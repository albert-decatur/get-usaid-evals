"Presents Mission's final report (9/77-6/83) on a project to enable the Cooperative Housing Foundation (CHF) to help the Self-Help Housing Agency (SHHA) of the Town Council in Gaborone, Botswana, implement a Housing Guaranty project for the poor in Gaborone's Broadhurst area. The project was extremely successful.  Six amendments expanded CHF services to include assistance to SHHA's in Selebe-Phikwe and Francistown and to the Government of Botswana's (GOB) Ministry of Local Government and Lands (MLGL).  Aided by direct CHF advisors and by training and TA provided by the MLGL, the three SHHA's have developed into permanent organizations, fully able to implement and manage shelter programs.  Further, the CHF advisor to the MLGL drafted a white paper which formed the basis for what later became the GOB's official housing policy - one of the first such policies in Africa.  Both the GOB policy and the work of the SHHA's are considered models of shelter assistance by African professionals. On the other hand, the project did not succeed in phasing out the need for expatriate TA in Botswana's housing sector.  The GOB and the World Bank have extended CHF assistance to Selebe-Phikwe and Francistown (through 8/83 and 12/84, respectively) in order to support Bank housing projects in those towns, and have also extended the contract of the MLGL advisor (through 12/84) in order to ensure program continuity. The OPG mechanism proved appropriate and flexible to the developing housing sector situation; in particular, beginning and amending the OPG by writing letters approving proposals and budgets prepared by CHF was far simpler than having A.I.D. prepare project documents.  On the other hand, A.I.D.'s interests in Botswana would have been better served if AID/W had given USAID/B authority to approve OPG amendments and, in particular, to extend the CHF contract.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Low cost housing|Community self help|Housing planning|Housing policy|Institution building|Technical assistance|Limited data","Botswana","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAN983.pdf","220 KB","000506 - Foundation for Cooperative Housing","","008516 - USAID.

"Employee Stock Ownership Plans (ESOP's) represent a potential A.I.D. strategy for strengthening the private sector by extending capital ownership to economically disenfranchised groups.  Such plans can supplement employee benefits and improve workers' income and retirement security, while providing companies with capital formation, access to new credit sources, tax advantages, and gains in productivity. This study examines two ESOP programs in each of three developing countries - Costa Rica, Thailand, and Zimbabwe - and two, for comparison, in the United States.  Also provided are discussions of the theoretical framework behind ESOP's and of different types of plans. All the companies studied were large and financially successful, but their success could not definitely be linked to the presence of ESOP's. All but one were enthusiastic about their ESOP's - the exception being a Zimbabwean company which borrowed money to purchase shares which later declined drastically in price.  As none of the developing countries provided tax benefits or other incentives to encourage ESOP's, all the plans were instituted at some cost to the company or to stockholders. Three companies contributed post-tax earnings to purchase newly issued stock for employees; two provided an interest-free loan to a trust for that purpose.  Thus the funds flowed back into the company so the main financial cost was the dilution of the value of existing shares. Employees' gains varied considerably:  some employees obtained substantial income or retirement security, while others had not yet received any financial benefits.  One company gave the employees' trust a controlling interest in the firm and others gave employees increased involvement in personnel management issues.  Generally, national and company-specific factors affected the plans' success, precluding generalizations as to their impact. In conclusion, the authors recommend an experimental A.I.D. program to promote ESOP's and evaluate their impact.  The possible elements of such a program are described. Appendices provide detailed information on the factors behind the adoption of ESOP's and their national- and company-level impacts. A 53-item bibliography (1958-82) is included.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-1406-I-04-1089-00","","1/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Ownership|Personnel management|Economic development|Private enterprises","Costa Rica|Thailand|Zimbabwe","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAL033.pdf","4,741 KB","006727 - Development Alternatives, Inc.

"Findings from impact evaluations of 12 A.I.D. education projects are herein reviewed and summarized.  The projects (four each in Asia and Latin America, two each in Africa and the Near East) included such activities as establishing institutions and institutional processes, curriculum reform, distance teaching, vocational and nonformal adult education, teacher training, and building/equipping educational facilities. The following lessons were drawn:  (1) Since the lasting effects of an education project are only apparent over time, A.I.D. should be prepared to make long-term commitments.  (2) A.I.D. efforts have significantly helped to increase and equalize access to education.  (3) A.I.D. training of professionals and support of educational institutions have been successful, especially when supported by career advancement and salary incentives.  (4) Careful prefeasibility studies and serious collaborative planning are essential to projects that introduce new teaching methods and curricula in remote areas.  (5) To ensure continuity, A.I.D. must not only introduce cost-effective reforms, but also determine how recurrent costs are apportioned, whether the costs are reasonable, and what will motivate continued payment of maintenance expenses.  (6) A project must fit into the wider economic context, respond to work force needs, and advance economic growth.  (7) Project success depends on good rapport among host country officials, institutions, and key A.I.D. personnel, and on careful consideration during the design phase of host country policy and of institutional, socioeconomic, and cultural constraints. Future research needs are to:  undertake a more comprehensive study of A.I.D.'s education interventions and a more representative study of A.I.D.'s nonformal education efforts; balance the need to expand access to education with the need to maintain its quality; determine whether the generally poor results of job-oriented education projects are representative; and assess the indirect impact of A.I.D. projects on established institutions and programs. Appended are data sheets for the 12 projects and proceedings of a 2/82 A.I.D. conference on the above findings.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Education|Educational planning|Educational reform|Nonformal education|Vocational training|Development project design|Teacher training|Institution building|Adult education","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAL034.pdf","3,911 KB","","","003433 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to mitigate the production impact of coffee rust fungus in Honduras by providing small farmers with credit and technical advice.  Special evaluation covers the period 6/81-12/83 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with USAID/H, Honduran Coffee Institute (IHCAFE), and bank personnel, and with farmers and extension agents. Although implementation was seriously delayed during the first year due to a change in higher administration, a drop in revenue from coffee exports (causing a severe cut in IHCAFE's operating budget), and a 5/82 stoppage in A.I.D. funding, very satisfactory progress is now being made.  IHCAFE is improving its effectiveness in coordinating extension, credit, and nursery activities and the project has already reached some 1,600 small farmers, who are using project credit to establish seedling nurseries and to renovate their coffee fields in line with the recommendations of IHCAFE extension agents.  Increased farmer productivity is virtually guaranteed.  (A delay in late 1983 in getting improved seed for some nurseries is not expected to cause any serious problems.) The extension service is making definite progress in developing techniques (e.g., group training, demonstration plots) for working with small farmers, but its ability to reach more farmers has been limited due to a cutback in field staff and a heavy workload in supervising farmer loans.  Also, there is a large degree of variability in individual agents' capabilities. Improved inservice training, better farmer training aids, increased supervisory support for agents, and more field personnel are among this component's key needs. The three banks (BANDESA, BANHCAFE, and Banco de Occidente) participating in the credit program are administering credit adequately, but reimbursement through the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank is not working well, causing occasional shortages of funds to be onlent to farmers.  Interest repayments are at the 90-95% level; principal repayments have not yet come due. The major lessons learned in this project are:  (1) the importance of providing profitable technical recommendations to accompany credit; and (2) the difficulty of channeling funds through the entire financial system. Numerous recommendations are included.","Work order no. 23","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-1406-I-23-1142-00","","2/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Coffee trees|Rust (fungi)|Crop disease control|Agricultural extension|Agricultural credit|Beneficiary count|Beneficiary interviews","Honduras","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAP046.pdf","1,434 KB","000480 - Experience, Inc.","","008555 - USAID.

"The impact of A.I.D.'s P.L. 480, Title I program in Jamaica during the period 1975-80 is evaluated. Despite increases in P.L. 480 and other direct and indirect forms of A.I.D. assistance, Jamaica's economy continued to decline during the period:  the Gross Domestic Product fell 14%; unemployment rose 5% to 27%; and production remained overly dependent on imports with no increased export capacity.  P.L. 480 food aid, which averaged $10 million annually (1977-80), at best alleviated the symptoms of economic crisis - while at the same time increasing the country's foreign debt. Positively, P.L. 480 aid did not increase food imports (although it may have affected their composition), because post-1975 Jamaican policies stimulated domestic food production and helped reduce food imports by 54%; this indicates the importance of host country food import policies in determining potential disincentive effects of food aid.  Self-help measures had little if any effect on Jamaican development, although agreement on counterpart allocations stimulated line ministries to meet their implementation responsibilities to avoid forfeiting future P.L. 480 funds.  Reports on self-help measures should be given importance in designing and implementing Title I programs. While generally consonant with P.L. 480 objectives, the program did not directly promote the key objectives of economic reform and structural adjustment; nor are these sufficiently ensured by agreements with the International Monetary Fund, agreements which USAID/J should scrutinize carefully.  Further, the program's foreign policy and balance of payments justifications clashed and ultimately overcame market development objectives, although this was perhaps inevitable given the economic situation. Recommendations are that:  school feeding be either phased out or supplied by counterpart funds and local commodity purchases; efforts be made to ensure that all parties participate in determining self-help measures and local currency uses; and Title I impacts be evaluated on the basis of economic indicators and policy concerns rather than such elements as institutional change, technology transfer, and small farmer benefits.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","2/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Food for Peace|Food aid programs|Food supply|Imports|Community self help|Balance of payments|Food for Peace Title I","Jamaica","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAL035.pdf","5,442 KB","000156 - USAID.

"Evaluates marketing and credit components of an American Institute for Free Labor Development (AIFLD) project to increase the incomes of members of democratic farm unions in Costa Rica's Rio Frio, San Isidro, and Tucurrique zones.  Special evaluation is based upon document review, site visits, and interviews with project and non-project personnel. Too many committees and too few implementors have delayed the recruiting of local staff for both components.  Decisionmaking could be simplified if FEDETAICO, the agricultural federation that will run the program when AIFLD departs, assumed a clear executive role under oversight of the Confederation of National Workers (CNT). Also, the program savors somewhat of a paternalistic, top-down approach. Some target areas still function on a subsistence-level economy due either to the lack of support services or to the exorbitant fees charged for them by local grocers (pulperos) who also act as middlemen. Provision of production credit (from the national banking system), consumer goods credit, a savings mobilization plan, and competing services would help break the monopoly of the pulperos and bring these areas to a market economy.  A pilot program of this kind is recommended in San Isidro's El Aquila and Los Santos areas. The assembly center concept should be implemented in the production areas and not on a regional basis, and honest local middlemen and truckers should be integrated into the distribution program to resolve farm-to-assembly-center transport problems; program vehicles should be used to haul commodities. In the San Isidro Valley, a direct distribution program would cut costs by bypassing middlemen.  Beans, corn, and some vegetables and fruits are economically promising and dialogue should be initiated with CNP buying stations to provide transportation, drying, and grading that complement CNP's purchase policy.  As for Rio Frio, the planned road to Guapiles will make possible a new tuber program relying on the Hortifruti buying station at Guapiles and will lower transport costs to San Jose, making platano and pina attractive for local markets and paving the way for Rio Frio to become Costa Rica's next boom area.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural cooperatives|Agricultural credit|Agricultural product marketing|Subsistence farming|Beneficiary interviews","Costa Rica","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAP145.pdf","2,873 KB","000260 - American Institute for Free Labor Development","","003052 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to strengthen the capacity of the Government of Seychelles (GOS) to conduct applied food crop research and to extend the results to small farmers.  Special evaluation covers the period 7/81-2/84 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with project personnel. Project success has been limited.  Although delayed two years, a diagnostic soils and plant laboratory (with staff offices and a small library) has been established and equipped; over 50 plant diseases have been identified and appropriate controls determined, hundreds of soil and fertilizer trials have been run, and some vegetable varieties have been tested and introduced. Initially delayed 18 months, 121 person-months of generally high-quality TA has since been provided, including intensive (if sporadic) on-the-job training in laboratory techniques for GOS technicians and research staff.  Also, many project-sponsored participants presented papers at the 1983 African Horticultural Symposium (attended by 17 nations) held in Mahe, Seychelles. However, the project has been hampered by an unrealistic time frame and inadequate GOS support due primarily to a GOS shift in sector priorities away from emphasis on extension/research to state/parastatal agricultural enterprises.  The GOS has failed to provide a strong extension infrastructure or sufficient, qualified, permanent extension and research counterpart personnel (there are currently no research staff working full-time and only two extension workers; the chief of research is overburdened with administrative tasks), or to request Peace Corps participation since the initial volunteers left in 1982.  Lack of counterpart trainees also has restricted the planned training program: only about nine months of a planned 21 months of overseas (including U.S.) training has been provided.  As a result, the project has failed to establish a self-sufficient research program, and although there have been indications of farmer adoption of some project-recommended practices, there has been no measurable increase in farmer income or production. Key recommendations are to institutionalize the research program and for the GOS to establish an extension division and hire more qualified extension and research personnel.","Attached to PD-AAP-147","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","AFR-0001-C-00-1032-00","","3/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Institution building|Agricultural extension|Research centers|Agricultural research","Seychelles","","","008601 - USAID.

"During the past three decades Korea has sharply increased its agricultural productivity through an intricate mixture of public and private initiative, but always with government playing the leading role. The contributions of six A.I.D. agricultural services projects to Korean agricultural development are assessed in this impact evaluation. A.I.D. assistance, the authors suggest, was appropriate and, in some cases, critical in increasing land and labor productivity. A.I.D. helped in the construction of new fertilizer plants and grain storage facilities and, while it is not possible to pinpoint specific policy changes directly attributable to A.I.D. technical assistance, the continuing dialogue on projects and policies and the extent of A.I.D. involvement (including participant training, which may have been A.I.D.'s most enduring contribution) evidently had a positive overall influence.  Major policy reforms and their timing, however, were products solely of the Korean government's perception of political and economic needs.  A.I.D. assistance to the National Agricultural Cooperative Federation (NACF) - a critical element in rural growth - increased government control over rural areas, but at the time the NACF was the only mechanism available to deliver agricultural services. Lessons emerging from the Korean experience include the importance of land reform as the bedrock of agricultural development, the difficulty of fostering mechanization without careful attention to labor absorption, the importance of sequencing agricultural interventions (beginning with research and training), and the recognition that policy reform is more likely to come through a cumulative process of dialogue than directly from technical assistance.  Subsidies (a key component in Korea's rural strategy) may be more effective in promoting agricultural development than are parastatal institutions. Korea, because of its particular administrative structure, and because it first stimulated industrial rather than agricultural development, is unlikely to be a model for other nations. Included are a 35-item bibliography (1971-83) and 9 appendices providing detailed data on Korean agricultural development.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","3/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural development|Agricultural production|Agricultural policy|Government policy|Development programs|Technical assistance","Korea R","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAL036.pdf","3,545 KB","","","000156 - USAID.

"The history of the user-financed primary health care (PHC) project in Sine Saloum, Senegal, teaches valuable lessons for community development programs, according to this case study. The key lesson is that a thorough, critical evaluation, when taken seriously and acted upon by a donor and the host government, can save a failing program.  A 1980 evaluation of the Sine Saloum project concluded that, despite the training and deployment of a large number of village health workers, the project's future was being jeopardized by several critical problems:  village health huts were not viable financially; supervision and support for village health workers were inadequate; and the drug supply and transportation system were unable to cope with new demands.  As a result of changes made since that evaluaton, the Sine Saloum project has turned around and community-level health services are largely self-financing. Major steps taken have included: standardization of user payments; village contributions to salaries of village health workers, construction and maintenance of village health huts, and building of drug stocks; vigorous training of community members in management and financial responsibilities; improvements in community health worker selection, training, and supervision; and more intensive project management by USAID/S. Problems remain, however.  Because the services provided are mainly those that clients demand and are willing to pay for, the program is still almost exclusively curative, and efforts to introduce preventive measures such as improved health and hygiene behaviors, oral rehydration therapy, and family planning information and services have met with little success.  Still lacking are the educational, outreach, and surveillance activities needed to effect long-term attitudinal and behavioral changes, as well as the indepth analysis and experimentation needed to determine if other PHC services can be user-financed and yet stay attractively priced.  Finally, recent research suggests that client satisfaction and participation could be significantly improved. Appendices include tables and a 27-item bibliography (l969-83).","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","4/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Health delivery|Primary health care|Community health care|Rural areas|Health finance|User fees","Senegal","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAL037.pdf","1,325 KB","000156 - USAID.

"Evaluates the sex education component of a project to provide family planning services in Panama.  Special evaluation covers the period 8/79-3/83 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with USAID/P and Panamanian staff. Despite a slow start up and subsequent administrative delays, the sex education component - an interinstitutional effort involving the Ministry of Health (MOH), Ministry of Education (MOE), National Directorate of the Child and Family (DINNFA), Institute for Special Education (IPHE), and International Planned Parenthood Affiliate of Panama (APLAFA) - has made some progress. Since the initial training in five seminars of the core teams from each institution, the grantees have largely worked independently. The MOH has provided training for its own staff and other groups.  The MOE has nearly completed training of all secondary school guidance counselors, has drafted a sex education curriculum for three grade levels, and is preparing a detailed plan for the next phase.  DINNFA has trained day care teachers and other professionals, delivered sex education programs to various groups, initiated an extensive collaboration with the Red Cross to train volunteers, and introduced an effective teaching technique to stimulate greater participation in its seminars and workshops.  Although IPHE progressed rapidly at first - training its staff and delivering sex education programs to parents - it has not developed formal curricula or systematized its activities. APLAFA, despite continuing restrictions on its activities due to lack of formal recognition by many public agencies, has continued its sex education program in the San Miguelito area and completed a study with Catholic University of adolescent sexual knowledge, attitudes, and practices. The sex education component has been hampered by:  inadequate collaboration and communication among the grantees and difficulties with the interinstitutional coordinating National Commission on Sex Education (i.e., its failure to provide effective leadership following completion of the five national seminars; attempts by some members to exert undue authority; and conflicts regarding its role). Recommendations are included.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/dspe-C-0053","","4/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Sex education|Family planning education|Information dissemination|Teacher training|Family planning promotion programs","Panama","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAP199.pdf","1,750 KB","001318 - American Public Health Association.

"Evaluates project to strengthen Senegal's Societe de Developpement et Vulgarisation Agricole (SODEVA).  Special midterm evaluation covers the period 1979-11/83 and is based on document review, visits to sample villages, and interviews with Government of Senegal (GOS) and USAID/S officials and with farmers. Progress has been made, despite an inordinate number of misunderstandings between A.I.D. and SODEVA and of policy and institutional changes.  Expected increases in cereals and groundnut production will not be achieved, but many other objectives are well on the way to attainment.  SODEVA has evolved into a more professional, more capable extension organization. It has developed effective linkages with agricultural research and sponsored farmer trials of on-station research results; lightened its touch in transferring technologies to farmers; developed a genuine group approach to extension; and, in the face of GOS-mandated reductions in field staff, has hired additional professional staff, while emphasizing a paraprofessional field approach and literacy training of both field staff and farmers. Audiovisual extension is behind due to building and equipment problems.  The women in development (WID) component has been somewhat peripheralized, but many WID activities (e.g., communal fields, sheep fattening, woodlots) are going well and management skills are being institutionalized.  Also, SODEVA failed to take advantage of two-thirds of its long-term training slots (ISRA, the national agricultural research organization, used all of its long-term training).  Due to project delays, funds are still available to accelerate progress in these areas and in research. Funding has been a constant source of friction, most crucially so in 4/83, when A.I.D. temporarily cut off procurement funding due to GOS failure to submit a strategy for handling recurrent costs. Confusion resulting from this action, as well as from, inter alia, top-level changes in SODEVA staff and in USAID/S project managers, and radical alterations in GOS agricultural policy (affecting agricultural input and credit systems as well as the cooperative movement), absorbed considerable management resources, contributing significantly to the project's failure to meet expected outputs. Recommendations and options for continued support to SODEVA are included.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-0000-I-3081","","1/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural extension training|Institution building|Agricultural extension|Agricultural research|Cereal crops|Groundnuts|Beneficiary interviews|Sampling method","Senegal","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAP212.pdf","4,326 KB","003002 - Ronco Consulting Corp.","","","English","application/pdf","Indepth evaluation|Social science evaluation|Evaluation team|Onsite evaluation|Pre evaluation data|Interim evaluation","","Morton, Alice L.|King, G.

"Evaluates CARE's Title II school feeding (SF) program in India. Evaluation is based on statistical analysis of data from a quantitative assessment (conducted by India's National Council for Education, Research and Training - NCERT) of program impact on primary school enrollment and retention; the period covered is not indicated. CARE's SF program has effectively targeted poorer districts and has probably increased school attendance.  In both 1973 and 1978, districts with SF programs had higher school enrollment rates than did districts with none (perhaps reflecting a cumulative impact, as SF programs were introduced in most districts between 1962 and 1965). Female school enrollment (including that of scheduled caste and tribal girls) was significantly higher in SF districts.  The likelihood of future fertility and mortality reductions is clear, given the established relationship between literacy and future income levels, birth rates, and infant mortality. Although SF effects on student retention remain unknown, a positive relation was observed in NCERT's block-level analysis. Mean retention rates were higher for SF feeding blocks in two states than for non-SF blocks. The intensity of student coverage in the CARE program has declined on a district basis.  This occurred because the food available to CARE for SF has not kept up with increases in the student population and because CARE chose not to concentrate the program in fewer districts.  The decline in intensity of coverage raises the question of how to allocate food so as to obtain maximum impacts on enrollment and retention while taking into account the cost per unit of food delivered.  Still, while the program is becoming more dispersed, it is perhaps achieving a greater impact on its target group. It is not clear how much these findings will influence decisions as to the future of the SF program.  Account must also be taken of other factors, e.g., the management implications for CARE of an SF phase-down (as was agreed to by CARE and USAID/I in FY82), the Indian Government's capacity to absorb additional SF food requirements, the availability of Title II resources worldwide, and competing demand by India's expanding maternal child health program. Recommendations are to:  (1) attempt to bring A.I.D.'s long-range strategic concerns and CARE's shorter-range operational requirements into harmony; (2) consider a global A.I.D. evaluation of non-nutritional SF impacts; (3) not orient SF toward nutritional rehabilitation; and (4) study SF impacts on fertility and mortality (e.g., by assessing impacts on adults who attended SF schools 20 years ago), and if a positive relationship is found, compare SF cost-effectiveness to that of conventional family planning and health projects.

"Evaluates the development impact of a CARE Food for Work (FFW) project to build rural roads and road embankment structures in Bangladesh.  Special evaluation covers the period 1975-83 and is based on comparisons between already built and proposed roads and interviews with local leaders and beneficiaries. The project is achieving its goals of upgrading rural infrastructure and stimulating rural economic and social development.  FFW roads built in 1980 and 1982 proved to be in much better condition and were more heavily traveled than are those proposed for reconstruction in 1984, although no 4-wheeled motor vehicles were observed on any of the roads; the superior condition of the older FFW roads is largely attributed to more recent maintenance.  Positively, FFW roads have:  improved local communications; reduced travel time and transport costs to and from the local market; and increased commercial activity, the use of new farm technology, access to health services, use of family planning services, and primary school attendance.  Moderate evidence supports further positive impacts:  decreased annual flooding near the road; increased use of the road by women; and increased use of health services. Negatively, the roads have mainly benefitted large landholders, thereby widening the already severe gap between rich and poor. There is no hard evidence to support road impact on crop mix and production or farm prices. The roads with the highest estimated development impacts overall tended to be those which were built earlier, had fewer unbridged gaps, were selected on the basis of development-related criteria and were recently maintained (features that should be sought in future projects); and were built near electric lines, in low distress areas, and in areas with doash (mixed) soil rather than sandy soil. Other recommendations are to:  expand emphasis on building bridges and culverts; build alternative types of roads in high distress areas having high concentrations of sandy soil and bullock cart traffic; and coordinate site selection with other rural development progams, especially in electrification and family planning.","Work order no. 1","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-0000-I-01-3080-00","","5/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Road construction|Food for Work|Rural development|Economic impact|Social impact|Beneficiary count|Beneficiary interviews|Sampling method","Bangladesh","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAP264.pdf","2,939 KB","006381 - Abt Associates, Inc.","","008511 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to strengthen the Yemen Arab Republic's (YARG) capacity to plan and manage agricultural development and to initiate production-oriented subprojects (SP's).  Special mid-term evaluation covers the period through 10/83 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with USAID/Y, Consortium for International Development (CID), and YARG personnel. Emphasis has been on SP development and implementation, rather than on developing an overall agricultural support program. Nonetheless, advisors are in place and management and support systems operational. Major strengths of the project are:  its collaborative workplans, which allow operational flexibility; preimplementation funding of SP's; and good CID-counterpart relationships.  Weaknesses include slow recruitment of technicians and field personnel, poorly defined EOP's, and YARG staff shortages. The Ibb Secondary School and the Core SP have been implemented. The Ibb school has been operational, with expatriate staff, since 10/79, a curriculum has been developed, and 79 students have graduated.  In addition, 7 Yemeni's are receiving U.S. Master's training and 10 are receiving B.S. training.  Under the Core SP, administrative and logistics support offices have been developed, a Documentation and Learning Resource Center is being built, 37 persons have been sent for degree and nondegree training, and 2 SP's (Poultry and Horticulture) have been funded, with 2 others in the planning stage. Activities to date under the Poultry and Horticulture SP's have been achieved with preimplementation funding from the Core SP. The Poultry SP has constructed poultry houses, sent students for English-language and Ph.D. training, and trained 700 farmers. The Horticulture SP has: leveled the Al Irra site; begun to construct buildings and irrigation works; planted a ""mother block"" of 300 citrus trees; lined out apple, peach, and citrus trees; trained 64 Yemeni in budding and nursery management; and selected another 20 for training abroad.  The former SP has been affected by a shortage of pullet-rearing facilities, the latter by inadequate housing and by its isolation.  The YARG desires increased production emphasis in both. Two areas need attention:  YARG capabilities in water resource development and soil conservation; and the role of the private sector.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC/1406-I-09-1141","","1/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural development|Agricultural management|Agricultural education|Animal husbandry|Poultry|Agricultural schools|Horticulture","Yemen","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAP287.pdf","5,960 KB","000981 - Pragma Corp.","","008624 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to strengthen Swaziland's capacity to improve public health (PH) by reducing water-borne diseases.  Special mid-term evaluation covers the period 11/80-11/83 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with contractor, USAID/S, and Swazi personnel. In general, the project is strengthening Swazi PH capabilities (albeit in ways not foreseen by the project planners) and it has a good probability of significantly contributing to long-term water-borne disease control.  Project TA has led to increased recognition of the need for indigenous professional PH services. Health impact evaluations have been performed for dam, irrigation, and water supply projects; water quality guidelines and water-system design criteria have been drafted.  The Ministry of Health declined to establish the planned PH engineering position; most likely, the position will be created in the Rural Water Supply Board of the Ministry of Works, Power and Communications. Laboratory facilities have been expanded at the Bilharzia Control Unit, and inservice training provided. Despite constraints (supply and transport problems, a lack of data analysis facilities), the unit recently completed a national schistosomiasis survey and has begun diarrheal surveillance, reflecting the project's shift away from schistosomiasis. The sanitation component has trained health assistants to construct vented pit latrines (over 1,000 have been built); health assistants are also being trained in communications and community mobilization. Through good management, the sanitation advisor has created demand for an assistant to the Director of the Health Inspectorate, an example of unplanned institutional development. The PH education component has made the least progress and is 1-2 years behind schedule.  No staff positions have been created in the MOH Health Education Unit (in which the project health educator has an advisory role, not the planned directorship); also, there was an 8-month hiatus in TA.  However, useful studies have been done on water and sanitation knowledge and practices in rural areas, especially in relation to diarrhea prevention, community organization, and the practices of traditional healers. Over 30 radio programs on diarrhea have been produced and it is believed that over 65% of rural homes with radios have listened.","Order of technical direction no. 168","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/DSAN-C-0080","","4/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Disease prevention and control|Water related diseases|Endemic diseases|Water sanitation|Public health care|Health education|Epidemiology|Sanitation","Swaziland","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAP302.pdf","4,898 KB","000333 - Camp Dresser and McKee, Inc.

"Evaluates project to develop the planning capability of the Gambia River Basin Organization (OMVG) which is composed of four member nations - Gambia, Senegal, Guinea, and Guinea Bissau. Special evaluation covers the period 5/81-5/84 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with A.I.D., OMVG, and University of Michigan (UM) personnel. The project, thus far successful and well managed, has focused almost entirely on the production of the planned maps and studies.  The maps have been completed; based on aerial photographs, they are more detailed and of higher quality than expected and have already been used to make some engineering planning decisions.  The final draft of the elaborate UM baseline studies on socioeconomic issues, river resources, wildlife and vegetation, and public health should be completed by early 1985. The UM teams have provided six member-nation personnel with on-the-job training in river resources; however, due to unclear guidelines and objectives, only one has been trained in wildlife and vegetation, four in socioeconomics, and none in public health.  Although participants have finally been selected for U.S. training, their departure has been delayed until the studies are completed. OMVG's planning operation has not yet reached the level of competence that will be required as the project moves into the next synthesizing and integrating phase.  Development has been hampered by:  an inadequate design (which called for provision of TA and training without specifying methods for developing OMVG's planning capacity); lack of an OMVG planning division director and economist which has kept the OMVG from taking the intended leadership role in river basin planning; and lack of some essential TA staff (e.g., a river basin planner, a hydrologist, and data and documentation managers). Key recommendations include to:  extend the project until 12/86; provide additional TA staff and short-term training; undertake special studies; upgrade map, documentation, and data management and facilities; and conduct an integrative, hydrological modeling exercise involving OMVG and member-nation staff.","Bibliography: p. 90-94","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","5/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","River basins|Rivers|Regional development|Development planning|Aquatic resource management|Water management","Gambia|Guinea|Guinea-Bissau|Senegal","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAP315.pdf","5,203 KB","008545 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to create an agricultural research, extension, and education (REE) system in Peru.  Special evaluation covers the period 8/80-2/84 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with USAID/P, National Institute of Agricultural Research and Extension (INIPA), World Bank (IBRD), National Agrarian University (UNA), Interamerican Development Bank (BID), North Carolina State University (NCSU), and Government of Peru (GOP) personnel. Despite delays of over 2 years due to slow procurement of TA, GOP noncompliance with conditions precedent, and diversion of NCSU TA to help the newly-created INIPA combine A.I.D., BID, and IBRD projects into a nationwide Integral REE Program (IREEP), substantial progress has been made.  Besides providing TA and the conceptual basis for the IREEP, the project has, inter alia: organized 18 Centers for Agricultural Research and Extension (CIPA's), 5 Regional Research Centers (RRC's), and 5 National Production Programs (NPP's) - the latter are making especially good progress in developing improved corn, rice, and potato technologies and extending them to farmers; developed (ongoing) 5 regional and 3 central service laboratories (RSL's) for crop extension/research and 3 new systems-focused National Programs; and formed project linkages with international agricultural research centers and collaborative research support programs. Long-term training is being provided to UNA/INIPA personnel, with 40 currently at UNA for M.S. degrees and 6 abroad for Ph.D. degrees; short-term training has also been provided. Several unplanned effects (some due to the creation of INIPA and IREEP) and weaknesses have hampered or altered the project, including: adoption of the ineffective training and visit extension system; integration of the NPP's, RRC's and RSL's within CIPA's; reduced emphasis on education and on UNA's role; failure to implement the planned national research and management units (the latter adding to INIPA's management difficulties); 1983 floods and drought; and inadequate GOP support. Key recommendations are to extend the project for 2 years and to begin planning for Phase II.","Attached to PD-AAP-367|Spanish ed.: PD-ACP-882","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-1406-I-24-1142-00|PDC-1406-I-00-1142-00","","3/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural research|Agricultural extension|Agricultural education|Research collaboration|National level","Peru","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAP367A.pdf","2,769 KB","000480 - Experience, Inc.","","008591 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to institutionalize a planning and statistics unit (the Direction of Studies and Projects - DEP) within the Government of Cameroon's (GOC's) Ministry of Agriculture. Special evaluation covers the period 12/79-12/83 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with GOC and USAID/C personnel. The project's statistical component got off to a slow start, but has accelerated nicely.  During 1983, a sampling frame, sample design, and enumerator and supervisor manuals were completed, as were questionnaires and survey procedures.  The basic elements for conducting the 1984 Agricultural Census and subsequent annual surveys are in place, but tabulation and analysis of the data to be collected are threatened by DEP's limited data processing capabilities (due to equipment and software difficulties, and lack of trained personnel and TA); quick resolution of this problem is imperative.  U.S. statistical training has been provided to 3 M.S. and 8 short-term candidates and short in-country training to enumerators, controllers, and supervisors. On-the-job training by advisors has worked effectively in project areas showing material progress. The project's economic analysis component started more rapidly. A number of studies, some of major import (e.g., the National Food Plan), were completed early on; all of the studies are being utilized in DEP planning and policymaking.  Five project design and/or feasibility studies have also been completed.  The planned sector analysis will not be undertaken until the project's statistical component has generated new data, mainly because a similar analysis was completed (with French assistance) shortly before the project began.  Four economists (3 M.S. and 1 nondegree candidate) and 3 short-term participants are studying in the United States; on-the-job training by advisors has been of great value.  Efforts to develop a DEP documentation center are underway. Several detailed recommendations are made, key among them that the project be extended through 6/87.  With increased funding, development of data processing capabilities, and continuation of TA, training, institutional support, etc., there is strong likelihood of achieving project goals.","Attached to PD-AAP-369","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","2/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Statistical analysis|Economic analysis|Agricultural planning|Institution building|Government departments","Cameroon","","","008524 - USAID.

"Evaluates project in northern Cameroon to develop livestock range management and crop rotation systems to reverse natural resource degradation and improve the resource base.  Special evaluation covers the period 12/78-12/83 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with USAID/C, Government of Cameroon (GOC), and project personnel. Although the reorganized project will achieve most of its targets, it is doubtful that it can produce a valid, replicable approach to improving livestock/agricultural production.  The project has constructed the Mindriff Project Center and 2 livestock watering points; established 3 demonstration grazing blocks; started reseeding and soil/water conservation demonstrations; cleared 114 km of trails; provided veterinary supplies; extended improved grazing techniques through the traditional leadership system in 9 villages; helped 30 farmers establish crop rotation systems on 1.25 ha each; and provided long-term U.S. academic training for 3 Cameroonians. However, the project has suffered from the GOC's failure to implement an overall resource management and land use program; an overly optimistic 5-year time frame (vs. the needed 15-20 years); limited geographical scope (activities are confined to the wetter portion of one transhumant system in one of five northern ecosystems); and underestimation of the number/scope of trained Cameroonian personnel needed.  Furthermore, the project seeks technical solutions to a multi-causal problem, failing to consider wider socioeconomic/environmental factors (e.g., droughts, demographic pressure, external effects from Chad and Nigeria, crop cultivation expansion, cultural patterns). Project experience shows the need for:  an interdisciplinary approach; more beneficiary feedback/involvement (e.g., in livestock herders' associations); outside evaluation; early participant training to allow integration of returnees into project activities; and locally adapted technologies. It is recommended that the project be extended to 12/87 subject to the reinstatment of a socioeconomic research, monitoring, and evaluation unit (a Phase II is not yet warranted).  If extension is not possible, the project should be terminated.","Attached to PD-AAP-370","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural extension|Agricultural development|Crop rotation|Technology transfer|Range management|Grazing land|Grazing|Natural resource conservation|Herders|Project change","Cameroon","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAP370A.pdf","7,418 KB","003552 - Ithaca International, Ltd.","","008524 - USAID.

"Evaluates phase two of a Commodity Import Program (CIP) in Somalia. Special evaluation covers the period 5/82-4/84 and is based on site visits, document review, and interviews with the traders and public sector personnel. Despite the unfamiliarity of Government of Somalia (GSDR) personnel and Somali traders with either the CIP or international trade and despite the GSDR's initial hostility to private enterprise, CIP implementation has proceeded smoothly and with extreme success; the program should be studied for possible use in other CIP countries. Private sector imports have not been limited, as often happens, to a single or to a few commodities, but have been varied and directed to agriculture and to agro- and light industries (with very tangible benefits to a stagnant economy), while public sector imports have included raw materials, equipment, and spare parts for GDSR utilities and enterprises.  Policy dialogue has successfully shifted the GSDR's economic policy from a focus on administrative control toward a reliance on market forces and the private sector. Although only a relatively small proportion of local currency generations - and these from CIP I only - have been disbursed so far for onlending by the Somali Development Bank (SDB), the generations have been fully programmed and only await project documentation before disbursement begins, while the loans made to date by the SDB have laid a basis - on which USAID/S should build - for diversification. It is recommended that USAID/S maintain the dedication and imagination it has shown in implementing the program so far, especially by continuing to review import allocations (and their use) to the public and private sectors; and that given the absence of an IMF program for Somalia, it adopt a more innovative approach to policy dialogue, e.g., expanding CIP exchange and perhaps interest rates and increasing compliance with existing covenants).","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","4/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Commodity import programs|Imports|Public sector|Private sector|Development banks|Economic policy|Limited data","Somalia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAP373.pdf","2,038 KB","008604 - USAID.

"Evaluates the success of six centrally funded agricultural projects in Thailand in providing TA, training, and commodities to Government of Thailand (GOT) agencies.  Special evaluation is based on document review and interviews with project, AID/W, and GOT personnel; no time frame is specified. Centrally funded assistance is well suited to Thailand's agricultural needs, as the GOT now has the capability and resources to be an efficient user of TA and manager of host country contracts.  Moreover, such projects leave USAID/T free to move into new development areas such as rural industry and environmental problems.  Centrally funded projects can perform development tasks as well as bilateral projects, while offering lower cost and more accessible TA, broader access to top scientists, less need for Mission support, a wider range of access modes to meet specific Mission needs, and greater facility in exploratory studies to determine future needs.  Disadvantages of central funding lie in long distance management (although this was not a problem in the projects reviewed, the potential exists), increased difficulties in communications with USAID/T and Thai agencies (conversely, international and U.S. technical exchanges are better with centrally funded projects), and administrative difficulties (with taxes, visas, etc.) for the resident advisor. It is recommended that both USAID/T and the Bureau of Science and Technology, Office of Agriculture (S&T/OA):  maintain Mission capability to oversee centrally funded projects; promote ongoing U.S., Thai, and international linkages; and stress management training and long- and short-term, academic and informal training. USAID/T should also assure in-country technology exchanges and help contractors with visas, taxes, etc.; investigate Thai receptiveness to expert counsel on key problem areas (natural resource conservation, environmental protection, soil and water management); and promote activities in irrigation research, new crops, hybrid seed, and regulatory services.

"Evaluates Commodity Import Program (CIP) to stimulate the private sector and support Government of Zimbabwe (GOZ) rural reconstruction efforts.  Special evaluation covers the period 2/82-3/84 and is based in part on interviews with project officials and beneficiaries. For the first CIP in a new recipient country, the project worked very smoothly.  Rapid disbursal (88% in 18 months) was achieved by:  using existing GOZ import allocation procedures and the commercial banking system; assigning a full-time A.I.D. officer to handle implementation; distributing a booklet explaining the CIP to the public/private sectors; and excluding policy linkages from the CIP agreement.  CIP commodities - 69% of them finished goods (mainly capital equipment) - were appropriate and at the micro level increased output and employment (among small firms surveyed) 20-50%, and generated 2,200-4,800 jobs.  Macro level impact was far less, however, since CIP commodities mainly served to make up for the 42% reduction in overall commodity imports which occurred between 1981 and 1983.  The program's support for efficient industries was probably greater than the controversial Jansen Study, which tried to determine Zimbabwe's industrial comparative advantage, would suggest. Local currency generations supported the capital requirements - and the GOZ the recurrent costs - of rural reconstruction and development projects in education, health, agriculture, and small businesses. Projects were quickly and efficiently implemented due to:  sound GOZ planning, budgeting, and management; the use of private sector contractors under competitive procurement procedures (thus reducing A.I.D. and GOZ management burdens); the local market's ability to supply most materials; and a general absence of graft and corruption.  A.I.D. targeted large (thus fewer, more efficient) projects which built on existing GOZ programs, were institution-building, and had immediate impact. The program was so effective that a follow-on was added in 2/83 and another is planned for 2/84.  Its local currency program should be studied for use in LDC's with similar public and private sector management capabilities.  Other recommendations include narrowing the focus of local currency projects to specific subsectors and institutional development and improving GOZ project reporting/monitoring systems.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","3/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Counterpart fund|Imports|Commodity import programs|Private sector|Local currency|Rural development|Economic impact|Beneficiary interviews","Zimbabwe","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAP380.pdf","910 KB","008628 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to strengthen the agricultural faculties of Indonesia's Association of Western Universities (BKS-B) - an 11-institution consortium - and to create inter-university networks. Special mid-term evaluation covers the period 1981-4/84 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with participants and with BKS-B, Government of Indonesia (GOI), USAID/I, and contractor staff. With effective USAID/I and contractor management and high-level GOI commitment, project implementation is largely on track. Moreover, the project has been a major catalyst within the BKS-B, providing for over half of consortium activities.  U.S. graduate training is being provided to 33 M.S. and 8 Ph.D. faculty; 15 others have completed M.S. degrees and returned to Indonesia (10) or continued with Ph.D. studies (5); 4 have returned without completing U.S. degrees.  BKS-B staff have also attended 2 one-month U.S. administrative courses.  In-country training has been provided to 109 M.S. and 14 Ph.D. candidates and to 188 students in 9 short courses.  A total of 168 BKS-B staff (of a planned 250) have attended the project's cost-effective intensive English-language training program; of the 27 who are currently enrolled or who have already passed the TOEFL test, 10-18 will probably be sent for U.S. graduate study. The project has also established inter-university networks in soils and English and identified topics for 3 others (vs. the targeted 6); the soils network has revised its curriculum and is preparing a laboratory manual.  A total of 10,875 new volumes have been added to BKS-B libraries and student library usage has increased; however organization, space, and short hours are still major library problems.  The target to increase faculty use of improved teaching methods (e.g., course outlines, tests, etc.) by one-third should be achieved by the end of the project.  Also, at least 3 universities are creating/revising their campus plans and several have instituted credit systems (however, the latter is an indirect, rather than a direct, project benefit). Given adequate GOI funding, the consortium is in a good position to be sustained without external aid.  Recommendations are made for a follow-on project.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","4/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Teacher education|Universities and colleges|Faculty|Educational development|Educational networking|Agricultural education|Beneficiary interviews","Indonesia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAP387.pdf","1,643 KB","008558 - USAID.

"Evaluates pilot project to determine the feasibility of using volunteer collaborators (VC) to establish a Passive Care Detection (PCD) network in Pakistan's Malaria Control Program (MCP).  Special evaluation covers the period 5/82-5/84 and is based on site visits and interviews with VC's, malaria supervisors (MS), and other project personnel and beneficiaries. Although PCD posts have been activated in three of the four districts (Lahore, Bannu, and Larkana), the project is barely underway; the number of VC's selected and trained so far is very small and only in Bannu have VC's been functioning longer than a month.  This may explain the project's weaknesses to date. Because of the purdah system, nearly all of the few VC's selected have been men, and most of these have been schoolteachers or unqualified health care dispensers.  Although the trainees are enthusiastic, the training itself has been poor; most of the VC's interviewed were unclear about their duties, the correct presumptive dosage of chloroquine, or the proper procedure for making bloodsmears.  Further, many lack the materials (e.g., patient report forms) needed to carry out their duties and no provisions have been made for VC's to administer radical treatments to patients with positive bloodsmears.  In addition, MS's supervision of VC's in the field appears lackluster and ineffective, as do MS's ongoing Active Case Detection (ACD) activities.  A lack of equipment and transportation, enthusiasm, discipline, and a sense of responsibility are common problems among MCP workers.  Also constraining success of the PCD program are negative attitudes by both non-MCP medical workers/technicians (who do not consider malaria their responsibility) and of MCP personnel (who doubt the efficacy of PCD and the use of VC). If the above problems can be overcome, establishment of an effective VC network for PCD is clearly feasible.  Major recommendations include increasing the number of VC and standardizing guidelines for their selection, training, and supervision; making ACD/PCD complementary; enforcing MCP work codes; providing incentives for MS's and VC's; and increasing training for all MCP personnel.","At head of title: Unclassified","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","5/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Domestic government programs|Malaria|Disease detection|Disease prevention and control|Volunteers|Beneficiary interviews","Pakistan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAP397.pdf","1,447 KB","008588 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to help The Asia Foundation (TAF) promote economic development in Irian Jaya, Indonesia through the Irian Jaya Development Information Service Center (IJDISC).  Special evaluation covers the period 1978-4/84 and is based on document review and interviews with project personnel. The IJDISC, established in 1981, has made substantial progress in attaining its objectives.  It has carried out assessments of Irian Jaya's social and human resource needs, created a Documentation Center, and produced over 50 documents, e.g., reports on conditions in various parts of Irian Jaya, health and nutrition notes, and progress reports on community development projects.  Further, in response to a series of unanticipated conditions which emerged in its first year, the IJDISC's purpose was wisely reoriented from a focus on providing technical development information and expert consultant services to introducing grass roots, holistic, and participatory approaches to community development as the center of a nongovernmental organization network in Irian Jaya. Two serious and related challenges threaten the Center's future. The first is the continuing struggle to define the Center's purpose and direction; the second is an impasse as to whether the IJDISC should be legally constituted, independent foundation or yayasan capable of programming its own funds.  These challenges have led to serious internal differences among members of IJDISC's previously inoperative Steering Committee and have also rendered doubtful many original assumptions which were de facto abandoned in the reorientation of IJDISC - namely, that there pre-existed baseline and technical information relevant to Irian Jaya's development and a strong market for IJDISC services among development groups and that rapid indigenization and formation of a yayasan was feasible. It is recommended that the TAF and Cenderawasih University - the two institutions with ultimate responsibility for IJDISC - form a new Steering Committee (composed of individuals, not of representatives of organizations); request a 6-month project extension; formulate an overall program policy and communicate it to concerned agencies; and appoint a full- or part-time Program Officer.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","4/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Community development|Information centers|Institution building|Private voluntary organizations|Community participation","Indonesia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAQ297.pdf","6,232 KB","000278 - The Asia Foundation (TAF)","","008558 - USAID.

"The Bong and Lofa Agricultural Development projects in Liberia were administratively successful integrated rural development efforts, but they produced only limited socioeconomic benefits because mid-course design corrections were not taken when preproject assumptions proved unrealistic.  The projects, designed to diversify and expand the economy by encouraging small farmer production of coffee, cocoa, and swamp rice, focused on planting new coffee and cocoa trees, rehabilitating old trees, restoring old swamps, and clearing new ones; support activities included monitoring schistosomiasis, training farmers and extensionists, building wells and latrines, strengthening and establishing marketing cooperatives, repairing feeder roads, and creating semi-autonomous project management units (PMU's).  Some 17,000 farm families have been involved in these efforts. Although the PMU's performed ably in coping with unforeseen circumstances, the projects lacked provision for the formal and comprehensive mid-course redesign work which was necessitated by, inter alia, commodity price fluctuations (which limited farmers' incentives to participate in the crop development programs), the lack of a strong agricultural research program (erroneously assumed to exist), and unresolved national-level policy, financial, and administrative problems.  Also, district cooperatives - which are to be the PMUs' heirs - have not yet proven their viability, and long-term social impacts (on, e.g., women, land tenure, the environment) are still undetermined. It was learned that:  (1) broad-based projects must be flexible enough to allow design changes; (2) agricultural projects should test proposed technical packages; (3) decentralized projects are viable given national policy and administrative support; (4) farmers' participation depends upon their perception of material benefit; (5) decentralized projects should be integrated, with explicit linkages between central government and project staff, among donors, and across sectors; and (6) locally-based agricultural research which involves farmers and is closely tied to extension is crucial in agricultural development.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","6/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural development|Integrated rural development|Small farms|Crop diversification|Agricultural credit|Agricultural prices","Liberia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAL038.pdf","2,410 KB","000156 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to help Djibouti's Centre de Formation Professionelle des Adultes (CFPA) provide skills training to adults and out-of-school youths.  Special evaluation covers the period 8/80-4/84 and is based on document review and interviews with Government of Djibouti (GROD), CFPA, USAID/D, and International Human Assistance Program (IHAP) personnel. Although most activities are close to target, the project, which was designed on the basis of some faulty assumptions about the Djiboutian job market, is not likely to reduce unemployment. Moreover, planned assistance to the Ministry of Labor (MOL) having been deleted at the GROD's request, the project has been unable to help in formulating a national manpower policy. A training center for CFPA's Section Commerciale (SC) was constructed on schedule and under cost, and 7 Djiboutians were trained overseas (in accounting, secretarial skills, and language arts) and are now performing successfully as teachers at the SC. They have redesigned curricula and materials to bring them within the grasp of SC students, who are adolescents of a quite low academic level.  Over 100 students are enrolled, but only 9 have graduated thus far.  Given Djibouti's high unemployment rate and the level of competition from graduates of other programs, the students' job prospects are not good.  By contrast, CFPA's training program for employed adults has had good success. Little has been done to improve CFPA administration; while the IHAP chief of party has been an excellent exemplar of institutional management, there is no mechanism for transfering such skills.  A CFPA Orientation and Placement Office was established in 10/83, but does not yet offer a full range of services. Despite this mixed record, the project has focused GROD attention on the need for a coordinated manpower training effort and has established IHAP's credibility in this area.  A second phase, to include assistance to the MOL, is recommended. Lessons learned are:  more attention needs to be given to verification of basic assumptions; project activities must be, not only intrinsically worthwhile, but capable of producing effects beyond themselves; and project objectives may be incompatible - it is not possible to transform semiliterate youths into skilled secretaries and bookkeepers competitive on the job market.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","4/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Vocational training|Training centers|Personnel development|Labor planning|Career development","Djibouti","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAP455.pdf","1,005 KB","008536 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to provide technical and financial support to training programs for paramedical, auxiliary, and community (PAC) family planning workers in Asia.  Special evaluation covers the period 10/79-4/82 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with personnel of host governments, A.I.D., and the Regional Training Service Agency for Asia (RTSA/A), an office of the University of Hawaii. RTSA/A is for the most part meeting its contractual requirements and will in fact exceed numeric targets for training PAC workers. Although start-up was slow, activity has quickened over the past 8 months as a result of improved administrative procedures; increased acceptance by, and stronger working relationships with, A.I.D. Missions; and a clearer understanding of RTSA/A's role by both RTSA/A itself and host countries. Some 5,000 PAC workers have received in-country, regional, or U.S. training (vs. the 4,000-5,000 specified in RTSA/A's contract).  In addition, 885 days of TA have been provided, as a result of which 118 subactivities have been proposed and 58 completed. RTSA/A's planning and evaluation functions are not strong, perhaps because RTSA/A believes that A.I.D.'s priorities do not take into account RTSA/A's field experience.  Also, field visits by RTSA/A staff and the amount of in-country TA provided vary greatly from country to country and among staff members, apparently a result of conflicting teaching duties or a too-restrictive travel approval process. Most A.I.D. Missions look positively on RTSA/A.  The countries which have learned to use and value the contract - India, Nepal, the Philippines, and Thailand - view RTSA/A as an unduplicated resource, while those which have used RTSA/A services in only a limited way - Bangladesh and Indonesia - see little advantage in continuing the contract. Although considerable other training opportunities exist in Asia, none focus as thoroughly on in-country PAC training and none ensure that capacity building within host country training institutions and units will be linked to PAC workers' needs for pre-service, inservice, and refresher training.  It is recommended that the project be extended 2 years, possibly with a different contractor, and with some changes in the scope of work.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Regional development|Family planning|Paramedical education|Beneficiary count","Asia|Indonesia|Philippines|Thailand|Bangladesh|India|Sri Lanka","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAP475.pdf","2,512 KB","001318 - American Public Health Association.

"Evaluates project to develop a nationally replicable low-cost health delivery system in three Integrated Rural Development areas of Ecuador. Special evaluation covers the period 10/81-3/84 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with project participants. Key results have been as follows.  (1) Decentralization of the Ministry of Health (MOH) has been hampered by resistance to the proposed role of Area Chief (AC), and the effectiveness of those trained as AC's has been hindered by their impermanent, contractual relationship with the MOH.  A new strategy has been proposed whereby hospital subcenter directors will be given added pay and emoluments to assume area-wide responsibility for health services; their training should match in content that given to AC's early in the project, but be given on-the-job.  Also, further data on the Ecuadorean health system (e.g., as to cost-effectiveness) are needed to help MOH officials accept the the health area concept.  (2) A rapid succession of five Ministers of Health has limited development of a model primary health care (PHC) delivery system, with more progress needed in training, supervision, and information handling.  The model's cost-effectiveness also needs to be determined.  (3) The Center for Multidisciplinary Development Research (CIMDER), the TA contractor, has been highly effective in coping with unforeseeable difficulties, although remaining TA needs cannot be provided under the the current system.  (4) The supplementary food program has evolved to the point where it can become an integral part of the area model for PHC services; planned food policy studies, however, have not yet been conducted.  (5) Steps have been taken by the National Health Council (CNS) to coordinate the activities of Ecuadorean health service institutions, but some duplication of effort remains.  An analysis of health sector resources is needed to support CNS coordination efforts.  On the policy level, CNS has conducted three workshops and studies and has been able to inform members of proposed actions and identify problems.  Even greater efforts are needed in the latter area. It is recommended to:  reduce the project's scope to at most two objectives; reprogram funds on a cost/benefit basis; and thoroughly review spending levels and budgeted amounts for each project component.","Attached to PD-AAP-492|Evaluation period: 11-24 Mar 1984","Special Evaluation","Documents","DPE-5927-C-00-3083-00","","3/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Integrated health care|Health care administration|Primary health care|Departmental reorganization|Government departments","Ecuador","","","003780 - Emrey Associates|000750 - Management Sciences for Health (MSH)","","008538 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to develop a nationally replicable low-cost health service delivery model in three Integrated Rural Development (IRD) areas of Ecuador.  Special evaluation covers the period 10/81-3/84 and is based on site visits and personnel interviews. Community participation and delivery of primary health care at the community level - issues which must be maintained as a high priority - have not received sufficient attention so far.  This has been due partially to strategic emphasis on high levels of administration and on the formal aspects of regionalization, and partially to external difficulties such as conflicts over the meaning of decentralization at the national and regional levels, the difficulty of formally establishing the Area Chief's role (due in part to weak contracting arrangement with the Ministry of Health), and problems in retaining leaders who were hired and trained.  A permanent director and field director for the Centro de Salud Hospital (CSH) would advance community operations and is critical to the project. The training of health promoters for IRD-Health areas is a primary immediate concern and funds should be reprogrammed for this purpose.  To coordinate health research with project capabilities and to avoid conflicting political interests, research priorities should be established by someone other than the National Health Council, e.g., by PRITECH and PRICOR, the A.I.D. contractors who have already assisted the project in this area.  Also, the new Area Chiefs - namely, the CHS directors - should be trained in-country by the Center for Multidisciplinary Investigations in Development (CIMDER) and should be given supplementary management training.  A quality assurance program is needed for the iodized salt used to control the iodine deficiency problem.","Loan no. 518-U-040|Attached to PD-AAP-492","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","5/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Integrated health care|Health care administration|Rural areas|Primary health care|Community participation","Ecuador","","","008538 - USAID.

The Ministry's EPI program, on the other hand, has not achieved good national coverage, and morbidity and mortality from immuno-preventable diseases has not changed in 10 years.  A USAID/E-funded advisor for health education for the two programs is urged.  USAID/E should also consider strengthening MSP management support systems (especially supervision, information, and operations research); studying vaccine logistics and cold chain effectiveness; encouraging the promotion of breastfeeding; and, possibly, studying the cost-effectiveness of the ORT and EPI programs compared to other MSP services. The A.I.D. project has made impressive gains in ORT and community organization.  However, administrative problems with Area Chiefs, competition between programs and personnel of the IRD Secretariat and those of the MSP, and the improvement in MSP capabilities have led to a situation in which there is little difference in ORT and EPI activities between IRD and non-IRD areas.  It is suggested that USAID/E expand the project to include the entire province (or even several provinces) and channel funds directly to the MSP to support these expanded efforts. Several nongovernmental organizations worthy of further support are identified.","Attached to PD-AAP-492|Evaluation period: 12-24 Mar 1984","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","3/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Rural areas|Oral rehydration therapy|Immunizations|Health education","Ecuador","","","000750 - Management Sciences for Health (MSH)","","008538 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to develop a nationally replicable low-cost health service delivery model in three Integrated Rural Development (IRD) areas of Ecuador (Salcedo, Quimiag-Penipe, Jipijapa).  Spanish-language evaluation covers the period 10/81-3/84 and is based on 62 personnel interviews, site visits in each IRD area, and review of project documents. The evaluation team recommends a revised agreement between the Ministry of Public Health (MSP) and the IRD Secretariat (SEDRI) to establish proper jurisdiction in the health sector and to permit health activity programming and implementation within the framework of national and regional plans and policies.  The MSP should support and participate in all health activities, establishing clear and precise norms for the functions, reimbursement, and duties of health promoters.  The team also recommends a major reprogramming of the project, in which resources would be allocated to priority areas more related to project objectives. This effort should include an upgrading of control mechanisms and should be preceded by a detailed study involving all participating institutions and followed by annual evaluations to determine the depth of health service coverage.","Attached to PD-AAP-492|Loan no. 518-U-040","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","3/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Rural areas|Health care administration|Health delivery|Health care planning","Ecuador","","","008538 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to assist educational reform in Botswana by improving inservice and pre-service training of primary school teachers and administrators.  Special evaluation covers the period 10/82-5/84 and is based on site visits and interviews with teachers and University of Botswana (UB), Ministry of Education (MOE), and USAID/B personnel. The project has been very successful.  Some 1,000 teachers from over 100 schools have received inservice training (IT) in 12 workshops. During the remainder of the project, IT will focus on 60 schools - teachers trained at 30 Target One schools will train teachers at 30 Target Two schools, who will eventually become trainers in turn. Although both Education Centers and Teacher Training Centers (TTC's) are involved in IT, the latter are neither committed to nor organized to deliver IT.  However, the nearly-completed Tlokweng TTC, which will include an IT facility, is intended to be a model of its kind for the other TTC's. Teacher preparation programs at UB's Department of Primary Education are fully functioning.  A teacher training curriculum has been devised and is being tested and modified.  The student completion rate is nearly 100%; 10 diploma students graduated in 1983 and 9 in 1984, with 10 diploma and 20 B.Ed. students expected to finish in 1985.  UB assistance to TTC's and to the IT program has increased markedly since 1982; a policy handbook for TTC-UB affiliations has been drawn up. Project staff have also:  helped prepare a new primary school curriculum which is being taught in IT and UB programs; conducted administrative workshops for Education Center officers; and helped the MOE develop a plan for continuing formative evaluation of IT activities. Out-of-country trainees are being monitored by UB and will serve as lecturers in the Department of Primary Education when they return. Although primary education reform, with the project's help, has progressed in remarkably smooth fashion in Botswana, the MOE's planned extension of basic education to include 3 years of secondary education will present great challenges to the educational system as a whole.  A second phase of the project, to begin in 1986 and continue for 5 years, is recommended.  Detailed recommendations are also made regarding the remainder of Phase I.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","ASB-0222-0-00-4128-00","","5/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Teacher education|Teacher training|Primary education|Curriculum design|Educational reform|Beneficiary interviews","Botswana","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAP539.pdf","747 KB","008516 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to establish a National Remote Sensing Center (NRSC) in Nepal.  Special mid-term evaluation covers the period 3/79-3/84 and is based in part on interviews with USAID/N, contractor, NRSC, and other Nepalese personnel. Although provision of a permanent NRSC facility is far behind schedule, occupancy of the new building - which provides four times the space envisioned in the project paper - is now imminent.  Equipment (including some - an Apple computer and a geoceiver - not called for in the Project Paper) has been procured, but has been underutilized - due mostly to lack of space in NRCS's present facilities.  Participant training is 2 years behind schedule, and as yet neither Master's Degree training for an earth scientist nor managerial training have been provided.  However, in-country training has reached a significant number of Nepalese personnel and agencies. Because the NRSC has, up to now, focused on establishing itself rather than on reaching out to users, dissemination of remote sensing data has not met expectations.  Nepalese agencies' unfamilarity with remote sensing data has also hampered dissemination, as has the lack of guidance provided by the NRSC Advisory Committee.  The NRSC has developed linkages with remote sensing organizations and receiving stations in other countries, but has had some difficulties in obtaining data, e.g., from the Hyderabad, India, station. Despite its problems, the NRSC has made considerable progress during the past 3 years.  In order to facilitate data dissemination and user linkages, the NRSC must become established in its new facility as soon as possible.  Institutionally, the NRSC would have access to more user agencies if transferred from the Forest and Soil Conservation Ministry to the National Planning Commission.  Pilot projects should be initiated, based on priority Nepalese needs (e.g., agricultural and land use mapping). By continuing its support, A.I.D., with a relatively small investment, can enable Nepal to reap enormous development planning benefits.  In considering its future role, A.I.D. should keep in mind that remote sensing projects should be user or need driven, not technology driven.  Rarely are sophisticated data used simply because they are available.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","3/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Remote sensing|Institution building","Nepal","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAP548.pdf","1,574 KB","008583 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to strengthen the Government of Sri Lanka's (GSL) development planning capacity.  Special evaluation covers the period 8/78-6/84 and is based on review of the participant training (PT) program and of a structured sample of 14 of 32 subprojects (SP's) through document review, site visits, and interviews with returned participants. Although the project was too broadly conceived and poorly planned, it has generally been a success.  The PT component trained 219 Sri Lankans (vs. a target of 135), including 23 women, through conferences, workshops, seminars, observations tours, and short- and long-term U.S. and in-country academic training.  The focus of training has shifted over 5 years from providing degree training to supporting line ministries engaged in development work or in assisting the private sector.  Although the program grew substantially beyond programmed levels in terms of numbers and cost, and despite the lack of a follow-up program, results have been positive; training has benefitted most participants, who are in turn passing on their knowledge. The project also funded 32 highly heterogeneous SP's - 3 pilot demonstrations, 5 studies, 8 consultancies, 4 institutional support and 12 special support activities.  SP's have lacked selection criteria, placed a heavy workload on USAID/SL, and have had mixed success and impact.  Only 5 of the 14 sampled (appendices evaluate each separately) related directly to USAID/SL and only 8 were successful and probably worth the cost. The most successful SP's were those which related directly to A.I.D.'s program, were well planned and followed-up, and had a high degree of host country interest and involvement. It is recommended that USAID/SL develop a successor project which would continue PT while focusing SP's almost exclusively on prefeasibility studies and other development work directed related to A.I.D.'s country program; the project should have a clearly defined logframe, an annually updated implementation plan, and specific criteria for selecting SP's.  Also, USAID/SL should take steps to lessen the workload for small SP's; develop a specific plan and follow-up for the PT program; focus PT on short-term degree training, especially in development economics; and increase the staff of its training office.","Attached to PD-AAP-551","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-0000-I-13-3083-00","","7/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Development planning|Government planning|Participants|Participant program administration|Beneficiary count|Beneficiary interviews|Sampling method","Sri Lanka","","","000673 - International Science and Technology Institute, Inc.

"Evaluates project to develop a national agricultural research system administered by the Philippine Council for Agricultural and Resources Research and Development (PCARRD).  Special mid-term evaluation covers the period 1979-1/84 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with researchers, administrators, policymakers, and clients. PCARRD has continued to make significant progress towards its objectives, and although once widely viewed as a threat by other research institutions, is now a respected member of the Philippine research and development community.  Among its accomplishments (during this project and its predecessor):  a nationwide system of national, regional, and cooperating research stations, with multi- and single-commodity responsibilities, organized into regional research centers/consortia; a system of research priorities related to national development goals; improved research management practices and policies; increased research funding; improved packaging and dissemination of research results; and improved linkages with other research and development agencies and with international organizations, extension agencies, and farming, forestry, and fishing communities. PCCARD has also had a spillover effect on the academic programs of colleges and universities.  Since 1973, when PCCARD as a new institution started its manpower development program, 820 grants have been awarded for in-country degree training (75 B.S., 645 M.S., and 100 Ph.D/ABD), 67% of which were to institutions outside the Manila/Los Banos area. International training grants (for Ph.D.'s, nondegree training, and travel) have been awarded to 195 researchers and support staff.  Under the Phase II project (since 1979) 58% of total infrastructure planned has been completed, another 30% is underway, and $4.4 worth of equipment and library materials have been added to agricultural research facilities.  The percentage of PCARRD-funded research outside the Manila/Los Banos area has increased from 23% in 1981 to 50% in 1983. Key needs for continued development of the Philippine's agricultural research program are to allow PCCARD to allocate directly a larger share of research funds and to place even greater emphasis on the needs of regional research centers.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","2/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural research|Research management|Research organizations","Philippines","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAP558.pdf","1,133 KB","000951 - Philippines.

"Evaluates project to upgrade the institutional capacity of the governorates of Beni Suef, Fayoum, and Minia in Egypt to plan, implement, and support urban infrastructure at the municipal level. Mid-term special evalution covers the period 8/81-5/84 and is based on interviews with project, municipal, and contractor officials. Mainly using a ""learning by doing"" approach, the project has: completed draft master plans for water and wastewater infrastructure in the three cities; completed 73 urgent subprojects (SP's) and funded 135; markedly improved municipal staffs' capabilities to plan and implement SP's; awarded almost all construction and consulting services contracts to private Egyptian firms; and trained 338 city employees through 18 courses. However, the project's institutional goals, timeframe, and planned range of infrastructure were overly ambitious, and project scope has narrowed during implementation to a current focus on capital components. The financial viability of existing or planned infrastructure investments has not been addressed. ""Learning by doing"" is no longer adequate to achieve planned capacity-building and decentralization, and USAID/E has been too closely involved in SP review and approval to allow decentralized decisionmaking.  Project training should meet the requirements for implementing SP's, operating current plants and networks, and preparing for the system expansion expected with the master plans; improved capacity is especially important as the cost of the proposed master plans far exceeds project funds and will require the cities to finance implementation. Lessons learned are that:  (1) capacity-building is lengthy and requires careful planning and monitoring - a phased shift of project responsibility to the Government of Egypt may have been useful; (2) financial viability must be considered in implementation; (3) USAID/E should be selective in monitoring decentralization activities; and (4) training should be oriented to practice.

"Evaluates project to improve and expand the capacity of Egyptian villages to plan, organize, implement, and maintain locally chosen infrastructure projects.  Mid-term evaluation covers the period 3/82-3/84 and is based on site visits and comparison of governorates' achievements via a custom designed scale matrix. The basic village services (BVS) project is well on target in meeting its goals.  It has activated Egypt's decentralization policy as a vital element of rural development, stimulating local private sector economic activity, including agriculture, and improving the quality of life. Development institutions are being strengthened from the village to the markaz and governorate levels.  A major accomplishment is raising local awareness concerning rights of elected village councils to choose and administer village projects.  Since performance varies considerably among governorates, incentives are recommended to assist governorates that lag in performance, and rewards for those that excel. Lack of maintenance of project-built infrastructure is a serious problem across all governorates; there are also specific technical problems - some (e.g., insufficient village wastewater treatment/drainage capacity) are beyond the project's scope and require national-level attention. Among the lessons learned from the project are that:  (1) meaningful decentralization depends upon increased delegation of authority from the central government to the village, and increased village capacity to use this authority effectively; (2) the capacity of villages to exercise authority to manage development projects requires project-specific training and management experience; (3) rural development projects can stimulate private sector development directly through infrastructure construction contracts, and indirectly through the existence of adequate public infrastructure (e.g., water, roads).

"Evaluates the Zimbabwe agricultural sector assistance (ZASA) program. Special evaluation covers the period 9/82-3/84 and is based on site visits, document review, and interviews with members of the Government of Zimbabwe (GOZ) interministerial ZASA working group (WG) and with farmers' union, University of Zimbabwe (UZ), and other project personnel. Impressive progress has been made in implementing ZASA subprojects (SP's).  With a major emphasis on small farm problems in communal areas, ZASA activities planned or underway include: research (e.g., on more efficient communal cropping systems); extension (e.g., housing and transportation improvements to facilitate access, inservice and overseas extension agent training, introduction of cotton/tobacco technology packages); credit (e.g., provided to 54,000 small farms); marketing/input supply (e.g., development of a network of small farm cooperative societies, 36 warehouses and 165 local facilites built); land/water use SP's; agricultural education (e.g., doubling student intake at certificate, diploma, and degree institutions and revising syllabi); and policy planning (e.g., with a priority focus on communal areas where 900,000 small farmers operate). Although evaluation of ZASA success is difficult as Zimbabwe had a bumper crop in 1980-81 followed by three drought years, positive production impact is indicated by:  a 250% increase (from 1975-82) in fertilizer consumption in communal areas (up from 8-23% of total consumption); an increase in the communal contribution to the cotton crop to 35% (tobacco has also done well); and an increase in business for cooperatives serving smallholders from Z$3.3 to Z$23.7 million (from 1978-82).  Also, GOZ elimination of consumer/producer subsidies has greatly reduced costs in 1983-84, although this policy has been set back by the drought and the need to offset higher imported food costs. ZASA has been hampered by:  a 6-12 month startup delay due to slow initiation of the WG, a shortage of local currency (until Commodity Import Program proceeds became available), and the late arrival of TA staff; a shortage of GOZ staff; and inadequate coordination with other donors. Recommendations include to continue the project unchanged.","Attached to PD-AAP-618","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","3/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Small farms|Collective farming|Communal land|Agricultural cooperatives|Agricultural productivity|Agricultural production","Zimbabwe","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAP618A.pdf","3,868 KB","003002 - Ronco Consulting Corp.","","008628 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to promote small, decentralized hydroelectric power (SDH) resources in LDC's.  Special evaluation covers the period 6/82-5/84 and is based on document review, briefings by A.I.D. officers, and a presentation by the contractor, the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association (NRECA). A 1983 Amendment redirected the project from strengthening NRECA's capabilities to supporting LDC activities and promoting private sector involvement therein.  During the evaluation period, NRECA provided TA to some 15 countries and conducted a workshop in Swaziland, 2 U.S. study tours, and a 2-day seminar on private sector involvement.  NRECA has established an excellent SDH database, including information on key SDH personnel. Although tardy, work on a Micro-Hydropower Source Book and an SDH Economics Handbook has begun. Major concerns touch three areas.  (1) NRECA must clarify whether the program should mainly foster development (and thus focus on rural areas) or meet national energy needs (with a focus on urban/industrialized areas).  The latter have not yet been sufficiently addressed.  To maintain A.I.D.'s credibility, the project must move beyond paper studies to implementation in conjunction with USAID country strategies. A.I.D. support for small pilot facilities is suggested as an approach to funding such efforts; an architectural/engineering firm should be introduced into the program.  (2) To improve intra-A.I.D. communication on the program, semi-annual meetings among the Science and Technology Bureau (S&T), the Regional Bureaus, and USAID's is recommended. Frequent meetings among NRECA, AID/W, and USAID's, are recommended to promote program coordination, efficiency, and visibility and to define long-term goals.  (3) To improve program management, it is recommended that:  S&T appoint an SDH project manager; NRECA status reports better address program status, recent activities, future plans, and costs; and marginal activities be eliminated through an improved tracking system. Also urged are a stress on:  follow-on activities; producing project documentation on time; and treating practical problems such as hydrologic data collection in future workshops.","Attached to PD-AAP-617","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","7/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Hydroelectric power|Small scale energy systems|Energy resource development|Technology assessment|Limited data plus","","","","000184 - USAID.

"Evaluates emergency P.L. 480 Title II Food for Work (FFW) program in Bolivia implemented by Food for the Hungry, International (FHI) to provide hunger relief from the 1983 drought/floods. Special evaluation covers the period 10/83-4/84 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with FHI personnel. As of 4/84, FHI had distributed only 2,700 MT of a programmed 10,000 MT of emergency commodities through FFW projects in the Cochabamba, La Paz, Oruro, Potosi, Sucre, and Tarija departments due to the delayed arrival of commodities (2,000 MT had to be borrowed from other agencies in late 1983; 4,000 MT arrived only in the last week of April) and of Outreach Grant funds to buy vehicles.  The lack of vehicles and of TA, plus FHI administrative difficulties (i.e., leadership turnover; non-Spanish speaking volunteers with little development experience; lack of coordination with other agencies), have resulted in an almost total absence of FFW project supervision, except in Chuquisaca.  Some communities have received food from more than one agency (e.g., coverage in the province of Arque was 249%; while in Misque it was only 2%) and others for only token participation (e.g., 2 days work on projects requiring 17). Also, rural residents close to departmental capitals and experienced in dealing with bureaucracies have received a higher proportion of food.  Although, some projects have been well-executed (e.g., in Sucre, where FHI worked closely with the Bolivian Institute of Agricultural Technology) and most have followed program eligibility guidelines (e.g., for bridge and road construction, and irrigation, agricultural, potable water improvements), many results will be short-lived due to the lack of TA and supervision. Despite these problems and others (e.g., unorganized, unsecured, dirty warehouses), with FHI offices now fully staffed, the emergency winding down, and the assumption that vehicle and warehouse equipment funds will soon arrive, future FHI FFW projects should be able to make a contribution to Bolivia's development.  Recommendations include redefining FHI staff authority and increasing departmental coordination through inter-institutional committees.","Attached to PD-AAP-625","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","5/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Food for Work|Emergency food distribution","Bolivia","","","008515 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to construct potable water systems and latrines in 39 rural communities in Bolivia's La Paz Department.  Final evaluation, conducted by CARE, the grantee, covers the period 3/79-12/82 and is based in part on village surveys. Despite the fact that the project took place during a time of political upheaval and economic difficulties, and despite poor relations between CARE and its Bolivian counterpart, the Regional Development Corporation of La Paz (CORDEPAZ), all 39 potable water systems were completed; targets for latrine construction (80 per water system) were not met for a variety of reasons. Problems between CARE and CORDEPAZ began to develop in 1981 when the latter failed to provide financial suppport for transport and administration; by early 1982, CORDEPAZ had effectively withdrawn from the project.  As a result, CARE unilaterally built 17 of the water systems and CARE and the communities themselves covered the financial shortfall caused by CORDEPAZ's withdrawal. Some 13,500 rural villagers have benefited from improved public health conditions and access to safe water (the projected figure of 19,500 beneficiaries was based on overestimation of village populations).  Three 21-day training courses, each attended by 2 persons from each village, covered water system maintenance and administration, public health and sanitation, community organization, and cooperativism; the courses generated a great deal of enthusiasm among community members. Although - due to a lack of baseline studies - it is impossible to accurately measure the project's health impacts, sample surveys in 6 villages indicate improved general sanitation as well as child mortality rates (ages 0-4) well below national norms. Latrines are generally ignored due to contrary cultural practices.  Reduced fetching clearly benefits women and children, and eliminating the need to store water in the home inhibits the spread of water-borne diseases.  Moreover, the project has led to increased awareness among villagers of their capabilities to manage similar projects; several communities have already expanded their systems. Future CARE projects in the region will focus on strengthening training, reevaluating sanitary disposal methods, and finding a reliable and energetic counterpart agency.","Attached to PD-AAP-626","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","8/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Rural areas|Private voluntary organizations|Outdoor toilet facilities|Potable water|Sanitation|Water supply structures|Beneficiary count|Beneficiary interviews|Limited data plus","Bolivia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAP626A.pdf","1,186 KB","008515 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to develop subtropical lands in San Martin, Peru. Special evaluation (a summary of an unattached 8 volume, 560-page final evaluation in Spanish) covers the period 6/78-9/82. The project has achieved some of its objectives.  Construction targets have been fully met for new roads, existing road improvements, and grain storage facilities.  However, road costs were higher than budgeted and maintenance has been inadequate; grain stores are far from markets, lack a maintenance fund, and have inadequate ventilation and rain protection. Although no crop yield increases resulted, agricultural extension was initially relatively successful (increasing staff by 76% and equipment by 63%; providing farmer courses/meetings); but with the 10/81 switch from group extension to an approach using contact-farmers to pass on extension messages to other farmers, progress has been limited. Participants have not been well chosen, messages are stereotyped and not locally adapted, and the system has failed to multiply. While 51% of planned loans to farmers have been disbursed and loan recovery has been around 70%, the credit program has been seriously hampered by an overemphasis on equipment purchases (often for unsuitable land-clearing machinery), lack of extension, and a cumbersome credit mechanism.  Most seriously, with inflation at 100% and an interest rate of only 32.5% the loan fund is rapidly being eroded.  The lack of available credit has also limited land clearing (to 18% of the target), land preparation (34%), and threshing (3%). Topographic surveying/mapping activities have been completed, but the cadaster survey and land titling have lagged; only 35% of adjudication contracts and 77% of reversion resolutions have been issued.  Although natural resource studies have been carried out, the overall environmental protection plan (due in 1981) remains incomplete due in part to a lack of aerial photography. Numerous recommendations include to:  extend the loan agreement; add research, agro-industry, forestry, and fishery components and increase coordination among components; and speed up the resource evaluation program.","Attached to PD-AAP-695","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Land development|Integrated regional development|Land reclamation|Agricultural development|Agricultural extension|Land clearing|Agricultural credit","Peru","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAP695A.pdf","1,913 KB","008591 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to increase agricultural productivity in Egypt by restoring and maintaining irrigation canals.  Special evaluation covers the period 9/78-12/83 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with Government of Egypt Ministry of Irrigation and other project personnel. Despite an initial 18-month delay due to U.S. and GOE disagreements over the provision of TA, equipment testing requirements, and contractual commitments to U.S. suppliers, the project has exceeded all its 5-year targets.  Four public companies have been provided with dredging, earthmoving, and support (e.g., trucks, spare parts, tools) equipment.  For the two companies that first received equipment, canal/drain debris removal increased by 62% between 1979 and 1982; a total of 101 million cubic meters had been dredged/excavated by 1982, primarily for maintenance.  With improved canal maintenance and water availability, some farmers have reported increased agricultural productivity. An unexpected benefit has been the use of AID-financed equipment to construct the new El Salaam Canal (i.e., Peace Canal) in the Sinai; also, a U.S. dredge is being used to maintain water exchange between the Mediterranean Sea and Lake Bardawil to permit continued lake fishing. The project has been hampered by:  equipment problems (mostly resolved except for shop equipment); ineffective TA (e.g., a consultant approved the wrong order of trucks for shipment to the project); an inadequate project design which overestimated economic rates of return (e.g., from increased cotton production) and lacked a logframe to aid in evaluation; and poorly executed training plans which resulted in Egyptian company personnel receiving only limited field training by U.S factory representatives and no U.S. training. The project's implementation problems highlight the need for a clear understanding of the terms of delivery, warranty, onsite training, etc. among host country personnel, consultants, and suppliers.  It is recommended that funding be obtained to provide lacking equipment parts.","Attached to PD-AAP-697","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","3/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Irrigation sites|Irrigation system construction|Water supply structure maintenance|Water supply structures|Canals","Egypt","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAP697A.pdf","1,221 KB","008539 - USAID.

"Evaluates pilot project to provide TA in construction management to selected Egyptian firms (evaluation also covers similar assistance to A.I.D.'s Irrigation Pumping Project - 2630040). Special evaluation covers the period 3/82-3/84 and is based on document review and interviews with contractor, host government, USAID/C, and construction industry personnel. DDR International, the contractor, has provided very valuable construction management assistance to four public sector Egyptian firms. Participant firms particularly praised DDR's capability and persistence, but felt that had DDR's contract time been longer, much more could have been accomplished.  Many also felt that DDR's scope of work should have been broadened to include instruction in quality assurance, cost control, equipment control, quantity surveying, and information systems and to allow more time for training of trainers. The firms' rates of project completion increased where DDR participated and some projects were finished on time or ahead of schedule. Less positively, the one private company participating in the project, the Urban Development Company for Investment and Contracting (UDICO), did not continue DDR's services after the 90-day trial period because it sought the more extensive services which DDR had provided to the public sector El Nasr General Contracting Company (which had hired DDR on its own before this project started).  Nevertheless, UDICO expressed interest in participating in an expanded construction management program. Lessons learned are:  the likelihood of successfully introducing a new technology such as construction management is enhanced when the audience has already demonstrated its receptivity; and the quality of a TA team and its personnel are critical to project success. It is recommended that USAID/C consider an expanded effort modeled after the DDR project, using the training office of the Ministry of Housing.  Also, when appropriate, construction projects should include a construction management requirement and project designs by architectural and engineering firms should be subject to value analysis (external evaluation of designs vis a vis a planned facility's function).

"Evaluates Accelerated Impact Program (AIP) to support community self-help activities in South Pacific island states.  Special evaluation, focusing on AIP projects supervised by Peace Corps Volunteers, covers the period to 4/84 and is based on visits to 29 projects and interviews with A.I.D., Peace Corps, and local officials and with beneficiaries. Almost 300 small self-help projects have been successfully implemented, directly meeting the needs of over 200,000 beneficiaries. Although the focus of the AIP has changed over the years to reflect a renewed emphasis on small business development and income-generating schemes, the range of projects remains diverse.  One-third have been in the area of agricultural development, the remainder in such areas as energy, cyclone relief, fisheries, forestry, water systems, and sanitation. Infrastructure has been improved through construction of bridges, sea and river walls, schools, and community centers.  Fishing projects have had a particularly significant impact by helping to transfer fish aggregation device technology to the region and by increasing the fuel efficiency and safety of small fishing boats. The projects, most in the $4,000-$8,000 range, have been been characterized by substantial beneficiary contributions of cash, labor, and materials.  Disbursement of funds to communities has been very efficient, and the projects have also benefited from a mandatory 6-month maximum implementation period.  Minor problems in fiscal recordkeeping at the local level have occurred.  Most projects have been in Fiji, although all island groups have benefited. Recommendations include to:  continue to support projects that genuinely reflect community needs; suspend poultry projects, in view of their poor showing, until their potential and suitability can be evaluated by an expert; suggest that the 6-month time frame for project completion start when the community receives funds, rather than when the agreement is signed; on a discretionary basis, mount an A.I.D. emblem plaque in an appropriate location upon project completion; and carefully screen proposals for community halls to insure that the halls are not desired solely for their prestige value. Descriptions of the individual projects visited are appended.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","4/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Community development|Community self help|Beneficiary count|Beneficiary interviews|Limited data plus","Oceania|Fiji","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAP701.pdf","522 KB","000039 - USAID.

"Evaluates subproject to help the Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA) in Western Samoa to expand its institutional capability to provide vocational training to rural and urban youth and to stimulate agricultural production.  Special evaluation covers the period 1978-3/84; no methodology is noted. Substantial progress has been made.  The YMCA has legally adopted a constitution, registered as an indigenous private voluntary organization, and put a professional staff in place.  Thirty-two YMCA clubs have been established, with a total of 2,100 members, and a headquarters building and training center has been constructed in Apia, the capital.  Many training targets have not only been met but exceeded. Some 235 urban youth have received training in job-seeking skills (vs. a targeted 120), while 75 urban and 20 rural youth have been given carpentry training (vs. targets of 60 and 40, respectively).  A 6-month course in motor mechanics has been offered to 40 youth; 12 others took part in short courses (vs. an overall target of 24 youth trained). Also, 13 trained mechanics, 5 of them from rural areas, received upgrade training.  Some 242 rural small engine owners (50% of them women) have been trained in repairs (vs. a target of 100), but only 256 rural farmers received management training (vs. a targeted 500); the latter program haa been delayed due to farmer trainees' slow repayment of loans. As for the project's agricultural production goals, taro, cocoa, and kava production involving 1,802 rural people have increased by 166%, 90%, and 242%, respectively, far exceeding the planned production increased of 25+%.  Local YMCA clubs market the surplus production for overseas export. Several programs and studies not included in the 2-year development plans have also been conducted.  Among these are: (1) training of 37 would-be migrants to New Zealand; and (2) studies of the high suicide rate among Samoan youth, the educational and social situation of street youth in Apia, and the need for courses in construction supervision for men and in small business management.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","3/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Rural areas|Urban areas|Youth|Vocational training|Crop production|Limited data","Western Samoa","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAP703.pdf","546 KB","","","","English","application/pdf","Limited data","","Ulinski, John A., Jr.","","Mar 1984","","","","Review of the rural/urban development program of the YMCA of Western Samoa","","PD-AAP-703","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTgzNDUw","South Pacific Regional","8790001"
"Evaluates project component to develop and implement a model rural water supply and sanitation (RWSS) program to be coordinated by Ecuador's Secretariat of Integrated Rural Development (SEDRI) and implemented primarily by the Ecuadorian Institute of Sanitary Works (IEOS).  Special mid-term evaluation covers the period 9/81-9/84 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with USAID/E and SEDRI personnel. IEOS has made little progress in developing a replicable RWSS model. Of the four low-cost technologies mentioned in the project paper, only one - the pour-flush toilet - has been developed to the operational stage.  Construction of gravity and mechanical pumping water systems, installation of handpumps, digging of wells, and construction of latrines are also all behind schedule. More positively, communities have been fully involved in system planning and in preliminary socioeconomic/sanitary surveys, and have also provided labor and funding inputs.  For each system built thus far, a community junta, responsible for ongoing operation and maintenance. has been formed.  However, only about half of the pour-flush toilets installed are being used, indicating a need for more sanitation education. Institutional development at the national level is far behind schedule.  As yet, there is no coordinated training plan; although some short-term training activities (courses, workshops, inservice training) have been conducted, none of the planned M.S. training is yet underway. Nor have job descriptions for responsible staff yet been developed.  At the provincial level, some encouraging steps, e.g., the use of promoters to help engineers and of contractors for civil works, have been carried out on the initiative of provincial engineers with little help or support from IEOS or SEDRI.  The project's funding arrangements are unnecesarily complex and a major cause of lack of progress. The project is at a critical juncture:  its objectives are still obtainable, but much must be done.  Three elements are essential: (1) community participation in all phases; (2) constant seeking of means to lower costs and expand coverage; and (3) mazimum use of paraprofessionals to assist engineers and administrators.  A total of 26 recommendations are made.","Order of technical direction no. 178","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/DSPE-C-0080","","9/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Water supply structures|Potable water|Sanitation|Outdoor toilet facilities|Rural areas","Ecuador","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAQ574.pdf","2,408 KB","000333 - Camp Dresser and McKee, Inc.

"Evaluates project to create a primary health care (PHC) delivery system in Somalia.  Special evaluation covers the period Fall 1980-4/84 and is based largely on interviews. Although the project can be salvaged, most components have been a dismal failure.  None of the 64 planned PHC units (PHCU's) has been completed, and no district health centers (DHC's) have been renovated. The two national training centers (NTC's) have been built; and however, while field staff, expatriates, and Somali counterparts have conducted a good deal of training for DHC and PHCU staffs, courses were conducted in English (translated by tutors), teaching materials were not translated, and NTC graduates are not competent to train traditional birth attendants and community health workers.  PHC delivery has been delayed by understaffing, logistical problems, and construction delays. Project management was the worst ever witnessed by the team. There is virtually no forward planning and no management instruments either in USAID/S, the Ministry of Health, or Medical Service Consultants, Inc. (MSCI), the contractor; large discrepancies exist between contracts and expenditures and in budget figures for commodities; and there is acute misunderstanding over drug procurement - while the project design promises only a modest amount of medical supplies, most personnel expect full drug and medical supplies for PHC units.  Design problems are reflected in excessive vehicle costs and in inappropriately large and expensive PHCU's. However, arguments for ending the project are overridden by the certain damage this would cause A.I.D.'s image and by the importance of PHC delivery in Somalia.  The Somalis show commitment and talent, and recent personnel changes bode well. The project is low cost, and the Government of Somalia (GOS) should be able to meet recurrent costs if cost-reducing recommendations made in the evaluation are followed and if USAID/S supports the project for 5 years after it is turned over to the GOS. Major recommendations are to:  extend the project 2 years; decentralize activities and separate training from health delivery; add 9 new expatriate advisors and discontinue MSCI services; and remove drugs and medical supplies from the budget.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-1406-I-08-1125-00","","4/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Rural areas|Primary health care|Health facilities|Training centers|Health workers","Somalia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAP723.pdf","28,036 KB","002615 - John Snow Public Health Group, Inc.","","008604 - USAID.

"Evaluates P.L. 480 Title II Food for Work projects implemented by Catholic Relief Services to build irrigation wells, tanks, and dams in India's Calcutta zone.  Special evaluation presents results of a 1982-83 multi-stage, stratified sample survey of beneficiaries of projects in Ranchi (1973,76,80) and Chandwa (1978-80).  Survey focused especially on Ranchi wells, which accounted for the majority of irrigation projects. The projects appear to be socially and economically beneficial. The construction of 4014 wells, 755 tanks, and 786 dams in Ranchi, and 1256 wells, 245 tanks, and 765 dams in Chandwa resulted in increased cropping intensity, higher yields per acre, and a corresponding increase in the marketable surplus for project beneficiaries, primarily small farmers holding 1-10 acres.  Benefits were highest for wells and lowest for tanks, although construction costs were highest for tanks and lowest for wells. Employment has risen; person-days per worker have increased for both sexes, although female labor has increased at a faster pace than has male labor.  Person-days used per acre also have increased.  Higher incomes have helped farmers send more of their children to school, with girls' education increasing at a faster rate than boys' education. Benefits have been greater in Ranchi than in Chandwa, with the rate of return on investment about 14%.  In Ranchi, over 50% of the beneficiaries held between 5 and 10 acres of land, about 35% held between 1 and 5 acres; all were male, 70% were 20-50 years old.  All beneficiaries used well water for irrigation, 74% for drinking as well. Crop area sown increased by 15%, from 5.4 to 6.2 acres per beneficiary; while additional area of irrigated land varied from 0.6 acres to 2.7 acres and additional income ranged from Rs.456 to Rs.3992.  About 56% of beneficiaries marketed part of the additional crop, 80% used it for self-consumption.  About 60% of Ranchi farmers spent part of their additional income on sending children to school.  Benefits have continued over the years, although the projects appear to have reached optimum level during their first years and average irrigated area has not changed greatly since then.","Cover date: January 1983","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","6/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Food for Work|Dug wells|Dams|Water supply structures|Irrigation|Beneficiary interviews|Sampling method","India","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAP834.pdf","18,092 KB","003754 - Xavier Institute of Social Services","","008557 - USAID.

"Evaluates Food for Work (FFW) low-cost housing construction project in India's Cochin zone.  Impact evaluation focuses on housing constructed during FY79-81 and is based on questionnaire data from a random sample of 300 project beneficiaries and 60 nonbeneficiaries. The FFW program helped to improve living conditions among the Cochin zone's rural poor.  Most beneficiaries were agricultural and nonagricultural laborers with monthly incomes of Rs.500 or less who had lived in damaged kutcha (mud walls, thatched roof) houses.  Some 95% of the beneficiaries would not have been able to build houses without FFW assistance.  The average cost of a house in Cochin was nearly Rs. 4,000; over the 3-year period, FFW commodities financed 10-24% of the total housing costs. Almost all the beneficiaries (65% in 1979 houses, 80% in 1980 and 1981 houses) were satisfied with the houses and willing to live in them permanently.  Among those not satisfied, the principal reasons were that the houses were too small or lacked doors, plastering, or flooring; a few houses were missing roofs and ceilings. The average house size was 150-300 square feet, although some houses built in 1979 were more than 400 square feet.  Household size averaged 2-3 people in 1979 housing and 6-7 people in 1980-81 housing.  Most households had wells for drinking water; although electricity was available in most villages, few households had connections.  Nearly 90% of the beneficiaries owned the plot on which the house was built. Among the major impacts of the housing were:  incidence of sickness was lower as the length of residence in FFW houses increased; acquisition of the houses enabled beneficiaries to have some type of food grain storage facility; and beneficiaries accumulated assets after acquiring the FFW houses, and the value of these assets increased with duration of stay.  No impacts on employment were found.","Cover date: January 1983","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","6/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Food for Work|Living conditions|Low cost housing|Beneficiary interviews|Sampling method","India","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAP835.pdf","9,478 KB","003274 - Research Institute","","008557 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to provide volunteer health personnel in the Caribbean and to establish a health personnel planning unit (HPPU) within the Caribbean Community Secretariat (CARICOM). Special evaluation covers the period 7/82-7/84 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with A.I.D., National Council for International Health (NCIH), Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), volunteer, and other personnel. Despite a slow start-up due to the great distance between NCIH and CARICOM, the delayed recruitment of the CARICOM coordinator, and AID/NCIH disagreements as to project emphasis, both components have been partially accomplished.  A highly effective HPPU has been established in Guyana to identify, recruit, and place West Indian and, to a lesser extent, U.S. volunteers.  The HPPU has gathered baseline health personnel data for 8 LDC's, developed a planning methodology, and with the aid of a project-supplied computer, begun refining data for national/regional (the latter less feasible) planning.  Although the HPPU has developed cooperative relationships with LDC Ministries of Health, the University of the West Indies, and especially PAHO (which will probably continue limited CARICOM support) and a health planning capacity, it cannot carry on without continued donor support. NCIH and CARICOM have responded to 25 of 43 requests (10 were later withdrawn) for short-term volunteers; 12 U.S. and 8 West Indian volunteers have been provided, and of these, 12 were physicians. However, as services provided have been mostly at the secondary/tertiary levels with little primary health care, development impact has been limited.  Also, due to the short assignment period (3 months), the necessary cultural/medical readjustment, and the absence of the usual volunteer support system, U.S. volunteers have proven less cost-efficient and have had less health impact than resident volunteers. The project has failed to develop a registry of Caribbean medical specialists or to persuade any specialists residing in the United States to serve as volunteers, although the latter are second in demand among LDC's after specialists resident in the West Indies.","Attached to PD-AAP-853","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","5/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Institution building|Health care planning|Volunteers|Alternative health delivery services|Health outreach services|Health workers|Private voluntary organizations","Guyana|West Indies|Eastern Caribbean","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAP853A.pdf","2,646 KB","000842 - National Council for International Health|001587 - Caribbean Community (CARICOM).

"Evaluates project to help the West Africa Rice Development Association (WARDA) develop and extend to farmers high-yielding rice varieties.  Special evaluation covers the period 10/81-10/83 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with project personnel. Overall progress has been satisfactory.  The WARDA Training Center at Fendall, Liberia, has provided rice production training, adapted from an IRRI model, to 907 employees of WARDA member governments.  It appears that a high percentage of former trainees are involved in rice production programs and performing well, but better trainee follow-up is needed. Research at the Mangrove Swamp Rice Research Station at Rokupr, Sierra Leone, is going well (although some of the work being done seems redundant).  Improved rice varieties have been tested or developed which are tolerant to iron toxicity and salinity and which show high yields with only small amounts of fertilizer; promising work has also been done on power tillage.  However, steps must be taken to ensure a continuous supply of water and electricity. The Deep Water Floating Rice Station in Mopti, Mali, has fared less well.  All 1982 trials were lost due to drought and 1983 trials are jeopardized by low river flood levels; the station lacks adequate pumping capacity to save the research. Nonetheless, two promising varieties have been identified, progress has been made in weed control, and several trials have been conducted in cooperation with Mali's Operation Riz program. There are sufficient research results available to make the project's Technology Assessment and Transfer (TAT) component a success, but TAT been constrained by the absence of effective national extension programs that can utilize WARDA technology and ensure that inputs are available to farmers.  A good start has been made at Rokupr in developing technical packages for extension, but no TAT personnel are present at the Mopti station. WARDA faces serious cash flow problems, which have adversely affected field operations.  Some actions have been taken to defer expenses, but unless member countries make substantial additional contributions soon, WARDA's continued existence is uncertain. Also, upland rice research has been neglected by the project and the project paper does not define institutional development as an objective, both serious flaws.","Attached to PD-AAP-854","Special Evaluation","Documents","PASA-BAF-0429-P-AG-3139","","1/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Rice|Research organizations|Research facilities|Agricultural extension|Agricultural research|Agricultural training|Varietal research","West Africa","","","001203 - U.S. Dept. of Agriculture.

"Evaluates project to strengthen the Cameroon Cooperative Credit Union League's (CCCUL's) financial and technical capabilities and to establish a pilot network of small farmer production credit unions (SFPCU's). Special evaluation covers the period 1981-6/84 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with project and credit union (CU) staff and with CU members. The project has been successful, due largely to the dedication of CU members who see the CCCUL as a private, voluntary, and social movement and to the fact that donor inputs are fully integrated into the existing CCCUL system.  CCCUL/CU technical and financial skills have been upgraded through:  66 inservice seminars provided by CCCUL for 1,026 CU officers and 592 bookkeepers; on-the-job and formal courses for 59 CCCUL fieldworkers; and overseas and U.S. long- and short-term training for 8 CCCUL officials.  Also, the project has conducted a training needs assessment and distributed educational materials to member CU's. Further efforts to strengthen CCCUL have included:  developing 10 of 15 planned job descriptions and an employee performance appraisal system; producing accounting and auditing procedure manuals; initiating work on a 5-year plan; liquidating 11 nonviable CU's and merging 11 others into 5 stronger CU's; and opening a dialogue between CCCUL and Cameroon's other major CU association to plan their eventual merger. The SFPCU component has established 15 of 28 planned CU's, trained 45 officers and 9 fieldworkers, and resulted in an 85% increase in the average value of agricultural loans and a savings growth in SFPCU's 16% higher than in rural non-pilot CU's.  Its production impact, however, has been less than expected.  Capital shortages have proven to be less of a production constraint than have a lack of technical knowledge, input supply, markets, suitable prices for farm outputs, etc. Although to reach full financial viability by the project's end (currently CCCUL is 97.4% self-sufficient), CCCUL may not be able to hire needed staff or to offer member CU's attractive interest rates, it is concluded that achieving 100% viability would greatly benefit CCCUL's institutional credibility and should be attempted.  Twenty-two recommendations are included.","Attached to PD-AAP-855","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","6/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Credit unions|Credit cooperatives|Financial management|Institution building|Agricultural production credit|Beneficiary interviews","Cameroon","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAP855A.pdf","10,391 KB","008524 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to prepare a national energy assessment and to strengthen the Government of Sudan's (GOS') National Energy Administration (NEA), a unit of the Ministry of Energy and Mining. Final special evaluation covers the period 1/81-3/84 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with A.I.D., GOS, contractor, and other project-related personnel. The project was a resounding success.  The NEA, barely existent prior to the project, was established as a viable GOS energy planning and policy development unit and organizational reforms were instigated within the National Electricity Corporation and the General Petroleum Corporation as a result of project activities.  Interinstitutional linkages (e.g., committees to study specific energy issues) were developed among government, private sector, academic, and other energy-related entities. Although training was given lower priority than the energy assessment, NEA staff skills in data collection/analysis and planning were upgraded through on-the-job and classroom courses (for an unspecified number of personnel) and U.S. Master's programs for three; additional training was provided through the U.S. Department of Energy's Petroleum Training Program. The National Energy Assessment was completed, providing baseline data for the National Energy Plan (currently under development as part of the follow-on Energy Planning and Management Project) and identifying key issues for policy analysis.  The latter included: petroleum and electricity supply, allocation, pricing, and investment; renewable resource commercialization; and foreign exchange availability.  The project was influential in effecting energy policy changes in pricing, allocation, investment, and demand management strategies (especially in the petroleum and electricity sectors); it also effectively argued the merits of the price mechanism for allocating scarce resources. Project success was due largely to strong A.I.D., GOS, and contractor commitment.  Although project management and quality control could have been tighter and the NEA should have been given more project input, the TA staff collaborated well with their counterparts and were especially effective in institution building.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","6/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Institution building|Energy planning|Energy policy|Policy analysis|Policy making","Sudan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAP875.pdf","7,833 KB","000743 - Arthur D.

"Evaluates P.L. 480 program in Tunisia.  Special evaluation covers the period through 7/84; no methodology is given. With regard to Title I activities to increase Tunisia's agricultural growth rate:  (1) Significant progress has been made in fertilizer scheduling and expansion of the distribution network, but planning and operations still tend to be cautious and shortages are still occurring at critical times.  Consumption of ammonium nitrate fertilizer was short of target by 15% in 1982-83 and 18% in 1983-84.  Phosphate consumption has, on the other hand, exceeded targets; Tunisian farmers must pay twice as much for nitrogen as they do for phosphate, due to higher subsidies for the latter.  (2) Private distribution efforts are generally proceeding well.  Thanks to badly needed increases in incentives to private dealers, many distributors have gone back into the retail fertilizer business; technical fertilizer information has been provided to private dealers.  (3) Construction of new fertilizer storage facilities is underway. (4) Extensive discussions have taken place regarding the potential use of low-cost alternative fertilizers such as DAP, which is manufactured, but not sold, in Tunisia.  (5)  Research on soil fertilizer response is moving slowly, due mostly to lack of trained staff.  More attention should be given to studies in this area and to research on forage and grain legumes and on other cereals; collaborative programs should be emphasized.  (6) Local currency allocations to the APMANE Small Farmer Credit project (6640302) have expanded rapidly; other allocations have been made, inter alia, to the Office of Cereals (used mostly for weed control and storage), the Office of Family Planning, and to the agricultural cooperative fund.  Agricultural research funding has increased some 60% between 1982 and 1984, but it is uncertain whether this is a result of local currency allocations. The Title II feeding program is now fully funded by the Tunisian government, as per the 1980 agreement. Recommendations address the above issues.  Annexes include a proposed implementation plan for 1985 and a discussion of future self-help and local programming directions; the need to continue the P.L. 480 multisectoral approach is stressed.  Other annexes deal with the economic analysis of fertilizer costs.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-1406-I-03-1138-00","","8/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Food for Peace Title I|Local currency|Fertilizers|Pricing|Fertilizer distribution|Agricultural development|Limited data plus","Tunisia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAP876.pdf","804 KB","003002 - Ronco Consulting Corp.","","008616 - USAID.

"Evaluates project implemented by the Cooperative League of the United States of America (CLUSA) to train farmer co-op members in the Gambia in skills necessary for their participation in the operation of local co-ops.  Special evaluation covers the period 7/80-4/84 and is based on a review of the final (1984) joint CLUSA/Government of the Gambia (GOTG) evaluation. The project successfully established a comprehensive member education program (MEP) and trained MEP field officers, known as Cooperative Inspectors-Education (CIE's), in nonformal education techniques and numeracy.  To date, 24 CIE's have conducted 6-month functional numeracy courses in 40 villages, trained co-op committee members in 36 co-op marketing societies, initiated 18 radio learning groups, and worked with women's Cooperative Thrift and Credit Societies.  All of these activities were conducted at the village level, with farmer members. The MEP exceeded expectations in developing materials and training staff, but given the project's short time frame, its overly ambitious farmer training goals could not be met. Although the project probably raised the consciousness and sensitivity of the GOTG toward farmer co-ops, it did not - and probably could not - increase GOTG support (due to inadequate means).  The MEP will erode quickly without donor support. Proposals by CLUSA and the Livestock Marketing Board (LMB) for co-ops in this sector have merit, but are inadequate in scope to have much impact.  Livestock marketing will be unable to expand significantly until the LMB overcomes key problems - inadequate infrastructure at buying points, lack of transport and operating funds, poor buying procedures, and inadequately trained staff. Constraints outside LMB control included GOTG pricing policy and strong market demand in Senegal, which fosters illicit exports across the border. The project should be terminated 9/30/84 as scheduled and the co-op mechanism made an integral part of downstream linkages in the Agricultural Research and Diversification Project (6350219). The GOTG should explicitly state that the Gambian produce and livestock boards' prices are support levels and that farmers may sell to anyone. Attached is a 5/31/84 rebuttal to the evaluation from a CLUSA cooperative education advisor.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/afr-G-1677","","5/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural cooperatives|Farmer training|Cooperative development organizations|Livestock|Agricultural product marketing|Limited data","Gambia","","","008545 - USAID.

"Provides contractor evaluation of a pilot project to train community health workers (CHW's) and village midwives (VM's) to provide nutrition education and infant growth monitoring in Sudan's Kordofan region. Special evaluation covers the period 1981-11/83 and is based on structured interviews with CHW's, VM's, and mothers and on anthropometric analysis. Despite difficulties, the project appears to be working. Illiterate CHW's and VM's have been trained to monitor children's growth, recognize clinical signs of malnutrition, and educate mothers about appropriate feeding practices and preventing dehydration.  The CHW's have weighed and measured children and monitored infant growth in 10 villages; in 5 of these villages, nutrition education has been provided as well. The interview data show that the mothers understand the activities of the CHW, know what a growth chart is used for, and maintain an adequate duration of breastfeeding.  Knowledge among mothers of oral rehydration therapy is widespread and oral rehydration salts are readily available in the villages. However, the CHW's have conducted little or no follow-up of children ""at risk"".  In addition, children in a nearby hospital were treated with intravenous solutions in an unsanitary environment despite the availability of oral rehydration salts. Recommendations are made regarding the UNICEF growth chart, timing of child weighing sessions, the provision of oral rehydration therapy, and CHW reporting and supervision.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/DSAN-C-0209","","1/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Primary health care|Community health care|Child nutrition|Nutrition education|Infant nutrition|Community health workers|Paramedical education|Growth monitoring|Beneficiary interviews|Limited data","Sudan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAP902.pdf","2,460 KB","000657 - Education Development Center, Inc.

"Evaluates nutrition education component of a population project in Jamaica.  Special evaluation (1984) supplements interim evaluation (1980) and is based on review of the media campaign, clinic visits, and interviews with Ministry of Health and USAID/J project personnel, officials from concerned international organizations, and mothers and children. Contrary to what was stated in the 1980 evaluation, the weak effect of the project's media campaign on eating/feeding habits has been mainly due not to unsatisfactory field contact with the target population - community health aides and nutrition assistants were well prepared and supportive of media messages - but to an inadequate understanding of Jamaican food behavior. The baseline social research which supported the project was superficial (in an effort to be broadly based), and later research aimed at determining food-related knowledge, attitude, and beliefs was poorly designed, addressing rational rather more emotional and psychological attitudes and neglecting cultural attitudes (e.g., that only cooked food is food, that a meal must contain meat) and facts (e.g., that Jamaican women crave green fruits during pregnancy, the impact of status and superstition on food choices, the correlation between a mother's ability to provide cooked food and her own sense of adequacy).  As a result, message design did not directly address the audience, tending to lecture instead of motivate change. Recommendations are, inter alia, to:  conduct an uninterrupted 1-year media campaign on the same issues (breastfeeding, expectant mothers' nutritional needs, anemia, weaning foods, and clinic attendance) but in a more clearly defined way; focus field activities in smaller areas; direct project efforts to those nutritionally most at risk; make media messages reassuring and confidence-building and confine messages largely to radio; rally greater support from hospital staffs, national opinion leaders, the private food industry, and Jamaican research and training institutions; improve training by increasing observational visits to model social marketing programs elsewhere and by conducting workshops to help field personnel develop ways to make mothers more comfortable in participating in the program.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/DSAN-C-0209","","1/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Nutrition education|Child nutrition|Maternal nutrition|Nutrition research|Mass media|Learning motivation|Beneficiary interviews","Jamaica","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAP903.pdf","696 KB","000657 - Education Development Center, Inc.

"Evaluates project implemented by the International Service for National Agricultural Research (ISNAR) to strengthen the management of African agricultural research.  Special evaluation covers the period 9/82-8/84 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with ISNAR staff. The project, with some modifications, is well on schedule.  ISNAR has completed country studies in Zimbabwe, Sudan, and Cameroon to determine specific research management needs; developed 8 case studies (most rated as average, some as excellent) on management issues (vs. the targeted 10; 3-4 more and accompanying teaching notes for all case studies are planned); and, using lectures, group discussions, and the case studies, conducted well-received management workshops for African research directors and scientists at the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture in Nigeria for 1 week (a trial workshop held in 1982), at the Eastern and Southern African Management Institute in Tanzania (7/83) for 26 participants (2 weeks), and at the Mananga Agricultural Management Center in Swaziland (7/84) for 18 participants (4 weeks). Additional workshops are planned for Cameroon (9/84), Mali (2/85), and possibly Kenya. However, due to difficulties on the part of both ISNAR and A.I.D. there has been a serious cash flow problem throughout the project; e.g., ISNAR did not receive initial project funding until 6/83 due to delays in satisfying the condition precedent that it have a properly accountable financial system.  Also, although ISNAR's project modifications (i.e., reducing the country studies from the planned 4-5 to 3; reducing the number and increasing the length of workshops) are appropriate, A.I.D. was not properly consulted about nor notified of the changes. Finally, ISNAR has not prepared its planned work agenda; has failed to submit a quarterly report for April-June 1983; and contracted 2 workshop consultants at an excessive cost. Recommendations include to continue the project and consider an extension pending the outcome of a final impact evaluation; also, ISNAR should submit a letter to A.I.D. justifying the project changes and increase its collaboration with African institutions.","Attached to PD-AAP-920","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","9/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural research|Management development|Research management|Management training","Nigeria|Africa south of Sahara","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAP920A.pdf","2,856 KB","000013 - USAID.

"Evaluates subproject (SP) to develop a family planning training and outreach program in Egypt for newly graduated physicians in ten Egyptian governorates.  Special evaluation covers the period 8/81-5/84 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with USAID/E, University of Alexandria High Institute of Public Health (HIPH), and Government of Egypt (GOE) personnel and with trainees. Although the SP has developed training plans and educational materials, only 63 pre-service trainers from eight governorates (vs. a planned 240 from 10 governorates) have received two weeks (vs. a planned three) of Stage 1 family planning training at the Abbis II Health Center; a projected 80 will have been trained by the end of the project, only 33% of the target.  Stage 2 training has been provided to 160 physicians in eight governorates by 29 of the pre-service trainers and 19 HIPH staff; Stage 2 output is expected to reach only 15-20% of the target.  Training has been hampered by:  (1) for the Stage 1 course, insufficient qualified trainees due to governorate-level staffing shortages, the GOE's failure to provide candidates, and the reluctance of physicians to leave private practices for the period required for Stage 1 training; and (2) for the Stage 2 course, the transfer of already-trained pre-service trainers, and inadequate governorate training facilities (and limited GOE funding for renovation or construction), training supplies, and equipment (e.g., pelvic models, films, slides).  Although trainees report satisfaction with the training, its effectiveness has been handicapped by the inability of trainees to observe or practice IUD insertions on live patients. Finally, although a community family planning outreach program has been established at Abbis II, its application has been inconsistent, supervision by health center medical staff inadequate, and medical supplies chronically lacking. Lessons learned are the importance of direct and indirect host government support to project success and of basing design targets on a realistic assessment of available human resources and facilities. Several recommendations are given.","Attached to PD-AAP-923","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","5/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Family planning|Physician education|Teacher training|Beneficiary interviews","Egypt","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAP923A.pdf","1,471 KB","008539 - USAID.

"Evaluates component (of a small farmer development project) to resettle 5,000 landless Guatemalan farm families in the undeveloped region of Ixcan.  Special evaluation covers the period to 1/84 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with project personnel and beneficiaries. The project has encountered many unforeseen developments.  Early on, support services from the National Institute for Agrarian Reform (INTA) were totally lacking, and lack of cooperation among participating entities nearly closed the project; these problems should have been anticipated at the design stage.  In addition, the military closed the project for some months during 1982. Since that time, however, the situation has much improved. To date, 2,000 families have been settled in the 50 targeted settlements, only 32 of which, however, are completed.  Although roads and trails were not completed prior to settlement by colonists, as was planned, the road system in the western part of Ixcan was virtually completed by 1/84, but no roads were completed in the eastern area due to its marshy terrain.  Four schools have been built, but three others remain unfinished and under litigation between INTA and a private contractor. Construction - funds for which were reallocated from a proposed land use study - has not been labor-intensive, as planned, but a CARE Food for Work project has been very effective in sponsoring self-help activities.  Further, only one of the participating cooperative federations, FECOAR, successfully carried out resettlement activities, and only one settlement had a functioning cooperative in 1/84, although cooperatives were to have been established in each settlement.  Also, pressure from the military caused the project to replace the planned health centers with a hospital at Playa Grande, which is, moreover, understaffed and underequipped. Although extreme poverty and poor health and sanitation are still high in the settlements, over $1 million in BANDESA loans has enabled settlers to begin clearing land and to cultivate annual and perennial crops; community organization is vigorous, and hopes for the future are high.  For recommendations, see the abstract of the attached PES (PD-AAP-925).","Attached to PD-AAP-925","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Small farms|Agricultural land settlement|Colonization programs|Landlessness|Beneficiary count|Beneficiary interviews","Guatemala","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAP925A.pdf","1,849 KB","008550 - USAID.

"Evaluates projects to increase dryland wheat production in Turkey, Jordan, Morocco, and Tunisia.  Summary evaluation covers the period from inauguration of the first project in Tunisia in 1965 to completion of the last in Turkey in 1982 and is based on 3 A.I.D. impact evaluations, a Rockefeller Foundation study, and an 11/83 A.I.D. workshop. All four projects achieved some measure of success, although effects on wheat yield were clearly positive only in Turkey and Tunisia; limited yield increases may have occurred in Jordan and Morocco.  Successful achievement of yield increases was not related to the type of technology transferred (in Turkey and Jordan, focus was on improved cultural practices; in Tunisia and Morocco, on high-yield varieties), but was correlated with length of assistance (10 years in Tunisia, nearly 15 in Turkey, 7 in Morocco, and 7 in Jordan - the latter including a 3-year hiatus), with rainfall levels, and with institution-building efforts. In both Turkey and Tunisia, great emphasis was put on training scientists and developing research and extension organizations capable of continuing work on wheat production technologies.  In contrast, the Morocco project was terminated due to the government's inability to support institution-building activities, while in Jordan institutional development never really got underway and the host government wheat production unit disbanded when the project ended. Price policies influenced the projects' success in complex ways. It appears that price incentives can increase yields as long as farmers have the technological capacity to respond and that there must be an institutional structure (in the broadest sense - providing research, information, inputs, market accessibility, etc.) which can support a production response to favorable prices. Farmer adoption of technology was strongly related to the risks thereof, which was related in turn to rainfall variability. Also, adoption might have been better had the projects:  (1) not neglected crop-livestock relationships (e.g., the value of weeds and wheat straw as animal feed); and (2) taken into account external changes - in labor costs and land tenure - affecting farmer resources.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Dry farming|Agricultural productivity|Yield increase|Wheat","Tunisia|Jordan|Morocco|Turkey","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAP932.pdf","600 KB","","","000133 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to help the Caribbean Confederation of Credit Unions (CCCU) develop and implement programs for member CU leagues and affiliated unions to mobilize local savings for development.  Second special evaluation covers the period 3/82-1/84 and is based on document review, site visits, and discussions with USAID, CU National Association, and league personnel. The CCCU has achieved most institutional development objectives; membership growth has exceeded targets, and annual savings per member has nearly doubled.  Virtually all CCCU financial management systems have been documented and implemented, and an operating budget, an information system, and a 5-year plan are being developed.  Emphasis is now on developing asset management capabilities.  The CCCU has established its credibility with governments and leagues but lacks a clear public image, especially at the CU level. CCCU has provided leagues with 5 manuals, standard operating forms and technical papers, and 5,000 reprints of CU information booklets for distribution.  Leagues, however, lack the capabilities to market CCCU products, which are often seen as too sophisticated and not relevant to participating territories. CCCU has completed institutional analyses of 13 leagues, all 15 leagues have received increased TA for CU management and planning, and a Caribbean exchange program has been developed. CCCU training services have been highly rated, although more emphasis is needed for on-the-job training and the training of trainers, and staff retention has been a problem. Some leagues have made financial progress, but only 5 will be financially self-sufficient by project end and guidelines for financial structures have yet to be developed.  There has been widespread demand for additional capital to complement CU funds and develop a regional CU finance system, but many CU's do not meet investment standards, and criteria linking external funds to internal capitalization need to be developed. In other areas, the country development program has initiated its new ""partners"" approach and improved its monitoring system and CU management capabilities; a CU needs identification study for Dominica has been completed; and standardized audit and meeting procedures are being developed (only 3 leagues were unable to complete 1981 audits).","Attached to PD-AAQ-014","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","2/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Credit unions|Institution building|Financial resources","Eastern Caribbean","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAQ014A.pdf","3,989 KB","001757 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to upgrade the capability of Bangladesh's agricultural research (AR) system to generate technology appropriate for farmers.  Internal evaluation covers the period 6/83-5/84 and is based on document review and site visits by 13 sub-committees. Progress has generally been satisfactory, although expenditures in most program areas have been low and inefficient project management by the International Agricultural Development Service (IADS) and poorly defined lines of authority among IADS, the Bangladesh AR Council, and USAID/B have hindered progress. Construction efforts are on target and TA has promoted AR decentralization, although it has not been used to maximum potential.  Training has been disappointing, especially in regard to in-country scientist training - for which only 7% of allocations have been spent - and the BARC training cell is inadequate to manage the training program.  Of 96 planned contract research projects, 54 have been completed or extended, and a contract research manual has been compiled.  The temporary nature of contract work has been a problem in obtaining efficient scientific personnel, however. Farming systems programs have strengthened on-farm research and farmer participation.  The status of project research is as follows: capability in agronomy is improving, and linkages in the AR network are being developed, but progress is slower than planned and results are not highly relevant; reasonable progress has been made in field crops; horticultural research is progressing well but lacks a full scientific staff and a core program; excellent progress has been made in soil management; pest management goals need to be clarified and integrated pest management efforts to be coordinated with other AR areas; achievements in water management, the largest program area, fell short of plans, although activities expanded despite insufficient staff; progress in agricultural economics and social science activities has been satisfactory; and the role of agricultural information in the AR process still needs to be clarified. Finally, considerable progress has been made in developing the Bangladesh AR Institute's central farm and regional research stations, although most of the latter require boundary fencing. Eighteen recommendations are provided.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","7/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Farming systems research|Institution building|Research centers|Research management|Agricultural training|Building construction|Technical assistance|Financial management|Expenditures|Limited data plus","Bangladesh","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAP965.pdf","33,169 KB","000046 - Bangladesh Agricultural Research Institute (BARI)|000655 - International Agricultural Development Service","","008511 - USAID.

"Evaluates Phase I of project to help the Government of Botswana (GOB) improve land use planning and resource management and increase agricultural production and rural nonfarm employment. Special evaluation covers the period 6/80-10/83 and is based on field visits, interviews with GOB officials, and document review. The project did not achieve all its objectives, but it has initiated several important steps toward sustained rural development, especially off-farm employment generation.  There were serious shortfalls in meeting land use planning targets, due to personnel shortages and lack of interest by the Ministry of Local Government and Lands; although considerable baseline data were generated concerning communal area development and resource management, only one land use plan was implemented (in Ngamiland). Most arable production outputs were achieved in spite of a 3-year drought, but lack of qualified staff led to poor choices in nurseries, woodlots, and horticultural estates.  The Arable Lands Development Pilot Program and the Agricultural Small Projects Fund were successful, but the former could have had more impact on planning large-scale programs, while the latter, which is ongoing, could benefit from more extensionists. In the off-farm employment component, the wildlife utilization project achieved none of its targets, due mainly to institutional problems and differences in orientation among personnel, and is being discontinued.  The rural industry program, on the other hand, has developed an active industrial extension program; its major shortfalls have been in finding local staff for the program and in completing surveys of industrial potential. The project's variety of activities, focus on local initiative, and flexible design have created special management problems for USAID/B and the implementing ministries.  Project shortfalls have been due to:  lack of trained personnel at both national and local levels; weak management systems within GOB ministries and competing priorities among them; and cumbersome administrative procedures. Lessons learned:  documentation and approval procedures should be simplified in projects of this sort; progress in land use planning and resource management depends on political will to address difficult issues; and, participatory rural development is a gradual process, requiring special management approaches and evaluation criteria.","Attached to PD-AAP-971","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","7/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Institution building|Rural development|Development planning|Land use|Off farm employment|Natural resource management|Agricultural production|Arable land","Botswana","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAP971A.pdf","5,712 KB","008516 - USAID.

"Evaluates grant to Accion Pro-Educacion Y Cultura (APEC) to provide training, counseling, and business credit to low-income women in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic.  Special final evaluation covers the period 2/82-8/84 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with APEC, the APEC Promotion of Women Training Center (PROMAPEC), and credit institution personnel, and with trainers and beneficiaries. The project surpassed its targets in most cases, having provided human development, skills, literacy, and/or microenterprise training to 2,454 women in the Capotillo barrio.  Training was provided at PROMAPEC and at three major skills training centers which at APEC's urging modified their curricula to accomodate women.  Literacy training was added to the project as 15.4% of the women had no formal education at all. Counseling (on legal, financial, and personal matters) did not meet targets due to lack of beneficiary demand, and employment referrals were deemphasized as job opportunities in the barrio were few; even so more than 100 businesses were contacted during the last 4 months of the project.  A sample of 298 trainees indicates that 46% were working at project end - most self-employed - with an average monthly income of RD$38 (vs. RD$2 before training). RD$300 were made to 108 women through the Dominican Development Foundation, which, however, did not provide follow-up assistance. While both human development and skills training were very successful, the wisdom of the project's emphasis on nontraditional skills, promoted by foreign planners, is arguable given the poor economic conditions in Capotillo and the hesitance of barrio women to enter traditionally male fields. Nonetheless, 16% of the women sampled are working in electrical repair or the printing trade. Dropout rates overall were high, probably because of trainees' lack of resources (psychological, physical, and economic), showing that extensive promotional efforts are essential when working with disadvantaged groups. Demand for project services remains high; 60 applications for loans and 779 for training are pending.  Recommendations are made for follow-on activities in Capotillo, and it is noted that PROMAPEC has expanded into a second Santo Domingo barrio using counterpart ESF funds.","Attached to PD-AAP-972","Special Evaluation","Documents","DPE-1054-C-00-1034-00","","8/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Women in development|Vocational training|Basic education|Training centers|Slum areas|Beneficiary count|Beneficiary interviews","Dominican Republic","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAP972A.pdf","1,653 KB","001341 - Creative Associates International, Inc.

"Evaluates project component to provide agricultural credit in Peru's Upper Huallaga region through the Agrarian Bank of Peru (BAP) and BANCOOP, the rural cooperative bank. Special evaluation covers the period 1981-6/84 and is based on document review, field visits and interviews with project, bank, and co-op personnel. Project credit activities, which include both in-kind credit (crops and livestock) and short- and medium-term production credit, have functioned ineffectively or not at all, due to inappropriate lending policies, poor management, institutional weaknesses in the project itself, and lack of experience, particularly in implementing in-kind credit. Moreover, contrary to expectations, small farmer demand for credit has decreased - probably because coca eradication efforts have reduced farmers' income potential and thus increased their reluctance to assume debt. Emphasis in the credit program should be shifted toward financing agribusiness enterprises which can generate employment and increase microeconomic demand for the crops being substituted for coca. Credit should be provided to the Naranjillo Cooperative's cacao processing plant and possibly to other proposed Naranjillo enterprises (coffee, plantain meal, citrus crops, and perhaps tea processing and/or marketing). BAP should be the lead institution for agribusiness credit, administering funds through BANCOOP and commercial banks (inclusion of the latter will help keep funds in the region). BAP provision of farmer credit should, however, continue to be supported; institution rebuilding efforts in this area should address policy and program issues, resource needs, and coordination with services provided by the National Agrarian University of the Jungle (UNAS), the Ministry of Agriculture, and the National Agrarian Research and Promotion Institute (INIPA). Training should be provided to INIPA agents (who currently lack understanding of BAP operations) to enable them to act as a link between farmers and the bank, and to BAP personnel, to help them translate formal bank procedures into language understandable by farmers. Further recommendations concern completion of land surveys and granting of certificates of land possession, documentation of credit funds, and experimental in-kind loans.","Spanish ed.: PD-AAP-985|Work order no. 1","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-1406-I-00-1094-00","","9/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Commercial credit|Financial management|Agricultural credit|Agricultural production credit|Agricultural development banks|Agribusiness|Farmers","Peru","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAP984.pdf","5,195 KB","000819 - Multinational Agribusiness Systems, Inc.","","000114 - USAID.

"From 1980 to 1984, the International Center for Research on Women (ICRW) provided technical assistance, primarily in project design, to help A.I.D. Missions increase economic opportunities for poor women. This impact evaluation reviews the project's background, its management by ICRW and AID/Washington, and its impacts, both in Washington and in developing countries. The evaluation found, in short, that despite the high quality of ICRW's assistance and some significant institutional benefits, field-level impact on Missions and especially on low-income women was disappointing.  Reasons include low Mission expectations; lack of follow-up, reflecting the short-term nature of ICRW assistance and the low priority with which most Missions treat Women in Development (WID) issues; and the erroneous assumption that the project would significantly increase opportunities for women.  The project nevertheless provided A.I.D. Missions in 17 countries and 5 private and public organizations in host countries with specialized assistance otherwise unavailable; strengthened ICRW capabilities and stability (although ICRW expectations of long-term field relationships and greater involvement in project implementation were not met); and increased the exposure and credibility of WID issues as well as the WID information available to the Washington development community. ICRW management was both efficient and appropriate, but implementation would have been improved had senior staff sought to build collaboration with A.I.D. project management.  AID/W's management was somewhat constrained by the degree of Mission control, and promotion within AID/W was inadequate. It is recommended, inter alia, that AID/W and ICRW emphasize coordinated technical assistance, which extends from the project design stage through implementation to follow-up.  AID/W should also seek to combine technical assistance with complementary WID-related activities - e.g., information dissemination and training of selected AID/W and Mission personnel.  Special efforts should be made to incorporate attention to women into Science and Technology Bureau projects, particularly those with an economic focus.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-0000-I-ll-3078-00","","9/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Women in development|Technical assistance|Economic development","Ecuador|Dominican Republic","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAR184.pdf","2,192 KB","006727 - Development Alternatives, Inc.

"The severity of the 1984 drought in Niger and its effects on population migration and food production are assessed in this report. The first sections discuss the effect of the drought on Niger's agriculture and pasture and, with maps for illustration, detail the condition and movement of displaced populations in the various departments.  A climatic assessment reveals that throughout half the agricultural zone, and nearly all of the pastoral zone, rainfall was only 50% of normal, creating a far worse situation than during the severe 1973 drought.  Estimates for 1984 millet and sorghum production outputs are presented and discussed in relation to food supply and demand.  The existing transportation and logistical network is described. Final sections depict the organizational structure of USAID/N and Government of Niger drought relief efforts, the extent of food commitments from other donors, and the strategies developed by the Government of Niger and A.I.D. to combat the crisis.  It is concluded that a massive southward migration of herders and sedentary farmers has taken place and that herd losses have reached as high as 60-65% for cattle; the Government of Niger's capacity to deal with the crisis is rapidly being exhausted.  It is recommended that A.I.D. provide timely, well-coordinated, and significant emergency assistance. The text includes numerous maps, charts, and tables; seven annexes are appended.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","10/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Drought|Emergency relief|Refugee relief|Refugees|Disaster relief|Emergency food distribution|Internal migrations","Niger","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAR220.pdf","5,459 KB","008585 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to strengthen agricultural extension agent training at Mali's three Agricultural Apprenticeship Centers (CAA's).  Special evaluation covers the period 5/77-6/84 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with A.I.D. and project personnel and with CAA students, teachers, and administrative staff. Significant progress has been made.  Major accomplishments to date include:  instilling a greater sense of purpose and professionalism among CAA faculty, staff, and students; inducing the beginnings of a shift in teaching methods from rote memorization toward integration of theory with practice; and completing half of the planned curriculum revision.  The project has also provided logistical support, administrative reform, and improved equipment maintenance. It is recommended that the project be extended to 1987 to allow for completion and evaluation of the curriculum revision and for continuation of the teacher training program, CAA administrative improvements, and equipment/vehicle maintenance efforts. The extended project should emphasize:  practical work and farmer training for extension agent trainees; further curriculum refinements away from theoretical and irrelevant materials; creation of student farm plots; teacher involvement in curriculum revision; expansion of the Specialization Centers to train all third year students; student evaluation after the second and third years of instruction; CAA participation in student selection; greater effort to sensitize and gain the support of the Government of Mali's Ministries of Agriculture and Rural Development; and orientation sessions for incoming students to address their concerns about future employment.","Attached to PD-AAQ-010","Special Evaluation","Documents","688-207-S-00-4029-00|688-207-S-00-4028-00|PIO/T 688-207-3-40001","","6/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural schools|Agricultural extension training|Teacher training|Agricultural extension agents|Institution building|Curriculum design|Beneficiary interviews","Mali","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAQ010C.pdf","2,036 KB","008575 - USAID.

"Provides final Mission report (1980-9/83) on a project to upgrade Liberia's youth on-the-job training (YOJT) program. Although the project was not able to train as many youths as was intended, it significantly upgraded the YOJT staff skills.  Staff were trained in new on-the-job training methodologies and management skills; 7 staff members received short-term U.S. training in the areas of counseling, administration, auto mechanics, carpentry, and electrical building trades, and supervision (2 trainees did not return and had to be replaced). As a result, the project was able to train youth at a higher level and provide training materials to both employers and trainees.  All institutional development targets were met except for skill performance certification and job follow-up procedures, both of which are still being developed. During the final two years of the project, the number of individuals placed in training increased to 100 a year (vs. an adjusted target of 200 a year and a preproject average of 38). However, only one class of 57 trainees (vs. 500 targeted) had graduated by the end of the project; of these, 44 were placed in jobs.  The failure to meet training outputs was due to a combination of factors:  (1) the need to extend most training programs from 1 year to 2 or more years because of the low reading, writing, and math levels of the trainees; (2) Liberia's economic decline, which resulted in many businesses being unable to afford the increased costs of new graduates; (3) delays in project implementation resulting from the 1980 coup; and (4) lack of motivation among Liberian staff. The number of participating employers increased from 30 in 1979 to 58 in 1983; some 40 other employers have expressed interest in participating if and when the Liberian economy improves. Participating employers were very satisfied with the YOJT program. In 1/83 the contractor (who had performed adequately in all regards) departed and the project was turned over to Liberian staff.  Low staff motivation, resulting mainly from Liberia's economic difficulties, continues to pose a major obstacle to further progress.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","5/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","On the job training|Vocational training|Youth|Limited data plus","Liberia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAQ060.pdf","381 KB","008570 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to strengthen the design and production capabilities of manufacturers of small farm machinery and equipment in the Philippines.  Special evaluation covers the period 11/80-10/84 and is based on site visits and interviews with project personnel, equipment producers, and users. Although the project lagged at first, significant progress has been made in the past year; the project's benefits have definitely outweighed its costs.  Despite inadequate staff, budget, design expertise, and shop facilities, the Government of the Philippines (GOP) Ministry of Agriculture and Food (MAF) Bureau of Plant Industry (BPI) has developed several equipment designs (i.e., a seed and fertilizer applicator, heated floor dryer, root crop chipper, manual corn sheller, and combination rice thresher/corn sheller) independently of the International Rice Research Institute, its co-implementor.  On-farm tests have been conducted for 21 types of equipment.  Project TA, training, and blueprints have been provided to over 200 manufacturers (mostly small rural enterprises) who are now producing or adapting equipment.  Communication has been strengthened among manufacturers, GOP agencies concerned with farm machinery, equipment designers and developers, and farmer users. However, several issues merit concern:  BPI farm machinery activities are not well integrated with other MAF R&D and extension efforts; small manufacturers need management as well as engineering assistance; and the BPI project co-leader has not been adequately involved in budgeting. Although a substantial expansion of the BPI project is not necessary to meet the equipment requirements for short-term agricultural growth, continued support for the project is needed to sustain its momentum during the current GOP budget crisis and to meet long-term farm machinery development needs resulting from the GOP's policy of accelerated agricultural development and its promotion of new crops. Short-term efforts should focus on developing postharvest machinery for the new priority crops.  A 2-year project extension with no additional funding is recommended.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","10/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Manufactured products|Manufacturing|Agricultural equipment|Product development|Machine design|Beneficiary interviews","Philippines","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAR343.pdf","632 KB","000180 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to help the University of the South Pacific (USP) upgrade the satellite communication facilities used in its extension and outreach programs.  Special evaluation covers the period 1978-3/84 and is based on USP site visits and interviews. Due to staffing and implementation problems, the communications system has become fully operational only in the past year. Nevertheless, the project has increased the number of pre-diploma students with access to satellite tutorials at USP's national extension centers; in 1983, one-half of USP's satellite time was used for tutorials covering 29 subjects.  The satellite system has also been used for educational support activities, weekly meetings of extension center staff, agricultural research round-tables, dissemination of information to development personnel (especially through audioconferencing), and routine computer messaging.  While satellite-related functions have been well integrated into regular extension operations, understaffing remains a problem. Other problems persist:  students' lack of access to the extension centers has caused erratic attendance; development outreach coordination has seen little improvement; and training has been limited to introductory sessions for faculty and staff. The project also lacks coordination among extension services, other USP resources, and national institutes of higher education newly emerging in the region. On the technical level, most technology supported by the project has been appropriate for USP use.  USP's regional communication requirements have been studied but no overall strategy has been formed; a long-term satellite access (alternative to NASA's experimental ATS-1 system, now in use) has not been identified. Finally, the radio broadcast and video production facilities (mostly general interest programming) have been upgraded. The evaluation showed that:  satellite teleconferencing is essential to success of the extension program which, as USP's visible presence in participating countries, may be crucial to USP's viability; system use for tutorials and regional outreach activities needs to be increased; continued access to the ATS-1 system is critical; and greater use of audio and video tapes for remote and rural learners is needed. Recommendations to improve the USP system are included.","Missing p.9","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","3/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Satellite communications|Universities and colleges|Educational delivery|Educational extension programs|Beneficiary interviews|Limited data plus","Solomon Islands|Vanuatu|Western Samoa|Tonga|Fiji","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAQ068.pdf","830 KB","002684 - University of the South Pacific","","000039 - USAID.

"Provides final Mission report (9/79-6/84) on a project to increase employment opportunities for women in Morocco's industrial and commercial sectors. Most targets were met.  Some 660 A.I.D.-sponsored women - 225 over target - were trained at Fes (132) and Ain Borja, two of the 30 pilot centers run by the Ministry of Labor's Office of Technical Training and Job Development (OFPPT).  Auxiliary efforts included sensitizing high school officials and women students to existing employment opportunities, counseling trainees, and holding pre-graduation workshops on preparing resumes, preparing for interviews, etc.  Some 70% of the women trained have found jobs, although most did so through their own efforts, not through the OFPPT.  OFPPT has however, developed three surveys to identify industrial and commercial firms with the best job placement opportunities.  In other areas, 17 of 23 candidates have completed U.S. training and have returned to Morocco, with 3 others due to graduate by 8/85, and OFPPT curricula have been substantially improved in drafting, electronics, business education, and secretarial skills.  On the debit side, the study of the constraints to admitting women to OFPPT centers was weak and was submitted very late; the system for evaluating on-the-job performance of women graduates was never formalized; and, most importantly, the quality of teacher training remains notably deficient (only on-the-job is provided), even though 13 trainers have received U.S. training. Lessons learned are:  inappropriate contract personnel (e.g., the economist) hurt the project; not all elements described in the Project Paper were included or well reflected in the contract; the contractor's procurement capability should be closely scrutinized and contracts should specify clear procurement plans; the return of participants before project completion should be assured; the contractor should help select participants; a follow-up procedure is needed to determine whether trainees have been suitably placed; and a local USAID project officer should be involved from the beginning in projects having several U.S. project officers. Future projects should be designed for women in small villages.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","6/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Women in development|Vocational training|Training centers|Employment|Beneficiary count|Limited data","Morocco","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAQ070.pdf","212 KB","008579 - USAID.

"Provides final Mission report (to 5/84) on a project to establish a training and demonstration site - called a Village Technology Unit (VTU) - at the Mahamba-Zombodze Rural Development Area (RDA) in Swaziland and expand a similar site at the Northern RDA. Although early input and construction delays and the death in 1983 of the still unreplaced Swazi project director forced a 2-year extension, the project has been a complete success.  Both VTU's are now fully operational, and 5 project-trained Swazi trainers, two at the Mahamba-Zombodze site and three at the Northern site, have trained over 160 Swazis to use appropriate technology for such activities as cinder block making, carpentry, cement jar making, and welding.  The project also provided loans to enable 46 graduates to open a wide range of profitable businesses within their homesteads either in groups or individually.  More than 5,000 people from within and outside Swaziland have visited the VTU's, which have received in excess of 250 requests for training and equipment.  In a particularly successful venture, a graduate in the Mahamba-Zombodze site purchased a cinder-ram machine, trained three Swazi's in block making, and grossed over $4,167 in his first 6 months of business, thus creating a huge demand for training in this area. On the negative side, the Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives's (MOAC) failure to budget for the project's training costs threatens discontinuance of the project.  Because the project was part of a larger and still ongoing UNDP/UNICEF effort, the MOAC and the Government of Swaziland in general have failed to realize that A.I.D. funding is being discontinued despite repeated notice to that effect.  More attention should have been given to finding alternative ways to fund the training course.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","5/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Appropriate technology|Training centers|Vocational training|Small scale enterprises|Rural areas|Beneficiary count|Limited data","Swaziland","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAQ078.pdf","101 KB","008609 - USAID.

"Evaluates P.L. 480 Title III Food for Development program in Bolivia. Second external evaluation covers the period 1982-84 and consists of an institutional analysis conducted by professionals and an evaluation of program impact based on interviews of rural residents conducted by a team of campesinos. After a 1982-83 curtailment in the program due to a temporary suspension of wheat shipments, inflation, and peso devaluation, the program was extended 1 year in 12/83 and additional wheat shipments and three new individual projects were authorized, bringing the total to 17. Program management by the Executive Secretariat has been commendable and low staff turnover has aided continuity of supervision.  However, proliferation (to 117) of subprojects (SP's) within the 17 individual projects has so taxed the Secretariat's field supervision and accounting capabilities that a special task force is needed to redress all the problems.  For its part, USAID/B has invaded areas of project authority reserved to the Secretariat and its project review process has slowed since 1982. Despite serious management deficiencies (except for CORDECRUZ), the Departmental Development Corporations (DDC's) have generally applied Title III resources to their projects in a cost-effective manner, providing high-quality community outreach and TA to project participants.  DDC-sponsored agricultural credit and reforestation have done notably well. Health sector projects have produced positive results in yellow fever, malaria, and tuberculosis control, although performance has been slipping since 1982 due to declining government support. Absolute immunization coverage is high but is less than initially thought in rural areas, where unmet demand reached 35% largely due to neglect of community involvement in local interventions. A number of nutrition research projects offer potential bases for future projects. Projects meriting continuation include integral and credit cooperatives, DDC forestation and other projects, campesino scholarships, and, as a matter of public necessity, communicable disease control.  Projects meriting termination are wheat collection centers, agricultural service centers, and micro-irrigation.  Due to high costs, colonization roads (Chane-Pirai) should be completed but not extended. Details on all 17 projects and recommendations for the project's improvement are included.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","511-0000-C-00-4067-00","","7/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Food for Peace Title III|Rural development|Development project management|Disease prevention and control|Health research|Nutrition education|Government departments|Road construction|Scholarships|Cooperatives|Afforestation|Irrigation|Agricultural product marketing|Pesticides|Beneficiary interviews","Bolivia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAQ089.pdf","36,775 KB","001046 - Rural Development Services","","008515 - USAID.

"Evaluates project in Uganda to supply farmers with needed inputs and to rehabilitate the cooperative (co-op) movement so that it can resume providing essential agricultural services.  Special evaluation covers the period 9/81-10/83 and is based on interviews with USAID/U, Ministry of Cooperatives and Marketing (MCM), and contractor officials and with co-op members. Substantial progress has been made despite significant political, economic, communication, and transportation problems.  High quality training has been provided for nearly 2,000 co-op members/officials and MCM staff, including:  short-term U.S. courses for 57 (vs. a planned 48); in-country advanced management seminars for 49; seminars for 83 trainers on conducting primary society educational programs; and society-level courses (10,770 co-op members will have been trained by 6/84).  Seminars have also been held on mid-level management for 123, women in development for 20, and transportation for 41; the latter has been hampered by lack of manuals, spare parts, and tools. Textbooks are being provided to the Kigumba co-op college. Although procurements were delayed initially, large quantities of inputs (hoes, seeds, bicycles, etc.) are now being provided to farmers through co-ops.  However, input delivery has been uneven due to inadequate donor coordination and the co-ops have not received a fair share of distribution profits due to arbitrary and inflexible MCM pricing policies; both of these situations could be remedied by giving national and district co-op unions greater responsibility for distribution/pricing decisions.  Local factories have been rehabilitated to produce hoes; however, hoe quality has been poor due to lack of dies and a kiln (procurement of new equipment has been delayed). Despite insufficient TA staff housing, an over-burdened TA team leader, and failure to create an MCM planning unit (as targeted) or to make headway in some transportation efforts (due to inadequate vehicle maintenance and management), the TA component has provided 105 person-months of TA, introducing a variety of improvements in transport and materials management, program administration, banking, sales management, etc. Detailed recommendations are given.","Attached to PD-AAQ-096","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","4/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural inputs|Agricultural cooperatives|Institution building|Beneficiary count|Beneficiary interviews","Uganda","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAQ096A.pdf","4,252 KB","008618 - USAID.

"The key problem facing Peruvian agriculture is that of realizing more effective use of land and water resources.  To this end, A.I.D.'s Improved Land and Water Use in the Sierra project (1976-83), called Plan MERIS after its Spanish acronym, included construction of irrigation and drainage works, investment credit for on-farm land development, complementary tree plantings, technical assistance, and training. Although Plan MERIS did not reach its numerical goals for construction, beneficiaries reached, or total irrigated hectares (despite a 2-year project extension), all farmers, large and small, now have greater access to a reliable water supply.  The infrastructure built under the project appears to be well designed and was constructed at a relatively low cost.  However, for the most part neither credit nor technical assistance have reached the small farmers who were to be Plan MERIS's primary beneficiaries; in fact, the credit component has reached less than 1% of beneficiaries overall.  Implementation shortfalls were largely due to the Government of Peru's budgetary difficulties; in this connection, revenues for future maintenance of the irrigation systems are not assured.  The project's forestry component appears to be progressing adequately, although community awareness of the benefits of such activities is lacking. On the whole, the Plan MERIS model is well-suited to small farm conditions in much of the developing world.  However, it must be recognized that the primary purpose of such a project is to provide technical assistance and services based on an assured source of water for irrigation, not to provide irrigation works supplemented by technical assistance.  Other implications of the Plan MERIS experience are:  (1) beneficiaries should be involved in project activities from the early stages; (2) production credit and especially technical assistance must accompany investment credit; (3) financing should be ensured from the start, even if A.I.D. must shoulder the burden; and (4) in irrigation projects, land ownership patterns must be clearly understood and a realistic time period allotted for implementation.","Loan no. 527-T-059","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","12/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Land use|Irrigation|Agricultural credit|Small farms|Agricultural water management|Beneficiary count","Peru","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAL040.pdf","3,958 KB","000156 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to improve rural public education in Bolivia. Special evaluation covers the period 8/77-11/84 and is based on document review and interviews with (and in some cases, questionnaire surveys of) contractor, Ministry of Education and Culture (MEC), and rural normal school personnel, and with students. Although the project has suffered from Bolivia's political and social instability and economic chaos, including extensive personnel turnover and crippling strikes, some progress has been made.  Teacher training has been perhaps the most successful component:  61 people were trained in Colombia, including 13 Institute of Rural Higher Education (ISER) professors and 6 5-member mobile teams; hundreds of normal school teachers were trained at ISER; and thousands of primary school teachers have received inservice training in summer and winter sessions and by mobile teams (the latter hampered by serious transportation difficulties).  It is not clear whether inservice training in general has been in tune with the realities of rural life or closely related to the rural primary school curriculum. Much curriculum development work for the normal schools and ISER has been done and redone in cooperation with other projects and MEC agencies, but teachers and authorities feel that the curriculum is still not preparing teachers to help in rural development, nor does it appear to be based on a well-defined primary school curriculum. The materials development component has produced at least 50 documents which have been used in teacher training, but have not yet been distributed - plans for ISER to become a materials production center have been delayed by late arrival of an offset printer (which is still not operational).  Audiovisual equipment (projectors and VCR's) have been supplied to normal schools, but without accompanying cassettes, transparencies, etc; nor has training in using the equipment been provided.  The very appropriateness of such equipment in the normal schools, many of which lack adequate blackboards, is questionable. In the administration component, several seminars and courses have been conducted for principals and supervisors, although little effect has been observed in actual administration at ISER and rural normal schools, or at the national level.","Loan no. 511-V-057|Evaluation period: 29 Oct-30 Nov 1984|Evaluation summary: PD-AAS-756","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","11/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Rural areas|Teacher education|Teachers' colleges|Teacher training|Primary education|Curriculum design|Educational materials|Educational administration|Beneficiary count|Beneficiary interviews|Sampling method","Bolivia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAQ168.pdf","3,607 KB","004011 - University of New Mexico.

"Presents final Mission report (9/78-9/84) on a project to increase contraceptive use in Morocco. The project doubled contraceptive prevalance as planned, induced the Ministry of Public Health (MOPH) to include FP as a basic health service, and effected a remarkable change in political attitudes: Moroccan leaders are more aware of linkages between population and development, the Government of Morocco (GOM) openly supports FP programs, and FP appears as a GOM budget line item for the first time in FY 85. Except for commercial distribution, which the GOM did not support, all outputs were achieved.  The project:  completed the household distribution (VDMS) program in Marrakech Province in 1980 and expanded it to 11 other provinces (with in-home FP services and paramedicalization, 40% of the population in these provinces have regular access to FP services); built and equipped 7 of 10 planned FP referral centers; made oral contraceptives and condoms available at 1,200 MOPH facilities nationwide, at the household level in all VDMS provinces, and in 35 factory workplaces near Casablanca; conducted national fertility and contraceptive prevalence surveys; produced a RAPID computer package; and operationalized a certified National Training Center for Reproductive Health (an important addition to the project), which has averaged 100 voluntary sterilizations monthly and conducted training for all levels of medical personnel.  Project trainees included:  800 nurses to practice IUD insertion; 35 nurses and social workers to promote FP in the 35 factories; 100 youth exposed to FP in 2 seminars; 100 women FP motivators; 50 journalists in a seminar on FP in the Arab world; and 30 Ministry of Education Inspector Generals in a 4-day workshop.  In all, 2,000 field workers/motivators have been trained.  Promotion has included weekly radio broadcasts, 2 pro-FP songs, 50 newspaper articles, 3 regional FP exhibits, a GOM seminar on FP and development, a television commercial, and an MOPH FP symbol. Key lessons learned were that FP activities can be promoted without a host government population policy and that USAID/M was wise not to pressure the GOM into formalizing one.  The grafting of the project onto an existing health/FP structure ensures its replicability.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","10/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Family planning services|Household based delivery|Contraceptive distribution|Clinic-based contraceptive distribution|Family planning education|Family planning promotion programs|Population policy|Behavior change|Beneficiary count","Morocco","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAQ170.pdf","166 KB","008579 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to support agricultural mechanization in Egypt. Special evaluation covers the period 9/79-7/84 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with USAID/E, Government of Egypt Ministry of Agriculture (MOA), bank, and other project-related personnel and with farmers. After a slow start due to an overly ambitious design and lack of basic research data on mechanization, project progress has accelerated. The planning and evaluation subproject (SP) has: conducted 5 surveys; prepared 22 technical reports; trained counterparts in data collection and analysis; and established a small computer hardware unit.  The soil improvement SP should complete precision land leveling of 1,000 feddans in late 1984. The machinery management extension SP has:  trained 12,868 farmers and MOA staff in 1,382 demonstrations and short courses, 51 mechanization extensionists, 4 MOA staff in M.Sc. programs, and 68 MOA staff and farmers in short-term overseas courses; produced 10,000 posters, 20,000 extension folders, 18 television programs, 15,000 slides, and 20 video tapes; and provided TA to equipment loan recipients.  The service center development SP has provided credit to 6 private service centers and 23 workshops and assisted some 10,000 farmers in replacing the animal-drawn sakia with motor-driven pumps. The research and development SP has: funded 9 research grants; tested and modified machinery; developed a prototype thresher; and provided in-country training. Although the project expects to raise farm production and income by reaching about 25,000 farmers directly through extension and training and over 24,000 indirectly through its loan funds, it has not become the nexus for Egypt's mechanization efforts as was expected due to funding limitations and the involvement of other institutions. Lessons learned include to design more flexibility and start-up time into implementation plans and ensure that basic research data are available prior to implementation.  Key recommendations are to:  extend selected activities; improve organizational management capabilites; clarify institutional responsibilities; expedite customs clearance; emphasize soil analysis; and simplify loan procedures.

"Evaluates irrigation and water management (IWM) component of a project to increase the ability of agricultural research in Bangladesh to develop small-farm technologies. External evaluation covers the period to 7/84 and is based on site visits and interviews with Bangladesh Agricultural Research Council (BARC), International Agricultural Development Service (IADS), and other project personnel. Six of the 10 ongoing research projects appear to deal only marginally with IWM research issues, a situation which reflects the newness of IWM research in Bangladesh.  Specific problems include:  the difficulty of identifying BARC and IADS counterparts; the shortage of social scientists in command area development research; extreme delays in releasing funds for contract research; BARC's lack of engineering personnel; the exclusion from the contract of vehicles and manufactured equipment originating outside Bangladesh; and underbudgeting for commodities.  The proposed split of the IWM specialist's time between BARC and the Bangladesh Agricultural Research Institute seems counterproductive. Overseas degree and non-degree training is proceeding apace, with 12 persons currently receiving M.Sc. and 1 person Ph.D. training and with 12 others participating in non-degree programs in 1983. The mix of disciplines seems appropriate to the IWM program.  The proposed use of in-country training funds for additional overseas degree training also seems sound, provided trainees pursue relevant specialties; these include Ph.D.'s in the economics of water resources and in irrigation engineering (with an emphasis on on-farm water management and tubewell irrigation systems) and an M.Sc. in well design and development techniques.  In-country training has included two short courses on diagnostic analysis and two workshops in IWM priorities and issues; the plan to hold 24 6-week courses over a 2-year period has not been realized, however, and there have been no participants in the sabbatical leave program for the IWM area - mainly because few can meet the requirement of 7 years' previous experience. On the whole, the IWM program, together with the efforts of other donors, has great potential, some of it already realized, (e.g., BARC's 1983 publication on IWM research priorities) to upgrade in-country research capabilities.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","7/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural research|Water management|Irrigation|Appropriate technology","Bangladesh","","","000655 - International Agricultural Development Service|001067 - Bangladesh Agricultural Research Council (BARC)","","008511 - USAID.

"A synthesis and a critique of seven studies examining various aspects of Egypt's small-scale enterprise sector are presented.  Major findings of the studies are that:  Egypt's Law 43 has spurred development of large-scale private and mixed enterprises, but not of small and very small enterprises; the latter-type enterprises are characterized by relatively localized marketing, low levels of fixed and working capital, and heavy reliance upon skilled labor; and expansion of these enterprises would be facilitated by relaxed regulation, the provision of credit available through mechanisms geared specifically to their needs, the development of labor training schemes, and more stable supplies of raw materials at more equitable prices. Negatively, the studies fail to specify:  the prospects of the small-scale sector and of its subsectors in relation to the large-scale sector; the difference between production in the formal and the very large informal small-scale sector; and the important social role played by the informal small-scale sector in providing subsistence labor on a wide scale.  Areas of additional study to remedy these lacunae are suggested.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","NEB-150-O-4103-00","","10/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Small scale enterprises|Manufactured products|Private sector","Egypt","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAR514.pdf","1,179 KB","000133 - USAID.

"Provides final Mission report (1979-83) on a project to expand both commercial and subsistence horticultural crop production in Botswana. Considerable progress was made toward meeting the needs of small-scale commercial and subsistence horticultural growers and in strengthening the Ministry of Agriculture's (MOA) capabilities in horticultural research.  The MOA's Horticultural Research Unit carried out varietal trials on six major crops as well as comparisons of irrigation techniques and cultural practices.  In addition, targets for counterpart, on-the-job, and inservice training were exceeded in most cases and extension support was provided to a variety of groups, including privately owned production units, small vegetable growers, primary and secondary schools, hospitals/clinics, and 4-B clubs. The project was less successful in working with Community Development Associations (CDA's), largely as a result of the CDA's lack of management capability.  While institutional linkages were developed between the GOB and CDA's, this area was deemphasized due to these management deficits. Experience shows that the project should have:  more realistically assessed CDA capacity at the outset; placed more emphasis on collecting and analyzing data on the feasibility and economics of horticulture in Botswana; and paid more attention to counterparts' prior level of training (replacement of project technicians with trained staff was impossible in some cases) and to the availability of a continous supply of inputs.  Also: access to a ready market for crops produced is vital; attention to crop production for domestic consumption in gardens around the home using waste water may have been warranted; the project's time frame seems to have been extremely short; and a no-cost extension (which had been requested by the grantee but denied by A.I.D.) would have allowed staff a few more months in which to achieve project purposes.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Horticulture|Crop production|Agricultural extension|Agricultural research|Limited data","Botswana","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAQ320.pdf","106 KB","001924 - International Voluntary Services, Inc.","","008516 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to strengthen the capabilities of Peru's National Office of Natural Resource Evaluation (ONERN) to inventory and evaluate natural resources.  Special evaluation covers the period 9/80-7/84 and is based on document review and interviews with staff of ONERN, USAID/P, and the Environmental Research Institute of Michigan (ERIM). The project has successfully provided ONERN with an automated geographic information service (GIS).  The GIS was tested at field sites and through preparation of a countrywide environmental profile.  As a result of TA and on-the-job training provided by ERIM, a cadre of ONERN staff is now capable of providing in-house training in GIS operation and in imagery analysis, remote sensing, and cartography. However, implementation did not always proceed as planned.  The objective of installing a GIS became, as delays and problems intervened, almost the exclusive project activity.  The contract failed to provide the detailed guidance contained in the project paper and a disjointedness in project activities resulted in a lack of preparation - evident in GIS demonstrations - in the skills and logic of a manual GIS, thematic mapping, and environmental assessment.  ONERN efficiency could be enhanced by consolidating related service functions and possibly by allowing interaction between disciplinary teams. It is recommended that A.I.D. provide follow-on TA and training support to ensure that the practical applications envisioned in the project paper are achieved.  Specific needs are, inter alia: (1) long-term training of three ONERN staff (in ecology, geomorphology, and economic geography) and short-term training in GIS operations and maintenance; (2) a comprehensive maintenance program for all equipment vital to the GIS; (3) funds to hire two additional staff in GIS operations and maintenance; (4) long-term (12 months) TA in GIS applications; and (5) short-term advisors to design a regional/national data base structure and a thematic map legend compatible with the GIS and Peruvian conditions, and to develop software enabling ONERN to use data from the Brazilian LANDSAT station.","Attached to PD-AAQ-334","Special Evaluation","Documents","527-0202-C-00-2014-00","","11/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Land use|Remote sensing|Geological surveys|Geological maps|Satellites|Natural resource inventories","Peru","","","001135 - Tippetts-Abbett-McCarthy-Stratton","","008591 - USAID.

"Evaluates subproject to help the Center for Population Policy and Development Studies (CEPPD) coordinate research and information awareness activities concerning the socioeconomic implications of Brazilian population growth.  Special evaluation covers the period 3/84-11/84 and is based on interviews with CEPPD, USAID/B, and Brazilian officials. The project is proceeding well, although some activities are behind schedule.  Despite initial delays (in, e.g., securing statistical data and appropriate software), population projections have now been completed for seven geographical regions of Brazil and distributed to a distinguished group of scientists and doctors who have been commissioned to write technical papers on the projections and their socioeconomic implications.  Of 42 papers planned, 31 have been commissioned and are expected to be complete by 11/84; the remaining 11 are expected to be commissioned and completed by 1/85, although there has been some difficulty in identifying researchers willing to write on politically sensitive family planning themes.  Also, lack of data on internal migration has made population projection in this area difficult. A successful meeting (with extensive media coverage) was held in Brasilia in 9/84 to promote federal parliamentarians' interest in population policy formulation and a second meeting is planned for 12/84. Plans for a state-level symposium, to be held 2/85, are well underway. There have been some problems in scheduling meetings, due mostly to conflicts with parliamentarians' political agenda.  Two newsletters have been written and the newsletter mailing list has been revised. Recommendations are that:  (1) TA be provided to help the project utilize findings from state contraceptive prevalence surveys; (2) a microcomputer and appropriate software be acquired to assist in population projections and facilitate development of population models for presentations at meetings and symposia; and (3) representatives of U.S. donor agencies not attend future parliamentarian meetings, in order to avoid the appearance of U.S. interference in these high-level political gatherings.","Project title: Population technical assistance (POPTECH)","Special Evaluation","Documents","DPE-3024-C-00-4063-00","","10/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Population growth|Population impact|Population forecasting|Population economics|Population planning|Population policy|Information dissemination|Limited data","Brazil","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAQ341.pdf","262 KB","000673 - International Science and Technology Institute, Inc.

"Evaluates project to provide foreign exchange (FX) imports and short-term credit to Egypt's private sector and to upgrade Egypt's credit system.  Special evaluation covers the period 8/82-12/84 and is based on document review and interviews with host government, bank, private sector, and USAID/E personnel. Although project goals were overly ambitious, FX inputs were successfully provided to private industries that use these efficiently. The project expanded on a previous Commodity Import Program (CIP) credit effort by including 4 private banks as well as Egypt's 5 public banks and by creating a demand-based system ($3m in project funds were allocated to each bank and the remainder distributed to banks able to move their funds), thus encouraging competition and rewarding efficiency.  Private banks' share of transactions was smaller than had been hoped, but their rate of participation did reflect their fair share of the banking market. As of 12/9/84, transactions worth $54m (80% of the program) had been approved and $37m (55%) issued in credit; all funds should be allocated by 2/85 and disbursed by 10/85 (vs. a goal of 3/85). To diffuse funds among a wide range of companies, transactions were limited to $500,000 (8 exceptions occurred) and total imports per firm to $1m/year.  The development value of only 3 or 4 (vs. a total of 288) transactions was questioned, and as 68% of transactions were with end users, the trader windfalls which occurred under the CIP have been virtually eliminated. The project was less successful in providing short- and medium-term credit.  Project interest rates (22-28%) were positive, given a 20% inflation rate, but very few participating importers used project financing, mostly because of a Maintenance of Value provision which could lead to serious borrower losses at loan maturity if the Egyptian pound is devalued. The planned Private Sector Steering Committee, which was to provide a forum for policy dialogue, was not activated, nor were institutional development activities (training, TA, studies) implemented. The major recommendation is to restructure the project's credit component so as to provide Egyptian banks with greater incentives for long-term lending (the prevailing interest rate structure sets short-term rates far higher than long-term rates).","Related document: PD-AAQ-585","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","12/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Commercial credit|Short term credit|Private sector|Imports|Foreign exchange|Banks|Beneficiary interviews","Egypt","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAQ344.pdf","2,950 KB","","","008539 - USAID.

"Provides final Mission report (1976-12/83) on a project to support Mali's Action Riz-Sorgho (ARS) program to increase grain production in the Gao area. Although its objectives were not achievable in the five (orginally programmed) or seven (actual) years of implementation, the project has successfully developed the infrastructure needed to increase grain production.  A dike and canal system constructed along the Niger River, and servicing 2,383 ha, has prevented flood waters from drowning rice crops; screens have been installed at the flood control gates to keep out fish that feed on rice seedlings.  Also, the gates have been constructed to retain enough water to allow the soil to absorb moisture for the sorghum crop.  Actual impact on grain production is unknown, however, as available statistics are of dubious quality. ARS has provided credit and extension services to about 6,500 farmers.  The credit program's sales of rice seed, which are repaid in kind plus interest, have had an improved rate of repayment, but further improvements are needed to fully serve the ARS market and to avoid stock depletion in case of disaster. Sales of plows and rentals of irrigation pumps to farmers and sales of mopeds to extension agents have been made on a limited basis and have for the most part been successful.  A.I.D. support of the credit program was suspended due to lack of internal controls and standardized procedures; these problems have been corrected and the program will be implemented again by ARS during the 1984 season. Substantial improvements have been made in ARS ability to manage the project.  A new accounting system which was introduced in 1982 has helped to ease the longstanding cash flow problem. However, the lack of experienced accounting personnel and water management specialists may constrain future growth.  A research station was developed near Gao, but its activities were limited due to lack of pumps and cash at critical times. A.I.D.'s decision to terminate the ARS project was made primarily because of the remoteness of the Gao area (15 hours by car) and the shrinking availability of USAID/M staff to adequately monitor the project.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","4/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Sorghum|Rice|Crop production|Flood control|Check structures|Canals|Agricultural credit|Beneficiary count|Limited data","Mali","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAQ356.pdf","406 KB","008575 - USAID.

"Evaluates Phase II of a project conducted by the Community Development Foundation (CDF), to provide technical and material assistance to self-help development efforts by local community groups in the West Bank/Gaza Strip.  Special evaluation covers the period 7/81-9/84; no methodology is noted. CDF has responded positively to recommendations made in the 1980 evaluation of Phase I, especially in regard to improving sector-specific planning and in-house expertise in agriculture and health, and tightening programming in priority sectors, and is currently the strongest AID-funded PVO operating in the region.  During Phase II, CDF has successfully implemented 48 community-level development subprojects (SP's) in the region, primarily in water resources and agricultural inputs, areas of importance in the region and in which CDF is strong, as well as in health and education; 36 other SP's are in the process of implementation, while 16 either were not approved or are awaiting Government of Israel clearance.  The SP's - especially in the domestic water sector - have met important needs for a large number of communities and individuals and have done much to offset negative Palestinian attitudes towards the United States. On the other hand, CDF has unfortunately downplayed economic development activities, especially work with cooperatives, because such activity was not targeted in the Phase II proposal and is believed by CDF to be the responsibility of American Near East Refugee Aid. General recommendations are that CDF continue to sharpen its sectoral strategy papers, develop such a paper for the Gaza area, and present some of its future proposals as sector-specific rather than as included under a generalized community development rubric.  A specific recommendation is that CDF explore possibilities in the area of agricultural extension to help offset official actions such as the closing down of two local agricultural research institutions and the blocking of the creation of a faculty of agriculture.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","NEB-0166-G-SS-1057-00","","9/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Rural development|Community development|Community self help|Water supply|Sanitation|Public health care|Agricultural development|Private voluntary organizations|Limited data plus","West Bank|Gaza Strip","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAQ369.pdf","679 KB","001647 - Save the Children.

"Evaluates project to provide preschool education to Palestinian children in the West Bank and Gaza.  Special evaluation covers the period 1979-9/84 and is based on classroom visits and interviews with Holy Land Christian Mission International (HLCMI) personnel, teachers, and mothers of children enrolled. Demand for HLCMI's two programs, the 35-week Preschool Education Program (PEP) for 5-year-olds and the complementary 26-week Mothers In-Home Program (MIHP) for 4-year-olds, greatly exceeds current capacity; since 1979, 2,115 children have attended PEP classes and 1,840 mother-child units have completed the MIHP. Conducted in six West Bank refugee camps and at an HLCMI school in Bethlehem, both programs have been well received by parents and teachers, and participating children have shown a significant head start in elementary school.  One concern is the impact these programs will have on the elementary school curriculum; first grade teachers have noted the need to provide PEP graduates with more advanced materials.  The kindergarten curriculum, which has been developed and field tested with project support, will be finalized and printed in 1984-5 and disseminated to all interested potential users. HLCMI's highly structured, developmental approach to kindergarten is successful despite teachers' lack of formal training in preschool education (some inservice training has been provided). Teachers and aides have been rated adequate to excellent, although further refinement is needed in test administration. Classroom facilities are adequate. In addition to the West Bank program, the project has provided support (through HLCMI) to the United Nations Relief Workers' Agency (UNWRA) for similar preschool activities in Gaza (the MIHP is in fact based on an earlier Gaza program). Recommendations are that HLCMI:  (1) initiate workshops with other West Bank and Gaza preschool programs prior to finalizing the PEP/MIHP curriculum, particularly to increase its relevance to the Palestinian setting; (2) examine the potential benefits of enrolling teachers in training programs available in the region; (3) develop MIHP enrollment criteria, according priority to the socially and economically disadvantaged; and (4) seek help from UNWRA to arrange inservice training for MIHP teachers.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","NEB-0171-G-SS-2068-00","","9/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Private voluntary organizations|Preschool education|Educational innovations|Beneficiary count|Beneficiary interviews|Limited data plus","West Bank|Gaza Strip","","","003356 - Holy Land Christian Mission International","","000894 - USAID.

"Evaluates rural development projects I and II in West Bank and Gaza villages.  Special evaluation covers the period 8/75-9/84 and is based on site visits. With the first project completed and the second underway, Catholic Relief Services (CRS) has completed 82 of 96 village subprojects, promoting the self-help construction of interior and access roads, public buildings such as schools, clinics, and community centers, and water and electricity systems.  Almost 200,000 villagers have benefitted, including about one fourth of the rural population in the West Bank, where most of the activities are located.  The subprojects have proved cost-effective and responsive to villagers' needs. It is recommended that CRS:  continue these types of activities, and expand them in Gaza, where the need is greatest; establish a full office in Gaza governing rural development and related CRS projects in health education and for the handicapped; and revise its development strategy to acknowledge worsened economic conditions by including non-construction activities.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","9/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Private voluntary organizations|Rural development|Community self help|Villages|Beneficiary count|Limited data","West Bank|Gaza Strip","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAQ370.pdf","904 KB","007337 - Catholic Relief Services (CRS)","","000894 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to provide credit and TA to small businesses in the Dominican Republic.  Special evaluation covers the period 4/83-5/84 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with loan recipients and financial intermediaries (FI's), and with USAID/DR, Small Business Assistance Center (CAPE), Central Bank Economic Development Investment Fund (FIDE), and Technical Assistance Center (TAC) personnel. Despite an uncertain economy and overly-ambitious targets, the project has made some progress.  CAPE has successfully been established within FIDE and has assisted in the creation of 7 TAC's.  CAPE has promoted the TAC's (and the program) to communities and FI's, has helped the TAC's to devise operational plans, and has provided short-term, in- and third-country training to TAC staff (e.g., in small business assistance). Small businesses have generally been satisfied with the assistance they have received from the TAC's (e.g., bookkeeping training). However, CAPE has had serious difficulties in achieving planned loan disbursements, especially through the TAC's.  Of 32 loans made by CAPE through FI's, only 10 were initiated through TAC's (although there are 88 potential TAC loans in the pipeline); also, 68% of all loans made through FI's were medium and large, only 4% were small.  Most TAC loans were mid-size as well.  FI's reluctance to use TAC services has been due to inadequate promotion and to an overly complex and lengthy (6-8 week) credit process (the latter has especially hampered FI small loan disbursement).  With TAC loan activity at a near standstill, the center's income self-sufficiency targets are not being met. Other problems have included:  lack of a CAPE operational plan and failure to continue CAPE progress reports or perform a self-evaluation (some TAC operational plans and self-evaluations have been inadequate); a diversion of CAPE staff from their TAC-related duties due to a general FIDE staff shortage; inadequate TAC loan analysis training; and failure of the CAPE loan approval process to differentiate between varying loan and business sizes. Twenty-nine recommendations are included.","Attached to PD-AAQ-376","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","517-0150-C-00-3018-00","","6/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Small scale enterprises|Commercial credit|Loans|Beneficiary interviews","Dominican Republic","","","000436 - Development Associates, Inc.","","004030 - Central Bank of the Dominican Republic.

"Evaluates project to help communities to construct small rural infrastructure in Indonesia.  Special impact evaluation examines 21 of the 2,735 subprojects (SP's) implemented between Indonesian fiscal years 1979-83 and is based on document review and interviews with project personnel, government officials, villagers, and workers. The degree of success has varied by type of infrastructure.  Road SP's have been most successful in providing employment to marginal farmers and landless laborers (who used the additional income to improve their homes and/or farms) as well as longer-lived social and economic improvements - increased agricultural production and income and access to urban areas. The quality of life improved dramatically at all 13 road SP's visited.  However, even though communities do maintain to some extent the roads they have built, responsibility and funding for major maintenance that exceeds community resources has not been defined. Irrigation and flood control SP's have likewise boosted agricultural production, farmer income, and socioeconomic conditions, but have faced similar problems regarding system maintenance.  Flood control SP's, however, in increasing the market value of land, have led to competition among large farmers, while small farmers have been pushed away. Other SP's have been less successful.  A rice terracing SP led to relatively small yield increases, due to a failure to introduce drought-resistant crop varieties.  A fish pond canal SP benefited fish pond owners (who, however, are few in number and live away from the pond sites), but reduced farm production due to inundation of agricultural areas by seawater.  Finally, an SP to construct a water reservoir for dry season irrigation was not technically sound; the reservoir constructed usually collapses during the rainy season.  In projects of this type, construction should be professionally performed.","Loan no. 497-T-056|Executive summary : PD-AAQ-974","Special Evaluation","Documents","497-0285-C-00-3053-00","","3/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Rural areas|Road construction|Irrigation system construction|Community participation|Flood control|Fish pond construction|Terracing|Reservoirs|Beneficiary interviews|Limited data plus","Indonesia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAQ384.pdf","31,663 KB","004034 - Indonesia.

"Evaluates project to help the Government of Peru (GOP) develop a national soil and water conservation system.  Special evaluation covers the period 7/83-11/84 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews primarily with USAID/P and GOP staff. The project has made substantial progress, meeting or surpassing most of its training and extension targets.  A total of 4,504 farmers have received farm conservation training (728 so far in 1984, vs. a targeted 500); 408 professionals (40 in 1984) and 394 paraprofessionals have been trained in conservation extension. Also, the director of the Directorate General of Water, Soils, and Irrigation is set to tour U.S. and Guatemalan conservation sites. Conservation extension activities have included:  establishing 382 on-farm test sites in 1984 (with 116 in the pilot area of Cajamarca) for a project total of 2,529, and 12 farmer committees with an outreach to 3,500 farmers in 3 agrarian regions; collecting/evaluating technical and socioeconomic data from 1,164 test sites; producing and distributing 2,000 posters (on terracing), 8,000 pamphlets (promoting the national program), and 2,000 bulletins on gully control (7 bulletins on other topics are being developed); airing radio and television programs in Cajamarca, Huancayo, Cusco, and Puno (other radio programs, some in the Quechua, and Aymara languages, are ready for airing); and drafting a much-needed manual for technicians and cooperating institutions. Progress towards developing a national conservation program has been much slower.  However, interinstitutional coordination has been strengthened with the agreement by 20 institutions (e.g., the Agricultural and Forestry Research and Extension Centers) to establish soil conservation test plots (only 43 plots have thus far been set up); by establishment of ad hoc soil conservation committees in several agrarian regions; and by conducting 3 regional meetings.  Also, a draft proposal for a national soil/water conservation program will be discussed at the scheduled 11/84 convention of public agricultural agencies.  The recent extension of limited project activities to the Costa is also a positive step toward a national system. Recommendations include to extend the project for 18 months.","Attached to PD-AAQ-400","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","11/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Soil conservation|Water conservation|Environmental education|Environmental research|Agricultural extension|Agricultural training|Agricultural extension training|Farmer training|National level|Beneficiary count","Peru","","","008591 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to combat diarrheal disease among Pakistani children under age 5 through the use of oral rehydration salts (ORS). Special evaluation covers the period 1/83-4/84 and is based on visits to urban and rural health facilities and interviews with pharmaceutical, media, and marketing professionals; Government of Pakistan (GOP) and private health care providers; and consumers. The availability of ORS packets in Pakistan is impressively high; 5 pharmaceutical companies produce ORS, and GOP supplies have increased from 5 million packets at project inception to a proposed 17 million for 1984.  However, only 38.3% of mothers have heard of oral rehydration therapy (ORT) and only 10% have used it.  Major constraints limiting ORS use are the lack of a full-time ORT manager, limited promotional and public education efforts, especially in rural areas (although relevant materials are now being developed), and the inadequacy of the existing epidemiological surveillance system.  Other constraints include: underuse of the existing and impressive GOP training infrastructure and (by the public) of GOP health facilities; the difficulties of recruiting female medical technicians and of contact between the latter and female community health workers working in villages; insufficient support from doctors, who continue to prescribe ineffective drugs to combat diarrhea, and from traditional healers; lack of standard instructions on how to mix and administer ORS (currently, the GOP and the pharmaceutical companies are producing, respectively, 0.5 and 1.0 liter packets of ORS); and the uncertain quality of the ORS being produced. It is recommended that the GOP appoint a full-time, national ORT program manager (and a Pakistani counterpart if the manager is expatriate) as well as provincial and district supervisors; initiate a privately-marketed multimedia campaign to promote ORS use; conduct research on promoting the complementary use of home salt/sugar solutions; and improve surveillance (by restructuring and standardizing the system, upgrading reporting, etc.).  Other recommendations addressing the other problems noted above include stressing the actual rehydration of children during training of health personnel.","Evaluation period: 29 Apr-20 May 1984","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/DPE-5927-C-00-3083-00","","5/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Oral rehydration therapy|Diarrhea|Child health care|Epidemiology|Health education|Urban areas|Rural areas|Private health care|Public health care|Beneficiary interviews","Pakistan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAQ392.pdf","13,596 KB","000750 - Management Sciences for Health (MSH)","","000186 - USAID.

"Evaluates subproject to institutionalize a capacity in the Dominican Development Foundation (FDD) to provide credit and TA to small informal urban businesses in the Dominican Republic. Special evaluation covers the period 1981-84 and is based on document review and interviews with officials from FDD, the contractor, AID/W, USAID/DR, and U.S. and Dominican institutions, and with clients. FDD has extended assistance to 247 small enterprises, created 370 new and strengthened 2,240 other jobs, and had 14,880 indirect beneficiaries, versus respective targets of 250, 500, 1,860, and 12,660. Credit and TA characterized by self-help and group collaboration has reached over 350 ""solidarity groups"" of the smallest entrepreneurs, 87% of whom are street vendors. Management and TA to microentrepreneurs has helped increase their monthly sales by some 20% and the number of full-time workers by 1.5 employees per enterprise; clients have asked for more training in accounting, marketing, and product design. Unexpected program effects were the formation of two autonomous associations to help microentrepreneurs.  Effective TA was provided to the FDD as well as to beneficiaries by a resident advisor from ACCION/AITEC, although project experience makes the wisdom of full institution-building TA questionable. Several factors have hampered FDD's lending.  Funding arrived in tranches and did not always correspond to needs, slowing credit approval.  Dominican economic problems created difficulties for FDD and businesses (in fact, no new loans are going out at this time; efforts are being focused on existing loans and their required follow-up assistance). Structural deficiencies reducing FDD's cost-effectiveness and flexibility included centralized decisionmaking; weak intra-FDD communication; lack of differentiation between fixed capital and working capital loans; lack of a shortened approval process for follow-up loans; and a disbursal method which limited clients' use of loan funds.  FDD abandoned the advisor's monitoring/reporting system after his departure and compiles no regular data on its portfolio status or cost-effectiveness.  Finally, women as a group were not addressed in the project design and have had limited access to credit. Recommendations are included.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","DAN-5317-C-00-3085-00","","11/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Microenterprises|Private enterprises|Entrepreneurs|Commercial credit|Technical assistance|Urban areas|Beneficiary count|Beneficiary interviews","Dominican Republic","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAQ405.pdf","1,438 KB","002120 - Partnership for Productivity International","","008537 - USAID.

"Evaluates management of A.I.D.'s disaster aid in response to extreme flood and drought conditions in Ecuador, Bolivia, and Peru following El Nino in 1983.  Special evaluation covers the period Spring 1983-Summer 1984 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with personnel of USAID's, host country agencies, and other active relief agencies. Overall, USAID's quickly and efficiently established very relevant disaster programs under extremely adverse conditions. Emergency relief through the U.S. Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance was praised by Missions and government officials in all three countries.  Food assistance met both relief and recovery needs despite numerous problems and wide variation in the capacity of cooperating organizations. Emergency Title II and III aid in Bolivia, which ended in 7/84, achieved price stabilization in urban areas despite poor host country management and helped avert rural malnutrition and outmigration; targeted rice sales were particularly impressive.  Emergency Title I and II projects in Peru, expected to end in early 1985, have had like results. Disaster recovery projects in the 3 countries have varied in structure and implementation.  In Bolivia, implementation has resembled the traditional project approach, but due to Bolivia's economic and political troubles and attendant bureaucratic inefficiency, USAID/B played a larger role than usual (despite its own personnel and funding constraints).  Some activities are behind schedule, but the project may be completed on time in 12/85.  USAID/Peru has funded activities chosen by a Government of Peru coordinating agency, which has been strengthened in the process.  As 15 of Peru's 17 affected departments are receiving assistance, organizing the project has taken some time (86 subprojects are involved), and funding has been piecemeal; nevertheless, completion in 7/86 is anticipated.  Disaster recovery in Ecuador consists primarily of infrastructure rehabilitation, which is ahead of schedule despite technical and transportation problems, and a loan to import agricultural inputs, which has begun just recently. Eighteen recommendations address disaster preparedness and planning, emergency food assistance, and disaster response projects.","Work order no. 10","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-0000-I-10-3082-00","","11/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Disaster management|Disaster response|Disaster recovery|Disaster relief","Peru|Ecuador|Bolivia|Andean region","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAR621.pdf","1,377 KB","000356 - Checchi and Co.

"Evaluates Catholic Relief Services (CRS) P.L. 480 Title II Food for Work (FFW) program in India.  Special evaluation covers the period to 3/84 and consists of a review of six asset studies and five recipient profile studies conducted by USAID/I and CRS to measure the program's impact. The asset studies show that FFW operations have had a positive impact on rural development.  Major FFW activities (e.g., land leveling, minor irrigation) have led to increases in total cropped area (11%-32% per beneficiary), area irrigated (26%-100% per beneficiary), and the value of agricultural output (40%-131% per beneficiary).  Most of the assets built under the CRS/FFW program are individual, privately owned agricultural projects and have benefitted small and marginal farmers, who comprise 68% of program beneficiaries.  Diocesan representatives' sincere dedication to the poor, which has effectively excluded the influence of local political interests, has been a positive factor in this regard. The recipient profile studies show that the FFW program is providing employment opportunities to India's truly needy.  The FFW program has provided about 71 days of employment per recipient per year (21% of the average household's annual employment) and increased benficiary household income by over 33%.  Landless agricultural and nonagricultural laborers have constituted 64% of recipients, small and marginal farmers 28%, and small traders/service workers 8%; 78% of all beneficiaries belong to needy groups especially targeted for assistance by the Government of India (GOI).  Nevertheless, average household income still remains below the GOI poverty line. Lessons learned are that:  the survey designs were effective in measuring the program's quantitative, but not its qualitative effects; a monitoring and evaluation system is still needed to analyze program impact; the asset studies did not measure the beneficial impact of non-program factors such as weather and the use of improved varieties; the recipient profile studies failed to determine whether their employment statistics represented a one-time event or a recurrent phenomenon; and weight and height measures of children were not obtained due to inexperienced data collectors and supervisors.","Attached to PD-AAQ-554","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","6/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Food for Peace Title II|Food for Work|Farmers|Small farms|Landless laborers|Employment|Agricultural production|Agricultural income","India","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAQ554A.pdf","2,021 KB","008557 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to reduce malnutrition among preschool children in Zaire's Bandundu region.  Special evaluation covers the period 9/82-11/84 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews (including anonymous questionnaires) with project and nonproject personnel and Government of Zaire (GOZ) officials. Project objectives are overly ambitious, given the difficulty in travel and communications in Bandundu region and a lack of sufficient resources to address malnutrition on the village level, but implementation, at least on the micro-level, is on schedule.  The Food and Nutrition Council of Bandundu (CRANB) has in its first year become a viable working group, funding ten food production subprojects; nutrition surveillance has evolved into widescale data collection; and nutrition education has expanded. However, there is as yet no assurance that any of these activities will affect malnutrition.  Also, the capacity of National Nutrition Planning Center (CEPLANUT) staff in Kinshasa has not been notably strenghtened, and CEPLANUT has no staff development and training plan. A preoccupation with outputs on the part of the senior project advisor has clouded the project focus, led overworked staff to neglect their responsibilities to transfer skills and technical capacity to Zairians, with related injury to Zairian morale. The project has also been handicapped by its separation from the GOZ units with which it must coordinate; e.g., curriculum development has been hampered by inadequate CEPLANUT-Department of Education interaction, while insufficient collaboration in nutrition surveillance by the Ministries of Public Health and Agriculture has led the project to rely on uncertain private data sources. Recommendations are to:  allow Zairians, supported by U.S. staff, to direct project activities; increase the realism and focus of the project purpose, redefining it as both to reduce the prevalence of acute child malnutrition by 25% and to increase CEPLANUT institutional capabilities; cease nutrition surveillance activities which exceed CEPLANUT capabilities; focus nutrition education efforts on supporting CRANB interventions, training health personnel, and refining the draft primary school curriculum; and improve CRANB review procedures to increase the effectiveness of its interventions.","Attached to PD-AAQ-645","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","11/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Child nutrition|Nutrition improvement|Institution building","Congo DR","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAQ645A.pdf","1,167 KB","008626 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to increase Egypt's research, extension, and training capabilities in rice production, seed processing, and storage. Special evaluation covers the period 9/79-10/84 and is based on document review, site visits, and discussions with project staff. Progress has been exceptional in most activities.  Extension has directly helped over 90,000 farmers cultivating 46,500 feddans to produce yields 59% above the national average.  Financially, extension has been most helpful to farmers cultivating less than 1 feddan (1.03 acres).  Registered seed, free from red rice, has been produced for 3 years, and enough of the new certified Giza 173 seed was produced to plant 50% of rice acreage in 1984.  In addition, the project has trained 63 extensionists, 25 national rice advisors, 2 Ph.D. candidates, and 5 persons in postdoctoral and 5 in nondegree studies. However, the entire effort is in danger of unraveling because the National Rice Institute has not been endowed with permanent status (without which there can be no means to assure ongoing research and training capabilities).  The project has also been affected by low rice prices and a lack of timely inputs, as well as, initially, by such typical implementation problems as finding trainees with adequate English skills, providing transportation for extension, clearing commodities through imports, and securing full-time counterparts. In addition to the crucial issue of institutionalization, several other problems must be addressed:  rice mechanization has not progressed well and should focus on one machine (i.e., a thresher) or be eliminated; and additional TA is needed in blast screening and in the installation of laboratory and processing equipment.  Also recommended are greater coordination with other projects and acceleration or expansion of selected project activities. Lessons learned:  (1) provision of permanent status to a new institution (along with its own staff and budget) is essential; (2) typical implementation problems should be realistically addressed in project design; (3) quantifiable targets can help maintain momentum; and (4) high returns are possible from production-oriented research and active extension, especially in a favorable environment.

"Evaluates programs by AID-funded PVO's to provide preschool education in the West Bank and Gaza.  Special evaluation covers an unspecified period and is partially based on a 1983 survey of preschool centers by the Community Development Foundation (CDF). Although approximately 200 programs are currently providing preschool education to an estimated 15,000 children between three and five years of age, the preschools lack official government support, function essentially without professional program guidance, and offer a relatively low-quality educational experience.  Physical faciliites, usually limited to space available in buildings used for other purposes, lack proper lighting and ventiliation.  Educational materials and playground toys are minimal.  Most preschool teachers have received no formal training beyond high school; of the 315 teachers involved with charitable-society sponsored preschools, only 75 have participated in the recently instituted teacher training programs at Bethlehem University and the Red Crescent Center in Hebron. More positively, although most preschools operate without curricula, several PVO's (the Holy Land Christian Mission International, the Jerusalem Union of Charitable Societies, and the Hebron Red Crescent Society) have recently completed or are planning the development of curricula.  CDF has opened a number of preschool resource centers to assist kindergartens in upgrading their curricula, to provide a system of professional program guidance, to loan equipment and materials, and to provide inservice teacher training and assistance.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","9/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Educational development|Preschool education|Private voluntary organizations|Beneficiary count|Limited data","West Bank|Gaza Strip","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAQ670.pdf","136 KB","000133 - USAID.

"Evaluates program content and management of Catholic Relief Services' (CRS) Food for Work (FFW) and Food and Nutrition (FNP) programs in Indonesia.  Special evaluation covers the period to 10/83 and is based on document review and interviews with staff of USAID/T, CRS and its counterpart agencies, and with beneficiaries. CRS and its counterparts lack a national framework for FFW/FNP activities and effective project selection and monitoring systems. Counterpart staffs, although well-trained and motivated, are preoccupied with accountability and logistics at the expense of the more qualitative aspects of planning and management.  CRS's Indonesian headquarters is understaffed, and funding for staff salaries and other management expenses is highly unstable. FFW projects consist mainly of cooperative community labor projects, generally not targeted on the underemployed/unemployed; the remuneration level is very low.  Impacts cannot be determined definitively, due to lack of an adequate data system (a serious problem), but case studies (attached for both FFW and FNP projects) suggest that impacts are favorable; workmanship at the projects is impressive.  Some projects require considerable technical expertise, which is not always readily available. The FNP previously lacked clearly defined goals, but in 4/83 CRS and its counterparts articulated a program (being implemented in 23 pilot centers) which includes recipient commitment, targeting, food distribution, growth surveillance, cadre training and support, nutrition education, income generation, and a plan to graduate children of good nutritional status.  Data inadequacy again precludes impact evaluation; the new program is promising, but will take years to implement in full. It is recommended that a 5-year plan be developed during FY84. Specific proposals include:  creating a national program framework, with uniform management and data systems; correcting the overemphasis on food accountability by focusing on nutrition improvement and simplifying the food accounting system; and maintaining the overall budget through FY89 and recipient levels through FY87.  FFW should target the poor (as both participants and beneficiaries), deemphasizing infrastructure.  FNP purposes should be clarified to give CRS and counterpart staffs a firm concept of expected achievements.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-0000-I-05-3083-00","","6/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Food for Peace Title II|Private voluntary organizations|Food for Work|Management operations|Beneficiary interviews","Indonesia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAQ704.pdf","11,049 KB","000673 - International Science and Technology Institute, Inc.

"Evaluates P.L. 480 Title II program in Senegal.  Special evaluation covers the period to 5/84 and is based on document review; site visits; interviews with personnel of USAID/S, Catholic Relief Services (CRS), and the Ministry of Health's (MOH) Division d'Alimentation et Nutrition de Senegal (DANAS); analysis of data collected from all feeding centers and from nonparticipants; and analysis of growth data for 6,000 children at 20 sample centers. The P.L. 480 food distribution program is inseparable from DANAS's Program de Protection Nutritionelle et Sanitaire-Groupes Vulnerables (PPNS).  Title II food is distributed with CRS assistance in 457 feeding centers, most in MOH dispensaries. Most centers (67%) are located in rural areas, where malnutrition is most acute, yet because of their dependence on MOH infrastructure, are not situated in the poorest communities. Program participants tend to be of lower socioeconomic status than are nonparticipants who know about the program, but of higher status than are nonparticipants who live in PPNS communities but are unaware of the program.  Most children enter the program before age 2, which is best as it is easier to identify malnutrition among the very young. Length of participation in PPNS was associated with higher nutritional status, and for certain vulnerable age groups, with a faster growth rate; however, statistically it is impossible to attribute these effects solely to PPNS.  Mortality rates in the most vulnerable age groups were consistently lower for participants than for nonparticipants of a similar socioeconomic level; this appears related to several factors including food supplementation, nutrition education, and the fact that food distribution clearly encourages center attendance and the use of primary health care.  Participant mothers were more likely to have their children vaccinated against measles and to utilize malaria prophylaxis and postnatal health services. Suggestions are made concerning:  integration of health and nutrition (especially to combat diarrhea, which this study has conclusively related to low nutritional status); targeting to avoid ""aging"" of the recipient population; and further strengthening of the program in the areas of maternal education, growth surveillance, reduction of personnel workload, personnel training, and supervision of child weighing and maternal education.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-0800-C-00-3027-00","","5/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Maternal child health care|Food for Peace Title II|Child nutrition|Infant nutrition|Malnutrition|Sampling method","Senegal","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAQ705.pdf","5,707 KB","000673 - International Science and Technology Institute, Inc.

"Evaluates five PVO projects in the West Bank and Gaza.  Special evaluation covers the period 1975-84 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with officials and staff. The projects have reached about 50% of the people in the West Bank and Gaza, fulfilling their goal of showing U.S. concern for the Palestinian people.  Dedicated and seasoned PVO field personnel - both expatriate and Palestinian - are the major factor in the projects' success, accomplishing seemingly impossible tasks in a tense political environment. Catholic Relief Services (CRS) Rural Development Projects I and II are excellent participatory, community-building programs. Subprojects (roads, water, primary schools, community centers, clinics) were all completed, needed, wanted, used, maintained, and relevant to village needs. The Community Development Fund (CDF) Rural Community Development Project II is the strongest agriculture project and the only one staffed by senior agriculturalists.  CDF has the largest and most diversified water program (rural and urban, drinking water, wastewater disposal) and the only AID-supported preschool program in villages and towns; it aids, inter alia, a blood bank, a school for the mentally retarded, and dental and eye clinics. Holy Land Christian Mission International (HLCMI) operates preschools for 5-yr-old children in refugee camps in the West Bank and Bethlehem, and a Mothers In-Home Program for 4-yr-olds. Both are well received and considered very beneficial, as are similar activities in Gaza. The America Near East Refugee Assistance (ANERA) Project is active in vocational training, agricultural production and cooperatives development, health, and water and sanitation; 71 of 108 subprojects have been completed, 5 are underway, and 32 (most in agriculture or income generation) have been disapproved or tabled by Israel for political or security reasons. The America-Mideast Educational and Training Services (AMIDEAST) Human Resources Development Project has provided U.S. training for 181 faculty in 7 institutions, scholarships for 995 undergraduates at West Bank universities, and short-term U.S. training for 100 persons from the development community, as well as other assistance in the educational sector. Recommendations include to increase assistance, especially in Gaza.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","9/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Private voluntary organizations|Refugees|Community development|Community self help|Beneficiary count","West Bank|Gaza Strip","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAQ715.pdf","1,920 KB","000673 - International Science and Technology Institute, Inc.

"Evaluates multidonor project to support the Caribbean Investment Promotion Service (CIPS), a UN Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) program to provide Caribbean nationals, on a pooled basis, with investment promotion (IP) contacts and training.  Special evaluation covers the period 10/83-9/84; is based on document review, a CIPS meeting in Antigua, and discussions with UNIDO personnel; and is limited to Antigua/Barbuda, St. Kitts/Nevis, Belize, and Dominica, the program's full-time participants. The first year of the program has amply demonstrated its potential value.  IP officers from the four countries have been stationed in New York, where through formal training (a 1-month orientation program) and on-the-job doing, they have learned IP tools and techniques and have begun to get a feel for the U.S. market.  The four officers have attended 10 trade shows and numerous Caribbean Basin Initiative promotional events; compiled sectoral and other lists used in direct mail promotion; prepared IP literature and sent out 2,500 pieces of professionally competent direct mailings; developed country IP strategies and action plans; and made 750 follow-up phone calls to various contacts.  The latter have resulted in 30 personal interviews and 13 serious possibilities for U.S. investment in one or more of the four countries. CIPS suffers from several weaknesses, however.  There is need to: strengthen the officers' home country institutions (which have not always provided adequate support); adopt a more selective approach in order to target the most promising subsectors of the U.S. market; and combat a tendency to rely excessively on computer-power before the fundamentals of IP and entrepreneurial skills have been learned. It is recommended that UNIDO's proposal for the program's second year - which represents a three-fold increase in A.I.D. funding - be approved, except for items regarding software and possibly office rent. Early in FY85, CIPS participants and UNIDO should develop a long-term strategy and action plan, centering on the establishment of an Eastern Caribbean Regional Investment Development Office in the United States, and should aggressively approach potential donors for support.","Related document: PD-ABJ-874","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-0000-O-00-4157-00","","9/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Investment promotion|Foreign investment|Limited data","Caribbean","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAQ756.pdf","703 KB","000165 - USAID.

"Evaluates energy options for pumping groundwater in irrigation projects in Africa, with an analysis of problems at eight A.I.D. projects, six in sub-Saharan Africa and two in North Africa. Special evaluation, dated 9/84, is based on document review. Most of the projects have used diesel fuel or electricity for pumping groundwater (these are currently the most economical energy sources), and have failed to experiment with alternative energy sources, e.g., human and animal labor, biomass, and solar or wind energy, even when such experimentation was part of the project design.  Project designers and implementing personnel should explain in greater detail the reasons for their energy source selection, and either the results of their experiments with alternative energy or their reasons for not experimenting with them.  Also, as evaluation teams have not sufficiently documented problems with water pumping, it has been difficult for project designers to learn from past experience. The most serious pumping problems that the projects have encountered are:  (1) fluctuating levels of water sources, and the lack of appropriate technology to deal with this; (2) deficient fuel system design, deficient well construction, and inappropriate pump and engine selection; (3) difficulties in conforming with foreign engineering designs and specifications when A.I.D. is entering an ongoing project (especially in Francophone Africa); (4) difficulties in procuring and storing water pumps and related inputs, including fuel and spare parts; and (5) lack of trained personnel, particularly diesel engine mechanics and competent administrators. A.I.D. irrigation projects in Africa should continue to use diesel-powered water pumps because, for the present, they are the most economical method, but should also experiment with alternative energy sources, because their prices will continue to fall while the prices of gasoline and diesel fuel will rise. When designing alternative energy experiments, care should be taken to ensure their practicality; results should be carefully documented, with reasons for their success or failure.","Bibliography: p. 45-37","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","9/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Water pumps|Irrigation|Alternative energy resources|Conventional energy resources","Africa south of Sahara","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAQ773.pdf","1,211 KB","001554 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to upgrade and expand domestic water systems in five provincial Philippine cities and develop the capabilities of the Local Water Utilities Administration (LWUA).  Special evaluation covers the period 1977-9/84 and is based in part on household survey data from two project cities - Cagayan de Oro and Bacolod. Despite a slowing down in implementation due to host government budgetary constraints (discussions on how to reduce these constraints are planned), the project has achieved 29% of planned outputs - 241 systems are complete, 560 are under construction (vs. a targeted 2,800), and better quality water is being delivered.  The number of active connections has risen from 4,000 in each city to 19,000 in Cagayan de Oro and 13,000 in Bacolod, and the number of households using the systems as their major water source has risen from 52% to 89% in Cagayan de Oro and from 37% to 54% in Bacolod.  Although users are of higher socioeconomic status than non-users - a disparity which has increased during the project - a significant number of lower-income households now have access to a reliable water supply.  TA and training in excess of project targets have helped water districts and the LWUA increase service reliability and reduce water loss by 50%, but system financial viability has been achieved only in Cagayan de Oro (and only in the last year). The project has not, however, achieved its goals.  There is no clear evidence of a positive health impact (as measured by incidence of infant diarrhea and by child nutritional status), although this may be partially due to a worsening economy. Analysis of water and health variables showed that improved water service will not yield a significant short-run impact unless households already enjoy a reasonable standard of living and access to sanitary facilities; in fact, income and diet were found to have the strongest health impact. Further, in both cities improper handling reduced water quality at point of use; both improved water handling and general sanitary conditions may be necessary before health impacts can be realized.  The project has significantly increased gardening for home consumption, but not household businesses. A decision on whether to extend the project will be made after a 1/85 evaluation.","Main document: PD-AAR-880","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","6/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Water supply structures|Institution building|Beneficiary interviews","Philippines","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDCAJ068.pdf","218 KB","001785 - U.S. Dept. of Commerce.

"Evaluates Commodity Import Program (CIP) intended to ease the Government of Egypt's (GOE) lack of foreign exchange needed to import equipment and raw materials.  Special evaluation covers the period 1/75-12/84 and is based on document review and interviews with project personnel. Through some 4,400 transactions, the CIP has financed food commodities, industrial machinery, raw materials, semi-finished products, and spare parts.  The program seems efficiently managed and, given the profusion and complexity of CIP objectives and time and resource constraints, has a remarkable record of success.  Although the CIP has had an increasingly small effect on Egypt's balance of payments (BOP) deficit, it has helped prevent further BOP deterioration and has had a generally positive impact on the GOE budget, employment, import substitution, and backward and forward linkages, with no major adverse effect on income distribution and equity.  The CIP contributed to 15 out of the 16 priority economic sectors identified in the GOE's Five-Year Plan. In order to improve CIP management and to help meet its many, often conflicting objectives, it is recommended that:  (1) clear guidance be given to technical divisions on their review of CIP procurements to ensure that they support USAID/E's other assistance goals; (2) ""project-like"" packaging of selected transactions be encouraged beforehand with adequate resources to monitor progress; (3) USAID/E disseminate information about CIP more widely; (4) continued effort be made in implementing the efficiency measures listed in the 1984 PAAD; (4) USAID/E cease involvement in programming Special Account funds after joint decision is made about which AID-financed projects are to receive funds; (5) arrangements be made to verify training, planning, and other preparation steps when imports of large capital equipment are proposed; and (6) the end-use audit system should be expanded slightly and standardized.

"Final Mission report (7/80-1/85) on a project to provide engineering design for road construction in southern Sudan. The contractor, Wilbur Smith and Associates (WSA), successfully completed preliminary design and selected final design documents for 440 km of primary gravel road in the Bahr El Ghazal Region of southern Sudan and found that the proposed road work would cost not $26.6 or $30.1 million (as had been estimated during project design), but closer to $60 million - a cost which could not be justified in terms of expected economic benefits to the region. Accordingly, the project was terminated.  An alternative strategy which focuses on selective, incremental rehabilitation has been initiated under the Southern Roads Maintenance and Rehabilitation (SORMAR) Project (6500046), which was authorized in 7/83. Two important lessons can be learned:  (1) Projects to be executed in isolated areas or areas recovering from turbulent conditions (e.g., the civil war and subsequent administrative reorganization in southern Sudan) should incorporate a methodology which permits in-course adjustments.  The follow-on SORMAR project provides flexibility to shift work sites as needed and is adaptable to problems relating to supplies (fuel, materials, spare parts) and changes of local officials and labor conditions. (2) Use of an intermediate ""design development"" stage in projects such as this could identify potential cost increases earlier on. Contractors should pay close attention to economic feasibility and should prepare cost estimates based on reconnaissance and sketch plans, i.e., prior to technical design.  The WSA Contract did not anticipate technical problems, potential cost increases, or possible early redirection or termination of the work; as a result, by the time A.I.D. completed its financial review, WSA had undertaken extensive final design work and was able to claim payment for nearly the entire contract amount.  Also, the Project Authorization and Grant Agreement were unaccountably ambitious in projecting completion within 2.5 years.","Attached to PD-AAQ-920","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Rural areas|Road construction|Transportation system design|Contracting|Construction costs|Limited data","Sudan","","","008607 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to assist the Kenya-based Regional Centre for Services in Surveying, Mapping, and Remote Sensing (the Centre) in promoting the use of its Regional Remote Sensing Facility (the Facility) in East and Southern African member countries.  Final evaluation, based in part on interviews, covers the period 6/82-2/84. The Facility has made significant progress in developing the capacity to provide services, and there is a growing - though still low-level - sensitivity among governments in the region to the utility of remote sensing in resource planning.  Except for member country support, which has fallen since 6/82, all quantifiable targets have been met:  average monthly user assistance has totaled 47, and 1983 photo lab production included monthly sales of Kshs 29,340 (vs. respective targets of 45 and Kshs 29,000); 204 (vs. a targeted 100) persons have been enrolled in local seminars on surveying techniques, and over 10 new natural resource surveys initiated.  Outputs and training have been of high quality, and all facilities appear to be in good working order; some interpretation equipment, however, is unused for lack of space and personnel. Nevertheless, the long-term viability of the Centre/Facility is in doubt.  Poor management has been reflected in significant communication difficulties among the Centre, Facility, A.I.D., and the UN Economic Commission for Africa (the Centre's guiding arm); lack of a long-term Centre workplan; and an incomplete Facility draft workplan which is not integrated with Centre planning.  Lacking counterparts and full staffing, the Centre has relied heavily on contract TA, retaining a low in-house capability to provide special imagery and course organization, and has been unable to meet all training requests; professional Facility staff have inadequate academic training, and the Facility lacks personnel able to utilize needed computer technology (as well as an appropriate definition of computer requirements).  Most significantly, the low level of member country/donor support has placed the Facility in severe jeopardy. The Centre and Facility have relied heavily on A.I.D. (the only major donor), which has doled out money in a piecemeal fashion, without making a commitment to institutional development. Recommendations for a one-year project extension and improved implementation are provided.","Attached to PD-AAQ-926","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","3/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Institution building|Remote sensing|Technology applications|Natural resource inventories|Regional development|Beneficiary interviews","East Africa|Southern Africa|Kenya","","","000026 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to develop Liberia's capacity to train subprofessional agricultural personnel.  Final special evaluation covers the period 11/82-4/84 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with students, faculty, and officials of the Rural Development Institute (RDI). Institutional development has been adequate to justify continued support of the RDI, which has graduated 4 classes totaling nearly 300 students (85% of the first 3 graduating classes are employed in relevant agricultural work) and has made commendable progress since the 11/82 evaluation in re-orienting its curriculum toward practical skills training in plant and animal sciences; a promising Farmer Involvement Program in which second-year students work directly with farmers has been initiated.  Also, a student agricultural enterprise program is being considered and progress is being made toward Liberianization of the staff. The RDI, however, is far short of the objective to reach financial self-sufficiency, and little progress has been made in administrative areas.  The Institute is overstaffed, salaries and benefits are out of line with those of similar institutions, significant cost cutting measures have not been undertaken, internal administrative procedures are cumbersome, and new sources of revenue have not been sought.  These administrative issues will clearly be a significant focus of the planned Phase II project. Another problem has been uncertainty about the services to be provided to RDI by Cuttington University College (CUC) and the financial remuneration involved in the sharing of services and facilities.  CUC has charged RDI for services the latter neither needed nor used and has failed to pay for its use of RDI facilities. Lessons for projects establishing new educational institutions: (1) give particular attention to developing a relevant curriculum and to preparing the institution to administer its resources effectively and economically (establish administrative procedures early on and audit them regularly); (2) clearly specify in advance any sharing arrangements between institutions. Extensive recommendations - some needing attention before Phase II is initiated - are made.","Attached to PD-AAQ-931","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","4/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural colleges|Institution building|Educational administration|Curriculum design|Agricultural education|Beneficiary count|Beneficiary interviews","Liberia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAQ931A.pdf","3,132 KB","002997 - Cuttington University College|008570 - USAID.

"Evaluates P.L. 480 Title II Section 206 program to increase food production in Mauritania and strengthen the marketing and distribution system of the Mauritanian Cereals Office (OMC). Special evaluation covers the period 7/83-12/84 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with key officials. During the past 2 years, the United States has provided 40,000 MT of wheat and sorghum under the Section 206 program, about half of which has been sold.  Some $3.9 million in local currency has been generated - 77% of this has been deposited in a special account and about half of the latter amount has been allocated for such activities as road construction and operating costs of the Food Security Commission (CSA), into which the OMC has been integrated. Marketed domestic grain production has not increased during the program's first 2 years, and probably will not during the third, despite a GOM increase in the wholesale price of wheat and sorghum (as called for in the Transfer Agreement).  This failure is due mainly to a severe, unanticipated drought.  The price increase will allow the CSA to import food commercially without causing economic distortions, but it has not encouraged farmers to increase production, since they were already producing as much as they could given existing technology, resource constraints, and the drought.  Also, local currency generations have not directly supported grain production, as planned extension and plant protection activities have not been implemented. The program's second objective, to strengthen food marketing and distribution, is on track.  The CSA is successfully handling, transporting, storing, and distributing grain both to those able to pay for it and to those unable.  Identifying these two groups is difficult, however, since the food consumption and income distribution surveys called for under the program have not been conducted.  Also, the GSA lacks a budget and a financial accounting system, making its overall cost-effectiveness difficult to assess. currency, but except for the proceeds from the A.I.D., World Food Program, and German programs, it is difficult to monitor the allocation of these resources.  Recommendations for a third year of the program address these problems.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","12/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Food for Peace Title II|Cereal crops|Food production|Food prices","Mauritania","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAQ968.pdf","1,111 KB","008576 - USAID.

"Evaluates a planning, monitoring, and evaluation system devised for the P.L. 480 Title II program in India.  The system was based on:  (1) a series of 1983 workshops on system design, and substantial field testing in 1984 of the instruments of protocol derived from these workshops; (2) a 3/84 evaluation which included 11 studies on program impact and recipient profiles; and (3) preliminary system design and field testing by USAID/I, Catholic Relief Services (CRS), and Community Systems Foundation. The present CRS system of monitoring commodities from their arrival at four different port cities to their arrival at consignees' godowns works well.  Losses have been minimal both in terms of tonnage and man-days expended, and CRS is using widely accepted management practices in commodity and recipient accounting.  There is, however, a general and felt need at all levels of CRS for streamlining the administrative load; while this can be done without changing accepted procedures, it does require giving greater decisionmaking responsibility to lower management personnel.  Further, evaluation is being conducted through casual conversation and accounting methods such as periodic reports and reply-by-endorsement, which are not very effective in selecting the best project.  Finally, the level of detail required on the current Form 6 (measurements, dimensions, man-days, and capital input by 17 project types) is unrealistic. Consignees must submit an Annual Estimate of Requirements well before there is any firm knowledge of the man-days that will be available or the projects that will be proposed. A key lesson learned is that decentralized decisionmaking is essential in the planning, monitoring, and evaluation phase.  The consignee and project holders are in the best position to understand local circumstances and judge a project's potential. Also, CRS' tight management style is ill adapted to the task of evaluating the system. The two management styles should be combined so that decentralized decisionmaking, which characterizes evaluation and planning, and the strictly controlled reporting and response mechanisms used in monitoring stock levels may both be utilized. It is recommended that:  (1) the evaluation component be expanded; (2) existing evaluation documents be revised, reports from consignee to zonal office be on a quarterly basis, and the progress/completion report be submitted at the end of each project or semi-annually for continuing projects (the summary statement of progress/completion should be aggregated by project type and reported semi-annually); and (3) the project be fully implemented by 10/84 and CRS assign an individual to coordinate and help implement the system country-wide.

"From September 1980 to December 1984, The Pathfinder Fund carried out a women's action/research program in Latin America and the Caribbean, funding five model projects through local implementing agencies, and documenting them intensively in order to supply qualitative data for policymakers and program planners.  This report reviews the program's accomplishments. All five projects - a metalworking enterprise in Brazil, an ice cream factory in Costa Rica, an egg production cooperative and a bakery in rural Honduras, and a crafts and sewing enterprise in rural Jamaica - produced goods for sale in the formal economic market.  Group ownership and self-management, reinforced by grant rather than loan capitalization and the provision of technical assistance and training by local technicians, promoted group commitment as well as financial and managerial self-sufficiency. The training was mostly 1-2 years in duration and focused not only on business skills but also on the context in which the skills would be used.  Even so, experience showed that even more training in marketing - the key to long-term viability - was needed.  Indigenous personnel received special training to collect research data on the projects' economic impact, the factors contributing to success or failure, and the question of self-sufficiency. At the program's termination, all the projects were operating; three were meeting current expenses; four had working capital for cost-effective production; and one was making a net profit.  Four had already achieved a legal status which made them eligible for credit, and the fifth (the bakery) had access to union loans.  Besides the factors noted above, the conducting of pre-project market and feasibility studies and the provision of adequate functional equipment helped the projects to benefit some 100 uneducated women previously lacking in formal economic experience and to positively affect gender relations and social relations within their respective communities. Recommendations for policymakers in the areas of program evaluation and of women in development, population, and private enterprise programs are provided, as are case histories of the five projects.","Spanish ed.: PN-AAX-843|Evaluation period: Sep 1980-Dec 1984","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/OTR-G-1867","","1/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Women in development|Small scale enterprises|Economic research|Cooperatives|Socioeconomic status|Credit|Income|Marketing|Management training|Economic self sufficiency","Brazil|Costa Rica|Honduras|Jamaica","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAS314.pdf","3,087 KB","000941 - Pathfinder Fund","","000163 - USAID.

"Evaluates housing guaranty (HG) program in Sri Lanka.  Special evaluation covers the period 1/81-12/83 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with Government of Sri Lanka (GSL) and USAID/SL officials and with housing project residents. Although progress was delayed by the 11/82 national election and by ethnic conflict in 7/83 which left thousands homeless, 20,000 project-supported Aided Self-Help (ASH) units were completed in rural Sri Lanka between 1981-82 (vs. a goal of 13,210 a year), a success partly attributed to the advantages of the ASH production methods and to use of locally available and traditional construction materials - costs of materials for ASH are increasing rapidly, however.  In urban areas, of the 3,600 planned Slum and Shanty Upgrading units, only 1,503 were completed, due to inadequate financing, lack of staff, technical difficulties in having two separate agencies involved, and legal problems concerning property rights and tenure.  Cost recovery has been poor, but several steps are being taken to improve collections. In addition to housing construction, other key measures of project success include:  upgraded indigenous skills in site and unit design, site supervision, and TA; growing GSL concern with cost control and a commitment to resolve problems of cost recovery; and improved collection and analysis of planning data in the Slum and Shanty Division of the Urban Development Authority.  Two financial institutions devoted to housing have been developed:  the State Mortgage Investment Bank and the Sri Lanka Housing Development Finance Corporation, both promising a greater capacity for financing and servicing loans. In 12/82, the GSL announced a new Million Houses Program (MHP), a highly decentralized program (to be funded under 383HG02) in which loans and TA are provided to individuals and communities. While announcement of the MHP led to neglect of the ASH Program, it represents a positive step, very much in keeping with A.I.D.'s housing assistance goals in Sri Lanka. Key recommendations address: (1) management needs (e.g., monitoring, evaluation, review of land tenure and loan collection problems); and (2) the need to strengthen Sri Lanka's Centre for Housing, Planning and Building (CHPB) and enable it to play a major role in research and training for housing planning.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","9/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Housing policy|Low cost housing|Housing investment guaranty|Housing administration|Housing finance|Beneficiary interviews","Sri Lanka","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAR063.pdf","1,520 KB","003615 - National Council of Savings Institutions","","002960 - USAID.

"Evaluates project component to improve the capabilities of the engineering profession in Egypt.  Special evaluation covers the period 6/81-5/84 and is based on literature review, visits with engineers in New York and Cairo, and interviews with A.I.D. personnel and others. The Alliance for Engineering Cooperation, composed of the Egyptian Society of Engineers (ESE) and the American Association of Engineers (AAES), was created in June 1981, but has achieved only moderate success.  Of three planned seminars, two - on land reclamation and town planning - were held in early 1983; the third was cancelled.  The Cairo Center for Continuing Engineering Education (CEC), a major grant component, was established, but is operating on only a limited basis due to a lack of staff; positions for a director and a part-time assistant director are vacant.  A modest number of technical books and publications have been acquired for the CEC library and audio/video equipment has been procured.  AAES/ESE personnel exchange has been limited; AAES officers made only three visits to Egypt (including seminars), and ESE officers did not visit the U.S. until March 1984, and then at their own expense.  Outreach activities especially have fallen short of expectations. The Alliance's poor performance is due primarily to a lack of institutional capacity and motivation/commitment:  the ESE has no experience in outreach programs aimed at the practicing engineer, and AAES was not oriented toward managing and administering the grant efficiently.  Furthermore, efforts of both parties have been literally part-time.  In retrospect, it is apparent that the Alliance was formed without full recognition of the ESE's elite character (it represents only 1.5% of Egypt's practicing engineers). It is recommended that TA be provided to ensure proper installment and use of the audio/video equipment and that CEC operating expenses be covered for one additional year.  These actions would give CEC the opportunity to operate as originally intended and would mute any criticisms that might arise from the U.S. and Egyptian engineering communities. The project has demonstrated the necessity of choosing appropriate institutions as implementing agencies and of making adequate staffing a precondition to the provision of assistance.

"Evaluates housing guaranty (HG) project in Zimbabwe.  Special evaluation covers the period 1/82-3/84 and is based on document review and meetings with A.I.D., Government of Zimbabwe (GOZ), and contractor personnel. Despite delays - due mostly to GOZ institutional and housing policy changes - the project has increased the supply of low-cost housing and strengthened housing planning capabilities in Zimbabwe.  Phase I outputs have included 6,748 housing units in the GOZ Chitungwiza project (funded retrospectively under the project) and infrastructure (sewers, electricity, etc.) for 4,104 plots at Parkridge/Fontainbleau.  Some community facilities are being built, but this activity is far behind schedule.  Designs for Phase I construction in Harare are being drawn up.  Sites have been chosen for Phase II construction (5,764 units at Parkridge/Fontainbleau and in secondary cities), expected to begin in early 1985. An effective cadre of housing planners is being developed within the Ministry of National Construction and Housing (MNCH), the City of Harare (COH), and other local authorities; Phase II delivery plans showed good planning procedures.  While training has not yet been provided to architects, engineers, planners, and quantity surveyors, a 2-week management training workshop was held for 27 COH, MNCH, and other officials. Since project initiation, GOZ housing policy, which initially retained remnants of racially motivated white Rhodesian attitudes toward the poor, has gone through several stages, first accepting, and then challenging, A.I.D. shelter principles.  This process, as it represents true local initiative, will probably prove valuable in the long run, but certain project targets have lost ground; support of the informal construction sector, for example, has been overshadowed by MNCH use of public sector ""building brigades.""  The MNCH has actively pursued design development, but more innovative and cost-effective housing designs are needed. Lessons learned:  the project displays the value of the classic HG approach, which ties shelter provision to institution building; a fluid project management approach is effective, but needs careful monitoring and documentation; evaluations should be scheduled early, with input from the GOZ.","Attached to PD-AAR-119","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Housing policy|Housing investment guaranty|Low cost housing|Housing planning|Housing sites","Zimbabwe","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAR119A.pdf","1,823 KB","008628 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to create an Institute for Population and Development Studies (IEPD) in the Dominican Republic, under the auspices of the Dominican Family Welfare Association (PROFAMILIA).  Special evaluation covers the period 3/82-9/84 and is based on document review and interviews with IEPD and PROFAMILIA staff and other knowledgeable persons. Despite a design which was both overambitious and lacking in necessary implementation detail, the project successfully identified - and has filled - a serious lack in the Dominican Republic's population planning and policymaking process.  The IEPD is viewed with respect, and its advice on population and development issues is sought.  To date, IEPD has produced and published three sector analyses (on labor, nutrition, and housing), five issues of a bulletin, 200 news items, and two slide-tape presentations.  Training has included a seminar for journalists and another for leaders of the main opposition party. IEPD's relationships with other organizations are excellent, resulting in a high level of active collaboration; its relationship with PROFAMILIA has proven mutually beneficial and both organizations have demonstrated flexibility in reprogramming project resources in response to particular problems. Although IEPD research is among the best in Latin America, it has sometimes rested on inadequate or outdated data and has been weak on socioeconomic (as opposed to demographic) analysis. Dissemination activities have reached a large audience, but due partly to personnel and funding constraints have lacked a cohesive strategy.  While IEPD has been systematic in reaching government officials and journalists, contact with other target audiences has been sporadic and there has been little effort to tailor messages to specific audiences.  IEPD is taking steps to remedy its deficiences in both research and dissemination. Hopes for the IEPD to become self-supporting are simply a pipe dream, especially in light of the Dominican Republic's current economic crisis. Serious fundraising should be undertaken immediately to support future activities and to prevent loss of what has already been accomplished. Recommendations address staffing, communication, and funding needs.","Attached to PD-AAR-250","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","10/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Demographic analysis|Population impact|Institution building","Dominican Republic","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAR250A.pdf","4,553 KB","","","000114 - USAID.

"Evaluates OPG to PVO, Ltd. to expand special education, health care, and vocational development services for handicapped children in rural Jamaica.  Special evaluation covers 3/82-8/31 and is based on document review and interviews with government and school personnel, direct service providers, and parents. The project has achieved an impressive level of success; most project goals have been met or surpassed, and the multidisciplinary staff is competent and effective.  In the area of prevention, 32 workshops on topics related to early identification, pre-natal care, and remedial tactics were presented to parents and professionals; immunization, nutrition, and family planning counseling needs were also addressed. Pre-school and school-age services included numerous hearing, educational/physiotherapy, and vision screenings, as well as referrals to other agencies; original targets for providing services to 50 children per month have been doubled.  The project has also supported existing community-based programs; initiated home visits; produced and disseminated materials for teachers and parents and a series of 8 manuals; and provided support to the Unit Class programs operated by the Ministry of Education and PVO's.  A significant impact has been improved attitudes towards the handicapped in rural areas.  The project's major shortcomings have been in pre-vocational and vocational training, and in a program to aid school-leavers; these areas are beyond the scope and capacity of the project and have not been implemented. The project's mobile unit has been especially effective in expanding the coverage of services and presenting information to non-literate rural populations through films and discussions. However, the unit's size and unwieldiness on narrow mountain roads is a cause for concern. It is recommended, inter alia, that:  the project be extended until 1988, when PVO, Ltd. will pass on activities to another agency; professional and administrative staff be expanded; USAID/J play a greater role in project administration; the services of PVO, Ltd. be rationalized; project vehicles be upgraded; the mobile unit carry and dispense non-prescription medications; and an extensive assessment record and diagnostic information system be adopted.","Attached to PD-AAR-252","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","9/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Community services|Health education|Handicapped persons|Children|Beneficiary count|Beneficiary interviews","Jamaica","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAR252A.pdf","5,732 KB","","","008563 - USAID.

"Evaluates economic sustainability of a project to help the Government of Somalia (GOS) produce diesel wells in the Bay and Central Rangelands Regions.  Special evaluation, prepared by Louis Berger International, Inc., a project contractor, is based on analysis of real construction costs (1982-83) and of projected construction costs (1984-91), benefits, and operating and maintenance costs. Since project inception in 1980, 51 wells have been drilled, of which 21 (41%) have the potential of being production wells. This percentage should increase to about 60% or an average of 18 production wells per year.  Construction costs have run from $200,000 to $280,000 per well; heavy equipment and tools account for more than 60% of costs, the remainder being for materials, labor, fuel, and overhead.  The implications of such significant capital costs are:  (1) once capital equipment has been procured, cost per additional well is relatively small; (2) attempts to cut costs should focus on equipment procurement; (3) overall costs are very sensitive to expected equipment life (a 10-year lifespan has been used in the projections); (4) high annual completion of production wells is essential for acceptable per well costs; and (5) technology choice is extremely important in determining costs. In the Bay Region, 1,500-2,500 people and a like number of livestock per well are expected to benefit from water availability, reduction in water-related disease, freeing of labor now devoted to drawing water, and increased agricultural potential.  In the less populated Central Rangelands, each well should serve about 250 families and 7,000 animals. Demand will be limited almost entirely to the dry season in both regions. The GOS water tariff is sufficient to cover operating costs for one year of well service - $45,000 to $60,000 - and just over 50% of direct construction costs.  Even were the tariff doubled, however, it would not be possible to recover capital costs.  It is recommended, however, that the GOS consider collecting periodic lump sum (as opposed to per-unit) payments. If 18 production wells are constructed a year, equipment is well-maintained, and user fees are efficiently collected, the project can become partially self-sufficient (i.e., except for capital costs). However, the GOS is not likely to achieve these conditions without continued donor TA.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","4/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Drilled wells|Construction costs|Operating costs|Equipment costs|Beneficiary count","Somalia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDBAS071.pdf","5,779 KB","004134 - Louis Berger International, Inc.

"Evaluates project to strengthen the Government of the Dominican Republic (GODR) in developing the country's natural resources and establishing a soil and water conservation model.  Special evaluation covers the period 10/82-7/84 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with personnel of the GODR and the Ocoa watershed office, farmers, and community leaders. The project has contributed significantly to the GODR's capability to collect and interpret natural resource data and to develop long-term resource plans.  Stress has been laid on the need to select technically qualified staff, and coordination among the central office, watershed office, and the local community is good.  Project staff at all levels are, for the most part, quite enthusiastic. In the Ocoa watershed, substantial progress has been made on the aerial photo and mapping work and the soil, water, and forestry program is proceeding mostly according to plan - some 140 farmers have received loans for conservation improvements and nurseries have been established and 42,000 seedlings planted.  The environmental education program is very active and much in demand by farmer groups. Major constraints exist, however, the most serious of which is the inability of the GODR to provide the specified counterpart funds, which may necessitate a scaling down of planned activities.  A further concern is that little erosion/agronomic and economic research is being done to support the recommended conservation and cropping practices.  In providing incentives for farm conservation, too much stress is laid on formal credit; not all farmers need credit, dependence on loans should not be encouraged, and alternative incentives should be available. Project coordination with groups within the GODR Subsecretariat of Natural Resources is mostly satisfactory, but more effort is needed to cooperate with other institutions.  The information flow on the technical aspects of the watershed is progressing well, but data collection relative to human resources must be improved for long-term measurement of local and household-level impacts.  Also, the project's farm conservation improvements should be viewed as long-term investments in the environment, i.e., not merely as means of increasing crop yields.","Attached to PD-AAR-258|NOTE: Page 1 missing","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","7/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Natural resource conservation|Watersheds|Environmental planning|Agricultural land|Beneficiary count|Beneficiary interviews","Dominican Republic","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAR258A.pdf","1,405 KB","008537 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to reduce unwanted pregnancies in the Caribbean region.  Special midterm evaluation, focusing on the Windward Islands, covers the period 7/82-9/84 and is based on document review, site visits, and discussions with trainees and with host government, project, and Caribbean Community Secretariat (CARICOM) officials. Despite delays, the project is well underway and in most areas proceeding according to plan.  CARICOM has held regional and national Medical Contraceptive Policy (MCP) Seminars as well as a Regional Awareness Conference for political leaders.  CARICOM's Regional Population Policy and MCP have been approved at the regional level, but only 2 countries (St. Vincent and Antigua) have developed their own MCP's (it is unlikely the target of 3 national MCP's will be met). Population task forces - established in 7 countries - have suffered from lack of leadership and political will. Family planning (FP) services are now available from governments in all countries but Antigua and Montserrat.  Renovation is complete at 7 clinics and underway at 11; equipment has been supplied to about 50 clinics.  The International Planned Parenthood Federation's Western Hemisphere Region (IPPF/WHR) has trained nurses and paramedical personnel in 6 countries; sex education training has been provided to 80 teachers by the Caribbean Family Planning Association.  WHR seminars for physicians, however, were poorly attended (even when sessions were reduced to one day or less), and training in counseling and supervision has not been provided. Commodity supply and distribution systems have been set up in each country and community-based contraceptive distribution (CBD) has been expanded in Barbados and developed in St. Lucia, Montserrat, and Dominica; attempts to initiate a CBD program in St. Vincent have been plagued by difficulties and the Dominica program faces government opposition.  Adolescent clinics and outreach programs have been established or are in early stages in Barbados, St. Lucia, St. Kitts, Dominica, and Antigua. Benchmarks on contraceptive use and population/FP awareness among political leaders were not established as planned. Project shortcomings are due mostly to governmental inefficiency, lack of political commitment, staffing constraints, and overly optimistic targets (given the difficulties involved in implementing FP activities in the Caribbean).","Attached to PD-AAR-262","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","12/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Family planning services|Population policy|Beneficiary interviews","Eastern Caribbean|Windward Islands|Barbados|Dominica|Antigua and Barbuda|Saint Lucia|Saint Vincent and the Grenadines|Montserrat|Saint Kitts-Nevis","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAR262A.pdf","3,716 KB","001757 - USAID.

"Evaluates community-based integrated rural development project in Nepal implemented by Save the Children Federation (SCF) to develop a model delivery system for health, family planning (FP), and rural development services.  External evaluation covers the period 8/81-8/84 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with beneficiaries in Deurali Panchayat, a primary impact area. Community participation in choosing, planning, and implementing subprojects (SP's) has been outstanding, and a substantial majority of the beneficiaries interviewed feel they have the capacity to continue the development process when SCF support is terminated.  Women have been the primary beneficiaries:  water supplies and access to drinking water have been improved, 6 day care centers have been built, a health outreach program has been developed using female volunteers, and enrollment in adult literacy classes is 60% female.  Another target group, the poor, have benefited from the construction of a health clinic (and related FP services), and schools.  Other SP's have involved teacher training and training in building and installing smokeless stoves.  Construction has been performed by local laborers and tradesmen, thus increasing employment and reducing reliance on external technologies. The project has had a less measurable impact on Nepal's social structure, namely the caste system.  Over 70% of low- and tailor caste beneficiaries interviewed had made little or no attempt to implement SP's.  However, some activities like the co-mingling of children from high and low castes in day care centers offer hope that caste consciousness will diminish. The project's locale-specific approach and SCF's high level of commitment have been keys to the project's success.  On a programmatic level, however, the project is philosophically in conflict with the larger, broad based, and more costly AID-funded Resource Conservation and Utilization Project (RCUP) and careful analysis and coordination are necessary for newer SP's which lie within the RCUP geographic area. To build a stronger economic base in project areas, more efforts are needed in agriculture, income generation, and marketing.  The project is just starting to focus its resources more systematically in these directions.  A 2-year extension in which up to seven more panchayats would be brought into the project is under consideration.

"Evaluates implementation by Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) member governments of AID-funded cooperative projects to upgrade the capability and regional character of institutions in the ASEAN region.  Special evaluation covers the period 1979-3/84 and is based on site visits and interviews with key officials from the U.S. and ASEAN member governments. The program appears to be successfully promoting regional cooperation and technology transfer, and, despite the difficulty of planning and implementing projects through ASEAN groups which meet only semi-annually, operates well.  Training, the main focus to date, has provided a high quality of education at a lower cost than possible in the United States, and most trainees have remained in the region upon completion of training. Additionally, while their viability has yet to be tested, the training and research centers established under the projects are appreciated and provide quality services. ASEAN management has been generally good, steering committees have performed efficiently, and the projects have experienced few problems. However, A.I.D. support for project design has been too thin:  decisions are being made in Washington and implemented in the field by a single individual.  A.I.D. grant obligations through 1983 totaled just over $17 million for nine regional projects, and annual planned commitments are expected to reach $5 million in 1985.  Neither a program expansion nor loan funding are viable at this time, however, as the ASEAN system remains too disjointed to be cost-effective and as ASEAN countries are not willing to accept joint liability. Although program benefits are largely indirect, Thailand has hosted the most projects and can be seen to have received the greatest benefit, and Indonesia and the Philippines have benefited more than Singapore and Malaysia. It is recommended that:  the program be continued with no increase in planned levels until the ASEAN system includes a permanent secretariat; projects be reviewed at AID/W under standard development project criteria; personnel support from Missions in the region be increased; and a basket structure be used only for project development support, not for project funding.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","3/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Regional development|Development cooperation|International organizations|Institution building|Development programs|Host country cooperation","Thailand|Singapore|Malaysia|Indonesia|Philippines|Southeast Asia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDCAH841.pdf","2,367 KB","","","000039 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to improve rural postprimary education at Integrated Rural and Artisan Learning Centers (CERAI's) and at the Nyagahanga Girls School in Rwanda.  Special evaluation covers the period 8/79-12/84 and is based on document review, interviews with A.I.D., CERAI, other Rwandan, and contractor personnel, and field visits. Almost 4 years elapsed between signing of the grant agreement and arrival of the TA team in 3/83, during which time project circumstances had changed considerably; A.I.D. and World Bank studies had raised doubts about Rwanda's educational reform program, and French and Belgian Cooperants were already in place at the Ministry of Primary and Secondary Education (MINEPRISEC) unit responsible for curriculum development (a task originally slated for A.I.D.).  Thus, in 2/84 the A.I.D. team was transferred to a different MINEPRISEC unit and the project focus shifted away from curriculum development, toward inservice training of CERAI staff.  These changes, while appropriate, have not been documented in a Project Paper update. Thus far, inservice training seminars in school management and curriculum adaptation have been provided to the directors and teachers of 30 pilot CERAI's.  The team has also made excellent progress in helping MINEPRISEC collect computerized data on CERAI staff and students and has trained two Rwandans in computer operations.  Construction of the Nyagahanga School and of 30 CERAI's has been completed as planned; 20 cisterns have also been built (provision of cisterns at 150 CERAI's was added to project construction plans).  No progress has been made on plans to introduce adult education into CERAI's. In 6/84 MINEPRISEC decided that the seminars should be provided to personnel at all 310 CERAI's.  Therefore, the project should focus its efforts in this direction, eliminating planned adult education activities, as well as plans to work with Nyagahanga school (which is far ahead of the CERAI's in curriculum and staff development).  In addition, MINEPRISEC data collection activities should be expanded to include information on job opportunities, a project amendment should be prepared to reflect all the changes that have taken place, and reporting systems and financial management should be improved.","Attached to PD-AAR-404","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-1406-I-00-4052-00","","12/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural education|Basic education|Teacher training|Training centers|Rural areas","Rwanda","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAR404B.pdf","11,397 KB","000223 - Academy for Educational Development, Inc.

"Evaluates project to stimulate U.S. private investment in Egypt. Special evaluation covers the period 9/79-11/84 and is based on document review and interviews with project staff and Egyptian and U.S. businesspersons. Although targets have not been reached, the project approach has been generally successful.  The majority of potential U.S. investors interviewed indicated that the incentives offered by the project were an important factor in their decision to explore investment opportunities in Egypt.  Of 84 applications received, 44 have been disapproved and 4 are under consideration.  Ten reconnaissance visits and seven feasibility studies have been completed; seven staff members have been trained; and ten sectoral studies have been prepared.  Three of the firms that have used the project are currently processing Law 43 applications.  It remains unclear how many actual investments will be made. Achievement of targets was hindered by several factors.  The initial promotion effort was a ""shotgun"" approach.  The project was highly publicized before application procedures were finalized, and the original procedures were cumbersome.  A one-year contractual delay impeded timely completion of half of the sectoral studies.  Later delays resulted from bureaucratic problems in both Cairo and in the commercial section of the Egyptian Embassy in Washington.  However, the introduction of modified procedures in 6/84 and the increased experience of General Authority for Investment and Free Zones (GAFI) personnel have partially offset the negative impact of these problems. It is recommended that the project be extended with the following changes:  (1) initial screening, routing of applications, and communication with applicants be streamlined and (2) greater emphasis be given to promotion of the project as a package of services provided by USAID/E. Lessons learned:  (1) the timing of project inputs is critical. In this case, application procedures should have been finalized and sector studies completed before the project was promoted; (2) targeted investment promotion efforts are most cost-effective; and (3) the time frame for securing investments was unrealistic in the project design.

"Evaluates project to develop technologies appropriate for rural India.  Special evaluation, focusing on four renewable energy subprojects (SP's), covers the period 8/78-12/84 and is based on site visits, document review, and interviews with project, USAID/I, and public and private sector host country personnel. The project has fostered genuine technology transfer between U.S. and Indian scientific and academic institutions, established long-term institutional relationships promising for future technological progress, and assisted significantly in establishing Indian centers of expertise in several areas of renewable energy research and utilization (particularly in solar drying work at Annamalai University and high-temperature solar thermal design at Bharat Heavy Electrical Ltd). However, only the solar rice drying system is ready for widespread testing and dissemination; the other 3 SP's (village solar thermal energy; line-focus solar concentrators; and micro-hydro and hybrid systems) are seriously behind and will require an additional 9-24 months for field testing to be completed.  A 2-year project delay resulting from problems with SP approval crucially affected some SP's, as research priorities under the Reagan Administration have deemphasized renewable energy technology. (Project design also assumed an international price of crude oil reaching $40/bl). The project suffered from divergence between its implementation as a scientific exchange/scholarly research activity and its stated purpose to develop technologies for the rural poor:  the quality of research has been high and the technologies developed sound, but several are too expensive and complex for remote site operation and maintenance - selected apparently for their scientific interest rather than relevance to cost-effective rural development - and the absence of technically competent USAID/I supervision allowed inappropriate projects to continue.  The choice of universities and national laboratories as U.S. collaborators has exacerbated the high-performance emphasis; testing has been held up by the slow performance of some U.S. collaborators and the great difficulty experienced by some SP's in procuring U.S. parts. Recommendations for follow-on activities are included.","Attached to PD-AAR-453|Evaluation period: Aug 1978-Dec 1984","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-1406-I-08-2167-00","","1/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Energy research|Rural development|Rural areas|Renewable energy resources|Appropriate technology|Alternative energy technology|Technology transfer|Institution building","India","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAR453A.pdf","3,825 KB","001600 - Associates in Rural Development, Inc.

"Evaluates grant to the Cooperative League of the United States of America (CLUSA) to support cooperatives in India.  Special evaluation covers the period 4/83-9/84 and is based on document review and interviews with officials of CLUSA, the Indian National Dairy Development Board (NDDB), and USAID/I. CLUSA's activities are focused on monitoring the NDDB's Oilseed Growers' Cooperative Project (OGCP).  Under the OGCP, the income of farmer members has gone up and efforts are being made to create a sense of cooperative member security and confidence through an integrated production, procurement, processing, and marketing system.  A major activity has been revision of the multi-year operational plan to include recommendations of a prior evaluation and an audit, as well as initiatives based on project experience.  CLUSA has efficiently arranged vegetable oil imports for the OGCP and monitored their handling after arrival.  CLUSA submits quarterly, semiannual, and annual reports on the OGCP and conducts regular reviews, but until recently did not have sufficient staff to carry out regular site visits and district review meetings.  Although CLUSA's reports are comprehensive and detailed, USAID/I has not been satisfied with them, due to differing CLUSA-USAID/I perspectives as to the nature of the project and the roles of the organizations involved.  USAID/I has proposed a new, simpler reporting format, but has not specified what information it needs. CLUSA also participates in a number of other constructive activities in the cooperative sector, e.g., exploring new trade opportunities, strengthening the capacities of cooperative personnel, promoting a rural electric cooperative, recruiting consultants for planning a vegetable and fruit cooperative project, and sponsoring a P.L. 480 Title II donation of nonfat dry milk to the Indian Dairy Corporation. Utilization of grant funds has been slow, with only 13% of the total budget spent by 7/84, but given the recent recruitment of additional staff, it appears that expenditures will soon reach planned levels.","Attached to PD-AAR-454","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","12/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Cooperative development organizations|Agricultural cooperatives|Vegetable oils|Oil crops|Limited data plus","India","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAR454A.pdf","984 KB","","","008557 - USAID.

"Evaluates OPG to the Cooperative League of the USA (CLUSA) to support India's National Dairy Development Board's (NDDB's) Oilseed Growers' Cooperative Project (OGCP).  Special final evaluation covers the period 8/79-10/84 and is based on interviews with the staff of the OGCP, NDDB, and the Cooperative Oilseed Growers' Federation (COGF). Implementation was slower than planned, due to such factors as problems in establishing OGCP state federations and uncertainty about future support, the latter due partly to misunderstandings about project agreements and partly to an audit report which NDDB considered unusually hostile; organizational expansion and infrastructure investments were minimized until these issues could be resolved.  Another major implementation problem was difficulty in obtaining Government of India (GOI) clearances for technical and consultative personnel.  The OPG, originally due to expire in 8/82, was amended 7 times over a 6-year period so that training of key NDDB/COGF personnel could be completed. Given the above situation, the training program was not as strong as it could have been.  Nonetheless, a study tour and/or inservice training have been provided to key officials. Project operations research consultants were not put to the best uses, primarily because they arrived before counterpart personnel were prepared to benefit.  However, the consultants did identify issues that had to be resolved (e.g., plant size, technology, and siting) with respect to new projects in groundnut/virgin oil and margarine/butter production.  Ongoing operations research is not proceeding as planned, although a number of studies have been commissioned. Consultancies in financial planning and management did not take place due to lack of GOI clearances, and consultancies on specialized products never materialized because of nonavailability of consultants.

"Evaluates two projects to develop a national inland fishing industry in Jamaica.  Special evaluation covers the period 1979-11/84 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with project staff, fish farmers, and involved host country personnel. The projects have successfully established a viable tilapia production industry in Jamaica, having transferred aquaculture technology and skills to both private farmers, many of whom have been able to increase their income through fish production and sales, and the Inland Fisheries Unit (IFU), a government research and extension agency. IFU extension agents have shown increasing confidence and ability in their work due to project-funded training. However, the potential profitability of fish farming has encouraged its expansion in ways which were unanticipated and unintended.  The inadequacy of existing distribution and marketing channels and competition from medium-scale farmers and commercial enterprises have taken away much of the market from the projects' target group, small farmers; the participation of larger producers has also resulted in the overproduction of fish and decreased the market price.  In St. Catherine Parish, where the largest number of fish ponds are, the projects have exacerbated two environmental problems:  saltwater intrusion and shortages of drinking water.  Also, the production technology extended by the projects, while effective, may eventually prove less profitable than an alternative technology now in use on at least two large farms. Sustainability is threatened by two factors:  Jamaica still lacks the capacity to produce trained aquaculture professionals and technicians; and, the future role of the IFU is in doubt as the result of the withdrawal of A.I.D. funding, staff attrition, and competing institutional interests. The projects have taught the need for:  (1) a more effective strategy to keep large farmers from seizing control of the industry from the target population; and (2) realistic assessment of marketing opportunities; (3) environmental reassessment following changes in project direction and/or technologies; (4) monitoring of the host government's commitment to sustaining research and training.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-0000-I-16-3078-00","","11/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Fishery development|Fish culture|Inland fisheries|Beneficiary interviews","Jamaica","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAR481.pdf","972 KB","006727 - Development Alternatives, Inc.

"Evaluates project to provide an alternative coffee marketing network for small farmers in Haiti.  External evaluation covers 1977-12/83 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with officials of cooperatives and other institutions; information on predecessor project 5210073 is also provided. The Small Farmer Marketing Project (PCC) was designed to complement the earlier Small Farmer Improvement Project (PPC) which ended in 1981 without achieving its objective of increasing coffee production.  PPC failed due to:  a strategy of creating new local organizations (agricultural credit societies) instead of working through existing ones; failure to test the production technology package for acceptability to small farmers before extending it; and reliance on multiple, fragile, and inexperienced Government of Haiti (GOH) agencies to coordinate complicated project functions. In contrast, PCC - which did, for the most part, work with existing organizations - has succeeded in most of its objectives. Its foremost achievement has been to strengthen the cooperative movement:  the number of coffee marketing cooperatives and pre-cooperatives has doubled, and membership tripled. Cooperative coffee marketing competes effectively, though on a localized basis, with private exporters and ""speculateurs."" The key factor in this success has been the Pilot Center for Cooperative Coffee Exporting (CEPEC), created in 1981; CEPEC has increased its export volume every year and, with subsidies, operates profitably. Farmers have responded well to CEPEC bonuses for production of higher quality natural coffee, but incentives to produce washed coffee have not been successful. The Office of Promotion of Exportable Commodities (OPRODEX) has been effective in supporting PCC activities, creating CEPEC, and strengthening the co-ops; its greatest weakness has been its inability to secure financing for CEPEC or the co-ops from public or private sources. Midway through the project the co-ops established the Union of Haitian Coffee Cooperatives (CCH), intended, among other things, to assume operational control over the co-ops' national processing facility; however, CCH does not yet have the managerial or financial capacity to assume this responsibility, nor would PCC staff, almost all of whom are GOH employees, be likely to give up their job security to accept jobs (probably at lower pay) with CCH. Recommendations are made regarding the cooperative movement, coffee marketing, institutional roles, GOH policies, and the proposed A.I.D. coffee technology transfer project.  It is strongly suggested that A.I.D. make modification of the GOH's economically inefficient coffee export tax a condition precedent to disbursement under any new project.","Executive summary: PD-AAR-497","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-1406-I-17-1089-00","","2/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural cooperatives|Small farms|Agricultural product marketing|Coffee|Government policy","Haiti","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAR498.pdf","5,979 KB","006727 - Development Alternatives, Inc.

"Evaluates subproject to establish the Ibb Secondary Agricultural Institute (ISAI) in North Yemen.  Special evaluation covers 1979-1/84; methodology is not stated. During the past 4 years, significant progress has been made in improving the quality of educational activities at ISAI.  In 1981/82, 48 students were graduated, and in 1982/83, 29; 105 are now enrolled.  The ISAI curriculum is commendable and the school's reputation is very good; ISAI procedures are being adopted by other agricultural schools in Yemen, and the expatriate teaching staff, mostly from other Arab countries, contribute to a positive academic environment and to good relations with the Ibb community. A number of constraints impede full achievement of project goals, however.  The most serious is a political/ideological rejection, within the Ministry of Education (MOE), of the American presence in Yemen; this has prevented good working relationships between ISAI's Yemeni staff and its U.S. advisors, impeded development of sound administrative policies and procedures, and negatively influenced or prevented activities such as extensionist and farming training and outreach; a tense security situation in 1981/82 necessitating expatriate evacuation also hurt implementation of these activities.  Further hindering ISAI development have been the MOE's inadequate budgeting and its inability to recruit and assign sufficient counterpart and support personnel to ISAI; turnover has also been a problem. M.S. training has been delayed by counterparts' poor proficiency in English, and only 2 inservice programs for staff have been held; B.S. training is progressing well.  Student accommodations and educational facilities are still inadequate, and delays in acquiring more farmland have adversely affected practical training. Fewer students than expected apply to ISAI, partly because of disregard in Yemen for the values of agricultural education; many students show disdain for practical learning.  Religious and sociocultural factors have made it impractical for ISAI to conduct educational programs for women. The project teaches the importance of sociocultural context in Yemen, especially vis-a-vis administrative decisionmaking and women in development. Numerous recommendations are made, including a 5-10 year extension.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC/1406-1-090-11411","","1/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural colleges|Agricultural extension|Agricultural education|Agricultural training|Secondary education","Yemen","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAR524.pdf","1,632 KB","006727 - Development Alternatives, Inc.

"Evaluates project to institute an adult nonformal education (NFE) program in Nepal.  Special evaluation covers the period 1981-1984 and is based on document analysis, observation of NFE classes, and interviews with key personnel and beneficiaries. The NFE program is operating in 6 of 75 districts in Nepal - close to the targeted number - and is running its second cycle of classes.  The NFE's literacy training materials and its participatory methodologies (e.g., demonstrations, games, small group work) are appropriate and the program content (mostly related to agriculture, family planning, and health) is relevant to the rural life situation.  NFE personnel feel that the program is effectively raising consciousness and productivity among participants; the latter are both pleased with the program's functional content and confident that they will achieve literacy status at the end of the program. On-the-job training of specialists, supervisors, and facilitators has been successful, although supplementary specialized training is needed and facilitators find the duration of their training (one week) too brief.  Female facilitators had a significant effect on increasing women's participation in NFE.  Although interaction between NFE and the government's Functional Literacy Program has been negligible, gradual NFE institutionalization is considered possible. The project's greatest shortfall has been delayed production of the last two (of four) literacy primers and of follow-up materials.  Other problems have included delayed supply of materials, inadequate lighting in facilities, inadequate provision and delayed release of funds, lack of clear-cut responsibility by the district administration, and especially the temporary status of project personnel. It is recommended that:  timely production of project materials have top priority; literacy materials and training methods be refined to reflect different Nepalese topographical and cultural contexts (thus far, materials have been targeted to the hilly region); external TA be continued to complete NFE program development; specialists have long-term training in their respective areas to ensure continued leadership in the NFE program; and NFE be integrated into the Ministry of Education and Culture's Functional Literacy Program.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","4/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Nonformal education|Literacy instruction|Adult education|Beneficiary interviews|Limited data plus","Nepal","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAR543.pdf","1,884 KB","004451 - Language Culture Training and Research Center|001295 - World Education, Inc.","","002641 - Nepal.

"Evaluates project to establish and replicate a rural health and family planning (FP) delivery system in Nigeria's Oyo State using trained community volunteers (CV's) supervised by government nurses. Special evaluation, prepared by Columbia University's Center for Population and Family Health, covers the period 1983-6/84. The project has successfully expanded from the pilot area around Akinyele to four other areas in Oyo and has significantly increased health services rendered to the rural population; nurses and CV's implementing the expanded community-based delivery (CBD) system have been particularly motivated to reach all residents.  Project success is due in part to the careful training provided in the pilot area by staff of the original implementor - the University College Hospital (UCH) - for Oyo personnel, who are gradually assuming control of expanded activities.  More so than positive political feedback (e.g., resulting from the politically popular use of traditional birth attendants - TBA's - instrumental in increasing FP acceptance) or publicity, word of mouth among health professionals and elites has generated demand for project replication in nearby areas. CV's have effectively provided home health visits and referrals to health centers; wardmaids in particular have assisted nurses well with supervision and FP education.  While most CV's are illiterate, 90% have learned to diagnose and treat a few common illnesses; the project has notably developed a pictograph-based sheet for CV recordkeeping.  FP is now recognized as an integrated component of basic health services, and while contraception is still not openly discussed (thus the importance of having both male and female CV's), use of modern FP has increased from 2% to about 10% of women of childbearing age and is reducing the practice of postpartum abstinence. The expanded project has proved more replicable and better supported than the pilot as nurses have organized local CBD themselves; the UCH-run pilot, in contrast, has led to poor supervision by government nurse midwives as CV's regard UCH staff as the key supervisors. Although it was found that variables (such as the use of TBA's) among the five areas cannot be controlled for research purposes, conclusions may be drawn from natural variations; use of a microcomputer is expected to increase data collection efficiency.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","6/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Health delivery|Rural areas|Community health care|Public health care|Family planning services|Pilot projects|Project replication|Limited data","Nigeria","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAR560.pdf","455 KB","000378 - Columbia University.

"Evaluates contract (and extension of Project 5220139) with the Consortium for International Development/New Mexico State University (CID/NMSU) to help the Honduran Ministry of Natural Resource's (MRN) Department of Agricultural Research (DIA) conduct farming systems research (FSR).  Special evaluation covers the period 10/82-3/84 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with research and extension staff, officials of implementing organizations, and beneficiaries. CID/NMSU has initiated entomological research and extension, on-farm weed control testing, and studies and training in soil fertility. Several activities in these and other areas have been done - as required by a 1983 USAID change in the Plan of Work - in cooperation with the Regional University Center for the Atlantic Coast (CURLA), sometimes to the neglect of the DIA program.  Little economic research has been accomplished as the NMSU economist has devoted most of his time to installing a microcomputer system at CURLA, other CURLA-related work, and administrative chores.  A 6-month contract extension has been proposed. Some of the problems encountered by CID/NMSU originated earlier in the project, but six contract-specific problems have also arisen:  (1) ongoing problems caused by design flaws (e.g., planning an FSR support effort to last only 18-24 months) and by confusion about the project's organizational placement, the latter contributing to a feeling among Hondurans that the project is not part of the MRN; (2) three changes in the scope of work, initiated by USAID or DIA; (3) lack of host government financial commitment and funding uncertainties affecting training and the proposed contract extension; (4) arguments concerning divergent definitions of ""farming systems research"" and ""on farm research,"" and concerning the extent of leadership NMSU advisors should provide; (5) lack of coordination among USAID's various agricultural projects; (6) quarterly project reports from NMSU which have been delayed, fragmented, and a source of dissatisfaction to the MRN because they seem to identify the project as solely a CID/NMSU endeavor. Recommendations address these issues as well as specific FSR needs.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","522-0139-C-00-2059-00","","3/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Farming systems research|Research management|Beneficiary interviews","Honduras","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAR620.pdf","1,957 KB","000490 - University of Florida.

"Evaluates pilot project funding component of subproject to increase the planning, implementation, and evaluation capabilities of the Central Tunisian Development Authority (CTDA).  Government of Tunisia/USAID midterm evaluation focuses on the period 1982-5/84 and is based on document review, a sample survey of beneficiaries, site visits, interviews with CTDA staff, and contacts with local authorities and implementing agencies. It is premature to draw definite conclusions, as the component did not really get underway until 1982 and especially as the pilot projects to date have absorbed only 4% of available funds. Two years were required for agreement on criteria for use of the funds, in part because the CTDA was not yet operational in promoting experimental projects. Also, a narrow interpretation of small-scale (average cost:  18,000 dinars, vs. an expected 100,000) and innovation (artisans and small industry were not reached for this reason) criteria has restricted the number of projects.  Of the 11 approved, 2 are completed, 7 ongoing, 1 to be started, and 1 (aviculture) abandoned due to technology problems. Only 33% of obligated funds have been used.  Slow execution has resulted from CTDA personnel and logistical constraints, insufficient CTDA monitoring and communication with implementing agencies, inadequate capacity of and planning by these agencies (in some cases resulting in underestimation of costs and lack of materials), time constraints on and dispersion of beneficiaries, and lack of integration among projects. While further efforts are needed in implementing projects, the objective of building CTDA capabilities is apparently being realized: project identification is proceeding, projects conform to essential criteria, and CTDA has led implementation of the Jilma and El Ayoun integrated development projects and has implemented one other. Moreover, the projects respond to the region's economic and social needs.  There has been an appreciable increase in family income of 350 dinars per year in Jilma and El Ayoun, even with the failure of the aviculture project, and 90% of these populations enjoy improved living conditions.  The 9 small-scale technology projects have stimulated a participative approach, a self-reliant mentality, and the use of local materials (e.g., Eoliennes have reduced the cost of pumping water), but have not resulted in the expected employment.  On the institutional level, the Government of Kasserine is implementing habitat projects using a like approach, and local authorities are requesting further and complementary pilot projects. Eleven recommendations are provided.","Evaluation period: 24 Apr-25 May 1984","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","5/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Rural development|Regional development|Pilot projects|Institution building|Beneficiary interviews|Limited data plus","Tunisia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDHAB947.pdf","1,526 KB","003923 - Tunisia.

"Evaluates Catholic Relief Service's (CRS) program to provide Title II food aid and related nutrition education and health training at maternal child health (MCH) centers in Djibouti. Special evaluation covers the period 7/83-6/84 and is based on document review, surveys of MCH and other medical personnel, site visits, and interviews with staff of CRS, USAID/D, and health and donor organizations. The impact of CRS food distribution through MCH centers has been disappointingly small.  Although CRS has spent some 70% of its management time on food delivery, commodity management continues to be unsatisfactory by CRS standards (only about half of the food is accounted for in reports received from the centers). Mother/child attendance at the centers is irregular and drop-out rates are high, reflecting, no doubt, the limited economic value of the small CRS food ration in a country in which food is readily and cheaply available (in the market or through other aid programs).  Most important, the Ministry of Health (MOH) clearly opposes the distribution of donor food within the health network. Other factors contributing to the program's lack of success are its lack of clear guidelines, objectives, and protocols and the low skills development of center personnel. On the positive side, CRS has had a unique opportunity to participate in establishing Djibouti's primary health care system by instituting child weighing and growth surveillance at MCH centers, training nurses and other center personnel, and setting up a development fund (using mothers' fees) to help pay staffing costs.  However, mother education is, for the most part, sorely missing; often, neither MCH staff nor mothers understand the individual child growth chart, while staff who do understand it do not know how to use it as a teaching tool.  Also, the master chart is too complicated to serve as an appropriate data gathering instrument. It is recommended that CRS phase out food distribution in MCH centers, transfer other feeding activities to the World Food Program if the host government so desires, and concentrate on: (1) providing health education and training to support the diarrhea control program now being planned with WHO and UNICEF assistance; and (2) expanding growth monitoring, nutrition education, and related activities.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-0000-I-15-3083-00","","11/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Private voluntary organizations|Food for Peace Title II|Maternal child health care|Child feeding programs","Djibouti","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAR800.pdf","1,635 KB","000673 - International Science and Technology Institute, Inc.

"Evaluates projects to support development of a new lands settlement in San Julian, Bolivia. External evaluation, conducted shortly after the projects' completion, covers the period 1975-10/84 and is based on review of land records and interviews with settlers and key informants. Thus far, the San Julian colonization program, which successfully transferred a highland farming population to the subtropical lowlands, has fared better than most resettlement schemes. Settlers have overcome the stresses of pioneering, and there is some evidence that they are now ready to move beyond subsistence production. However, there is also a real possibility that economic growth will not be realized and the settlement will fail. Most settlers grow staple crops and provide their own inputs; few have tried to grow high-value cash crops. As a result, there are almost no input suppliers in San Julian and only a handful of forward production linkages (e.g., a rice mill); other off-farm services (stores, schools, etc.) are only incipient as settler incomes do not generate much demand for even basic trades or services. Off-farm employment is virtually nil. None of San Julian's 39 nucleos has a functioning agricultural credit program, indicating that settlers have no incentive to risk debts in order to increase farm productivity. Slowness in land titling also limits settlers' opportunities for credit (and hence maintains their dependence on government and PVO resources). Insufficient potable water is the singlemost factor limiting San Julian's economic growth and, possibly, its future as a settlement. Other problems include lack of road maintenance, predatory burning of forests, and poor health status, the latter due to economic conditions (once A.I.D. support ended, settlers' incomes could not support health services) and to the projects' failure to train female health workers (women were neglected in general, as the projects wrongly assumed that the colonists would be young, single males). Only 5 nucleos have functioning clinics. Democratic community organization, on the other hand, is very strong; land sales, for example, must be approved by fellow settlers. This strong control no doubt accounts for the settlement's resiliency under harsh conditions and for its low level of settler displacement, and it demonstrates that the colonists have the organizational strength to develop regional fiscal linkages and to administer the resources which potentially can be generated, on- and off-farm, and which are so badly needed to alleviate problems in health, infrastructure, etc. Recommendations are included.","Companion project evaluation summary: PD-AAU-934","Special Evaluation","Documents","DAN-1135-A-00-1078-00","","12/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Settlement establishment|Agricultural land settlement|Population resettlement|Agricultural production|Agricultural product marketing|Beneficiary interviews","Bolivia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAT403.pdf","1,343 KB","000363 - Clark University.

"Evaluates Housing Guaranty (HG) to help the Government of Jamaica (GOJ) strengthen its capacity to provide shelter services to low-income families.  Special evaluation covers the period 1/83-7/84 and is based on document review and interviews with project personnel. Although the project has helped to support the GOJ's 1982 National Housing Policy (NHP), which established a framework for the provision of housing finance and redefined the roles of public sector shelter institutions, implementation to date has shown that the problems of Jamaica's shelter sector are more complex than had been thought. Institutional restructuring under the NHP may not have gone far enough as there continue to be problems in management control, cost recovery, and duplication of functions among institutions. Many housing construction and delivery functions have been improved in this project, but finance, marketing, and mortgage operations remain extremely complex, largely due to the large number of institutions involved and the complex relationships among them. Some of the units constructed under the project's Settlement Improvement and New Schemes components are nearing completion. Unless marketing of units developed under the previous HG is accelerated, a serious bottleneck will occur.  Also, the total cost for the New Schemes component exceeds the budgeted amount; the component may have to be reduced.  Construction under the Build On Own Land component has lagged.

"Evaluates A.I.D.'s urban projects in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) and reviews recent shifts in A.I.D.'s policies on urban and rural development.  Special evaluation, prepared under project 9311135, is based on a review of AID/W documentation and interviews with USAID and other involved officials. A.I.D.'s urban experience in LAC leads to several conclusions. (1) City- and nation-wide urban programs are complex and rely heavily on local institutions, the effectiveness of which is vital to program success.  (2) In private sector and employment generation projects, loan programs are slow in beginning and disbursing funds, the employment multiplier is limited, and much depends on business confidence in the economy.  (3) The Housing Investment Guaranty Program has been quite successful.  Ongoing problems are the affordability of shelter units by lower-income families, the adequacy of shelter maintenance, and the feasibility of self-financing.  (4) Rivalries and lack of coordination among the many participants involved can hinder multisectoral urban community development and integrated regional and area-based rural development programs; the latter also have difficulty retaining local management personnel.  (5) Efforts to strengthen local institutions, especially in the areas of municipal administration and fiscal reform, are sometimes resisted politically on the grounds that they weaken central powers; less ambitious but more successful have been programs, e.g., in Brazil, to train local government administrators. Under the Reagan administration, the great increase in A.I.D. funding for private enterprise has led to a decline in area-based development programs (expected to virtually disappear by 1986) and a notable shift in emphasis from rural to urban areas, a shift furthered by increasing A.I.D. efforts to adjust prices to correct macroeconomic problems. Current A.I.D. policy and thinking shows a tendency to overlook the relationships between sectors and projects (Jamaica is a notable exception).  A coherent development strategy should be devised to address the major aspects of current policy directions:  macroeconomic factors and structural reforms; support for the private sector; institution building; and agriculture and rural development.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","DAN-1135-A-00-1078-00","","7/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Urban development|Development policy|Rural development|Development strategies|Government policy|Private enterprises","Latin America|Caribbean","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAR861.pdf","646 KB","000363 - Clark University.

"Recent research on the relationship between military expenditures and economic growth is reviewed.  There are three major findings. (1) Military expenditures are easily hidden and are thus difficult to measure and assess.  (2) Contrary to conventional wisdom, high military expenditure is negatively related to growth.  (3) Specifically, high military expenditure has a negative impact on human resource development, modernization, technology transfer, and the industrial sector. Recommendations are to:  (1) increase resources for collecting data on military expenditures; (2) match any increase in military assistance with a proportional increase in economic assistance; (3) conduct country-level analyses of military expenditures so that policymakers can better understand economic conditions in countries with differing levels of military spending; (4) promote improved strategic factors as an argument for improved economic growth.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","8/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Military assistance|Economic growth|public expenditures|Economic development","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAT504.pdf","334 KB","003433 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to increase the capacity of Ecuador's National Energy Institute (INE) to influence energy policy and promote nonconventional energy.  Special evaluation covers 9/81-5/84 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with INE and A.I.D. officials. While progress has been slow, it appears the project is now at the take-off point.  In late 1983, a new executive director reorganized INE, producing a more efficient, coordinated structure and a comprehensive, 2-year operational plan.  Despite its youth, INE already possesses considerable planning and technical expertise and has gained credibility as an advisor on energy policy.  INE personnel have been trained through overseas workshops and short-term courses (15 as of 3/84).  Energy studies published by INE seem to be of high technical quality. During 1981/82, however, INE's relative inexperience obliged it to take a ""go-slow"" approach while gaining fiscal capacity and technical expertise.  As a result of this and other factors - INE's extreme reluctance to spend project (especially loan) funds when other resources can be found; a national economic crisis; political disputes with the Minister of Natural Resources and Energy (since resolved); A.I.D. delays in approving expenditures; and frequent changes of the USAID/E project officer - most activities are 2-4 months behind.  Solutions to these problems are being at least partially implemented. Energy technology transfer and information networking, the weakest component to date, is now being emphasized.  A technology transfer group with a full-time director has been formed and will consolidate the many, but disparate, networking efforts already underway.  Development of an information center remains a key need, however. Implementation of the alternative energy (microhydro, biomass, solar, and geothermal energy) and conservation components has not always been according to plan, but deviations from the project agreement appear sound.  Significant work is being done. INE is still a small, politically weak organization, dependent for crucial data on other, stronger institutions.  Support by the newly elected government will be of vital importance.  Project extension for 1 year is recommended, with further extensions to be predicated on regular review findings.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","9/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Government departments|Institution building|Alternative energy resources|Energy policy|Energy planning|Energy research","Ecuador","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAR919.pdf","12,813 KB","001257 - Volunteers in Technical Assistance, Inc.

"Evaluates two integrated health projects in the Philippines. Special evaluation - intended to provide background data and a conceptual framework for a proposed comparative analysis of the projects - covers the period 1976-7/84 and is based on public health data, document review, interviews with A.I.D. personnel, and field visits. The Bicol Integrated Health, Nutrition, and Population Project (BICOL) provided health, nutrition, family planning (FP), sanitation, and preventive health education services to residents of 400 rural barangays. Over 400 Barangay Health Aides (BHA's) were trained, 25,000 household toilets were constructed, 241 barangays had handpumps installed, and 13 springs were improved. Except for household toilets, sanitary infrastructure fell short of target, due to funding problems and lack of management personnel, lack of planning, and inadequate communication; in fact, poor coordination at barangay and regional levels has characterized the project as a whole. Community participation in identifying health problems and planning solutions was weak; participation in implementation was more adequate, though hindered by residents' dire poverty. The project monitoring and evaluation system was nonfunctional. The Panay Unified Services for Health Project (PUSH) also addressed health, nutrition, FP, and sanitation concerns. Some 450 Barangay Health Workers (BHW's) were trained, and 30,734 household toilets and 1,738 water supply facilities were constructed. The BHW's performed satisfactorily, although with more emphasis on environmental sanitation than on health care. Nonetheless, BHW's were instrumental in improving immunization, FP acceptance, and child nutrition, though not to projected levels; most people did not utilize BHW's for curative services. A fund for BHW's to spend on small activities was well utilized, but, due to inflation, available funding per project was too small. Although environmental sanitation targets were overambitious, significant changes in waste disposal and water sanitation occurred as a result of the project. Community participation was less than expected and project recordkeeping and financial management were egregious. Included are an annotated bibliography of BICOL and PUSH documents and suggestions for comparative analysis of the projects.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","OTR-0085-O-00-4281-00","","7/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Primary health care|Health delivery|Integrated health care|Sanitation|Rural areas|Community health workers|Paramedical education|Water sanitation|Toilet facilities|Public data|Limited data","Philippines","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAR928.pdf","2,780 KB","","","000156 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to enable Partners of the Americas to establish a Women Partners in Development (WPID) Program in Latin America and the Caribbean.  Special evaluation covers the period 1982-10/84 and is based on document review, discussions with and questionnaires from implementing staff, and site visits. The WPID Program has, by and large, been successfully integrated into existing Partners programs.  It is recognized as a permanent and viable structure, has equal status with other Partners programs, and has attracted new leadership and volunteers to local Partnerships.  The program should reach most project targets, having supported the travel of 146 volunteer technicians (mainly for workshop attendance), held 5 workshops, and provided seed money for 22 projects, vs. respective targets of 160, 4, and 40; 43 of 54 local Partnerships are now supporting WPID subprojects (SP's).  The project development (1) and regional (4) workshops, with their built-in week-long follow-up activities in participants' countries, have been the most effective means of building Partnerships' capabilities and engaging them in SP's, although other program areas (i.e., community education, agriculture) have generated spin-off SP's.  SP's have assisted women generally bypassed by government or private institutions. Only 2 of an expected 9 program fellows have been identified, however, due to volunteer professionals' inability to take a 1-2 month leave and to relative neglect for fellowships by overburdened staff. Difficulties in identifying successful SP strategies for improving women's socioeconomic conditions have been a major shortcoming.  There is an organizational perception of the program as strictly concerned with AID-funded income generation and agricultural production SP's and a concomitant neglect of other means of increasing women's economic potential and leadership capabilities.  Also, the program lacks institutionalized procedures for approving, monitoring, and evaluating SP's and does not disseminate information well to local Partnerships, the latter due in part, perhaps, to poor communication between neighboring countries and Partnerships. Recommendations for improving WPID administration and implementation are included.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","10/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Women in development|Private voluntary organizations|Volunteers|Community self help","Latin America|Eastern Caribbean","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAR932.pdf","17,114 KB","001757 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to help Sierra Leone's National Savings and Cooperative League (NASCCLOS) strengthen and expand its network of affiliated societies (CC's).  Special mid-term evaluation covers the period 1981-9/84 and is based in part on visits to CC's. While the project's impact on credit and savings societies in Sierra Leone has been considerable, neither NASCCLOS nor CC development has met expectations because figures for active CC's and total membership used in project design were inflated. NASCCLOS met only 14.6% of its expenditures during 1983 vs. a targeted 50% (although expenditure has been well controlled and consistently below budget), due to low income from affiliation fees and stationery sales and, more significantly, to problems in collecting dues from CC's (the rate of dues payable is on target at 2% of savings, but rate of collections was only 17% in 1983, vs. a planned 80%), and to delays (arising from a dispute between NASCCLOS' parent organizations, now resolved) in implementing a planned risk management program. NASCCLOS has provided regular (and well-attended) training for CC officials (training 96 vs. a planned 52), and NASCCLOS administrative, accounting, bookkeeping, and personnel procedures have been raised to an efficient level and are fully documented in a 1984 manual.  However, no long-term development planning (and only limited short-term planning) has been carried out. Promotion of urban worker-group societies has been unsuccessful, in contrast to NASCCLOS' consolidation in the provinces. While CC's have improved considerably, without the bookkeeping services provided (to 161 CC's vs. a planned 180) by NASCCLOS field workers and regional service centers, most would be unable to keep proper records or provide statements (although 340 secretaries and 2,535 members have been trained, exceeding targets of 180 and 1,960). CC-level loan extension has been satisfactory, but loan repayment rates are low; furthermore, few CC's pay dividends on savings to attract new members. Standardized stationery is used by 92% of CC's surveyed, and standard administrative procedures are being disseminated, but NASCCLOS has failed to introduce a central finance scheme, even though this and risk management are the services most desired by CC's. NASCCLOS is now in good condition to develop further; it is vital that technical and financial assistance be continued.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","9/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Credit cooperatives|Institution building","Sierra Leone","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAR962.pdf","1,348 KB","004499 - Pannell Kerr Forster","","008602 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to support Tunisia's population and family planning (FP) program.  Special evaluation covers the period 1982-6/84 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with staff of involved organizations. Since 1981 Tunisia's National Office of Family Planning (ONPFP) has increased the number of FP centers, maternity clinics, and mobile units; strengthened regional technical and administrative capabilities; created a postpartum consultation program to further FP education and motivation; and taken steps to expand private sector involvement. Training and retraining, some overseas, has been provided to physicians, nurses, midwives, pharmacists, and social workers; various new curricula and training instruments have been developed.  Extensive information, education, and communication activities (using interpersonal, group, and mass media techniques) have resulted in widespread knowledge of modern FP methods. IUD insertions and tubal ligations provided by the public sector rose 68% and 14%, respectively, between 1979 and 1983.  The private sector is now an important source of FP services and supplies for some 25% of users (most in urban areas); private sector provision of orals has more than doubled in recent years and that of condoms risen 40%.  Data on contraceptive prevalence have been inconsistent, but ONPFP is making good progress in collecting statistics and has developed a promising computer program to calculate prevalence. Difficulties in rural FP have included inadequate data for monitoring program impact; departure of animatrices after training; a shortage of midwives, who oppose placement in rural areas or mobile units; lack of adequate transport; mobile clinic breakdowns; sociocultural difficulties (e.g., women's reluctance to be examined in the mobile clinics); and intervillage hostilities.  Lack of physician participation and of cooperation by social affairs personnel have affected peri-urban FP, though there are important regional variations.  To alleviate the shortage of midwives, a new cadre of personnel called obstetrical nurses is being planned.  Also, medical schools give little attention to FP. Serious scientific research on population topics is badly needed in Tunisia, but is hampered by severe personnel constraints.","French ed.: PD-AAS-008|Companion project evaluation summary: PD-AAQ-081|Evaluation period: 9 May-1 Jun 1984","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","6/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Family planning policy|Population programs|Family planning promotion programs|Family planning services|Family planning research|Family planning education|Management operations|Urban areas|Rural areas|Suburban areas|Contraceptive prevalence","Tunisia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAS007.pdf","3,129 KB","003572 - Tunisia.

"Evaluates project to provide Missions and LDC's with TA on environmental issues.  Mid-term evaluation covers the period 8/82-3/84 and is based on site visits and interviews with Mission, AID/W, International Institute for Environment and Development (IIED), and International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) staff. A.I.D. has  been extremely pleased with the advisory services provided by IIED.  Despite early organizational difficulties (which have resulted in management changes), IIED staff have responded well to requests for TA.  To date, 39 requests have been filled, with the majority of work having been done in three areas:  design or participation in country environmental profiles (CEP's) - 15; TA for LDC environmental PVO's - 5; and, more recently, assistance in the preparation of national conservation strategies (NCS's) - 3.  Budget restrictions (management and personnel costs were underestimated and an administrative assistant was added to the staff) have forced the A.I.D. project manager not to ""advertise"" the services; thus, the project is not operating to its potential and many Missions are unaware of its services. The pilot activity to promote intersectoral natural resource management has essentially been subcontracted to IUCN's Conservation for Development Center (CDC).  CDC has prepared a computerized consultant register and has supported development of NCS's, most notably by sponsoring an NCS conference and publishing the proceedings.  The pilot activity's goal will also be furthered by a separate activity funded under the advisory component, the development for the Asia Bureau of a systems model for the integrated analysis of multiple sectors (i.e., agriculture, energy, forestry, population, and infrastructural development and their various subsystems). The information analysis and dissemination component has been postponed and its budget of $45,000 reserved.  However, several potential topics have been identified. It is too early to judge whether IIED advisory services could become financially self-supporting, although there are indications that Missions would pay for the services.  CDC plans to make its consultant register self-supporting. To date, there has been little coordination between the project and other S&T support services to Missions.  Nor have A.I.D.'s information resources been well utilized. A.I.D. has sought ways to add to project resources:  a $750,000, 3-year supplement to be used primarily to help Missions conduct field-level CEP's; and a proposed $2.5 million extension for FY85-88. Approval of the project extension with a number of minor modifications is recommended.","Project title: Environmental planning and management","Special Evaluation","Documents","DAN-5517-A-00-2066-00","","4/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Environmental research|Natural resource management|Environmental planning|Technical assistance","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAS010.pdf","11,751 KB","000669 - International Institute for Environment and Development","","000185 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to upgrade agricultural extension (AE) in Antigua, Dominica, Montserrat, St. Kitts/Nevis, St. Lucia, St. Vincent, and Belize, as well as the University of the West Indies' (UWI) Department of AE.  Special evaluation covers the period 1982-10/84 and is based on document review, 15 farmer case studies, and interviews with farmers and government, AE, project, private sector, and regional personnel. The project has made progress toward most goals, being especially effective in motivating ministry attention to, and administrative restructuring of, AE.  National agricultural planning committees have been formed, job descriptions formulated, and communication lines, management procedures, and concrete work plans (the latter for national, district, and extension agent (EA) levels) developed in most countries. EA supervision has been strengthened through supervisor training, and performance and reporting standards.  The establishment of a regional program to recognize outstanding EA's has helped increase professionalism and morale. AE continues to be hindered by lack of materials, transportation, and housing and by limited formal training of EA's, but the project has demonstrated potential for significant impacts on farmers (in, e.g., crop diversification and quality, and fertilizer/pesticide use); in 1984 farmer contacts increased by 50% over 1983. Although the project has significantly increased in-country and regional training opportunities, two key programs - Diploma in Agriculture and in Extension - have fallen short of expectations, the former plagued by lack of qualified candidates who intend to work in AE, the latter being too theory-oriented.  Inservice communications training has helped compensate for weaknesses in the UWI communications course resulting from lack of equipment. While the project provided equipment and vehicles well suited to needs, delivery of these items was usually delayed. Project outreach staff have set a positive example through their hard work and dedication.

"Evaluates project to develop the regional agricultural research, education, and extension capabilities of the University of the South Pacific (USP).  Special evaluation covers the period 1980-5/84 and is based on document review, site visits, and discussions with regional and national agriculture personnel, students, and project staff. The project has made reasonable progress, despite a mediocre beginning, due much to the exceptional performance of the 3 technical advisors (TA's) currently assigned (4 more are being recruited); personal interaction is proving to be one of its most successful elements.  Outputs have been commendable in education - TA's have provided assistance in 5 subject areas and the library (which is becoming a respected center) - but at the expense of research and extension.  TA's have spent far more time teaching on campus than on research and extension combined; in fact, the extreme divergence between USP's interpretation of teaching as the priority responsibility and project intent was a severe problem early on.  Still, 16 students have graduated from the new teaching certificate program and are returning home to work, and participant training has had above average success, although the number of postgraduate awards was cut from 10 to 6. Most or all scholarships have been used for certificates, not degrees. Progress has been only fair in extension; results did not materialize until the current TA's reported in 1982. Agricultural liaison officer (ALO) networks have been established in the Cooks, Fiji, Solomons, Niue, Tonga, and Vanuatu, and an ALO is scheduled for Western Samoa; there has been great variance in duties, however, and greater clarity is needed, in part to avoid duplicating national services.  ALO's, most located within Ministries of Agriculture, have received 2-3 week training and have fostered linkages with related organizations. While two TA's have conducted research relevant to the region, overall research progress has been poor.  Crop research has reached its limits under personnel and logistical bottlenecks, and research results have neither been published (extension work has contributed to several articles) nor stimulated the adoption of advanced technology. The project suffered early on from being one A.I.D.'s first projects in the region.  It is recommended unequivocally that the project be extended for 5 years, as there is no better vehicle than USP for A.I.D.'s agricultural development goals.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/ASIA-C-1447","","5/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Regional development|Institution building|Agricultural colleges|Agricultural education|Agricultural research|Agricultural extension|Beneficiary interviews","Oceania","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDCAJ896.pdf","2,395 KB","001230 - University of Hawaii at Manoa.

"Evaluates OPG to International Human Assistance Programs, Inc. (IHAP) to establish an indigenous plantation management training center and to support rural self-help and women in development (WID) subprojects (SP's) in Vanuatu.  Mid-term Mission evaluation covers the period 6/81-10/84 and is based in part on interviews. IHAP has effectively met project targets, although problems in hiring and fielding a trilingual advisor delayed implementation for 6 months. IHAP has successfully played a catalytic role, and through its Vanuatu and New York offices has established good working relations with governmental and nongovernmental agencies (especially the Canadian University Service Overseas). Some 95% of construction on the Plantation Management Training Center (PMTC) was completed within 10 months after the advisor arrived in 1/82, and a comprehensive, skills-oriented curriculum was prepared for the PMTC, which trained its first class of 17 students between 11/82 and 8/83; a second class of 19 entered in 6/84.  As a result of PMTC development, a cooperative-type Plantation Support Association representing Vanuatu's major plantation islands has been established through another OPG. The project has also provided commodities to 13 small rural community development SP's and to 22 WID SP's as well as grant assistance to the Nasonal Komuniti Development Trust (NKDT) to supplement its small-loan revolving fund.  While the small, village-level SP's have had a definite beneficial effect, the result has also been a package of micro, narrow, dispersed, and costly interventions. Lastly, with funding drawn from the three planned components, a pilot component was added in 1/84 to train village entrepreneurs in assessing the profitability of their enterprises; expatriate consultants and five indigenous trainers carried out a training program on a rural island, and 53 small businesses have been serviced. It is recommended that the project be extended to 4/85 to complete remaining activities.  Formulation of a new OPG should consider: extending support for the PMTC for 2 years, especially to upgrade staff; implementing future pilot activities through indigenous organizations from the start; favoring large over small SP's; and increasing grant support to the NKDT.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","879-0251-G-00-1002-00","","9/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Private voluntary organizations|Rural development|Plantations|Management training|Training centers|Agricultural management|Women in development|Pilot projects|Small scale enterprises|Limited data plus","Vanuatu","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAS121.pdf","7,925 KB","004532 - Prodeva Consultancy Services, Inc.","","000039 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to conserve and stabilize watershed areas in the highland regions of and provide a natural renewable energy and commercial resource for Sri Lanka.  Interim outside evaluation covers the period 7/80-12/84 and is based on document review, interviews with officials of USAID/SL and the Ministry of Lands and Land Development's Forest Department (FD), and a visit to the Upper Mahaweli Catchment area. In terms of institutional development, the project has been a success, and has enabled the FD to acquire the technical and managerial ability to undertake a large-scale planting project. Key staff have been trained and have returned to positions to authority; a national forestry extension plan has been developed and presented to the Ministry; forest research capability has been strengthened; and the National Forest College has expanded its curricula to train Forest Officers for the first time. However, the project will fail to meet its overly ambitious acreage planting, short-term staff training, and construction targets. A full-time Chief of Party with managerial and technical experience and who divides his/her time between Colombo and field offices is needed to supplant the inadequate TA provided by short-term consultants.  USAID must document changes, e.g., alterations in FD's spacing system for fuelwood plantations, which have been agreed to verbally. The main lesson learned is that a full analysis at the design stage of the actual number of host government staff needed for the project and of host government budget restrictions would have permitted the establishment of more realistic targets and cost components when the project was amended in 1983. The project should be continued, but project documentation should be revised to state that institutional development is its primary purpose and that targets - in forest plantings, staff training, and building construction - are being reduced.  Given these reductions, it will not be necessary to obligate the $2 million planned for FY85.","Project no. in title is incorrect","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","12/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Natural resource management|Water management|Reforestation","Sri Lanka","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAS123.pdf","1,976 KB","","","008606 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to enable small farmers in eight land settlements in Thailand to use their land effectively through techniques replicable throughout the Northeast region.  Final special evaluation covers 1979-ll/84 and is based on document review, site visits, household surveys, and interviews with officials and staff of participating agencies. Due to a delay in implementation, the project was active for less than 3 years, and ended just as it was beginning to build momentum.  The major implication of this experience may be that A.I.D. should be more flexible in setting timeframes, particularly in projects aimed at changing traditional attitudes and practices, an inherently slow process. Project management was excellent; much time spent in the field by Thai Department of Public Welfare project managers was a major factor, and volunteer organizations were a positive component. The degree of beneficiary participation accorded with the project design, resulting in better use of scarce local resources, particularly in agriculture, and the beginning of an organizational base for continued ""bottom up"" activities.  A marginal improvement in beneficiaries' standards of living occurred, and in a relatively short time the project contributed to the sustainability of agriculture in the land settlements. However, these gains could be lost unless agricultural extension agents remain in the area for the next 2 or 3 years.  To date, infrastructure projects (e.g., roads, water) have contributed little to the settlements, but - even though growth in farm production will probably fall short of that hoped for - the long-term return on project investments should be quite acceptable. Most research and field demonstration activities made satisfactory progress, but coordination between researchers and extensionists was poor and data collection was hampered by the latter's inexperience. Also, while baseline data collected for the project evaluation were of good quality and data analyses well done, a reduction in the scope of follow-up data collection precluded meaningful evaluation of individual settlements; nor was the use of a quasi-experimental study design particularly effective. The overall project methodology is replicable, and will probably be used in similar projects.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","11/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Community participation|Agricultural productivity|Agricultural land settlement|Beneficiary interviews","Thailand","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAS124.pdf","3,257 KB","008613 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to increase agricultural production in Niger by expanding and improving national-level support services. In-house evaluation covers the period 8/82-12/84 and is based on document review and interviews with Government of Niger (GON) and A.I.D. officials. Implementation has been delayed for over a year.  Retarding factors have included the time needed by the GON to meet the Conditions Precedent and delays in procuring TA through an educational institution. The major factor, however, was a 1982 shift in GON strategy and policy to stress increased participation by cooperatives in rural development, agricultural management, and the distribution of agricultural inputs and credit, as well as increased participation by the private sector in the provision of inputs and credit.  This new GON strategy led to a redesign of the project's input supply and cooperative training components; the redesign eliminated construction and equipping of a warehouse for the Centrale d'Approvisionnement (CA) and proposed the development of economically profitable cooperatives at all levels.  The latter initiative includes establishing a Bank Guarantee Fund to serve cooperatives; local training at the cooperative level and later at higher levels; studies of agricultural machinery and animal traction and of the possibility of using indigenous phosphate deposits to reduce dependence on fertilizers from Nigeria; and a program to assist small enterprises with their production process. Nine recommendations are made in regard to the input supply and cooperative training components; chief among them is to transfer CA activities to the cooperatives.  Also included are 28 other recommendations in regard to:  (1) agricultural policy and planning (with a stress on generating reliable agricultural statistics); (2) linking of research and extension, currently a serious project shortcoming; (3) participant training (with a stress on the need to have remaining participants begin training in 1985); (4-5) overall and USAID project management; (6) the importance of including women in project activities; and (7) seed multiplication.  It is noted that the GON has an emergency plan for collecting seed during the shortages expected in 1985.","Evaluation period: Nov-Dec 1984","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural management|Agricultural cooperatives|Agricultural policy|Limited data","Niger","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDBAV456.pdf","628 KB","008585 - USAID.

"Evaluates malaria control project in Timor Island, Indonesia. Special evaluation covers the period through 12/84; no methodology is given. While the project's house spraying operations have drastically reduced the incidence of malaria in Timor, several problems (most importantly, financial and personnel constraints) must be addressed. Delays in release of project funds (due to late and improper document preparation) have postponed malariometric surveys and spraying operations planned for Sept./Oct. 1984; the latter will not get underway until well after the start of the rainy season. Equally serious are personnel constraints - especially the difficulty of recruiting, training, and retaining local personnel in East Timor. Without local personnel, Timor will have no prospects for achieving a self-sustaining malaria control program. Furthermore, recruitment of experienced temporary personnel from Java and Bali has been impeded by a decision to restrict per diems to 14 days, when 30 days would be minimum to be cost effective.  Personnel problems have also resulted in the lack of entomological data collection in East Timor and very little (limited species and density surveys) in West Timor.  No M.Sc. medical entomologist is currently assigned to either province.  Three assistant entomologists were trained in East Timor, but those positions are now vacant.  Two assistant entomologists in West Timor require refresher training and administrative assistance to carry out entomological studies. Also, a shortage of and/or misuse of vehicles has hampered field operations.  With the project 80% completed, only half of the $140,000 set aside for vehicles has been spent. Specific recommendations are provided for coping with these constraints, as well as recommendations aimed at:  upgrading the quality of examination of malaria slides; developing an overall training plan for both provinces; and assigning an experienced malariologist to provide TA, especially in the area of training. It is also suggested that the project be extended 2 to 3 years, with its goals and objectives revised in light of performance to date.","Also available as PD-CAM-092|Full report: PD-AAW-502|Evaluation period: Oct-Nov 1984","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","12/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Disease prevention and control|Malaria|Pesticide spraying|Limited data","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDCAJ724.pdf","324 KB","008558 - USAID.

"Evaluates OPG to the High/Scope Educational Research Foundation (HSERF) to train 4 other PVO's and thus improve preschool and day care education in Latin America and the Caribbean, especially on behalf of the poor.  A.I.D./HSERF midterm evaluation covers the period 10/81-1/84 and is based on document review, visits to all participating day care centers, and interviews with all key project personnel. Support for the project is strong at all levels, in large measure due to overwhelming satisfaction with the HSERF approach to training and TA. In the 3 subprojects (SP's) implemented thus far, participants rated training content and delivery very high, and considered the training insufficient only in that they wanted to learn more.  Common to all SP's and responsible for the high rating has been a view of training as a participatory, decisionmaking process facilitated by the trainer which participants can adapt to their own situations. Dissimilarities in training method and quantity resulted from differences in the nature and purposes of the SP's.  The CRS SP (which involved the greatest quantity of training) trained a large number of paraprofessional personnel for 15 day care centers and required a complicated cycle of training, evaluation, and training; the community development-centered SP in Bolivia used an experienced local professional to provide full-time TA; and short-term consultancies by HSERF staff and other ""outside"" consultants were most successful in the Quito SP, where the initial tasks were primarily research and the number of staff to be trained was small. The most significant impact of training has been to change organizational behavior, both in terms of space and time organization and in the forms of activities now undertaken with children.  The focus of early childhood intervention has broadened from day care only to preschool education and education for the family as a unit (and children have in turn become more sociable).  This impact, while strong, has remained somewhat localized on the immediate beneficiaries of TA. Progress toward institutionalization has also been favorable, but not as marked and stable as training.  Participants unanimously agree that the project merits long-term support but are unsure how to create the organizational structure needed to sustain the effort.  Virtually all the efforts of participants to promote institutionalization have been triggered and guided by HSERF, which has consistently stated that continuation will depend on its institutionalization as an ongoing effort and that the development strategies chosen should be those that can assure project continuity.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","LAC-0615-A-00-1057-00","","1/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Educational development|Preschool education|Child care|Day care services","Latin America|Caribbean|Bolivia|Ecuador|Peru","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAS139.pdf","1,243 KB","004542 - High/Scope Educational Research Foundation","","001373 - USAID.

"Evaluates project in Ecuador to strengthen rural institutions, disseminate small farm technologies, and establish a Rural Technology Transfer System (RTTS).  Special evaluation covers the period 1980-84 and is based on document review, site visits to 10 of 12 subprojects (SP's), and interviews with USAID, SP, administrative, and technical personnel. While its basic objective remains sound, the project's design was overly ambitious, unrealistic, and at times almost self-destructive. Project administration and financing have been most ineffective. CONACYT, the implementing agency, was established after project approval and did not participate in the project's design; as its operations got underway, CONACYT found the requirements for TA and training too stringent and inflexible, and felt that it did not have the necessary flexibility to adapt SP's to the priority needs of Ecuador.  As a result, CONACYT has virtually ceased to approve any kind of TA or training for the past year and a half, and has prevented the University of Florida from performing its function.  In addition, the project plan to establish informal collaborative linkages among rural institutions required an implementing agency with strong administrative, planning, and technical capacity; it was unrealistic to expect CONACYT, a new institution, to have these capacities, or the Government of Ecuador to be able to provide sufficient counterpart funds. TA in the SP's has been effective at the technician level but has been less so at the level of top management and administration. Training has been uneven and too closely tied to specific SP's; the lack of management training at CONACYT has also limited the quality of training in the SP's.  Nonetheless, some positive results in institution building are evident among the 12 SP's. Funds for private sector research have not yet been used. A major redesign is strongly recommended to:  focus on technical training (in-country and U.S. short-term and degree training and English language training); specify a limited number of institutions for investment and to form the primary advisory council; strengthen appropriate SP's; create a follow-on SP to the Machala University brucellosis SP; reconstitute the administrative services agency and the technical services contract; select a new lead institution; establish a training SP; and identify research priorities as they relate to redesigning the project.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","7/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Rural development|Technology transfer|Institution building","Ecuador","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAS189.pdf","10,181 KB","","","008538 - USAID.

"Evaluates AID-supported research conducted by the Bangladesh Rice Research Institute (BRRI).  External review covers the period 1981-11/84 and is based on site visits and discussions with staff from the BRRI and related institutions, extension personnel, and officials from the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA). During its second 5-year plan, BRRI has steadily developed its professional capacities and physical facilities.  Its major accomplishment has been increasing national food production through the development of high-yielding rice varieties which can be harvested in the spring.  Other accomplishments include the development of cropping systems that make more intensive use of land without increasing exposure to risk; and the identification of major soil deficiencies and suitable low cost treatment. Also, improved varieties for deepwater areas are being considered for research.  Immediate publication of BRRI's last four annual reports is urged.  Staff development and training activities are on schedule; overseas staff training has slightly disrupted research activities. Weak management and the need to develop research priorities have been BRRI's most serious problems.  The package approach to farm recommendations has not targeted technologies to the specific needs of farmers.  It is recommended that BRRI determine research objectives and target groups, focus research on farmers' physical, socioeconomic, and cultural milieus, analyze the possible impact of proposed technology before research, and develop monitoring and follow-up systems.  Another major problem is the inadequacy of the staffing and facilities at BRRI's regional research stations.  Other problems include:  the lack of commitment to on-farm research in almost every BRRI division; the inadequate development of linkages with other Bangladeshi research entities; the inadequate number of trained extensionists; the weakness of the Economics Division; and the failure of BRRI's Board to meet in the last 2 years. The team endorses the proposal to extend the project to 6/86, but with more emphasis on upgrading regional stations than proposed.","Project title: International agricultural research centers (IARCs)","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","11/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Varietal research|Plant breeding|Research centers|Rice|Institution building|Project change","Bangladesh","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAS199.pdf","2,733 KB","003593 - Bangladesh Rice Research Institute|000672 - International Rice Research Institute (IRRI)","","000180 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to support training of paramedical, auxiliary, and community (PAC) family planning personnel in Latin America and the Caribbean.  Special evaluation covers the period 9/79-2/84 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with trainees and with personnel of Development Associates, Inc. (DA), FP agencies, and A.I.D. Despite a small staff, DA has effectively and efficiently improved the quality of FP/PAC training in the Latin America and Caribbean region.  DA believes in and respects the FP organizations with which it works; it is flexible, responsive, and nonbureaucratic; it has excellent logistic and reimbursement systems; and its staff is dedicated, competent, and accessible (though overburdened). The project is not without its weaknesses, however:  (1) the DA contract places undue emphasis on quantitative as opposed to qualitative training targets, resulting in programs which are ill-defined (""information giving"") and/or non-standard (motivational training); (2) DA has not articulated long-term training program strategies for the countries in which it works; (3) program and budget decisionmaking have been separated, the former performed by A.I.D. field population officers (with DA help) and the latter by AID/W; (4) the project's excessively narrow focus on PAC's has been a barrier to DA in developing a coherent training plan for some agencies; in some cases, physicians who have not received project training have prevented PAC's from using their skills; and (5) needs assessments, done for the most part by client agencies (often staying within the PAC constraints, rather than taking a broader look at agency training needs) have been of variable quality. A follow-on project should:  address broader organizational development goals, while continuing to emphasize training; fund a wider range of TA and training activities (including more training of private sector FP administrators); include training evaluations and follow-ups, where appropriate; and make more frequent use of external project evaluations.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/DSPE-C-0058","","7/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Family planning services|Paramedical education|Beneficiary interviews","Latin America|Caribbean","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAS258.pdf","2,882 KB","001318 - American Public Health Association.

"Evaluates project to develop an operations research (OR) methodology for improving primary health care (PHC) delivery. Mid-term evaluation covers the period 9/81-5/84 and is based on document review and interviews with project, AID/W, and Project Advisory Committee personnel. Project staff have developed an innovative, highly focused OR methodology which uses models borrowed from agriculture and other fields (which have rarely been used in PHC) to screen alternative interventions.  If the methodology is shown to work well under field conditions, it is indubitably a major advance for PHC. The major activity thus far, has been review of some 400 OR proposals, 40 of which (in 30 countries) have been funded, vs. a target of 28.  The studies focus on four areas - community support (health workers, financing, and organization) and commodity management. Proposal solicitation and review have been performed most competently and have provided access to a wide variety of PHC programs and researchers that would otherwise have remained unknown to A.I.D. Nevertheless, there is concern that the review mechanism (which does not include review by persons familiar with a proposal's local context), combined with a strictly defined research approach, limits the project's ability to respond to promising research opportunities. While other activities are behind schedule, it is expected that all will be developed in the second phase of the project, particularly the technical monitoring and comparative analyses of country studies, methods papers, and other information dissemination activities. The project has been extremely well managed, with staff showing great experience and imagination for streamlining operations to save time and costs.  Nonetheless, activities such as methods papers and technical monitoring have proven more complex than had been thought and it is clear the staff are overworked. It is recommended that the project be extended up to a year with the same contractor; 2 additional staff should be hired and priority during the remainder of the project should be given to analyses and dissemination of generalizable findings. Recommendations are also made regarding a proposed 5-year follow-up project.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","8/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Primary health care|Health research|Operations research|Research methodology","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAS260.pdf","1,975 KB","000186 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to increase trained agricultural manpower in Nepal through establishment of an Institute of Agriculture and Animal Science (IAAS).  Special evaluation covers the period 1975-6/84 and is based on document review, observation, and interviews with IAAS personnel. IAAS is at a critical juncture in its development, with most basic components relatively well established; additional demands will now be placed on it for improvements in quality.  Despite some progress in curriculum, deficiencies noted 2 years ago remain:  the curriculum is relatively fluid, extremely ambitious, demanding of students, and lacking in practical training.  Other specific IAAS shortcomings include:  an absence of reliable data on manpower needs and employment of graduates; such poor recordkeeping that not even the size of the student body (estimated at 611) can be determined with certainty; inability to project future enrollments; and an urgent need for more English language training. To date, more attention has been given to IAAS facilities than to programs; this emphasis should be reversed.  During the next decade, major focus should be on:  (1) improving administrative capability and functioning; and (2) establishing a balanced curriculum and teaching program plus viable research and outreach programs in appropriate facilities.  Faculty members should put more emphasis on improving IAAS and less on their personal status; a faculty evaluation system should be implemented. Development of the experimental farm, long overdue, should also be given high priority.  Additional, lower priority, needs are, in order of importance:  further M.S. and Ph.D. training for staff; TA in administration, agricultural engineering, animal science, and experimental farm operations; and construction and upgrading of student housing, offices, research laboratories, and staff housing. Despite large investments by donors in training and research, and countless recommendations by consultants for reforms, there has been little evidence of any effort to undertake these reforms. What is needed at IAAS is not necessarily an influx of more resources, more training, or more or less TA, but establishment of an operating principle whereby resource inputs become contingent on implementing some of these recommendations.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","6/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural colleges|Agricultural education","Nepal","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAS278.pdf","1,134 KB","000836 - Midwest Universities Consortium for International Activities, Inc.

"Evaluates pilot project to introduce irrigated rice production techniques in Tanzania's Rift Valley.  External evaluation covers 1981-84 and is based on site visits and interviews with key officials, planners, and engineers. Though the Rift Valley is a hostile environment for rice cultivation, the project, a 2-year accelerated impact program, has been very successful as a pilot project, not only for rice cultivation but for large earth-moving machinery rehabilitation as well.  The outstanding work of the project manager and his skill as an engineer were crucial factors; if such capability is a requisite for success in similar programs, close attention must be paid in training of personnel. Three unique pilot perimeters were completed (101 ha total) and a 10-ha project is under construction.  Overall, three approaches were tested: establishment of pilot schemes, construction of new plots, and rehabilitation of traditional plots.  Of these, rehabilitation of traditional plots required the least time and expense; this approach, and the building of new traditional plots, were most popular in the villages. Training - especially hands-on experience in machinery maintenance and repair and in design and supervision of project work - was a significant accomplishment.  People in the area had sufficient mechanical background to be readily trainable and personnel competence is now adequate for project continuation. Also, during the off-season, project machinery was used to aid other development efforts, providing additional observation of equipment performance as well as valuable experience for operators and mechanics. The first rice crop failed completely due to drought and it is too early to determine the project's long-term impacts.  Of utmost importance is the need to determine labor constraints (e.g., lack of draft power) to full use of the paddy fields. Also, while the purchase of cultivation rights to half-ha plots is an attractive investment, the price is too high for most farmers; future projects might offer credit. Ongoing constraints are:  low availability of water; difficulty in working heavy clay soils; scanty agricultural support services; and the lack of any tradition of rice cultivation.  Attention should be given to potential crop disease and pest problems, as well as possible increases in human, water-borne diseases.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","DAN-4127-C-00-2086-00","","1/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Rice|Irrigation|Agricultural water management|Pilot projects","Tanzania","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAS316.pdf","789 KB","001249 - Utah State University.

"Evaluates project to institutionalize within the Dominican Republic's Center for Administration of Rural Development (CADER) a capacity to provide inservice management training to public and private sector rural development personnel.  Mid-term evaluation covers the period 6/83-12/84 and is based on formal and informal interviews, document review, and project observation. After a slow start, the project has successfully utilized inputs and should achieve or exceed all targets within the 1-year extension.  CADER has developed a training program consisting of seminars, workshops, and a 5-week administration training course. Seminars and workshops, involving a range of participants from poor farmers to members of Congress to the President, have provided a forum for productive debate and decisionmaking.  The 5-week course is in high demand, reportedly improving trainees' work effectiveness.  A planned 5-month diploma course is yet to be implemented, however, and CADER's role in providing administrative training beyond what it now offers is undecided. CADER has the potential to provide cost-effective results, and with its parent institution - the Instituto Superior de Agricultura (ISA) - has the administrative and staff resources necessary to implement current training effectively.  However, given its nature as a research and education institution, CADER cannot be expected to become financially self-sufficient, and without continued outside support will cease to exist. Furthermore, personnel turnover is high due to inadequate compensation, and CADER risks losing its present staff. It is recommended that:  the Government of the Dominican Republic define CADER's mandate and develop a strategic, medium-term development plan to allow CADER to develop a support/funding base; ISA increase salaries to retain at least some of CADER's professional staff and send replacement staff for training; ISA and USAID/DR seek P.L. 480 funding to cover operating costs for the next 5 years and actively pursue sources of endowments - including ESF local currency generations - for CADER staff; and USAID/DR provide at least 2 long-term technical advisors for another 3-5 years.","Attached to PD-AAS-308","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","12/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Management training|Management development|Rural development|Institution building|Training centers|Beneficiary interviews","Dominican Republic","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAS308A.pdf","1,095 KB","008537 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to help El Salvador's Office of Small-Scale Irrigation (OPOR) implement small irrigation subprojects (SP's). External evaluation covers the period 8/78-8/84 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with OPOR and USAID/ES staff, and with beneficiaries. Small-scale irrigation, relatively new to small farmers in El Salvador, is a useful tool for increasing agricultural production, and OPOR - although it has experienced a high degree of structural instability since its formation in 1979 - is developed into a viable institution for developing these systems. The project has become more manageable since changed in 1981 to work primarily with Phase I agrarian reform cooperatives, but the co-ops have not yet proven their long-term viability and lack both short- and long-range community and agricultural development plans, as well as management training for members. Design and construction of SP's - most are open channel systems - are mainly good; construction costs have averaged SV3,477 per ha, and internal rates of return 20-23%.  The systems have been designed, however, without much farmer participation, and most are not easily farmer-manageable.  Also, while farmers are enthusiastic about the new irrigation methods, they will need much help not only in the proper physical application of water, but also in fully utilizing the systems; to this end, close liaison among OPOR, the co-ops, and other supporting services and institutions will be essential. OPOR functions that are being executed well include intra-office coordination, delegation of authority, document processing, basic engineering and design, TA (as provided by Caribbean Technical Services), and budget management.  Functions being executed moderately well include general management, agronomic and economic analysis, construction supervision, topographic surveying, and budget analysis. Substantial improvements are needed in the areas of interagency liaison and communication, postconstruction engineering follow-up, extension outreach (now definitely planned), hydrology, socioeconomic analysis of beneficiary needs, and use of SP selection criteria. Project continuation, with priority given to OPOR stabilization, is recommended.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","DAN-4127-C-00-2086-00","","8/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural water management|Small farms|Institution building|Irrigation system construction|Government departments|Agricultural cooperatives|Irrigated farming|Beneficiary interviews","El Salvador","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAS305.pdf","3,617 KB","004571 - Applied Social Science and Health Consultants, Inc.|003786 - Colorado State University.

"Evaluates general support matching grant to Coordination in Development, Inc. (CODEL), a development consortium of about 40 U.S. religious organizations.  External mid-term evaluation covers the period 8/82-1/84 and is based on visits to 10 CODEL projects, information from a formal questionnaire given to project staff, and interviews with project personnel and beneficiaries. CODEL is an effective and influential development organization which emphasizes small, community-based projects that develop local problemsolving capacities and tend to reach poor and needy communities, including members of ""marginal"" social groups. The CODEL approach has been fairly successful in generating well-organized grassroots development activities with a high level of socioeconomic impact on beneficiaries. CODEL-funded projects are given consistently high ratings in the following areas:  (1) CODEL's aims are in keeping with A.I.D.'s objectives as evidenced by the number of CODEL-funded projects included in Mission country strategy statements; (2) project beneficiaries show a high level of involvement, participation, and enthusiasm; (3) the projects have positively affected local collaborating institutions (especially obscure and/or very small local institutions, which have benefited greatly from CODEL funds); (4) CODEL projects successfully introduce new but proven technologies to a region or nation; and (5) three of four projects analyzed for cost-benefit impacts showed good returns on investment. Despite this, some criticism can be made of CODEL's development strategies, which are often ambitious and tend to spread its resources too thinly.  Also, CODEL's ecumenical aims notwithstanding, interfaith cooperation does not seem to be an important factor in local projects. It is recommended that CODEL:  (1) consider a new project evaluation system; (2) reduce the number of projects being funded in the Africa and Asia regions so as to enhance local ecumenical cooperation; and (3) prepare a publication that documents the effects of ecumenicalism on development.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-0100-C-00-3128-00","","1/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Community development|Private voluntary organizations|Religious groups|Development projects|Beneficiary interviews|Sampling method","Latin America|Asia|Africa","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAS408.pdf","3,212 KB","000088 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to conduct cereals research in semiarid Africa and to disseminate improved agronomic practices to small farmers. Special evaluation covers the period 1977-8/1984 and is based on site visits, document review, and interviews. The project has achieved most objectives, despite its poor organization. The international agricultural research centers have had some success in developing improved varieties (though it is much too soon for conclusive results suitable for widespread extension), with pest and disease resistant varieties showing much potential. Considerable progress has been made in cowpeas; maize breeding was less successful (not focused on small farmer conditions), and sorghum and millet results were somewhat limited by high staff turnover. No planned work was contracted for groundnuts. After an ineffective start, the farming systems component is providing valuable information in Burkina Faso, though with little regional impact. Soil and water management, however, has not been adequately addressed. The project's 12 technical workshops have been attended on average by 58 African scientists from 12-20 countries, and groups of 6-8 scientists have participated in peer review tours of ongoing research. Long-term training has been provided for 21 researchers and short-term training for 70. Accelerated crop production officers (ACPO's - one of whom is funded by France) are now working in 5 countries to bridge research and extension and have been one of the project's strong aspects, although more in-country support is needed for ACPO's. The project has spent far more on institutional contracts and far less on training and ACPO's than originally planned. In contrast to the well-designed technical aspects, institution building was largely overlooked, resulting in some serious management problems. The Organization of African Unity project coordinating office in Burkina Faso was paralyzed for over a year while USAID/BF and project staff cleared recommendations from a 1982 audit (devoting excessive time to the task); the office has since acquired new leadership, developed direction and purpose, and in particular made strides in accounting. The project's technical advisory and consultative committees have begun to function after a slow start and provide a channel through which member countries and donors can influence program planning. A strong foundation has been laid for Phase II. Fourteen recommendations are made.","Attachment: XD-JAC-534-A","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","9/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Semiarid zone|Dry farming|Agricultural research|Cereal crops|Varietal research|Research centers|Regional development|Small farms|Agricultural extension","Africa south of Sahara|Burkina Faso","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDJAC534.pdf","21,089 KB","000013 - USAID.

"Evaluates implementation of P.L. 480 Title II Emergency Food Program in Bolivia following the 1983 drought and subsequent floods.  Special evaluation covers the period 3/83-8/84 and is based on interviews with personnel from the implementing agencies, rural beneficiaries, and others. Through CRS/Caritas Boliviana, Food for the Hungry International (FHI), and the National Community Development Service (NCDS), the program reached 1.6 million disaster victims.  Although the program met its humanitarian goal of alleviating hunger among victims, the concurrent goal of rehabilitation through food for work (FFW) projects was only minimally achieved.  Most food distribution was made through FFW, but the projects' impact was limited by their short duration and their focus on maintaining existing community infrastructure; only about 25% of FFW projects contributed to mitigating future disaster, while 75% had strictly humanitarian value.  The lack of quality in FFW projects was due most notably to inadequate supervision and TA (partly a result of A.I.D.'s failure to approve outreach funds until after program termination in 7/84, limiting funding for vehicles). NCDS/Potosi, NCDS/La Paz, and FHI/Sucre achieved substantially greater results in rehabilitation than the other regional agencies, as they provided TA and closely monitored implementation. In some cases food did not arrive when most needed.  Distribution was delayed by the late delivery to Bolivia, problems in transporting food (and the programming of five commodities which arrived at different times, complicating logistics), and poor procedures for accounting and disbursement to the agencies' regional offices.  Overall coverage was good, but lack of coordination resulted in uneven distribution among provinces; areas remote from departmental capitals received as little as 10% of assigned quotas.  Caritas was most effective in alleviating hunger between 11/83-2/84 because of its access to regular food program stocks, use of local distribution centers, and previous experience in food distribution.  Both FHI and NCDS had severe difficulty in administering the program, overburdened by the 10,000 MT of programmed food; despite staffing and warehousing shortages, however, food losses were minimal.

"Presents final Mission report (9/80-9/84) on project, implemented by the Cooperative League of the U.S.A. (CLUSA), to improve local management of rural co-ops and co-op thrift and credit societies (CTCS) in Gambia through increased and upgraded training at village and primary society levels. The project has established a comprehensive Member Education Program (MEP) which has increased farmer members' involvement in the affairs of their co-ops and has in general created more awareness of the Gambian Cooperative Union (GCU) and of the advantages of joining co-ops.  The project has trained MEP, GCU, CTCS, and Department of Cooperatives (DOC) staff and, at the village level, provided literacy/numeracy training (the most successful and demanded activity) to more then 2,600 persons. Over 2,000 persons have been involved in discussion group activities and more than 500 joined radio learning groups; the vast majority of beneficiaries have been farmer co-op members. In addition, workbooks, manuals, and promotional materials have been produced in quantity; 3 U.S. scholarships were provided to DOC personnel; and DOC-CLUSA staff have participated in overseas workshops.  Thirty DOC staff now work full-time on the MEP, and it appears that the DOC has gained the capacity to support and maintain MEP activities. Lessons learned are:  (1) MEP numeracy/literacy training should be used as a base on which to build other educational programs; (2) although MEP fieldworkers were well-trained and a structured job set up for them, some would have benefited from more field supervision and support; (3) high salary deductions and slow allowance payments reduced field staff motivation; (4) village acceptance of the MEP cannot be ensured unless close working relationships are developed with village elders; (5) many geographic areas could not be covered by the MEP due to the limited number of co-op inspectors assigned to education; and (6) collaboration with other government agencies is necessary for an integrated approach to rural development.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Cooperatives|Agricultural cooperatives|Management training|Nonformal education|Credit cooperatives|Private voluntary organizations|Villages|Government departments","Gambia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDBAY216.pdf","138 KB","008545 - USAID.

"Presents a study conducted by A.I.D.'s Bureau for Science and Technology Office of International Training (S&T/IT) which compares the effectiveness and costs of contractor services for participant training. Internal evaluation covers FY82 and is based on document review and a survey of contractors. Both A.I.D. and training contractors lack sufficient managerial procedures.  A.I.D. has no overall system for:  (1) collecting comprehensive data on participant training contractors; (2) comparing contractor services and costs; or (3) analyzing contractor effectiveness.  In addition, information needed to perform these activities cannot be assembled from AID/W offices or Missions. Administrative costs varied greatly among contractors.  The average administrative cost was $401 per participant month while the average cost for technical programs was $880 per participant month.  On the average, as the number of participant months processed by an organization increased, the organization offered a greater range of services at lower costs. In general, contractors lack information and guidance provided by project managers on participant training procedures and policies. Contractor managed participants, therefore, receive uneven treatment in the quality of services they receive, (e.g., maintenance and other allowances, health insurance, personal counseling, etc.) It is recommended that:  (1) a follow-on study of contractor costs be conducted; (2) AID/W and Missions be required to justify contractor costs that greatly exceed those deemed acceptable by A.I.D. Handbook 10; and (3) mechanisms be established to provide S&T/IT with copies of all contract procurements of participant training activities regardless of the type of funding.  Also, AID/W should, in coordination with the offices of Contract Management and Financial Management, establish:  (1) standard formats (including budget line items and cost categories) for the submission of contractor proposals for participant training activities; (2) standardized cost categories and line item budgets for the contractors to use in reporting; and (3) a centralized system to collect and analyze such data as participant training program budgets and progress reports.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","5/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Participants|Participant program administration|Educational costs|Cost studies|Contractors|Sampling method|Limited data","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAS776.pdf","539 KB","000187 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to assist the expansion and development of small businesses in Jamaica.  Interim evaluation covers the period 5/82-5/84 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with key staff of the Small Businesses Association of Jamaica (SBAJ) and beneficiaries. SBAJ institutional development is on track.  Despite difficulties early on, SBAJ has grown into a more effective small business sector representative than it was 2 years ago.  The organization has been newly structured with a membership of 1,368, a board of directors with various committees, 16 paid employees, and two branch chapters with a third soon to open.  Marketing efforts to benefit small businesses have been greatly expanded; information programs have been initiated, including regular provision of one-on-one information and direction to business persons; and agreements have been made with several institutions to train SBAJ members.  The 18-member board of directors is composed mainly of volunteer small-business persons (chiefly women) who, though often from a humble background, are capable and dedicated to helping their sector. Nevertheless, much remains to be done.  Financial concerns have affected the morale of the Executive Director and other staff. Inadequate funding has severely hampered SBAJ's ability to deliver services to members, especially those involving travel, and has limited the ability to hire the capable senior staff needed; efforts for improvement are being made.  Planning is inadequate, e.g., the failure to submit to A.I.D. the second and third years' implementation plans. Recruitment of members is behind schedule, a failure ascribed to lack of funds and of services or incentives to join; steps to address this problem, such as creation of branch chapters, are being taken.  Also, one-on-one advice and guidance is minimal and should be increased, the overall responsibilities of the marketing office are not sufficiently spelled out, and advocacy of small businesses is still in initial stages and has had little impact thus far.  An inexpensive solution to data base software needs should be worked out and a qualified bookkeeper or accountant is needed; a Touche Ross audit is planned.  Specific recommendations address all these constraints.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","6/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Small scale enterprises|Business support services|Institution building|Beneficiary count|Beneficiary interviews","Jamaica","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAS877.pdf","432 KB","","","008563 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to provide improved seeds and cultivation methods to farmers in Burundi's highlands.  Mid-term evaluation covers 1980-4/84 and is based on site visits, document review, and interviews with USAID/B, donor agency, and Government of the Republic of Burundi (GRB) personnel. Early setbacks in preparatory activities (i.e., contracting TA, recruiting staff, procuring equipment, constructing facilities) have delayed project implementation, especially the development and operation of the Kajondi seed farm.  Production of improved seeds - for corn, wheat, and potatoes - has just been started and at much greater than anticipated cost.  Seed distribution through the companion High Altitude Food Crop Production (CVHA) project has also been delayed due to CVHA's late start-up and poor TA. Project planning and management is inadequate.  Recordkeeping and accounting procedures at the Kajondi farm are poor, despite earlier recommendations to improve them, and have made project monitoring difficult; also, little has been done to evaluate the farm's impact in the larger context (e.g., benefits to small farmers).  Daily farm operations have been undermined by problems recruiting adequate TA and managers and have resulted in, inter alia, failure to meet planting schedules.  In addition, the low levels of competence, language skills, and commitment on the part of U.S. advisors have exacerbated the farm's problems. Finally, USAID/B's project management has been short-sighted.  By focusing its energies on ad hoc solutions to daily implementation crises, USAID/B has forfeited its control over the project's overall direction.  Problems with high staff turnover and difficulties in recruiting replacements have been persistent; as a result, much of the project's supervision has been relegated to non-agricultural personnel, and U.S. technical advisors are virtually unsupervised. Despite these shortcomings, the project supports the GRB's high priority, high visibility efforts to increase food production and warrants A.I.D.'s continued support.  A.I.D. should:  (1) fund the project through FY86 and postpone for 1 year the GRB's commitment to finance half of the project's operating costs; and (2) make major improvements in farm management and project implementation, recordkeeping, and monitoring.  Detailed recommendations and yardsticks for measuring progress are given.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","4/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Seed production|Food crops|Crop yield","Burundi","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDBAS500.pdf","14,740 KB","008522 - USAID.

"Evaluates Government of Sri Lanka's (GSL's) Million Houses Program (MHP), focusing on program strategy and cost recovery. External evaluation covers the period mid 1977-9/84 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with A.I.D. and GSL personnel. The MHP has a number of strengths, which should be recognized and reinforced:  (1) the self-help approach, in which families build their own homes, works well and produces housing of good quality; (2) loan limits appear adequate for the desired product; (3) MHP marketing is effective, although no structured marketing strategy exists; (4) MHP officials are enthusiastic about the program and receptive to suggestions for improving it; and (5) MHP has broadly based support at top GSL levels. However, weaknesses exist, particularly in cost recovery and the program's decentralized structure.  The GSL's 1984 MHP implementation guide made improvements in several areas, but cost recovery guidelines were not clarified or otherwise improved. MHP still lacks a workable large-scale collections program. Collection costs often exceed payments received, and the initial 6-month grace period encourages laxness in repayment.  The present decentralized structure cannot ensure that housing and cost recovery standards are upheld; the authority of District managers needs to be better defined.  Also, the interest structure is unfair to low-income borrowers, and loan reporting and accounting systems do not provide adequate information for decisionmaking.  Of 5 MHP components envisioned, only the Rural Subprogram is operational. It is recommended that the GSL: (1) turn loan disbursement and collection over to private commercial banks (e.g., the Bank of Ceylon and the People's Bank) and maintenance of individual accounts to the State Mortgage Investment Bank (SMIB); (2) develop an automated management information system covering individual loans and overall program activity, available to MHP staff at Ministry, District, local, and village levels and with access to the SMIB system; (3) help village offices develop a plan to strengthen and increase the uniformity of their roles in MHP marketing, promoting private sector lending, and assisting in debt recovery; (4) simplify loan agreements, streamline lending procedures and documentation requirements, and review the enforceability of the loans' term with respect to the guarantor; (5) develop uniform policies and strategies for resolving serious delinquency; and (6) implement a system to monitor and evaluate MHP performance at all levels.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","9/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Housing","Sri Lanka","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAT162.pdf","1,992 KB","004707 - CMS, Inc.","","002960 - USAID.

"Evaluates OPG to Aid to Artisans (ATA), a U.S. organization, to establish a facility and system in Honduras (ATA/H) through which to help local artisans design, produce, and sell crafts for export. Special evaluation (no time frame is given) is based on an examination of project documents, financial management, and the ATA system; market testing; and interviews with ATA staff, representatives of producer groups, and 11 artisans. ATA has come a long way, first, in establishing a place for Honduras in the U.S. craft and gift markets, and, secondly, in proving that a private organization using a business appproach to development can significantly increase the export competitiveness of a country like Honduras.  In every case examined, furthermore, craft producers have increased their income, often substantially. ATA has trained a competent staff, now providing TA to artisans throughout Honduras, and has established an office/showroom complex. ATA has acknowledged the need to recruit and train Honduran designers/promoters. ATA/H is making good use of the funds made available to it, and the introduction of greater specificity and supervision into the initally haphazard small grants program has increased the program's effectiveness.  ATA has been using a high percentage of total funds for administration, however, perhaps due in part to the high cost of design and marketing support. The potential impact of the project is tremendous.  However, more than 2 - or even 4 - years are necessary to establish an ongoing, independent, and stable institution capable of providing product development and marketing assistance.  The project has also shown that ATA needs to develop a clear work plan. It is recommended that ATA:  select and train designer/promoters; hire a Honduran-based manager; communicate more with other Honduran craft organizations and funding sources; encourage craft producers to open roadside markets; increase efforts to make the artisan feel a part of ATA; and do more to improve members' business skills.  It is also recommended that A.I.D. maintain, and if possible increase, support to projects that enable rural dwellers, and especially artisans, to remain in rural areas.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Artisans|Export promotion|Institution building|Beneficiary interviews","Honduras","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAT203.pdf","2,322 KB","004717 - John A.

"Evaluates Economic Support Fund (ESF) program in the Philippines since the 1979 Amendments to the Military Bases Agreement. AID/Government of the Philippines (GOP) review covers the period 1979-9/84 and is based on discussion with officials from USAID/P, the GOP's Development Projects Fund Secretariat (DPFS), and local governments; review of DPFS reports and written operating procedures; and visits to Region III projects. GOP use of ESF peso resources has been overseen from the ministerial level by the DPFS.  Dollars have been transferred to joint activities as agreed upon in 1979, but at a disbursement rate below target; delays in the flow of financial releases (especially at the cash disbursement certificate, or CDC, stage) resulting from GOP austerity measures and from special approval procedures for contracts over 2 million pesos have held up SP implementation for up to a year.  The program requirement that pesos be used within one year is clearly too ambitious:  many activities take two years, and some rural energy activities will take longer. Nevertheless, U.S. and GOP objectives have generally been achieved; valuable infrastructure is in place, under construction, or planned, and local communities have been involved in the development process to a greater extent than before.  Most financial and administrative delays have been overcome and DPFS and USAID/P are seeking ways to further speed funds release and contract approval.  The trend for most SP's is to start slowly and later achieve a more rapid implementation pace; exceptions have problems not connected to general DPFS/USAID procedures. Lessons learned include:  (1) planning should be based on 2-5 year projections, revised annually, rather than on a year-to-year basis; (2) the need for rapid disbursement remains, but can be tempered by concerns for development merit; (3) use of fixed amount reimbursement could avoid the problem experienced in Schools I requiring detailed accounting for close-out; (4) CDC-related delays achieve no apparent purpose - solutions should be urgently sought; (5) maintenance problems (evident on roads and possible in markets) cast doubt on the wisdom of further investment in SP's subject to poor maintenance; (6) tensions between local and central governments are inevitable where SP's balance their interests, and while overall a good balance has been struck, the benefits of greater local participation need continued emphasis; (7) the DPFS must be strengthened to handle the increased engineering workload to come; (8) evaluation and reporting of successful activities are inadequate. Unresolved issues concerning the focus of development (e.g., area vs. sectoral approaches) remain.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","9/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Economic Support Fund|Nonproject assistance|Limited data plus","Philippines","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAT253.pdf","845 KB","008592 - USAID.

"Evaluates grant to International Human Assistance Programs (IHAP) to undertake pilot activities in training, health care, agriculture, and miscellaneous rural development in the Cook Islands.  Mid-term external evaluation covers the period 9/80-6/84 and is based on document review, visits to 20 of the project's 30 activity sites, and interviews with Cook Island Government (CIG) officials and the IHAP project manager and staff. Most of the 20 pilot activities examined are worthwhile and consistent with long-term CIG goals of encouraging income and employment generating enterprises, but only two hold promise for a wider, more sophisticated future interventions.  Of these, the first demonstrated a potential for oyster pearl and shell cultivation in Rakahanga and Manikiki islands by providing lantern nets for spat (oyster egg) development, thereby furnishing strong argument for a coastal fishery development program.  The second supported a Peace Corps project which demonstrated solar energy panels and a locally produced fish drying oven; the latter has immediate utility as well as considerable value to a potential coastal fisheries program. The objective of undertaking pilot interventions that could be expanded in the future was probably too ambitious.  Most project activities have been narrowly focused.  Choice of activities is based on requests by Island Councils or by Ministry officials and, due to the wide range of requests, their small monetary value, and the limited funds available to hire experts, the activities necessarily address only a small part of what might, or might not, be a larger developmental problem.  CIG's Department of Planning (which, theoretically at least, would view each request in the larger developmental context) has removed itself from the approval process. Planned TA to Tumu Korero school and to a vocational training program for juvenile delinquents was not provided, as the CIG abolished both the school and the program. The project should not be extended unless its objectives are made more modest, similar to those of an Accelerated Impact Program. It is recommended that IHAP pursue possibilities in coastal fishing, including shellfish, and include a fisheries component in an extension to its Agricultural Diversification project. Also, based on experiences with certain of the project activities, IHAP should make sure that sufficient resources are available both to fully implement activities and to cover recurrent costs, and should not undertake a community type intervention without community input into planning.

"Evaluates grant to International Human Assistance Programs, Inc. (IHAP) to help diversify and expand agricultural production in the Cook Islands.  External evaluation covers the period 5/81 through mid-1984 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with Cook Island Government (CIG) officials and IHAP staff. All 7 major project components are being effectively implemented and are on schedule.  As some activities (greenhouse construction, the radio program, and land preparation for coffee planting) have been eliminated, there are funds remaining which could be reprogrammed to accomodate supporting elements for several activities not included in the original project plan. While the project has set the stage for increased production and overall economic growth, a favorable outcome will depend on the CIG's ability to give priority to further development of the project's institutional basis and to recover recurrent costs. Special attention should be given to the training of farmers and Ministry of Agriculture personnel and to the difficult task of helping the CIG develop a process to shift the carrying of recurrent cost burdens.  The CIG's constructive attitude, the small farm population, and the project's widespread impact are conditions which favor success in these areas. Prospects for achieving the broader project goal of arresting emigration to New Zealand are less sanguine, given New Zealand's attractive economic growth.  The project should be redesigned to reflect a more modest and realistic goal. It is recommended that:  (1) planning begin to address the issues of institutionalization, recurrent costs, and critical areas (processing, storage, marketing, transport) not covered by the present project; (2) unspent funds in certain components be used to support such activities as farmer training in coffee production, procurement of nursery equipment, and hiring of short-term experts in food preservation, livestock processing, and poultry feed production; (3) a modest interest rate be charged by the revolving fund for copra drying facilities; and (4) IHAP fulfill its funding obligation and initiate negotiations with the CIG and A.I.D. regarding recommendations 1 and 3.

"Presents final evaluation by the grantee, The Foundation for the Peoples of the South Pacific (FSP), of a 1-year (6/83-6/84) project to help villages and groups in the Fiji Islands rebuild houses and other buildings destroyed or damaged by cyclone ""Oscar"". The program was a success.  Under two grants, it funded 30 projects in 31 villages, organizing villagers to rebuild/renovate a total of 453 kitchens, 94 toilets, 56 showers, and 6 community centers to the benefit of an estimated 9,725 people.  Only one project was rejected.  However, because of a long delay in the delivery of monies from the second grant, materials were still being delivered as late as 8/84, well after the project's official end. The program benefited from the efforts of the Sigatoka District Officer, FSP's Country and Project Directors, and an inservice PCV, as well as from FSP's ability to tie into the A.I.D. program a women in development project for which it negotiated a grant from the UN Development Programme.  The excellent relations of both USAID and FSP with the Fiji Government were key factorsin the program's success. Another key factor was the quick response of A.I.D.'s PVO funding mechanism.  In fact, the major lesson learned from the evaluation is that of the flexibility which enables the PVO mechanism to expedite activities which otherwise would take much longer to implement and thus not meet beneficiary needs. No recommendations were made.

"Evaluates an integrated rural development project consisting of 23 activities in the commune of Chambellan in Haiti.  External evaluation covers the period through 6/84 and is based on document review, interviews with project personnel and beneficiaries, and a sample survey of commune residents. Although the project's implementation approach raises serious issues regarding community participation and empowerment, social costs, and distribution of benefits, its achievements are quite respectable. Twelve components have reached or surpassed targets.  Major infrastructural improvements have included construction of a potable water system for Chambellan and adjacent communities and of a slaughterhouse.  Agricultural activities have had the highest rate of success and included training animators to work with farmers in vegetable gardens, organizing the distribution of tools and seeds, establishing nurseries, establishing 2 co-ops, and training in animal husbandry.  Most educational activities have been well done; major accomplishments have been refurbishing the national school and the formation of women's interest groups.  Other achievements include a nutrition program and constructing 12 (vs. 5 planned) social centers. The problems experienced in other activities were often the result of inadequate feasibility studies and/or overambitious planning.  Two planned activities were cancelled and another - involving the costly procurement and installation of a hydroelectric turbine unit - was totally inappropriate.  Several activities (latrine building, teacher training, and dispensary construction) failed because the community refused to participate without payment (which was not entirely unjustified as much infrastructure work was done on a paid basis, in which professionals were hired and, in turn, paid their workers). While the project has to a degree stimulated peasant group formation, it has also - and to a much greater degree - strengthened the local political hierarchy (i.e., the community councils and their groupements).  In many instances, community councils have coerced the poorest and weakest community members to ""donate"" labor for project activities of which they (council members) are the chief beneficiaries. The project's economic benefits have indisputably been skewed toward the wealthier population segment. Recommendations include to:  undertake fewer activities, focusing on those that will most benefit peasants, and on the areas of agriculture and agricultural research, environmental protection, and education of children; reduce reliance on the councils as much as possible; and not expect unpaid community labor.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","6/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Integrated rural development|Community self help|Community participation|Beneficiary interviews|Sampling method","Haiti","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAT346.pdf","4,297 KB","001341 - Creative Associates International, Inc.

"Evaluates collaborative research grant with the International Council for Research in Agroforesty (ICRAF) to (1) develop and test diagnostic methods to identify agricultural and forestry land use problems; (2) document worldwide agroforestry systems; and (3) develop and carry out training courses in agroforestry. Mid-term evaluation covers the period 3/82-3/84. Project purposes have been implemented as scheduled and progress has in some cases exceeded what was projected in the Project Paper.  A field tested Diagnostic and Design Methodology (D&D) has been developed and published in two ICRAF working papers. Curricula and materials for training courses have been developed, and 20 participants have been trained so far.  Only the documentation component has lagged behind, hampered by problems inherent in standardizing worldwide data and delays in international mail.  These problems in no way jeopardize the final completion of the component, however, which should occur during a six-month unfunded project extension. ICRAF has a major role to play in improving land use and sustaining small to medium size farm operations in LDC's.  It should move more directly into technology generation, however, as opposed to the synthesis and evaluation of existing technology. Towards this end, ICRAF has already established a network of research projects under its Collaborative and Special Projects Program (COSPRO) where its scientists could be assigned and work directly on applied research activities. ICRAF should also give more attention to higher input agroforestry technologies and small to medium sized market-oriented operations (as opposed to subsistence level technologies and operations). In the future, A.I.D. should encourage ICRAF to expand its training capacity, especially by providing assistance to forestry and agronomy schools in curriculum design, developing educational materials, and training teachers at the diploma and degree levels in agroforestry. A.I.D. should also provide some assistance to the COSPRO program, perhaps by funding a series of research projects under different ecological and climatic conditions that would produce new technologies. Finally, A.I.D. should improve USAID Mission access to ICRAF expertise, perhaps by altering existing procurement and contracting requirements. (Author abstract, modified)","Duplicate project number.

"PACR for a CARE-implemented project to construct water systems and latrines in seven villages in rural Ecuador.  PACR covers the period 9/80-7/84. While the main objective - to improve the health of rural Ecuadoreans - undoubtedly was achieved, it is difficult to demonstrate this with hard data.  The project did surpass its targets in a number of areas, though.  Water hook ups and latrines were provided to serve a total of 5,407 people, almost twice the original target of 3,000.  Another target, to establish community groups to maintain water systems constructed under the project, was met by organizing village water boards in each village, which are now charging user fees to cover maintenance costs and hiring villagers to be in charge of system operation and maintenance.  A final target, to provide basic health education to beneficiaries to maximize the health potential of the new systems, is harder to quantify, although serious educational efforts have been mounted and are likely to continue. Provincial staff of the Ecuadorean Institute for Sanitary Works (IEOS) used a simplified purchasing plan which enabled the project to be completed in record time, and which demonstrated to IEOS headquarters the need for streamlining procurement procedures.  Many of these have since been streamlined, and construction now takes place faster than before.  Other lessons are that (1) communities involved in the project have realized that much can be accomplished by working together; (2) the establishment of village water boards has taught participating communities much about management practices which should carry over to other development activities; (3) interinstitutional cooperation can be the major bottleneck in construction projects of this sort; and (4) attention should be paid to the capacity of the counterpart host government agency; in this project, implementation was slowed at first because of IEOS' weak provincial organization, and it was only after an infusion of funds for institution strengthening and a change in IEOS staff that the situation improved.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","","Water supply structures|Water supply engineering|Water supply structure maintenance|Community participation|Community development|Rural areas","Ecuador","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAY265.pdf","335 KB","008538 - USAID.

"Evaluates a project implemented by Project HOPE to provide immediate medical and dental services and technical support to Grenada following the U.S. invasion in 1983. Project HOPE specialists were largely volunteers, with physicians staying an average of two months.  While they performed well and Project HOPE meet its targeted goals, the Grenadian physicians were unsatisfied. Their major complaints were the rapid turnover of American physicians, and Project HOPE's emphasis on training, when Grenadian specialists were mostly concerned about service. Project HOPE's technical support was competent and valued by the Ministry of Health.  These activities are deserving of continued support from A.I.D. after the life of the project. Four recommendations are provided to help Grenada develop a self- sustaining and affordable health care system:  (1) promote self-reliance in health personnel development; (2) promote development of appropriate and affordable health services; (3) promote assistance in areas of health related to economic development (e.g., environmental sanitation); and (4) make the best use of obligated but unexpended funds under the present cooperative agreement. A strategy for achieving these objectives should emphasize: affiliation with the University of the West Indies; health planning and financing based on an improved information system; and environmental sanitation.
