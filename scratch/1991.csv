"Final evaluation of a project to establish a producer-controlled corporation, Fondo Ganadero de Honduras, to help small and medium-sized producers and peasant groups expand their livestock operations. External evaluation covers the period 9/83-1/91. The project made numerous achievements, and there is evidence that participants, which include between 800 and 900 livestock- producing families, have increased incomes and adopted new technologies.  Fondo's financial status experienced a marked turnaround in 1988 and appears to be gaining considerable strength.  The livestock-on-deposit and infrastructure credit operations are functioning well.  Returns to the various enterprise options under the livestock-on-deposit program are as follows: dual purpose, 5%-7%; breeding, 3%-6%; growing, 15%-20%; and fattening, 15%-25%.  The Fondo farm supply outlets rapidly increased sales and earnings after a slow start.  The number of outlets grew from one to three, and a fourth is planned.  A mineralized salt mixture produced by the Fondo continues to gain excellent market acceptance, generating increasing profits. In response to various market and inflationary considerations, the in-kind credit program for cattle loans was recently suspended.  Fondo also sought to improve its financial stability by modifying pricing practices and inventory management and by tightening the criteria for project participation, in effect redirecting beneficiary selection criteria towards larger producers.  While this latter move was justified at the time, a return to the project's initial focus is now in order.  All in all, Fondo management has established control of the company and is managing it on a for-profit basis, a situation that could be improved by increased stock sales (various options for which are discussed).  On a negative note, despite the adoption of improved animal husbandry practices, low calving rates continue to preclude the returns to investment that are needed to make cattle breeding an attractive enterprise choice and to achieve reasonable growth in the national herd. Three lessons were learned.  (1) A for-profit private corporation can only be expected to actively support social benefit goals when it is in a relatively secure economic position.  (2) If an enterprise is expected to become a self-sustainable and profit- oriented business, it should not be given long-term donor support.  (3) Baseline data are needed for adequate measurement of project achievements and impact.","Companion ES: PD-ABC-972","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1991 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural credit|Livestock|Cattle|Loan administration|Beneficiary count","Honduras","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABC276.pdf","3,137 KB","001335 - Chemonics International Consulting Div.|006575 - InterAmericas Group, Inc.","","008555 - USAID.

"The evolution of Nepal's health care system and the impact thereon of A.I.D. programs over the past 30 years are assessed.  Major findings are as follows. (1) Health status has improved, as reflected by increasing life expectancy, declining infant mortality, and substantial control and reduction of malaria.  A.I.D. programs -- especially malaria and diarrheal disease control, technical and managerial training of health workers, and (with UNICEF) the Expanded Program of Immunization -- have contributed notably to these improvements.  (2) The family planning program, which until recently focused overly on sterilization and did not offer a broad choice of methods, has not been a success; only 15% of Nepalese practice modern contraception. (3) Persistence of high female morbidity, maternal mortality, neonatal disorders, and high incidence of diarrhea, worms, respiratory infections, and skin diseases suggests a cluster of maternal/child health problems which do not respond well to either vertical campaigns or passive curative treatment. These problems may be associated with low levels of female education and poverty, including extremely poor hygiene and polluted water supply.  (4) The system has been dominated by the Government of Nepal's (GON) effort to fulfill its promise to provide a reasonable level of health care to all citizens. While the gains from this approach are undeniable, many institutional weaknesses persist.  Most importantly, the demand for health care outstrips the GON's ability -- especially financial -- to meet it.  (5) The private sector's role in health care is poorly defined, despite widespread willingness to use private, fee-for-service sources.  Efforts of nongovernmental organizations (NGO's) to implement health insurance or prepaid drug schemes, and NGO experience in general, are largely ignored by the GON.  (6) GON efforts to decentralize health care decisionmaking have thus far consisted of little more than formal changes in the organizational chart.  The recent establishment of a corps of women community health volunteers is a positive sign, though there is a danger that this corps will be incorporated into the system as a new ""bottom rung"" of the health bureaucracy. (7) The advent of a new, potentially democratic government gives Nepal a chance to reexamine its approach to health care and A.I.D. a unique opportunity to help chart a fresh approach.

"Evaluates two projects in Indonesia to co-finance the efforts of nongovernmental organizations (NGO's) to spur local community action and strengthen the independent sector.  Final evaluation covers the period 1974-90, with emphasis on the years 1985-90. The projects have played a key role in the development of Indonesia's NGO sector, helping NGO's to set agendas, conceptualize projects, and improve management.  NGO's supported by USAID have furthered democratic pluralism and served as effective advocates for their constituents, and coordinated the activities of independent organizations sharing common goals. PVO projects supported by USAID, such as CARE's water systems and sanitation project on the island of Lombok, have contributed to improving the lives of many of Indonesia's poor. Of the six indicators of success identified in the 1985 amendment, four were fully achieved and one was partially achieved, as follows: (1) since 1985, 25 Multi-Project Support (MPS) grants have been made, 14 to indigenous PVO's (IPVO's), against respective targets of 7 and 3; (2) the percentage of the budget used to support urban and off-Java programs was about 56%, against a target of 50%; (3) six new IPVO's, with capabilities to implement programs in line with USAID priorities, have received direct grants, two more than targeted; (4) USAID currently funds 3 IPVO's with national policy impact potential, consistent with target; (5) since 1985, 39% of project funding has been channeled through MPS grants, partially realizing the target of 60%. The objective of reducing the number of active grants by 1990 was not achieved, however; in fact, at the time of the evaluation the number had grown from 34 to 47. Despite this good record, NGO training needs are still considerable in the areas of project design, monitoring and evaluation, and financial management.  Recommendations for the next phase, the Strengthening Institutional Development/PVO Co- financing III project, are that USAID: continue emphasis on improving NGO management skills; work collegially with NGO's on the substance and intellectual content of their projects; select NGO's capable of promoting democratic pluralism; help IPVO's diversify their funding sources; and fine-tune its own management of the project.","Companion evaluation summary: PD-ABD-014","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","2/1/1991 12:00:00 AM","","Development projects|Grants|Private voluntary organizations|Indigenous private voluntary organizations","Indonesia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABC343.pdf","1,955 KB","003970 - Management Systems International, Inc.

"Mid-term evaluation of a project to encourage tree planting by groups and individuals in Senegal.  External evaluation covers the period 8/86-11/90. Although the project goal and purpose remain valid, they are not achievable by the PACD.  The time frame is too short for a forestry project, long-term TA needs were underestimated, and assumptions regarding training needs of the forestry service were unrealistic. Nonetheless, the project team is technically and administratively competent and continued support is warranted. The matching grants for on-farm forestry component has undergone considerable restructuring in response to studies conducted under the project.  It is planned to use matching grant funds for interventions in Acacia albida, block plantation of eucalyptus, and fruit and nut trees. By PACD, some 2,816 grants should be made, leading to the planting of some 4,000 ha. In the training and extension component, technical expertise for interventions other than block plantations has been weak.  While this may be improved as the training program progresses, additional TA should be provided.  Five participants have begun M.S. programs, and twelve seminars have been held for forestry agents. The media campaign has focused primarily on delivering public service messages, with little attention to developing training materials. Some progress has been made in roadside planting (30 km vs. 200 planned), but this is a new approach to tree planting and time will be needed to work out related problems. Progress has been made in promoting private sector involvement in forestry by conducting basic market studies and disseminating information to the field.  Connections between producers and buyers are beginning to improve.  Under the policy review component, the project has also provided information support to government policymakers by conducting a study on the forestry code.","Delivery order no. 2|Project title: Senegal reforestation project","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-1406-I-02-0033-00","","3/1/1991 12:00:00 AM","","Agroforestry|Forestry|Matching funds|Agricultural extension training|IEC|Private sector|Policy analysis","Senegal","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABC420.pdf","1,199 KB","001335 - Chemonics International Consulting Div.","","008600 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to strengthen family planning (FP) services in Zaire.  Interim evaluation covers the period 9/82-12/90 (against a 9/91 PACD), with a focus on activities since the 8/88 project amendment. The project has made many positive contributions to Zaire's FP program, which is well advanced in comparison with other French- speaking African countries.  The Zairian National Population Committee (CONAPO) has devised a population policy which will be an integral part of the government's next 5-year development plan.  Support to Projet de Services des Naissances Desirables (PSND), the government's FP agency, has resulted in several notable achievements; specifically, this component has: established 140 operating FP units (vs. a target of 125); opened 3 regional training centers, 2 of which are still functioning; encouraged the integration of FP into the curricula at several secondary-level nursing schools (but not at university-level nursing schools or medical schools); and provided in-country training for 849 people, and overseas training for 148 more, ranging from courses in the basics of FP to full MPH degree programs.  The project has also provided management TA to both CONAPO and PSND, and helped increase sales of condoms through the social marketing program from less than 1 million in 1988 to a projected 9 million in 1990. On the negative side, PSND's logistics and supply system are functioning poorly, and there is an urgent need for in-service retraining of service providers.  Additionally, codified medical standards or referral guidelines for FP providers are lacking; national FP goal setting is unrealistic, ad hoc, and ""top-down;"" there are too many staff and supervisors at headquarters, and too few at the field and regional levels; the definitions of terms used in reporting service statistics to PSND headquarters are not understood in the field; and FP services in clinics are generally underutilized, indicating that community-based distribution (CBD), contraceptive social marketing, and particularly IEC activities need improvement. Besides recommendations aimed at correcting the problems mentioned above, it is recommended that USAID/Z:  (1) collect data on contraceptive prevalence prior to project termination; (2) strengthen and coordinate with the A.I.D./GOZ Rural Primary Health Project (SANRU) and the Zairian Association of Family Well-Being (AZBEF) to enable them to play lead roles in implementing IEC and CBD; and (3) involve the private sector (including industrial and commercial firms) more closely in FP activities.","Delivery order no. 22","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-0085-I-00-9060-00","","2/1/1991 12:00:00 AM","","Family planning services|Family planning promotion programs|Family planning policy|Health professional education|Family planning clinics|Commercial retail sale of contraceptives|Social marketing|Beneficiary count","Congo DR","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABC433.pdf","1,859 KB","000356 - Checchi and Co.

"Evaluates a project to help developing countries to establish and improve their domestic capital markets.  Interim evaluation covers the period 1/89-9/90. Progress in the four project components -- strategic planning, TA, R&D, and dissemination of information -- has been mixed. the strategic planning component, a comprehensive diagnostic framework for conducting financial sector assessments has been developed, and assessments have been conducted in 9 of 10 targeted countries.  Use of the entire diagnostic framework has proven difficult and time consuming, however, and the contractor has been allowed to use sections of the framework to conduct partial strategic assessments.  This is consonant with the interests of most USAID Missions, which are more interested in addressing specific financial issues than conducting broad strategic assessments.  So far, follow-up TA has been limited to one country. TA services have been the most widely used and well received of the project's components.  While this has not resulted from the strategic planning activities as planned, the shortfall has been more than made up for by widespread demand from Missions and A.I.D./W Bureaus and offices. In all, 29 short-term TA interventions have been provided in such areas as stock and bond markets, bank regulation and supervision, credit guarantees, training for the financial sector, and credit subsidies. Some areas covered by the assistance, notably privatization, go beyond the scope of the present project, however, and should be left to other A.I.D. projects. The R&D component has not met expectations.  The objective of publishing four journal-quality monographs per year has not been achieved; the contract has been amended to require annual production of eight reports of high technical quality relating to project interventions.  The main problem seems to be the inability of A.I.D./W and the contractor/subcontractor to agree on a research agenda, partially because of limited A.I.D./W and Mission interest in financing research.  Nonetheless, three research projects have been completed and one is underway.  One of the completed studies served as the basis for two additional TA study projects. Information dissemination could be improved.  While a semi-annual project newsletter has been prepared as required, its usefulness to Missions is questionable.  Conferences have been conducted as planned, but their high cost has not been justified by its contribution to project objectives.  Finally, contacts with other donors have primarily been limited to the field. Overall, while much quality work has been done, the project has not attained the coherence and effectiveness envisaged for it. There are several reasons for this.  The use of buy-ins, while increasing Mission interest in the project, has also limited the influence of A.I.D./W (PRE) and the contractor on the selection of project activities.  Also, promotion of project services by A.I.D./W and the contractor has been limited.  A principal recommendation is that PRE reallocate the funds budgeted for R&D and information dissemination into a coherent dissemination, education, and promotion effort targeted at 15-20 countries.","Delivery order no. 19|Evaluation period: Jan 1989-Sep 1990","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-0085-I-00-9060-00","","2/1/1991 12:00:00 AM","","Capital markets|Strategic planning|Technical assistance|Information dissemination|Economic research|Sector evaluation","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABC434.pdf","2,997 KB","000356 - Checchi and Co.

"Interim evaluation of a project to strengthen the institutional capacity of Panama's Consejo del Sector Privado para la Assistencia Educacional (COSPAE) to implement short-term training activities.  The evaluation covers the period 9/87-3/91. Significant progress has been made during Phase I of the project, which focused on strengthening COSPAE's technical and administrative capabilities prior to initiating short-term training activities.  A new computer system has greatly improved COSPAE's financial management capacity and is also used to develop information for evaluating training programs and preparing follow-up activities; maintaining lists of potential funding sources and clients; and developing promotional and publicity material. COSPAE has benefitted greatly from strategic planning services provided by a U.S. consulting firm.  However, the exercises conducted to date have dealt primarily with defining the organization's goals and purposes, without determining the activities required to reach these aims. COSPAE has been an outstanding fund-raiser when using traditional Panamanian methods, such as dinners, expositions, and direct contributions.  COSPAE has also obtained TA to improve both its traditional fund-raising efforts and to develop project development skills to attract international assistance. The addition of a highly skilled training coordinator has enhanced COSPAE's capacity to organize and implement U.S. and Panamanian short-term training.  However, the coordinator lacks familiarity with the kinds of U.S. institutions and programs supported by COSPAE -- a weakness which should be corrected immediately.  COSPAE has also developed a number of successful procedures for implementing its training programs, though these still need to be documented.  A clearly defined follow-up program for returned participants is also needed. COSPAE was unable to carry out planned observation visits to U.S. educational institutions due to increased demands on COSPAE leaders after the change of government in Panama.  Procedures have been developed for both international and local contracting, but neither of these has been officially approved by the COSPAE Board of Directors.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","LAC-0032-C-00-9036-00","","3/1/1991 12:00:00 AM","","Institution building|Training centers|Procedural development","Panama","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABC436.pdf","479 KB","000223 - Academy for Educational Development, Inc.

"Food for Work (FFW), provided under P.L. 480 Title II, is used by private voluntary organizations (PVO's) and the World Food Program (WFP) in development projects and emergency operations as a mode of food aid delivery which requires individuals to work in return for food.  This report documents the impact of FFW programs in Africa, Latin America, Asia, and the Middle East/North Africa during the past decade. The findings are generally favorable.  (1) FFW programs have succeeded in reaching poor areas, targeting poor people and women, and delivering emergency food supplies in a number of countries.  They are especially useful in food-deficit areas and in community development projects where meals at work sites make sustained mobilization of labor possible.  How to harmonize management and accountability requirements in such situations remains problematic, however.  (2) The requirement for active participation as well as the increased provision of resources other than food (e.g., tools, materials, technical, and administrative supervision) has created an opportunity to achieve development results. However, regulations, procedures, and commodity management requirements need to be improved to more fully support development objectives.  (3) Acceptable labor productivity is achieved where FFW is provided for tasks achieved or to gangs working on contracts.  (4) During the 1980's, FFW programs benefitted from new forms of commodity use.  In some countries, PVO's entered into barter arrangements to exchange imported commodities for locally grown foods available closer to project sites. This practice reduced transport costs, increased demand for local commodities, and avoided problems of food acceptability.  Closed monetization, which provides low-paid workers the option of receiving cash wages or food subsidies, achieved similar ends, though difficulty was experienced in programming the resulting currencies.  A final section of the report presents recommendations for future programming.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","OTR-0700-C-00-9133-00","","2/1/1991 12:00:00 AM","","Food for Peace Title II|Food for Work|Emergency food distribution|World Food Program (FAO)","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNABH222.pdf","2,147 KB","003211 - Wu P'i, Inc.|006646 - International Trade Services Group","","006215 - USAID.

"The Middle East Regional Cooperation (MERC) program has achieved, during its ten years of existence, a remarkable record of success. Egyptian/Israeli scientific and technical cooperation has yielded significant achievements in the fields of agriculture, public health, and marine technology.  The projects have dealt with subjects of high priority, and both Egyptian and Israeli efforts resulted in work of considerable utility to both countries.  Good professional relationships have been established, as well as cordial personal friendships.  Despite a background of political tensions and violence in the area, the scientific work was not affected significantly. The very favorable environment for collaboration that has emerged can be attributed to five factors.  First, U.S. academic entrepreneurs have been present from the beginning to stimulate interest in the program, bring the various parties together, assist in the development of concrete projects, and help to overcome difficulties in implementation. High-level host government support has been a second important contributor to program success.  Especially in Egypt, such support has served as an important buffer for participating scientists facing opposition from their colleagues and home institutions.  The U.S. Government and institutions have also provided an important umbrella of support.  Project coordinators are another key element.  Several of the participating Egyptian and Israeli scientists have had an association that antedates the program, and the program has strengthened that association significantly.  Finally, the  continuing interest and financial support on the part of Congress have been essential. Despite the generally warm and relaxed associations that have evolved, continuing sensitivity to certain key aspects of the relationships must be acknowledged.  In particular: those relationships must represent a partnership among equals; U.S. evenhandedness in dealing with the two parties is essential; and a low profile regarding publicity is necessary to minimize the risk of media distortions. A congressional initiative thrust the MERC program upon A.I.D., which already had large bilateral programs to monitor with limited staff. Despite its initial reluctance to undertake an activity at variance with its normal work, A.I.D. has turned in a performance of considerable merit.  Nevertheless, we have heard some criticism of its burdensome bureaucratic methods.  Our recommendations in this area concern, first, the strengthening and greater flexibility in the administrative arrangements.  A second, even more important set of recommendations, seeks closer integration of activities among the various collaborators who individually are functioning quite well.

"Evaluates project to develop human resources in El Salvador's private sector by strengthening the institutional capacity and training programs of the Foundation of Entrepreneurs for Educational Development (FEPADE). Interim evaluation covers the period 1987-1990. Except in the areas noted below, FEPADE has already met or surpassed project goals.  Institutionally, it has developed an adequate capacity for organizing and administering project- supported training programs and for developing new ones.  On the negative side, due to competing claims within FEPADE for the services of its professional personnel, FEPADE has failed to develop the information system needed to monitor and evaluate its training programs.  Existing systems are fragmented, difficult to cross-reference, and accessible only to their creators. FEPADE also needs to develop realistic plans for the financial self- sufficiency of its programs. FEPADE training courses appear to be relevant and well-received. A sample survey of trainees showed that FEPADE training has increased worker efficiency, productivity, and earnings.  The technical and vocational (TEC/VOC) program, which accounts for at least 75% of project training, has already exceeded its 5-year targets by training over 5,000 persons in 343 courses covering 13 employment categories.  A total of 18% of TEC/VOC training has been directed to the export sector, mostly in apparel manufacturing; in light of the projected threefold increase in export volume and employment, FEPADE's decision to focus on the export sector appears well taken.  FEPADE has also established a successful automotive repair and maintenance training institute, Escuela Taller Automotriz.  The institute is controversial, however, since it caters exclusively to the high-tech/high- capital end of the automotive repair sector while neglecting the much larger informal sector. FEPADE's management administration training program has trained about 1,800 top and middle-level managers through 123 courses, seminars, and conferences covering 37 themes.  The program has surpassed its cumulative training objectives and established FEPADE's credibility within a very competitive training sector. Of particular note is the program's success in generating demand for an in-company program in quality control systems and procedures. The 36 scholarships awarded so far under FEPADE's scholarship meet targets for this component; 27 of the recipients have returned to El Salvador, and the majority are gainfully employed and using their technical abilities.  The educational credit program has not met expectations, however, with only 51 loans (representing 23% of available funds) made to date; the program has also failed to promote enrollment in FEPADE-sponsored training courses.  FEPADE should either dramatically increase the number of loans made or terminate the program.","Delivery order no. 20|Companion evaluation summary: PD-ABC-977|Spanish executive summary: PD-ABP-310","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-0085-I-00-9059-00","","2/1/1991 12:00:00 AM","","Personnel development|Private sector|Management training|Vocational training|Technical training|Scholarships|Student loans|Institution building","El Salvador","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABC519.pdf","2,827 KB","003970 - Management Systems International, Inc.

"Working through Provincial Development Banks (BPD's), the Financial Institutions Development Project, Phase I (FID-I) is attempting to expand the flow of financial services to the rural poor in Indonesia through the development and expansion of an existing network of village-based, nonbank financial institutions in selected provinces. The project is well-designed, competently implemented, and contains many lessons that may help USAID design future interventions, both in Indonesia and elsewhere. Because of the great variation observable in the different project areas, FID-I exemplifies the importance of deposit mobilization in the provision of financial services to rural smallholders.  FID-I and its companion project with the Bank Rakyat Indonesia (BRI) Unit Desa system offer perhaps the clearest evidence available in the developing world of the importance of a credible deposit facility as an essential part of a long-range credit provision strategy. The project succeeded in meeting what, in other contexts, would have been unrealistically optimistic institutional growth targets.  It was also very successful in reaching increased numbers of rural poor with improved financial services.  Although the optimistic target for number of borrowers served was not achieved, this failure may be due to the project's success in reaching an increased number of savers.  Project design failed to anticipate the extent to which small borrowers would substitute the financial service of a good deposit facility for the financial service of credit.  If the project design may be faulted on any one issue, it is its failure to appreciate the demand for deposit facilities on the part of the FID-I clients and the potential for institutional development inherent in meeting that demand. The most impressive achievement of FID-I institutions during the life of the project concerned the sharply increased portion of the credit portfolio funded by domestically mobilized resources. According to the most recent statistics, the project achieved 323.1% of the target of 17.3%, with fully 55.9% of the credit portfolio of the original four systems funded out of locally mobilized resources.  As of the end of 1989, the Bank Karya Produksi Desa of West Java was able to finance 100% of its rapidly expanding credit portfolio out of locally mobilized resources.  The Lembaga Perkreditan Desa of Bali -- not among the original four FID I systems -- should achieve this status by the end of 1991. The report stresses the need for a basic restructuring of the relationship between the BPD and the village units as a means of ensuring a smooth flow of services from the center to the deposit-accepting units at the periphery of the financial system. A model for FID-I systems in this regard is the BRI Unit Desa system, which has solved this problem by forging a close relationship between the village units and the bank as a whole. There is an uninterrupted flow of services from the bank to the Unit Desa -- TA, training, monitoring, and supervision, as well as an array of financial services backed up by an incalculable amount of good will in the form of the image of BRI as an unsinkable ship of state.  These services flow to the village units because there is a return flow of both loanable funds and profits to the BRI from the Unit Desa. The development potential that resides in the FID-I systems is great. An enormous amount of human, real, and financial capital has been put in place over the life of the project, much of it from nonproject sources.  This capital provides a firm basis for deposit-led growth, provided the organizational and structural problems tied to ownership and control are overcome. In seeking to make the transition to deposit-led growth, established specialized credit institutions face a major stumbling block:  as the reliability and convenience of the deposit facility becomes generally recognized by the rural population, there will be relentless pressure for average loan size to increase as former credit customers substitute the deposit facility for credit as a source of liquidity. Institutions that once successfully managed large numbers of small loans are not necessarily prepared to manage the smaller number of larger loans that is the distinguishing characteristic of successful deposit-led financial intermediation, particularly since the larger loans can be made only at sharply reduced loan rates of interest.  The reduced average yield on a portfolio of larger loans means that institutions experiencing deposit-led growth must give considerably more attention to loan quality than is currently observable among the specialized credit institutions served by the project.  This inescapable concern with loan quality is part of the adjustment to market demand that tends to make village outlets for financial services cash-surplus units. The evaluation reveals that a tendency for successful deposit-based rural institutions to be net suppliers of credit to the financial system constitutes prima facie evidence that the project and institutions respond to the demand for services on the part of the people they serve. The project should be extended until 3/31/94; this would coincide with the national and provincial governmental planning years.  A follow-on project is also recommended.  Major issues for the immediate future include extending what has been learned about deposit mobilization in Bali and West Sumatra to the other FID provinces and establishing effective systems of external auditing, supervision, and control of the many hundreds of rural financial institutions in the FID provinces.

"Evaluates project to coordinate exchange visits by black South African entrepreneurs to observe U.S. business operations.  The project is implemented by the United States-South Africa Leader Exchange Program (USSALEP).  Interim evaluation covers the period 9/89-3/91. The project is on track.  USSALEP has implemented an impartial participant selection process, pre-departure planning has gone smoothly, and the training itself has been well managed by USSALEP and a subcontractor, the Program for International Education and Training. The ten entrepreneurs who have visited the U.S. so far have generally reacted favorably to their experiences.  There is evidence that the skills and knowledge they gained, and business contacts they made, will benefit their enterprises back home.  Business and Systems Consultants (B&SC), another subcontractor, has already provided legal, accounting, and advisory follow-up support to five returned participants, and has been aggressive in helping entrepreneurs increase production and distribution capacity, generate an export order, and pursue subcontracting proposals and venture capital. Improvements are needed in two areas.  First, USSALEP's marketing efforts have not generated sufficient numbers of qualified applicants. The lag in applications, which total only 140 to date, is due in part to the newness of the program and the use of infrequent print and broadcast media to advertise the program. More aggressive marketing measures are needed.  Second, the study visits have suffered from inadequate background information about applicants and insufficient lead time to tailor visits to the different needs of each entrepreneur.  More detailed background information (e.g., financial, business sector, objectives) would greatly facilitate candidate selection and the planning of visits. It is recommended that $100,000 be added to the second tranche for follow-on activities in the United States, but that continued funding be contingent upon USSALEP's submission to USAID of an acceptable strategic plan that includes benchmarks by which to measure performance.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-2028-Z-00-7186-00","","3/1/1991 12:00:00 AM","","Management training|Observation|Entrepreneurs|Private sector|Disadvantaged groups|Participants|Participant preparation|Participant follow ups|Educational exchanges","South Africa","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABC523.pdf","7,231 KB","008330 - J.E.

"Final evaluation of a grant to the Christian Service Society (CSS), the Bengali affiliate of World Relief Corporation, for a project to implement child survival activities in five rural unions in southwestern Bangladesh.  The evaluation covers the period 1/88-1/91. CSS's child survival project is implemented in conjunction with an income generation program that provides loans to increase villagers' standard of living.  A 4% premium on interest (16% vs. 12%) is charged on loans in participating unions to offset recurrent costs.  Project activities include family planning promotion (including distribution of orals and condoms); distribution of oral rehydration solution, food supplements for very malnourished children, and vitamin A; growth monitoring; and promotion of government immunizations (e.g., transporting vaccinators and vaccines to village camps). The project has had a significant impact.  Immunization coverage is more than double that in adjacent unions; contraceptive use is significantly higher; and deaths from diarrhea much lower.  The community actively participates in project activities, ensuring program sustainability.  A cadre of village volunteers, selected by the community, has been trained to work in the program. The CSS staff, all Bengalis, view employment in the program as a career opportunity.  This keeps costs down and also enhances continuity. The staff are clearly committed to village development in southwestern Bangladesh.  Also, CSS has a strong management structure and is skilled in attracting foreign funding. CSS could improve this already effective project by adding a public health specialist to its team, developing a comprehensive management information system, and increasing health education and training efforts.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","OTR-0150-C-00-0143-00","","1/1/1991 12:00:00 AM","","Public health care|Child survival activities|Rural areas","Bangladesh","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABC535.pdf","9,017 KB","002892 - Automation Research Systems, Ltd.","","000088 - USAID.

"Evaluates a project to provide TA to improve and extend the use of soil taxonomy in the tropics and subtropics.  Final external evaluation covers the period 10/79-4/91. The project has been very productive in terms of both the volume and quality of work accomplished.  In collaboration with international donors, agricultural research centers, and host governments, the project has conducted numerous training activities, including:  21 training forums involving 1,297 participants, 6 soil classification workshops with 343 participants, 7 soil correlation meetings with 445 participants, and 6 soil management workshops with 345 participants. Nearly 5,000 soil samples from 84 countries have been analyzed, providing information for the project's tropical soils data base, the largest in the world.  The project has published and distributed 50,000 copies of a pocketbook guide to soil taxonomy, all or portions of which have been translated into 13 languages. The project has also provided 609 short-term TA consultations. As the result of these accomplishments, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's soil taxonomy is now the world system for classifying, inventorying, and mapping national soil and land resources. The project's success can be attributed to adequate, timely, and high-quality inputs; a dedicated staff; flexible, opportunistic plans; the usefulness of soil taxonomy; effective networking; and cost-sharing and support by international donors, host countries, and others.","Delivery order no. 6","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-1406-I-00-0034-00","","4/1/1991 12:00:00 AM","","Soil analysis|Classification|Soil sciences|Soil research","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABC577.pdf","946 KB","","","000180 - USAID.

"Interim evaluation of a project to help developing countries to improve dryland, rainfed farming systems.  External evaluation covers the period 7/81-4/91. The project did not really get underway until 1984 when the current project coordinator was appointed.  Despite its slow, uncertain start -- which almost led to project termination -- the project has done quite well in transferring expertise and in establishing a role for itself in the evolving international agricultural research system. Specifically, the project has:  (1) sponsored an international conference attended by 400 participants from 52 countries and 36 U.S. states; (2) arranged 4 international workshops in Africa, Asia, and the Middle East attended by 350 participants from 40 countries; (3) sponsored 3 international seminars in Asia and the Middle East for 580 participants from 49 countries; (4) conducted 4 U.S. field tours for 100 developing country leaders and donor agency managers; (5) conducted collaborative research in Niger, Morocco, Haiti, India, the Dominican Republic, and Jordan; (6) developed automated data bases and information systems on rainfed areas in Niger, Mali, Cameroon, Benin, Syria, and Jordan; (7) developed crop growth and soil and water balance models; (8) provided TA to developing countries; (9) conducted programs with international agricultural research centers; and (10) operated an information network linking scientists from the United States, developing countries, and international assistance agencies. Despite these achievements, the project could be improved through more structured arrangements for long-term collaboration with selected nations in the semiarid tropics.  It is recommended that upon its completion in mid-1991, the project be incorporated into the Soil Management CRSP. Two key lessons were learned.  (1) There is a need to compile and evaluate research data generated by earlier and ongoing projects to identify research gaps and needs and to prevent duplication of efforts. (2) Data collected on A.I.D. projects should be made available on computer diskettes to allow further analysis.","Delivery order no. 6","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-1406-I-00-0034-00","","4/1/1991 12:00:00 AM","","Soil research|Research collaboration|Technology transfer|Soil moisture|Information dissemination|Dry farming|Semiarid zone","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABC578.pdf","3,540 KB","000180 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of a project to assist the Health Education Division (HED) within Lesotho's Ministry of Health (MOH) in using mass media and face-to-face interaction for the diffusion of health messages, particularly those on oral rehydration therapy (ORT) and immunization. External evaluation covers the period 11/86-9/90. HED has improved both the quantity and quality of its output of print materials.  The project directly contributed to these improvements by supporting the addition of three new staff positions, the purchase of a computer, a printer, and radio production equipment, and an increase in office space by more than 20%.  The project also provided training on the use of computer graphics, the preparation and pre-testing of educational materials, and materials development in general.  HED also produced a daily 15-minute radio program on health, but only a small proportion of women listened to the program frequently. Immunization rates remained about the same, which means that the MOH kept up with the annual population increase, although BCG and DPTI were given at an earlier age.  The number of childhood diarrhea episodes receiving ORT increased notably both at home and in health centers during the project period, rising from 39% of all cases in 1987 to 60% in 1990.  This increase can be attributed to the joint efforts of the project, the HED, and the Control of Diarrheal Disease and Control of Childhood Communicable Disease programs in retraining health personnel in ORT and in producing and distributing ORT materials. In the future, HED needs to address the following problems:  the perception within the MOH that the HED is merely a printing house; a lack of team spirit and collaboration among staff members; a need for regular supervision and material support as well as regular reporting on activities; and the need for feedback on staff performance.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","DPE-1018-C-00-5063-00","","3/1/1991 12:00:00 AM","","Health education|Child health care|Child survival activities|Oral rehydration therapy|Immunizations|Beneficiary count","Lesotho","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABC594.pdf","1,466 KB","006729 - University of Pennsylvania.

"Assesses a grant to liberalize and privatize fertilizer importation and distribution in Cameroon.  Third annual technical assessment covers program year 1990. Despite very unfavorable economic conditions, the program has succeeded in privatizing fertilizer importation and distribution, thereby giving farmers access to fertilizer at competitive prices.  A private sector market for fertilizer has been established and participants -- commercial banks, importers, and distributors -- have responded to market demand signals. On the negative side, demand from coffee growers, the main consumers of fertilizer, fell for the second straight year due to depressed coffee prices and the still incomplete settlement of arrears for coffee sales. Once planters have been paid for all coffee previously delivered and coffee buyers are able to offer them cash payment for future deliveries, confidence in the market will be restored and fertilizer consumption should revive. Additionally, several Cameroonian-owned companies, including several not tied to the coffee sector, have expressed interest in importing fertilizer under the 1991 program, giving hope for broader participation at the importer level.  Indications of increased financial commitments by importers and increased participation of small-scale distributors also give hope for long-term sustainability of a privatized fertilizer marketing system.","French ed.: PD-ABE-071|Project title: Agricultural marketing improvement strategies (AMIS)","Special Evaluation","Documents","DHR-5447-Z-00-7074-00","","4/1/1991 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural inputs|Fertilizer distribution|Privatization|Imports","Cameroon","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABC605.pdf","1,790 KB","006381 - Abt Associates, Inc.|000574 - University of Idaho.

"PACR of a project (1986-1990) to conduct environmental profiles of select Eastern Caribbean countries. The project underestimated the time and resources required to produce the target number of 8 environmental profiles.  In the end, the project required a 2-year extension and a $300,000 cost overrun to produce profiles of only 6 countries (St. Lucia, Grenada, Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, and St. Christopher and Nevis).  Nonetheless, the profiles are considered landmark documents in that they were the first to compile a vast array of natural resource information along with prioritized recommendations for short-, medium-, and long-term proactive and remedial solutions to environmental degradation. The profiles serve as important tools for government and nongovernmental organizations to plan environmental strategies and programs.  Although difficult to quantify, evidence exists that environmental awareness was also enhanced in the general population through increased use of the mass media to transmit environmental conservation messages. The project also strengthened local institutions that were brought back into active status to assist in preparing the profiles.  These include the Dominica Conservation Association and the National Trust in St. Vincent.  Other key support institutions for the profile exercises were Dominica's Years of the Environment and Shelter Committee, the Grenada National Trust, and the Antigua Environmental Awareness Group. In St. Lucia, closer linkages were woven between the already strong National Trust and the Central Planning Unit.  In addition to these national institutions, the Caribbean Conservation Association strengthened its capacity in proposal preparation, financial management, and implementation.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","4/1/1991 12:00:00 AM","","Environmental research|Environmental degradation|Natural resource management","Eastern Caribbean|Saint Lucia|Grenada|Antigua and Barbuda|Dominica|Saint Vincent and the Grenadines|Saint Kitts-Nevis","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABC624.pdf","67 KB","001757 - USAID.

"Presents final evaluation of a project (1985-1990) to strengthen the Government of Guinea Bissau's (GOGB) Crop Protection Service (CPS).  In response to the findings of a 1988 mid-term evaluation, the project was amended in 8/88 to add $1 million for construction of zonal-level offices, warehouses, and for additional commodity procurement. As of 8/90, significant accomplishments had been realized:  (1) participant training was complete or nearing completion for four Bachelors' and three Masters' degrees, with three additional project staff receiving Bachelors' degrees under a regional training project and numerous staff having received third-country and in-country training; (2) four zonal-level warehouses and office and residential facilities were constructed; (3) a national single side band radio net, with fixed and mobile units, was in place and functioning; and (4) over 80 national, zonal, and district-level personnel were providing crop protection services in such areas as storage, biocontrol, diagnostics in entomology and plant diseases, as well as technical support to other government agencies in plant protection, vertebrate pest control, pesticide legislation, and plant quarantine.  Thus, the foundations for a solid crop protection research and service in Guinea Bissau exist. However, given A.I.D.'s decision to cease funding the CPS, the program's continued operations are in jeopardy.  The GOGB is committed to continuing to fund CPS personnel throughout the country.  A.I.D., however, has funded many of the service's operating expenses, including facilities maintenance and office supplies.  Thus, although personnel will still be in place and will be paid, they may lack funds to carry out their work.  Two primary crop production zones may continue to operate with other donor financing, through area-specific rural development programs, but the other two zones' operations are in question. The CPS also established impressive linkages with a number of regional and international research and service agencies under A.I.D. funding.  Some of these, with U.S. and European organizations, will no doubt continue.  Others, with African organizations more dependent on external funding, may cease as travel and communications funds cease. Thus the CPS' ability to diagnose and deal with emergency or new pest problems is in question. Finally, although the service has grown and developed a number of basic organizational systems in a remarkably short period of time, given conditions in Guinea Bissau, its basic administration and management are still limited.  Withdrawing support now will have a serious impact upon the ability of CPS staff to maintain services and sustain the organization during what is to be a turbulent adjustment period. The evaluation recommends that, despite the imminent termination of the project, A.I.D. continue to maintain some level of oversight and concern for the CPS, specifically  with regard to identification of other potential donors and to provide training and TA through regional A.l.D. mechanisms.  Assuming that some level of other donor support is found, the evaluation recommends that the CPS maintain its links with regional and international agricultural research and training organizations which have provided support in the past, and continue its efforts to expand applied research in critical areas.  Efforts to train farmers, CPS regional staff, and senior management must remain an area of strong emphasis. In the long run, the GOGB must assume primary responsibility for the staffing and operations of the CPS.  A nation's food and fiber supply is dependent upon a strong, well trained, national CPS.  Due to A.I.D.'s assistance over the last decade, Guinea Bissau now has such a service. The ability of the country to reach its goal of food self sufficiency will largely depend on the GOGB's willingness and ability to provide continuing support to the CPS.

"Summarizes lessons learned in the design of sector grants in Niger, which have dominated USAID/N's program since 1982. The major lesson learned is that there is no definitive answer on what works and what doesn't.  Thus, maximum flexibility should be built into design and implementation.  Every assumption must be tested, and no aspect can be assumed to function without continual monitoring, frequent status reviews, and, in many cases, periodic re-design. In the case of Niger, USAID/N and other agencies were overly optimistic in defining expected results; the economic gains anticipated from stabilization and structural adjustment programs did not occur. Expectations should be modest, and justification should be based not only on economic effects, but on human impacts as well. The Mission has not totally resolved the issue of how to measure impact, but program designers have learned to be as clear as possible in stating anticipated effects and defining monitoring needs.  The more defined plans are at the design stage, the easier it is for later reviewers to use or modify them. Measuring the impact of local currency funds is particularly cloudy; no comprehensive guidance on the subject exists.  The sector grants in Niger have all used somewhat different approaches in programming local currency.  One gave preference to the partial funding of agriculture projects, one concentrated on activities directly related to the program's purpose, while another used funds for budget support.  Each system has its advantages and faults, and it is still unclear if there is a best method. Whether or not strict policy reform benchmarks should be assigned remains an open question; in any case, implementors should be allowed flexibility in interpreting and modifying policy reform targets.  This is important because key staff -- both USAID and indigenous -- are likely to change in programs lasting more than two years.  Each change brings new interpretations of policy conditions and slows down implementation. One of the early misconceptions about sector grants was that they would be easy to implement.  In fact, USAID/N and other Missions quickly learned that the grants are both personnel-intensive and costly.  The Missions themselves, and not contractors, are ultimately responsible for monitoring grantee performance and program impact.  For this reason, the Missions must have technically proficient (and therefore costly) staff. For Missions with limited operating expenses, this will require creating a trust fund out of a portion of the sector grant. However, if the trust funds run out before a tranche is released, there can be subtle pressures on a Mission to relax its vigor in monitoring policy conditions.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","3/1/1991 12:00:00 AM","","Nonproject assistance|Development program design|Development program management|Development program implementation|Impact assessment|Policy reform","Niger","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNABH701.pdf","1,117 KB","008585 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to strengthen journalistic professionalism in Central America by (1) providing seminars (cursillos) and a Master's program for journalists at Florida International University (FIU) and (2) establishing a self-sustaining mass media training and research center in Central America.  Interim evaluation covers the period 3/88-12/90. This important and well planned project, which could easily have been seen as another attempt to impose North American ideas on Central America, has been enthusiastically received, thanks in no small measure to the tact and professional reputations of its staff.  The project has also taken extreme care to avoid the appearance of competing with Central American institutions engaged in journalism/communications education.  As a result, it is viewed not as a competitor but as a resource for enriching and augmenting journalism training in the region. Also, given early allegations of the likelihood of CIA involvement in the program, and the proclivity in Central America to think in those terms, the continued independence of the project in participant selection and other key operations is essential. Participants and their superiors generally regard the cursillos as useful, well-taught, and relevant to their needs.  Without exception, they regard the contacts with colleagues from other Central American countries to be one of the most positive aspects of the program.  The present cursillos are right on target, and all have included sessions on press ethics and the role of the press in a democracy.  It is recommended that room be found for cursillos in economics/business reporting and in science/ecology/technology reporting.  The arrangement to use the radio facilities of the Inter-American Institute of Agricultural Sciences (IICA) for training purposes is imaginative and provides welcome evidence that project staff have a broad ""get-the-job-done"" perspective rather than a narrow, bureaucratic one. Some essential elements of financial planning and management are not yet in place.  Filling in these gaps should be made a management priority and should include, inter alia:  preparing, as soon as possible, a budget for the remainder of the project; giving staff clear guidelines and assumptions regarding costing and timing of activities; and comparing actual with budgeted expenditures in quarterly reports to A.I.D. With respect to the proposed Central American media training center, a detailed  study should be carried out before proceeding any further than site selection.  It is recommended that A.I.D. examine the history of its establishment of two successful and now self-sustaining Central American institutions, INCAE and CATIE/IICA, to which A.I.D. provided direct budget support for between 15 and 20 years. A continuation of the project into Phase III is recommended. More specific recommendations are, inter alia, to:  place more emphasis on training of trainers in journalism and mass communications; develop a program (e.g., a project alumni association) for maintaining contact with participants; make greater use of Spanish language textbooks and evaluate English language materials for their comprehensibility to participants; maximize distribution of the magazine Pulso, especially at journalism schools; and determine whether the modern equipment used in training hinders participants' in their work situations or opens up new horizons to them.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-0085-I-00-9060-00","","2/1/1991 12:00:00 AM","","Institution building|Participants|Journalism|Professionals|Project acceptance|Technical training|Courses|Masters degrees|Graduate education","Central America","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABC628.pdf","1,186 KB","000356 - Checchi and Co.

"Evaluates project to provide appropriate technology and credit to small farmers in Togo's Zio Valley, and thereby stimulate the development of private agricultural marketing and processing enterprises.  Mid-term evaluation covers the period 1988-5/91. The project is being implemented by CARE and the Credit Union National Association of North America/Federation des Unions Cooperatives d'Epargne et du Credit (CUNA/FUCEC). The number of farmers working with CARE has declined, and it is not likely that project targets will be achieved.  CARE has applied a credit-driven model:  it has introduced marginally profitable technical packages that require high inputs and capital outlays.  Even though the project region is well-endowed agriculturally and close to the Lome market, no verifiable increase in economic growth has been discerned. approaches were attempted, but neither appears sustainable.  Over and above the evaluation team's critique of the CARE model, doubt was expressed about CARE's ability to implement in the field. This component --  though not A.I.D.'s support for small farmers in the region -- should be discontinued. The small and microenterprise development component suffered due to the failure of the first component.  Nor has it complemented the savings-driven, rural credit mechanism promoted by CUNA/FUCEC.  The microenterprises element reached quantitative output goals but was not sustainable, and only 1 of 10 targeted small enterprises (stove manufacturing and sales) was developed. Rural associations, the component's final target group, are largely agglomerated microenterprises which have suffered from a stagnant farm economy.  Either the component should be discontinued, or CARE should hire an experienced small enterprise specialist and focus work on high value crops and marketing. CARE's training component trained CARE field staff in support of group activities (25%); and trained personnel and trainers of local NGO's and public sector agencies (75%).  Although end-of-project objectives were surpassed, training activities seem overextended.  CARE provides training at no cost, and uses additional monies from an operational research fund to pay per diems and to supply materials.  As a result, the training activities also distort the local market; they should be more focused, and CARE should more carefully select clients. Operational funds should be used for clients who match contributions. This component should chiefly contribute to the project through business advisory training and services. FUCEC's principal role in TRIPS is to establish institutions for savings and productive credit.  Funds available to FUCEC for productive credit have yet to be used, as funds have been available through a central liquidity facility.  This component has successfully met or surpassed its targets; however, efforts should be redoubled in the area of productive credit.  A.I.D. should continue to support development of appropriate credit union legislation. The project management team, composed of the grantees, the Government of Togo's Planning and Programming Service (PPS), and OAR/Lome representatives, has not effectively coordinated TRIPS activities. Personnel shortages, poor data gathering capacity, and training exigencies have restricted the role of the PPS in coordinating TRIPS. The PPS is progressing with the assistance of an A.I.D.-supported advisor; significant improvements are anticipated by end of project.  It is recommended that OAR/Lome maintain a stronger supporting role for PPS through its participation in the project management team, and that the PPS use local consultants to assist with its weighty mandate.

"PACR of an OPG to Profamilia (1982-1986) to establish the Institute of Population and Development Studies (IEPD) to analyze and disseminate information on the impact of demography on sociocultural and economic development in the Dominican Republic. IEPD lacked a formal, cohesive strategy until well into the project and project objectives were not easily measurable in terms of outcomes, beneficiaries, or even timeframes.  Some objectives were also overly ambitious.  For example, the objective of self-sufficiency for IEPD was unrealistic, and the dissemination of population information, expected to be one of the most important IEPD functions, proved to be more difficult than originally planned.  This was due to problems with electric power infrastructure as well as a lack of planning. The close association between IEPD and Profamilia gave rise to demands on the part of both parties that were never envisioned. However, changes in the division of labor were made which benefitted both institutions. In 1/87, IEPD was absorbed into the Family Planning Services Expansion Project (5170225).  Most of the problems faced in the original OPG have been resolved.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","3/1/1991 12:00:00 AM","","Institution building|Economic demographic interaction|Demographic analysis|Demographic research|Information dissemination","Dominican Republic","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABC661.pdf","216 KB","008537 - USAID.

"Evaluates the impacts of, and documents related lessons learned from, a 1979-89 project to control water-borne diseases in rural Swaziland. Project training and TA improved the performance of involved Government of Swaziland (GOS) agencies -- the Rural Water Supply Board (RWSB) and the Ministry of Health's (MOH) Health Inspectorate and Health Education Unit (HEU).  The RWSB became very productive in constructing water supply systems, the Bilharzia Control Unit was reinforced, and the HEU gained a stronger place within the MOH; these improvements appear sustainable.  The impact on broader institutional capabilities, coordination, and sector planning has been less, though informal coordination between MOH and RWSB at the field level remains strong. The absence of functioning information systems severely constrains the ability of the RWSB and the MOH to monitor and plan their activities; project assistance in this area was a conspicuous failure.  Initiatives such as health communication and community development paved the way for continuing effective GO/USAID collaboration in these areas. In its single most visible impact, the project provided plentiful potable water for domestic use to an estimated 52,000 rural Swazis in 52 communities through 529 water taps.  Although it was not possible to document decreases in diarrhea and schistosomiasis, the 1988 Swaziland Family Health Survey indicated that rural families with access to piped water systems have lower diarrhea rates than those without, and health personnel have observed a definite decrease in childhood diarrhea.  On the sanitation side, at least 1,400 ventilated improved pit latrines, and probably many more, were constructed with project support.  Had the 1982 KAP survey been repeated, it probably would have confirmed that health-related behavior has improved in rural Swaziland.  Health messages are widely disseminated, and people generally appreciate the importance of clean water, especially for drinking; when prevailed upon to build latrines, they come to like and use them.  There is little evidence, however, that they try to prevent schistosomiasis by avoiding contaminated water. Seeing that systems generally fail mainly because of a lack of community involvement, the project shifted from centralized construction of water supply and sanitation (WS&S) systems to an emphasis on community organization, training, and financial commitment.  While the impact of community participation on sustainability has yet to be fully demonstrated, the project communities do have adequate funds, trained community members, and an organizational structure sufficient to handle everyday maintenance.  The RWSB has applied the project's community participation approach to WS&S systems funded by other donors. Several lessons were learned.  (1) Community-based WS&S improvements, when supported by public health education and services, can benefit a significant number of people at relatively low cost.  (2) Community organization pays off, particularly when community investments of money and effort are required.  Sustainable WS&S services depend on consumer demand as reflected in willingness to make a commitment of time and money. (3) Community motivation to build latrines is increased when latrine construction is a prerequisite for the start-up of WS&S systems. (4) Project designers should identify usable, management-oriented indicators to help implementors and evaluators assess progress; indicators used before and after the project should be comparable.  (5) The priority of a long-term advisor in the final phase of his/her tour of duty should be to establish local institutional mechanisms and capacity and to phase out direct implementation and coordination roles. When the role of a technical advisor is much broader than that of the counterpart who is expected to replace him/her, the chances of successful replacement and sustainability are diminished.","WASH task no. 221","Special Evaluation","Documents","DPE-5973-Z-00-8081-00","","4/1/1991 12:00:00 AM","","Disease prevention and control|Water related diseases|Institution building|Government departments|Community participation|Water supply structures|Potable water|Water sanitation|Health aspects|Rural areas","Swaziland","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABC662.pdf","2,831 KB","000333 - Camp Dresser and McKee, Inc.

"PACR of a project (1979-1984) to develop the Dominican Republic's capacity to maintain and rehabilitate rural roads at the national, regional, and local levels. The project achieved its targets.  At the national level, it established a separate road maintenance department with about 35 administrative and technical employees within the General Directorate of Rural Roads (GDRR).  At the regional level, the project staffed and equipped seven offices with 105 employees and seven sub-regional facilities.  At the local level, the project trained 700 personnel to perform daily routine maintenance and mobilized community members to develop effective cooperation with the GDRR and a long-term capability to maintain rural roads.  A permanent training capability was established at all three levels. During the course of the project, 1,200 km of rural roads were rehabilitated, and 1,200 km were placed under the maintenance program. An inventory of 12,000 km rural roads was completed including detailed information on road conditions and requirements for network planning. A major lesson learned is that the Dominican Republic's past difficulty in maintaining rural roads can be partially attributed to the lack of a trained civil service.

"PACR of a project (1982-1985) to promote freshwater fish production in the Dominican Republic by expanding hatchery facilities, developing baseline data, and improving interagency coordination. The project succeeded in expanding existing hatchery facilities and partially achieved the other two objectives.  Although harvesting data are being recorded, the data are on handwritten sheets and there is no compilation or analysis.  All four participating agencies -- Servicio Social de Igelesias Dominicanas, the Peace Corps, INDOTEC, and FUDECO -- made positive contributions, but the task of coordinating implementation among so many distinct agencies was too much of a burden for project administrators. The project proved that fish production can be viable in an area where fish has not traditionally been a regular item in the local diet. Fish is now readily consumed and production is expanding, albeit within a limited area.  The project also demonstrated that with proper motivation, farmers are willing to convert some of their land into fish ponds and engage in fish raising to improve their own diet and increase cash earnings.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","3/1/1991 12:00:00 AM","","Freshwater fish|Fish hatcheries|Fish breeding|Aquaculture|Inland fisheries","Dominican Republic","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABC669.pdf","149 KB","008537 - USAID.

The University of South Carolina (USC), the primary implementing agency, provided assistance to two local institutions:  the Universidad Catolica Madre y Maestra (USMM) and the Servicio Nacional para la Erradicion de la Malaria (SNEM). The project established a strong link between the two institutions for conducting vector control research and accomplished most of its objectives. USC established a vector control laboratory at UCMM and trained three UCMM faculty to design, implement, and evaluate malaria and dengue interventions.  UCMM now has the capability of providing training on vector control for SNEM, as well as agriculture and tourism interests, while SNEM has the capacity to apply new vector control techniques and improved operational research protocols.  A highlight of the project was the production of two field-tested interventions for malaria and six interventions for dengue. Numerous assumptions in the project design were unrealistic, especially given SNEM's difficult fiscal and personnel situation and the country's known problems with procurement, maintenance, etc.  Moreover, since a project advisory committee was not formed until late in the project, there was no mechanism for participants to address grievances or anticipate problems. Future projects of this type should have one person designated by each collaborating institution assigned to project matters. The major beneficiary of the project was UCMM, an institution with no legal mandate or responsibility for vector control. Perhaps in future projects institutional responsibility for applying outputs should be a consideration in determining inputs.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","3/1/1991 12:00:00 AM","","Disease vectors|Malaria|Dengue|Disease prevention and control","Dominican Republic","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABC673.pdf","345 KB","008537 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (1979-1989) to establish the Central Tunisia Development Authority (CTDA) to implement a variety of activities aimed at increasing agricultural production and meeting basic human needs. The project implemented 7 subprojects (SP's), including one to establish CTDA planning and evaluation capacity for SP management. Additional SP's included the following.  (1) One SP established on-farm irrigation infrastructure and promoted the diffusion and institutionalization of appropriate on-farm water management practices. The SP improved or installed 1,331 wells, and efforts are underway to create associations for self- management of the irrigated perimeters and to increase cost recovery.  (2) A rangeland management SP was less successful.  It introduced improved range and herd management systems on 25 perimeters, but only 3 of the perimeters showed sufficient improvement for stockraisers to continue the practices and encourage nonparticipating farmers to adopt them.  (3) Due to internal coordination problems and the lack of a soil testing facility, the dryland farming systems research SP also had very limited results. (4) A rural potable water SP established and refined a coordinated, decentralized institutional approach to rural potable water operations and maintenance with user participation and user fees.  The SP led to the adoption of a national strategy to promote beneficiary participation in water system management. (5) Save the Children Federation established a Tunisian PVO to implement community-based integrated rural development activities.  By 1984, the two organizations together had initiated more than 40 projects in the areas of agriculture/nutrition, income generation, community buildings, and health and sanitation.  After 1984, the PVO was assisted in becoming an autonomous Tunisian organization -- the Fondation Tunisienne du Developpement Communautaire.  FTDC has now taken initiative in organizing a federation of Tunisian community development NGO's.  (6) A rural extension and outreach SP trained several Tunisian personnel, in-country and in the United States, established demonstration plots for both fruit trees and vegetables, and increased the spread of fruit, nut, and olive trees throughout the region.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","2/1/1991 12:00:00 AM","","Community development|Potable water|Rural development|Agricultural extension","Tunisia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABC732.pdf","208 KB","008616 - USAID.

"PACR of a project to promote energy conservation in buildings in countries belonging to the Association of South East Asian countries. The project was successful in promoting policies and enhancing technical capabilities.  It provided TA and training to Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand in research oriented towards the development of policies for increased energy conservation in buildings.  A total of 24 research projects were conducted, covering construction standards, building solar gain and daylighting effects, and natural ventilation.  It is likely that the standards will be implemented as mandatory building codes in at least two countries. State of the art computer models were transferred to a number of universities and government agencies. As a result of the project, there is a stronger policy commitment to energy conservation in buildings in all the participating countries. Through project training, local personnel are now capable of carrying on the research necessary to develop and implement energy conservation policies.  In addition, the private sector increased its awareness of technology and design alternatives and more business opportunities were created in this sector. Two major lessons were learned.  (1) Under a multi-country project, management should not be divided among too many subcontractors.  This caused delays in disbursement of funds and an increase in overhead costs.  (2) General guidelines for nominating participant trainees should be specified in project agreements to avoid nominations from a limited number of regional organizations.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","3/1/1991 12:00:00 AM","","Energy conservation|Energy policy|Energy research|Building design","Asia|Indonesia|Malaysia|Philippines|Singapore|Thailand","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABC743.pdf","66 KB","008613 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (3/85-3/89) to provide TA to private enterprises in El Salvador.  The project was implemented by the International Executive Service Corps (IESC). IESC provided TA to 41 private enterprises, compared with a target of 50.  The shortfall was due to difficulty recruiting volunteers to come to El Salvador because of the country's political unrest.  However, IESC worked to overcome this problem by adding 15 recruiters and providing potential volunteers with positive references from returning executives. Various types of assistance were provided, including recommendations for improving production schedules, quality control, and training methods; assistance in reducing production costs; evaluation of existing production facilities to identify other products that could be manufactured; and establishment of contacts with U.S. suppliers and clients. Accomplishments include the following:  9 firms increased export capacity, 115 jobs were generated, 10 firms increased productivity 10%-20%, and 9 firms increased productivity 21%-35%. A key lesson is the importance of providing specific services to meet specific TA needs.  IESC was able to provide the right experts for specific jobs.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1991 12:00:00 AM","","Business support services|Management training|Private enterprises|Export promotion|Beneficiary count","El Salvador","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABC773.pdf","135 KB","008540 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (1978-1990) to strengthen the capability of Indonesia's Ministry of Health (MOH) to improve health planning and expand primary health care. The project was substantially modified in 1983 due to a lack of progress. The redesigned project had four components: planning, research and development, management information systems, and diarrheal disease morbidity/mortality control. The PACR focuses on the 1983-1990 period. Major accomplishments include the following. (1) The project demonstrated how the MOH could work with private sector advertising firms to generate new demand for oral rehydration salts (ORS) among rural mothers. Private firms have also expressed an interest in sponsoring radio and TV time for public service messages due, in part, to project activities. (2) A post-intervention knowledge, attitudes, and practices survey in the pilot province of West Java indicated that a mass media campaign to improve mothers' knowledge and use of oral rehydration therapy had a significant impact. (3) Diarrheal disease counseling cards developed in West Java were useful tools for volunteer workers in guiding and counseling mothers during village health post meetings. (4) The project established diarrhea training units in three provinces and provided training to staff. (5) About 18,000 nurses and midwives were trained in diarrheal disease case management along with physicians. Following training, they were placed in areas where physician coverage was low. (6) The medical education curriculum for diarrheal disease was revised in eight national universities. (7) Large social marketing communications projects were conducted in three provinces, utilizing the following media: TV and radio, banners, plastic store bags, flyers, calendars, billboards, newspaper adds, and mobile village videos. Despite these achievements, ORS supply remains poor at the community level and drop-out or inactive rates for village health workers are high (more than half). In addition, financial management was often substandard, contributing to implementation delays. Three major lessons were learned. (1) The project demonstrated an effective approach to training village health workers and it is evident that these cadres will be necessary until the government health system is expanded to every community. (2) The selection process for village health workers should be re- examined to decrease the drop-out rate. (3) Further efforts need to be made to explore fully commercial sector interest in marketing ORS products.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","6/1/1991 12:00:00 AM","","Health care planning|Community health workers|Health education|Oral rehydration therapy|Gastrointestinal diseases|Diarrhea","Indonesia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABC776.pdf","336 KB","008558 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (1985-8/90) to establish private sector systems in Central American countries to mobilize and channel resources for self-help activities in community development, shelter construction and upgrading, and employment generation. The Cooperative Housing Foundation (CHF), the implementing agency, successfully increased the effectiveness of the informal shelter delivery system by providing TA to grassroots institutions and injecting badly needed credit to accelerate shelter delivery.  CHF collaborated with 28 national federations, national technical services organizations, or regional institutions.  The project far surpassed planned outputs in the number of loans provided to these groups for home improvement, self-help house construction, and building material production; the number of nongovernmental organizations assisted to become technical services organizations; and employment generated. Fewer community improvement loans were made than expected due to a lack of demand. Nearly 9,000 families are directly benefiting from the project through improved housing and communities.  In addition, more than 100 small businesses are producing building materials and creating jobs in low-income communities. After the project's completion, A.I.D. had to repeatedly ask CHF for information on how long the program would continue to operate and what specific purposes loan reflows would be used for.  A satisfactory response was finally received from CHF in 3/91. Key lessons include the following.  (1) Program management should not have been located in Washington, since the program heavily emphasized field implementation of shelter construction, community developments, and TA for small private sector organizations.  (2) Even though the project agreement calls for Mission approval of activities, Missions had little direct involvement since management was in A.I.D./W.  (3) A five-year project such as this should have incorporated checkpoints or milestones that could be easily verified to facilitate monitoring.  (4) The project's piecemeal approach to infrastructure development may not be as effective as an overall community strategy.","Cover date: Feb 1991","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","LAC-0131-A-00-5046-00","","4/1/1991 12:00:00 AM","","Low cost housing|Housing credit|Home improvement|Loan administration|Beneficiary count","Central America","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABC792.pdf","331 KB","002290 - USAID.

"Evaluates a pilot nutrition education project to improve feeding practices for infants and young children (aged 0-24 months) (11/85-12/89) in  Indonesia. The project has clearly demonstrated that an enhanced nutrition education component can improve substantially the impact of Indonesia's national nutrition program (UPGK).  The program appears to have improved mothers' knowledge about infant feeding, positively changed feeding practices, contributed to better diets being offered and consumed by young children, and has led to improved nutritional status, albeit moderate. Lessons learned are as follows.  (1)  The project's educational content responded to the major problems mothers were experiencing -- it was not just a transfer of nutrition information.  A rigorous protocol was tested for examining families' child feeding practices; this protocol could now be streamlined for use in other provinces. (2) The messages that had the most impact were precisely stated and had a name or product identity associated with them.  Certain concepts, however, were not captured effectively, and although stated precisely, were not identified well; recommendations for improving the messages are provided. (3) The important role of interpersonal communication, especially via the kader (volunteer village health worker), cannot be overstated. Kaders gave specific messages to mothers for their child of a certain age.  Having this specific information and having been trained in how to counsel seemed to increase the kaders' confidence in giving advice and the mothers' receptivity. (4) Supervision of kaders emerged as an important determinant of their work as educators. (5) The total package of educational materials and the mix of media seem to have been appropriate, since even those mothers who do not recall direct contact with the program have been influenced by it.  It is important not to limit the program only to health channels, but to make it a community program. Includes findings from baseline research on actual practices relating to weaning, child feeding, and child care, reasons for these behaviors, and mothers' beliefs and their knowledge of child nutrition.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","DAN-1010-C-00-4109-00","","3/1/1991 12:00:00 AM","","Child nutrition|Infant nutrition|Nutrition education|Weaning practices|Weaning foods","Indonesia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABC807.pdf","1,869 KB","004646 - Manoff Group, Inc.","","006048 - Indonesia.

"The Cameroon Fertilizer Subsector Reform Program aims to ensure small farmer access to fertilizers by replacing the public monopoly of fertilizer import and distribution with a free-market system.  This evaluation assesses the impacts of the project at its mid-point. Although some elements of state and donor involvement are still strong, the system has been liberalized and is on its way to privatization.  In 1989/90, more than 64,000 tons of fertilizer were imported by 2 private firms and distributed by 5 cooperatives and 4 private traders.  The impact of liberalization has been beneficial and positive.  Leakages (i.e., waste, corruption, and inefficiencies), common under the public monopoly, have been stopped.  Furthermore, the government has reduced its subsidy bill, realizing savings of about $14 million over the past 2 years.  And, most importantly, farmers have been shielded from undue price increases, despite the subsidy reduction, because of efficiency gains in private fertilizer importation and distribution.  The sustainability of these gains will depend largely on Cameroon's capacity to overcome its current economic crisis and the government's commitment to structural adjustment.  Sustainability will be constrained by increasingly limited purchasing power in rural areas. If farmers have less to spend, the volume of fertilizer imports will decrease. A major lesson learned is that reform of the input side (e.g., fertilizer) of a productive sector will be constrained and probably difficult to complete in the absence of reform in marketing output (e.g., coffee, cotton).","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","6/1/1991 12:00:00 AM","","Fertilizers|Agricultural inputs|Economic reform|Privatization","Cameroon","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAX251.pdf","109 KB","003433 - USAID.

"Evaluates a project to establish a sustainable applied dryland farming research and technology transfer capacity at Morocco's National Agricultural Research Institute (INRA).  Interim evaluation covers the period 1988-5/91. The project has made substantial progress toward achieving several of the targets established in the 1988 amendment.  In particular, the INRA regional center near Settat is nearing completion, and four satellite field research stations are in operation. Participant training of Moroccan agricultural scientists is a clear success.  To date, 9 M.S. and 11 Ph.D. candidates have received their degrees, 13 (4 M.S., 6 Ph.D.) are working on their theses in Settat, 19 (2 M.S., 14 Ph.D.) are still studying in the United States, and the remaining 4 (2 M.S., 2 Ph.D.) will begin training in 1991.  In addition, scores of people have received short-term training.  Returned Moroccan researchers have helped INRA to develop technologies which may have important impacts, e.g., new cereal and legume varieties (including insect- and pest-resistant varieties), improved planting and weed control practices, recommendations for timing and quantity of fertilizer applications, and the use of no-till soil cultivation methods. Two areas require corrective action.  (1) There is a conflict between the project mandate to serve only small and medium dryland farmers and INRA's mandate to serve the needs of all farmers in its zone of influence.  This has made it difficult to establish research priorities and allocate resources accordingly. Many activities have ignored the project mandate, while other potentially fruitful areas for research and extension have been neglected.  The contractor's confused supplementary budget request to A.I.D. reflects this lack of priority setting and demonstrates the lack of management insistence that each project element contribute clearly to achieving the project's mission. (2) There is serious doubt about the sustainability of many of the project's activities.  To sustain center operations, INRA will have to increase its operating budget by over 70% over the next 2 years and a further 42% in 1994.  Additionally, INRA/Settat has significant problems in handling its increasingly scarce resources.","Delivery order no. 5|Companion evaluation summary: PD-ABP-991","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-1406-I-00-0033-00","","6/1/1991 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural research|Dry farming|Institution building|Research centers|Personnel development|Participants|Agricultural education|Beneficiary count","Morocco","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABC879.pdf","5,027 KB","001335 - Chemonics International Consulting Div.","","008579 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of a project to improve family planning (FP) services in Pakistan through contraceptive provision, support to private FP providers, assistance in voluntary sterilization, FP education, and training.  External evaluation covered the period 1982-1990. The project provided most of the contraceptives used in the NGO and government FP programs.  These were provided on a timely basis with few problems in logistics.  USAID/P produced a manual that greatly improved contraceptive handling and distribution and it significantly improved storage by constructing a central warehouse in Karachi.  Project TA helped the National Institute of Population Studies to become firmly established and produce high-quality research.  Five research fellows are receiving advanced demographic training in the United States.  The project also helped integrate FP into the health system by sponsoring training for selected Ministry of Health staff. Contraceptive prevalence appears to have increased from 9% in 1985 to 16%-18% in 1990.  Furthermore, the more effective and longer-term methods, namely the IUD and voluntary surgical contraception, are becoming more popular. On the negative side, the project failed to implement an information, education, and communication strategy, and the NGO sector program did not develop as originally anticipated.  The project emphasized opening service outlets rather than developing innovative NGO projects that could reach more potential acceptors, although the newly established NGO Coordinating Council is expected to improve coordination and services. The project's sustainability is uncertain.  Because of the Population Welfare Division's failure to utilize the project's training and TA opportunities, little institutional strengthening took place.  In particular, very few mid-level managers were trained, even though almost all senior staff will retire within 5-10 years.  The long-term provision of contraceptives is also unsure, since no plans have been made on how to procure contraceptives once the project is completed.

"Evaluates project to improve family planning and maternal/child health (FP/MCH) services in Bangladesh.  Interim evaluation covers the period 1986-1989. Measurable progress has been made toward achieving FP/MCH goals. The total fertility rate (TFR) fell from 5.6 to 5, the infant mortality rate (IMR) from 128 to 120, and the child mortality rate from 24 to 19.  If the TFR continues its downward trend and this is validated in the 1991 contraceptive prevalence survey, the target of 4.8 will likely be reached in 1991.  Similarly, if the IMR is sustained, the target of 125 has already been reached. Several of the project's strategies are working as planned.  The project has helped increase the contraceptive prevalence rate from 21.7% in 1983 to 32.8% in 1989, and has made a full range of contraceptives available, with oral contraceptives and female voluntary sterilization becoming increasingly popular.  Progress is also being made toward decentralization of services.  Support to NGO's and to the Social Marketing Company have been major factors in increasing contraceptive prevalence; in fact, NGO contributions to national CYP (couple-years of protection) increased from 11% to 24% between 1981 and 1988.  The project has also provided valuable assistance in the areas of research; information, education, and communication materials; and urban immunization.  Its achievements in improving the quality of FP/MCH care cannot be assessed, however, as activities for improvement have been minimally implemented. Institution building and sustainability are major concerns.  The GOB has repeatedly demonstrated a poor capability to implement and administer development projects and an unwillingness to cooperate with donor organizations; this project, like other donor efforts, is studded with examples of bureaucratic impediments.  Another consideration is that commodity support -- long an essential component of A.I.D.'s FP assistance -- is being gradually replaced by support from the World Bank, reducing A.I.D.'s advisory leverage.  It is suggested therefore that GOB institution building be given lower priority.  Additionally, economic realities make it unlikely that FP programs, including those of NGO's, can reach self-sustainability in the near future. Nonetheless, the importance of building FP services in Bangladesh indicates that self-sustainability should not be the overriding concern.","Project title: Population technical assistance (POPTECH)","Special Evaluation","Documents","DPE-3024-Z-00-8078-00","","7/1/1991 12:00:00 AM","","Family planning services|Maternal child health care|Child survival activities|Institution building","Bangladesh","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABC913.pdf","3,119 KB","006243 - Dual & Associates, Inc.|000673 - International Science and Technology Institute, Inc.

"PACR of a project (1/84-4/88) to improve the management systems and disease control capacities of the Dominican Republic's Secretariat of State for Public Health and Social Welfare (SESPAS). The project purpose of improving SESPAS' management systems was partially achieved.  All of the planned outputs of the financial management systems and management information systems components were accomplished.  Most of the planned outputs of the human resources management systems component were achieved, although standards for employee evaluation were not developed. Recommendations were made for reforming the purchasing and supply systems, but the reforms were not implemented because of personnel problems.  Finally, all of the planned outputs of the supervision/monitoring component were accomplished, including the implementation of guidelines for monitoring SESPAS' new management systems. Disease control programs were successfully established and made operational.  All five outputs in the dengue/yellow fever program were accomplished, including the out-of-country training of 10 health personnel and the in-country training of 765 health personnel in dengue surveillance.  Goals for schistosomiasis were partially achieved.  Seven persons were trained in-country in schistosomiasis control and diagnosis and two were trained out- of-country in schistosomiasis control, but the planned training of 108 doctors was not accomplished.  In-country diagnostic capabilities for both dengue and schistosomiasis were strengthened as well. The major lesson learned was that an improvement in SESPAS' management systems did not translate into better primary health care as the project was implemented at a time when government health priorities were focused on curative care.  Also, the frequent turnover of key SESPAS personnel negatively affected project accomplishments.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","4/1/1991 12:00:00 AM","","Health care administration|Financial management|Information management|Personnel management|Supply management|Supervision|Primary health care|Disease prevention and control|Schistosomiasis|Yellow fever|Dengue","Dominican Republic","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABC929.pdf","506 KB","008537 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (1986-91) to rehabilitate a network of roads essential to agricultural production and marketing in Jamaica. The project rehabilitated about 233 miles of roads against a target of 230 (reduced, due to budget shortfalls, from the original 450). However, due in part to the absence of a full-time construction engineer, about 20% of the roads did not meet USAID/J standards and had to be re-worked at the expense of the Ministry of Construction/Works (MOC/W).  Additionally, the project experienced several work stoppages, primarily because of Government of Jamaica (GOJ) budgetary problems. These stoppages resulted in rapid deterioration of partially completed roads, requiring a repetition of the work and a consequent increase in costs.  The workload also increased due to onsite conditions such as rain or deficiencies in planned drainage works.  These factors substantially increased the GOJ's contribution to the project. Finally, about 12 miles of road -- most of them sections that were never rehabilitated -- have deteriorated appreciably, due to increased traffic flows. Roads selected for rehabilitation were analyzed on the basis of cost and traffic benefits, and some screening was done to include road length, location, and environmental factors.  However, socioeconomic factors such as population, development, commodity movements, future plans in the area, and production were not considered in selecting roads due to a failure to recruit a sociologist. There was considerable disagreement between the MOC/W and the Mission concerning maintenance responsibilities.  Eventually, a pilot program was initiated to assign local area personnel fixed lengths of roadway under contracts to carry out routine maintenance.  The program had very positive results and was expanded to other areas.  However, the problem remains that the GOJ does not make funds available for minor repairs, maintenance, or alterations immediately after completion of a project road.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1991 12:00:00 AM","","Road maintenance|Road construction|Farm to market roads|Host country cooperation|National budgets","Jamaica","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABC936.pdf","700 KB","008563 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (1987-90) to facilitate privatization of cereals production inputs and marketing in Senegal. The project made very little progress due to basic flaws in design (particularly in assumptions regarding credit) and delays in the delivery of TA and training and was eventually terminated by the Mission in 9/90.  No credit was disbursed to traders, since commercial banks were reluctant to take on the risks of lending to the cereals sector. Although significant progress was made in privatizing retail fertilizer trade, the project played no role in this.  A component to collect agricultural statistics suffered a major setback with the medical evacuation of the technical advisor, who had only begun drafting a preliminary workplan. Some accomplishments were made in the project's media campaign. Through a local media development firm, the project broadcast promotional messages in French and five local languages via national and regional radio stations.  The campaign also helped organize meetings at the village and district levels with crop producers, inputs traders, credit agents, and extension agents. Technical bulletins and manuals in French and Wolof on agricultural input use were distributed, and a film was produced to demonstrate correct input use. Several lessons were learned.  (1) The many conflicting responsibilities of the directors of the various components and the head office could have been resolved by making each component financially autonomous, with the head office playing a coordinating role.  (2) The absence of a socioeconomic study was probably a major impediment to good project design.  (3) Rather than providing credit for cereals only, an integrated program providing credit for livestock, cereals, vegetables, and, especially, cash crops should have been initiated.  Without a linkage to cash crops, there is little chance to increase production of cereal crops, which are rarely marketed for cash and hence cannot generate the income required to make loan payments.  (4) The project design was based on Senegalese policies that were totally out of date. (5) Host-country contracting in Senegal is too cumbersome to be workable.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","6/1/1991 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural credit|Cereal crops|Privatization|Agricultural inputs|Information dissemination","Senegal","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABC945.pdf","496 KB","008600 - USAID.

"Mid-term evaluation of a project to improve financial management (FM) in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) through conferences, TA, and training for host country financial managers.  The evaluation covers the period 5/89-4/91. Progress has been made towards achieving the project's purpose. The project has sponsored eight regional, sub-regional, country- specific, and key financial manager conferences for more than 1,250 public sector financial managers.  Training has exceeded targets and produced excellent results:  the Comptroller General Office operational audit course has been institutionalized in Costa Rica, and four fraud and corruption seminars have sparked interest in the subject among government financial managers in Panama, Nicaragua, and Haiti.  The project newsletter is widely distributed in English and Spanish and contains timely information on FM topics and conferences. Country assessments in Panama, Colombia, and Costa Rica have generated interest at upper governmental levels.  As a result of the assessments, Panama is ready to install an integrated FM system; Costa Rica and Colombia are reforming their Comptroller General Office; and Chile is ready to implement FM courses for both financial and non-financial managers.  The project has also: identified a PC-based accounting software (TECAPRO) to help in monitoring and reporting donor funding on a regionwide basis; developed (though not circulated) a database of most regional FM activities; and drafted a comprehensive strategy to implement an international FM system on the central government level. On the negative side, the project's contracting mechanism has allowed neither the flexibility nor the resources to fund all the potential activities identified to date.  The Panama assessment, which was unforeseen, had a severe impact on the project budget. Nor has the LAC Bureau provided sufficient staff support for the project. Several lessons have been learned.  (1) Since the project's design, implementation, and training activities are mostly untested, periodic assessments may result in changes to the models.  (2) Any TA activities on the Mission level will overburden Mission comptrollers and staff. (4) Conferences, meetings for FM professionals, professional audits, and country assessments can all help to effect meaningful change.  (5) Political will is the first condition to any intervention.  (6) Contract mechanisms must allow donors to react immediately when host country climate is right to initiate FM changes.  (7) Host country financial managers need to be better informed of the scope of and process for submitting potential project activities. (8) LAC financial managers are genuinely concerned about solving the problems of fraud and corruption in government.","Annexes: PD-ABD-204","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","5/1/1991 12:00:00 AM","","Financial management|Public administration|Political corruption|Conferences|Management training|Auditing|Institution building","Latin America|Caribbean","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABC947.pdf","1,252 KB","003970 - Management Systems International, Inc.

"PACR of a project (1985-1990) to establish a self-financing pharmaceutical service including a pooled tendering system serving seven Eastern Caribbean public health care systems. The project succeeded in demonstrating the practical benefits of regional integration of common services.  The pharmaceutical service and pooled tendering system resulted in an average savings of 44% on the unit price of drugs during the first tender cycle and even greater savings in the second.  Subsequent cycles focused primarily on containing costs and improving quality. The project significantly upgraded the central medical stores (CM''s) by improving inventory systems and training hundreds of pharmacists and other CMS staff in drug supply forecasting.  In fact, when the Lotus-based system initially used to manage CMS inventories proved inadequate, the project designed a tailored software package for tracking purchase orders, drug needs, supplier performance, and financial account status.  The project also produced a regional drug formulary that is updated biannually and a newsletter and drug information system. In sum, although it would be misleading to suggest that the CMS's are operating at optimal efficiency, the means to improve inventory management are well in hand.  Whether the project's improvements will be institutionalized will depend on several factors -- including the motivation of CMS managers to improve the systems and the willingness of secretaries of health and others to use the management information system available to them to monitor this very expensive part of their annual budgets. The primary lesson learned is that regional cooperation does not require political integration.  The project also demonstrated that cost-containment efforts can contribute to cost- effectiveness as much as or more than price reductions.  A number of activities (e.g., the adoption of a regional formulary, studies of the cost-effectiveness of various treatment therapies, and improvements in inventory management) will ultimately have a greater economic impact than the initial cost savings of the pooled tendering system.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","7/1/1991 12:00:00 AM","","Public health care|Pharmaceuticals|Regional economic integration","Eastern Caribbean","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABC951.pdf","63 KB","001757 - USAID.

"PACR of a cooperative agreement with Project HOPE (1984-90) to provide U.S. medical personnel and equipment to meet Grenada's need for health services created by the abrupt departure of Cuban health professionals after the U.S. invasion in 1983. Project HOPE provided 122 person-years of U.S. TA, including physicians, nurse educators, a mental health team, and allied health workers.  On-the-job and special training programs were provided in nursing, cytology, ultrasound radiography, psychiatric nursing, community-based mental health, and vital/health statistics.  A smaller number of health workers received third-country training in areas such as medical records keeping, biomedical technology maintenance, and environmental health.  Although results were generally positive, many trainees have moved to positions outside the Ministry of Health (MOH). Through the project, Grenada was linked to the University of the West Indies's slow-scan satellite Distance Teaching Experiment system (UWIDITE), which allowed Grenadians to both receive and initiate teaching programs in health systems management; the system continues to be well-used.  Another highlight was the project's multi-faceted mental health program which upgraded care from custodial to therapeutic standards.  New acute and chronic care facilities were built and a community-based mental health program was introduced to reduce institutionalization.  Also of note have been improvements in health budgeting. Other activities were less successful.  A program to rotate UWI medical residents to the General Hospital in Grenada was discontinued due to a lack of interest and funding.  Efforts to improve solid waste management were also unsuccessful, despite about 5 years of resident TA. Several lessons were learned.  The project was overwhelming -- both in its scope and in the number of technical advisors sent. The large resident contingent -- over 30 strong at one point -- suggested to some that the MOH was perhaps no longer run by Cubans, but by a parallel group of Americans.  In the aftermath of the invasion, Project HOPE's ""take charge"" approach was resented by some.  This tension, along with an unrealistically broad scope of work, prevented the project from being fully integrated, despite enormous investment.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","7/1/1991 12:00:00 AM","","Emergency relief|Health delivery|Health professional education|Institution building","Grenada","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABC952.pdf","82 KB","007707 - USAID.

"Interim evaluation of a project to provide home-based preschool training to children considered at risk of developmental problems as the result of poor living conditions in the Gaza Strip.  The evaluation covers the period 10/89-6/91. The Portage approach, a home-based early childhood model, is used effectively and efficiently by project staff to meet the needs of the at-risk children and families.  In fact, the project is now serving over twice the number originally proposed because teachers frequently are able to serve more than one child per visit.  Some 1,000 children aged 0-4 years now participate in 90- minute weekly sessions.  Teachers, supervisors, and directors are capable and enthusiastic in meeting the educational needs of these children and families.  Their level of professionalism matches that of programs in more affluent, less troubled countries. In addition to benefiting children and families, the project also provides financial support to the women teachers and their families. Many of these previously untrained women report that their teacher salaries support from 5 to 16 additional family members. Teacher training and curricular activities are not as strong in the areas of health, hygiene, and nutrition as they are in developmental skills.  Efforts should be made to strengthen these areas.  There is also a need for provision of increased health services, establishment of libraries, and an increased number of kindergartens.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","6/1/1991 12:00:00 AM","","Teacher training|Preschool education|Nonformal education|Educational methods","Gaza Strip","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABC959.pdf","1,260 KB","","","005157 - USAID.

"Documents lessons learned in the health and hygiene education component of a rural potable water project in Kasserine, Tunisia. Concerning the female village health worker (VHW) program: (1) It is nearly impossible to implement a successful community-based health program in rural areas without a regular, assured form of transportation. The lack of transportation for Regional Health Education Team (RHET) members was frustrating and added to team stress, and also blocked field follow-up visits to VHW's throughout the life of the project. (2) For rural regions with limited health personnel, VHW's seem to be a viable way to reach communities, provided the VHW's are well trained, well supervised, and communicate very specific health messages related to actual existing behaviors and not to merely perceived needs. (3) Any reported changes should be evaluated through household observations to determine the accuracy of the information provided. Concerning the school-based hygiene education program: (1) This program greatly increased the knowledge level of both teachers and students regarding water and sanitation, personal hygiene, and household cleanliness. (2) There is a great need for the active participation of the Ministry of Education in this program. More active participation from the teachers is also necessary. Concerning the small community development programs: (1) An evaluation must be planned and implemented for all community development activities and not left optional. However, given their other responsibilities, RHET members often had difficulty finding adequate time to implement this activity. (2) The lack of strong Regional Water User Association Support Unit (UAG) leadership after the departure of the UAG Director led to a paucity of data collection and systematic monitoring activities. This in turn meant that only project outputs could be assessed. Concerning the women's interest groups (WIG) program: (1) Implementing a novel concept such as WIG's at a community level in Tunisia requires a significant commitment of time and resources. Having an outside party take a lead role in creating these structures without the active participation of a local, permanent counterpart diminishes any chance of sustainability after the outside staff member leaves. (2) The support of community leaders is critical to the success of the WIG. This groundwork must be laid well in advance. In several cases, however, the local officials tried to control the WIG instead of allowing the women to do so. (3) The WIG program should have included an assessment component. This would have permitted an analysis of the effectiveness of these community groups in representing women's points of view to the water user associations. Concerning materials development: (1) Flexibility in project design and budgeting can lead to some good, complementary activities and materials for existing programs. (2) Pretesting and field-testing of educational and training materials is a difficult technique to reinforce. (Even with training in these areas, RHET members actively resisted these steps.) It takes constant technical advising to insure that pretesting will take place. Concerning management and organizational issues: (1) Lack of a formal, administrative arrangement between the various ministries involved in RHET activities sometimes hampered these activities. (2) The services of an outside budget manager were necessary to the smooth functioning of RHET and encouraged more innovation and programmatic diversity. (3) The absence of a formalized structure for RHET led to internal conflicts between RHET members that were impossible to resolve in any satisfactory way. Creating the position of UAG Director for project purposes was necessary, but in the long run it left RHET without management, because it was impossible to recruit someone to replace the original Director given the administrative circumstances of the Ministry of Agriculture position.

"Interim evaluation of a program implemented by International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF) to assist its affiliated family planning associations (FPA's) in improving services and internal management.  The evaluation covers the period 7/87-9/90. The project, which has focused on FPA's in Brazil, Colombia, and Mexico, with smaller subgrants to FPA's in nine other countries, has accomplished many of its goals.  The assisted FPA's are well on their way to attracting the expected 2.8 million new acceptors, many of whom are from the targeted low-income populations in low-prevalence areas. Overall services are good, although some clinics are too crowded and require long waiting periods. The FPA's have also developed links with government and PVO programs that have stimulated more and better quality services by both types of organizations and diversified the resource base of the FPA's.  More, however, needs to be done in the area of formal documentation and dissemination. The project's stringent planning and financial reporting requirements have helped improve FPA abilities in planning and monitoring.  A new management information system has been developed under the project and is gradually being installed. The only serious problem has been the very long delay in hiring an individual to carry out the regional evaluation component. The evaluator was expected to analyze whether low-income/low- prevalence populations were being reached and to develop a plan for dissemination of innovative service delivery models, among other duties. Since 1986, the FPA's have succeeded in increasing their income from outside sources; matching grant support has dropped from nearly one-quarter of their aggregate budgets to only about one- sixth.  This has been accomplished in good measure by charging for services; however, there is potential for increased cost recovery. IPPF has been concerned by recent A.I.D. funding uncertainties, particularly the unwillingness to forward fund.  On the other hand, IPPF has resisted suggestions that it be moire flexible in its planning and more prudent in the rate at which it expends funds. Given the project's success, it is recommended that the grant be renewed in 1992.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","DPE-3043-G-SS-7062-00","","7/1/1991 12:00:00 AM","","Family planning services|Financial management|Private sector|Family planning clinics|Institution building","Latin America","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABC979.pdf","3,254 KB","006243 - Dual & Associates, Inc.|000673 - International Science and Technology Institute, Inc.

"Final evaluation of a project to strengthen agricultural research capabilities in Bangladesh.  Evaluation covers the period 1987-91, the project extension (supplement) period. The project has strengthened the research management capabilities of the Bangladesh Agricultural Research Council (BARC) and the National Agricultural Research System (NARS).  In the past 2 years, many effective state-of-the-art tools were prepared to help BARC and NARS develop strategic planning instruments, assess priorities, standardize research reporting, and coordinate information and personnel systems.  A major broadening of the curriculum at Bangladesh Agricultural University was another significant development during this period. Bangladesh's Agricultural Research Institutions (ARI's) were notably affected by the project.  (1) The project provided limited financial support for linkages between the Bangladesh Rice Research Institute (BRRI) and the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) in the Philippines.  (2) Project funding strengthened the research, technology transfer, and institutional linkage capabilities of the Fisheries Research Institute (FIRI).  (3) Linkages between local livestock scientists of the Bangladesh Livestock Research Institute (BLRI) and BLRI's On-Farm Research Division were strengthened, and poultry and poultry-fish components have been added to the cropping research program, a change especially evident in the women's development program. The project was less effective in strengthening BLRI headquarters.  (4) Integrated pest management in ARI's suffered from inadequate on-farm visitation by scientists and poor participation by ARI staffs.  (5) The BARC's social science staff was strengthened by project training in innovative and traditional statistical and survey techniques. The project contributed greatly to the strengthening and adoption of the farming systems research (FSR) approach, some form of which is currently being used at 20 sites.  Notable achievements include, inter alia, collaboration at the local level between different ARI's practicing FSR; development of over 100 innovative FSR technologies, 7 of which have been accepted as ""mature"" technologies; and increasing participation of women in FSR research and activities.  Problems include slow technology- sharing between BRRI and the Bangladesh Agricultural Research Institute; difficulty in diffusing improved technologies beyond the FSR site; the lack of mobility needed for monitoring; and lack of career incentives for young scientists. In the area of personnel development, the project helped develop training programs for the NARS, but degree training suffered considerably from bureaucratic and language constraints. The major design flaw was that the project only attacked the symptoms of the problems affecting agricultural research in Bangladesh -- poor management, lack of planning, lack of interest in farmers' problems -- rather than the root causes, which are excessive bureaucracy, inadequate incentives for research, the absence of pressure from users, and lack of appreciation for the power of science and technology.  A major difficulty in conducting the present evaluation was separating the impact of this project from other projects of a similar nature.","Delivery order no. 3","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","PDC-1406-I-00-0073-00","","7/1/1991 12:00:00 AM","","Institution building|Agricultural research|Research organizations","Bangladesh","","","005072 - Tropical Research and Development, Inc.","","008511 - USAID.

"The Training for Development (TFD) project is a $10 million general participant training project that provides short- and long-term U.S. training to approximately 155 Kenyans from both the public and private sectors.  Participants are selected on the basis of outstanding personal qualities that indicate potential for professional leadership; all stages of the project, from selection and orientation, through training plan design and follow-on, are oriented toward enhancing the participants' professional leadership skills. The project is one of the best participant training projects in A.I.D. today in terms of the quality of every stage of the training process.  The successful implementation of the project is due in part to a good project design and a capable contractor. Equally important, however, has been the ability of USAID, the project committees, and the contractor to continuously monitor, reassess, and improve procedures and rationale.  Over the years, the project has improved both in conceptual definition and implementation to evolve to its current status. Project management procedures are operational and effective and have evoked a high level of commitment from host country and contractor personnel.  Training procedures are fully in place and are successful in selecting qualified individuals and placing them in appropriate training programs.  The high quality of services are the function not only of a capable contractor, but also of the willingness of AID to provide the necessary funding. Although the cost of the contractor services is unusual, the quality of the services provided are also well beyond the standard. At this point in the project, there are few if any significant changes to be made in project management, selection, or placement activities.  The major new challenge for the remaining life of the project is to expand on the relatively new re-entry and follow-on components; in particular, USAID/Kenya must clearly define the nature of the relationship desired with returned participants.  Current activities are exploratory in nature, with a pilot activity in funding small projects proposed by returned participants, a participant directory, and an alumni association (if it is initiated by returnees).  Other options include support for management seminars or other in-country training programs. The primary question for USAID/Kenya is what level of support is appropriate, for which activities, and for how long.  The current program is entirely dependent on contractor services, and is therefore limited in time to the current LOP.  Depending on its objectives, USAID may wish to explore other mechanisms for maintaining some level of linkages and support to these individuals in whom it has invested so much. A range of options for future project design exist should the mission decide to fund a TFD II.  Design issues will include the advisability of greater project focus compared to the current demand driven training, policy issues on selection criteria and types of training, and management issues on the structure and scope of an implementation contract.

"PACR of a grant (7/87-12/90) to the Lembang Horticultural Research Institute (LEHRI) in Indonesia to develop a cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) vaccine which can be applied to horticultural crops, especially peppers, in the seedling stage. All research activities related to the production of vaccine have been accomplished; a vaccine, mixed CMV-2 + CARNA 5, has been obtained which does hold promise of a capability to protect pepper plants against the infection of CMV and its helper virus. However, the project lost 6 months due to problems in transferring technology to study sites in Indonesia (such as late delivery and technical problems in setting up crucial equipment). As a result, the principal investigator was not able to produce purified vaccines to control CMV. Although the topic was not specifically studied, the principal investigator indicated that the technologies developed by the project have the potential to increase farmers' income if properly applied; a private company has expressed interest in commercializing the technology.  Also, LEHRI's capabilities in virology, especially in the area of viral satellite technology, have been improved.  LEHRI is continuing research into CMV using chemicals purchased under the project and funds from a Dutch- supported project. Field trials in different pepper-growing areas need improvement and continuous investigation because of commonly occurring complications related to the incidence of other aphid-transmitted viruses.  Research has to be continued so that CMV control efforts can be applied on larger scales at farmer levels; this will provide an important economic incentive for increasing pepper production in Indonesia, and generally strengthen the development of the Integrated Pest Management (IPM) program. Lessons learned include:  (1) Although the small size of grants such as this makes it difficult to include formal evaluations, in the future it would be advisable for A.I.D./W to include a requirement for modest interim evaluations.  (2) The commercial dissemination of research results requires close collaboration between public research centers such as LEHRI and private sector companies.  (3) Provisions are needed to ensure that the principal investigator does not need to spend an inordinate amount of time on administrative/financial details.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","7/1/1991 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural research|Crop diseases|Mosaic diseases|Pest control|Vaccines","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABD007.pdf","827 KB","000171 - USAID.

"Mid-term evaluation of a project to strengthen Kenya's nongovernmental organizations (NGO's) by providing funding for specific activities, TA, and training.  The evaluation covers the period 1985-1991. The project had a slow start, but is beginning to have a positive impact.  Original plans to implement the project through a Kenyan NGO proved unsuccessful, and the project was redesigned in 1988 to allow the Mission to manage the project directly.  Many Mission staff members were unclear about the goals of the project, and the shift in management necessitated extra time for recruiting personnel and developing internal management procedures.  Delays were also caused by staff turnover in the summer of 1990 and the need to recruit a TA firm. As a result of these delays, and of the lengthy subproject approval process developed by USAID/K, fewer grants have been provided than expected.  So far, 10 grants totalling $2.5 million have been approved and another 7 are being considered.  Most have an institutional strengthening focus, and almost without exception they have been of high quality, carefully designed, and are progressing well.  Activities have been in the areas of small-scale agriculture, health care, vocational training, small enterprise development, water systems, and wildlife conservation. The project has developed an important constituency of NGO's beyond what is normally reached in sector-specific programs.  As a result of the project, these NGO's have strengthened their abilities to conceptualize and design projects, improved organizational development skills, installed new or improved financial systems, initiated improved procurement and personnel policies, enhanced systems for reporting and analyzing progress, and diversified funding.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","6/1/1991 12:00:00 AM","","Indigenous private voluntary organizations|Institution building|Grants|Co-financing","Kenya","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABD026.pdf","2,175 KB","003970 - Management Systems International, Inc.

"PACR of a project (1979-1990) to improve the agricultural research and extension activities of the Government of Senegal (GOS) in the Groundnut Basin.  The primary implementing agency was the Societe de Developpement et de Vulgarisation Agricole (SODEVA). The project encountered many problems.  Between project design and the beginning of implementation, the entire policy and institutional context within which SODEVA operated changed radically.  (1) The supply system for the factors of production and the agricultural product purchasing organization virtually disappeared.  (2) Short-term credit for inputs was canceled.  (3) Cooperatives came under severe scrutiny and were generally discredited. Consequently, the production targets were not achievable, since farmers were simultaneously encountered with declining rainfall and the lack of availability of improved seed, fertilizer, and credit. SODEVA's budget submissions were late for a variety of reasons and the initial disbursement system of advance payments was stopped after a very negative audit report.  SODEVA was then required to pre-finance a considerable proportion of project expenses and since the GOS did not cover counterpart costs in a timely manner, SODEVA had to borrow on the commercial market to continue its operations. In 1984, the project was redesigned to put more emphasis on agroforestry and soil conservation.  During this phase, the main problem was that there were too many agencies involved.  This meant that decisions couldn't be made easily and field work suffered.  The project also experienced numerous staff changes, which compounded problems between headquarters and the field. Despite these problems, the project made some significant accomplishments.  A new agroforestry system was established in 63 villages, which involved the creation of village nurseries to produce seedlings for woodlots and windbreaks.  Ten new wells were constructed and nine rehabilitated.  Training in agroforestry was provided to 46 GOS agents.  A documentation center was established and is fully operational. Several lessons were learned.  (1) To overcome the Groundnut Basin's environmental problems, emphasis is required on agroforestry, soil and water conservation, village-level woodlots and windbreaks, and the integration of livestock into the production system.  (2) When research is worthwhile, an efficient mechanism needs to be used to disseminate this research.  (3) Women are an important labor source in the Groundnut Basin, and progress could be furthered by providing them with literacy instruction training as well as new technologies for gardening. food preparation, livestock care, etc.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","3/1/1991 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural research|Agricultural extension|Agroforestry|Environmental degradation","Senegal","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABD034.pdf","254 KB","008600 - USAID.

"Mid-term evaluation of a project to establish the Caribbean Law Institute (CLI) to promote law reform in the Commonwealth Caribbean, especially in the areas of trade, commerce, and investment.  The evaluation covers the period 8/88-8/91. It is too early to make a substantive evaluation of CLI's work because it has not yet produced much final product.  However, it is apparent that CLI requires reforms of its structure and management. Major findings include the following.  (1) CLI should hire permanent staff to produce draft legislation in a form amenable to adoption by the countries involved.  (2) The executive project director, currently located at Florida State University (FSU), should be transferred to the Caribbean to enhance CLI management structure and capabilities.  (3) CLI must become less dependent on the University of the West Indies,  and its board should be reconstituted to reflect a community of interest beyond academia.  CLI's relationship to Florida State University (FSU), whose contribution to CLI, while not inconsequential, does not seem to warrant the extent to which FSU partakes in project funding -- requires an even more radical change.  (4) The restructured CLI should be financed on a self- sustaining basis through a trust funded by unspent A.I.D. grant funds as well as additional sources and, if possible, revenue- generating activities.","Delivery order no. 30|Companion evaluation summary: PD-ABG-359","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-0085-I-00-9060-00","","8/1/1991 12:00:00 AM","","Legal reform|Institution building|Organizational structure|Personnel|Financing","Eastern Caribbean","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABD122.pdf","903 KB","000356 - Checchi and Co.

"Final evaluation of a project component to establish surveillance systems to monitor transmission of dengue and schistosomiasis in the Dominican Republic.  The evaluation covered the period 2/84-10/90. Inputs were well used and resulted in successful completion of planned outputs, including a national laboratory service for dengue and a regional one (Region V) for schistosomiasis.  The Secretaria de Estado de Salud Publica y Asistencia Social (SESPAS) has an improved capacity to diagnose, report, and control these vector-borne diseases, and protocols and plans are in place to respond to routine and emergency control of the diseases. Training activities related to dengue surveillance exceeded targets, with 10 health workers trained out of country (vs. 6 planned) and 765 trained in country (vs. 100 planned). Information on dengue was disseminated through epidemiological bulletins, departmental serial publications, and national and regional conferences.  The surveillance system established under the project has enabled SESPAS to discover widespread dengue transmission and the first confirmed cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever in the country.  This information has convinced SESPAS and U.S. Centers for Disease Control experts that something must be done to prepare the country for a possible epidemic. Training in schistosomiasis control was completed for laboratory technicians and physicians, but physician training for schistosomiasis referral was not carried out, partially because of a delay in local currency disbursement.  The schistosomiasis component has completed serological sample studies, conducted public health education activities, improved sanitation in areas of high endemicity, and conducted vector control activities.  The outlook for continued attention to schistosomiasis control is generally positive, but the government could use help in purchasing chemicals and in its constant training and retraining of laboratory technicians (due to large personnel turnovers). Increased physician education and involvement is needed for both dengue and schistosomiasis surveillance and control.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","DPE-5948-C-00-9030-00","","2/1/1991 12:00:00 AM","","Dengue|Schistosomiasis|Disease vectors|Disease prevention and control|Epidemiology","Dominican Republic","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABD199.pdf","557 KB","005969 - Medical Service Corp.

"Final evaluation of a project to test ecologically sound, low-cost interventions to control malaria and dengue in the Dominican Republic. The evaluation covers the period 8/86-5/90. The University of South Carolina, the primary implementing agency, signed sub-agreements with the Universidad Catolica Madre y Maestra (UCMM) and the Servicio Nacional para la Erradicacion de la Malaria (SNEM).  UCMM conducted operational research, while SNEM used research findings to field-test vector control measures.  The project faced many constraints, including a serious lack of collaboration between SNEM and UCMM at mid-term; a difficult fiscal and personnel environment at SNEM; poor repair and maintenance of SNEM-owned commodities; UCMM faculty with heavy workloads; slow release of P.L. 480 funds; and long lag-times between purchasing and receiving equipment. Despite these problems, the project succeeded in establishing: (1) a vector control research facility at UCMM and faculty capabilities in research and training in this field; (2) a SNEM capacity to apply vector control techniques and operational research protocols; and (3) an institutional plan to establish a lasting link between UCMM and SNEM. include:  in-country training of 302 persons in 14 short courses; completion of a M.S. degree for one UCMM faculty members and partial completion of one for a SNEM vector control specialist; participant training of 16 professional staff members of UCMM and SNEM; and establishment of insectaries at both UCMM and SNEM. The project also tested two malaria control interventions: truck-mounted spraying and B.t.i. larvicidal applications.  Six interventions were tested for dengue:  (1) truck-mounted ULV spraying; (2) indoor residual spraying of curtains; (3) area aerial spraying with ULV malathion; (4) use of larvivorous fish in household water-storage tanks; (5) thermal fogging; and (6) a community participation project. The project produced a variety of guidelines and recommendations for routine and emergency control of malaria and dengue. In sum, both UCMM and SNEM seem to have the capacity and the willingness to continue their respective activities in research and vector control.  For UCMM, this a voluntary involvement, which should be fostered.  For SNEM, it is a mandate and a responsibility, but fiscal problems and the low priority given to malaria research are likely to remain as major constraints. Postproject support is needed mainly in commodities.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","DPE-5948-C-00-9030-00","","2/1/1991 12:00:00 AM","","Malaria|Disease prevention and control|Dengue","Dominican Republic","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABD200.pdf","1,334 KB","005969 - Medical Service Corp.

"Evaluates a project to (1) strengthen the capacity of Pakistani institutions at the federal, provincial, and local levels to plan and implement projects to increase the production of fuelwood and timber, and (2) demonstrate the feasibility of producing tree crops on privately owned farm and range land.  Second interim evaluation covers the period 9/87-9/91. The present status of the project is good.  Excellent progress has been made over the past 4 years due to the high degree of cooperation among USAID/P, provincial governments, and the TA team.  The project has been especially successful in eliciting the participation of private individuals; over 60,000 tree plantations have been established by farmers and landowners, and over 2,400 farmer operated nurseries have been established. However, it appears that the main beneficiaries of the project have been influential, well-off, and large landowners and farmers.  In addition, although studies of forest product industries have indicated that there is market potential for the wood being produced on the plantations, little harvesting and marketing technology is available to the plantation owners. Farm and energy forest research have not been farmer oriented nor concentrated enough on production alternatives for farmers and landowners; for example, 80%-90% of all trees privately produced and planted are eucalyptus.  Future research should focus on species trials, establishment of seed orchards, and tree/crop/livestock interaction, as well as on the formation of wood-based industries through appropriate technology. Despite the progress made in the training of project staff, managers, trainers, researchers, and extension agents, the training component has numerous shortcomings, such as a poor selection process, inadequate attention to sociological aspects, and gaps in the curricula.  Most importantly, advanced degree training has fallen so far behind schedule that it will be impossible to achieve original targets.  It is suggested that training programs be modified or redesigned to make optimum use of the remaining time to address key issues; the establishment of the training cells should be a top priority. In general, the project is making excellent progress towards establishing an institutional capacity to support forestry activities in Pakistan, and towards promoting positive and beneficial attitudes and relationships within the relevant communities. However, the focus on physical output targets -- number of trees in the ground, biomass production, etc. -- draws attention away from other, equally important issues such as environmental conservation/enhancement and institution building.","Companion evaluation summary: PD-ABE-292","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-5517-I-00-0105-00","","8/1/1991 12:00:00 AM","","Forestry|Agroforestry|Farmer participation|Agricultural extension|Agricultural training|Agricultural research|Private land|Institution building|Beneficiary count","Pakistan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABD207.pdf","3,605 KB","005072 - Tropical Research and Development, Inc.","","008588 - USAID.

"Interim evaluation of the third year of a Housing Guaranty Loan to the Government of Indonesia (GOI) to support the GOI's Municipal Finance and Shelter Program.  The evaluation covers the period 8/90-7/91. The GOI has made substantial progress under all components of its shelter program and is clearly committed to its objectives. Highlights include:  continued progress in decentralized investment programming and local revenue generation, laying the groundwork for expanded private sector participation, adopting precedents to improve the structure of municipal borrowing and central grant allocations, beginning civil service reforms that promise to enhance local government capacity, making a serious commitment to upgrading the status of some local governments, strengthening systems for overall program monitoring and control, and clarifying responsibility for program coordination at the central level. Progress has been slower than promised in:  (1) providing a viable nationwide system of loan finance for local governments, including the full institutionalization of a regional development account; (2) bringing a larger share of grants for regional and local development under the discretion of local officials; (3) expediting improvements in local institutional capacity and enhancing the role of local officials in the investment programming process; and (4) updating the plan's targets for future achievements.  Also, special emphasis should be given to assure that local governments honor their debt service obligations. A.I.D. support has become increasingly important to the GOI program. TA has expanded in key policy areas that have not been addressed by other donors, and housing guaranty loan funds have become vital to the investment program, as the level of capital support from other donors has declined.

"PACR of a project (1983-1987) to strengthen El Salvador's Ministry of Health (MOH) by providing essential medical drugs and supplies, equipment, and related services, and by improving planning, management, and training functions. The project allowed the MOH to maintain its health care capacity during a crucial time, despite declining public sector finances. The MOH was strengthened by the pharmaceuticals, supplies, vehicles, and medical equipment provided by the project, as well as by improvements and additions to the physical infrastructure, including warehouses and workshops for repair and maintenance of vehicles and biomedical equipment.  Construction of operating rooms, and purchase of X-ray machines and other equipment enabled hospitals to meet hygienic standards and the country's increased medical needs. Additional project achievements include the following.  (1) The project had a major impact on lowering the number of malaria cases in 1986 and 1987.  (2) MOH capacity to carry out emergency drug and supply distribution was improved in the aftermath of the 1986 earthquake.  (3) Cold chain equipment provided by the project continues to be used to prevent loss of perishable medicines and blood.  (4) A vehicle maintenance program was well organized and had considerable success in streamlining and standardizing the fleet, implementing cost controls, and providing preventive maintenance.  (5) Teaching modules for trauma care were developed.  (6) The computerized management information systems began to operate in 1987, but further training is needed for both users and operators. Lessons learned include the following.  (1) Institution building is not accomplished with resource transfer alone, and it takes time.  In this case, 5 years was clearly insufficient.  (2) Continuity in the provision of TA has positive effects on results and is an important element in institution building.  (3) MOH policy decisions are key to making the system effective, and they should not be sacrificed to meet pressures for quick results. (4) Cooperation between management groups is important and must begin early in the project.  (5) Hospitals have an advantage over the rest of the system in obtaining resources, and measures must be taken to elevate the priority of lower-level care facilities. (6) Project papers should be written with specificity concerning what will take place and how, but should also be flexible regarding areas that are almost certain to require modification.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","4/1/1991 12:00:00 AM","","Health delivery|Medical equipment|Emergency medical care|Hospitals","El Salvador","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABD231.pdf","338 KB","008540 - USAID.

"Evaluates a contract with Matrix International Logistics, Inc. to provide worldwide freight forwarding and warehousing of contraceptive supplies for A.I.D.'s Office of Population. Overall, Matrix has been extremely effective and has shown continued improvement in warehouse management and delivery performance since the start of the contract.  Matrix received high marks from Mission personnel and cooperating agencies for its performance and especially for its responsiveness to problems such as lost, damaged, or stalled shipments.  Transit and transfer times for both air and surface transportation show that Matrix has, for the most part, moved shipments expeditiously between pickup points at supplier or warehouse locations and destination ports of entry; 97% of air, 97% of land, and 98% of sea shipments met transit time standards.  Performance in actually delivering the commodities to the Missions' doors fell short of these figures, however, largely due to:  (1) the undependability of suppliers in meeting production and shipment commitments; and (2) delays in clearing shipments through customs.  Both of these factors are in many ways beyond the control of Matrix. Key concerns for this and similar contracts regard the need for: (1) better communications between suppliers, shippers, and Missions, through the Office of Population's NEWVERN freight tracking system; (2) incentives for suppliers to meet supply deadlines more dependably; and (3) facilitation of customs clearance, which will require high-level Mission involvement at the country level and A.I.D./Washington involvement at the intergovernmental level. In sum, the consolidation of contraceptive shipping and warehousing responsibilities into a single contract has led to improvements in management, quality of services to field programs, and overall transportation costs (savings of $1.1 million annually since the beginning of the contract).  A similar contract design should be used for A.I.D. contraceptive transportation services in the future. However, it is suggested that contracts be awarded for 5 years, rather than annually.","Project title: Population technical assistance (POPTECH)","Special Evaluation","Documents","DPE-3024-Z-00-8078-00","","9/1/1991 12:00:00 AM","","Contraceptive agents and devices|Procurement|Warehouses|Transportation","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABD266.pdf","6,180 KB","006243 - Dual & Associates, Inc.","","000191 - USAID.

"The Agricultural Non-Traditional Export Promotion (ANEP) Program was initiated in 1988 to help the Government of Uganda (GOU) increase non-traditional exports (NTE's) in the long term. This report updates developments in the ANEP program since the 8/90 impact evaluation, which concluded that the ANEP program has had a positive impact on the growth of nontraditional agricultural exports. Despite a variety of adverse macroeconomic pressures, NTE's continued to demonstrate robust growth during the past year. NTE's grew by 70% from 1989 to 1990 and there are strong signs that there will be similar growth in 1991, despite continued infrastructural problems (primarily in financial services and transport services) and the loss of important markets in Rwanda and the Middle East.  This growth is primarily due to incentives created by additional GOU policy and regulatory reforms, such as exchange rate reform (legalization of the foreign exchange bureaus and liberalization of foreign exchange transactions), export licensing reform, and modest improvements in the agricultural marketing infrastructure, especially the roads. ANEP has firmly supported the GOU policy reform program.  Through ANEP, USAID/Uganda has provided general support to nontraditional exporters and specific assistance to a few firms,  which has led to increases in NTE's.  The Export Policy Analysis and Development Unit (EPADU), which is supported by A.I.D. funding and TA, has provided important policy analysis and advice to the reform program; additionally, specific technical advice and export promotion programs offered by the EPADU have provided critical support to a few firms which has had a positive impact on the growth of NTE's.  One example of EPADU's recent success is its support of a women's organization making handicraft exports. However, while EPADU has had much success analyzing the policy environment and arguing within the GOU for policy and regulatory change to promote NTE's, its seminars and training activities have been too broad and not focused enough to meet the specific marketing needs of export-oriented firms.  Moreover, EPADU is late in publishing the results of an Exporters' Survey done in 8/90 and has not yet initiated the 1991 survey which is intended to build baseline data required to measure program and institutional success in promoting NTE's. During 1990, the agricultural NTE's earning the most foreign exchange were:  hides and skins; sesame; maize; beans; fish; and timber, all of which earned more than half a million dollars. Interviews with exporters indicate that all of these commodities, with the notable exception of timber, continue to be the most lucrative and highest volume agricultural NTE's during 1991.  Indeed, these commodities have been the leading agricultural NTE's for the past 3 years.  While horticultural products, especially banana and pineapples, have also been exports of high value, infrastructural constraints (especially appropriate storage and transport) currently prevent these commodities from growing as rapidly as other NTE's. Commodity specific analyses indicate that most marketing arrangements remain fragile for NTE's.  Lack of adequate financing to maintain high levels of marketing activities is a common constraint cited by firms involved in virtually every NTE. In addition, the ability of speculators to undermine contractual relationships between exporters and producers or to threaten the marketing relationships made by private investors also poses a threat to the development of sustainable growth in NTE's. Nevertheless, the potential for continued growth in NTE's remains high.  Fish exports, in particular, will continue to grow as new processing facilities are opened in 1991.  But additional investments in marketing infrastructure, including storage and transport, could increase exports at an even faster rate than has been achieved to date. Moreover, more focused TA to specific firms could help them increase their export marketing efforts.

"Mid-term evaluation of a project to promote private sector development in Africa.  The evaluation covers the period 1988- 1991. The project is being implemented by the Africa Bureau's Office of Market Development and Investment (AFR/MDI), with support from private contractors. End-of-project targets established in 1988 were generally reached by mid-1991.  These include having Missions integrate private sector work into their country strategies, assisting African governments with privatization efforts, establishing multiple new credit facilities, and facilitating policy changes in many priority countries.  More specific efforts have included: (1) technical assistance and funding to promote trade missions, evaluate export processing zones, develop agribusiness activities, and support small businesses; (2) creation of innovative financial sector programs including policy reform measures, credit facilitation, debt swap exchanges, and venture capital promotion; (3) joint funding of major private sector development programs with other donors and U.S. agencies; and (4) matchmaking activities with U.S. and African businesses. Efforts to stimulate private sector development in a region long dominated by socialist-minded leaders have been outstandingly innovative, and individual programs have generally been managed satisfactorily, though coordination and follow up have sometimes been lacking.  Most programs, although only having been conducted in the past 1-3 years, appear to have had a modestly positive if generally unmeasurable impact.  On the negative side, despite Africa's growing sense of economic realism and appreciation of the importance of the private sector in economic development, the slow pace of economic reform and bureaucratic rules and practices that delay commitments and preclude risk taking have posed a major constraint to the project. Other findings are as follows.  (1) The decision to support multiple, sometimes precedent-establishing promotional programs has been appropriate during a period when African leaders and most Missions were starting to appreciate the justification for private sector led growth. (2) Efforts to channel AFR resources through organizations such as the multilateral African Project Development Facility (APDF), and the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC), have been particularly successful in leveraging major incremental commitments by those organizations. (3) Use of contract personnel to augment the work of A.I.D. direct hires has been effective and should continue.  (4) Although some services provided by MDI to missions, e.g., privatization and finance operations, are duplicated through centrally funded PRE operations, Missions generally prefer to use MDI resources.  PRE officials have expressly cited a desire to collaborate more closely with private sector programs in Africa. Other A.I.D. private sector offices, such as those in the Latin America and Asia bureaus, are currently retrenching efforts to directly influence the role of the private sector in host countries, opting instead for limited interventions through private intermediaries such as chambers of commerce and joint business/governmental groups, and for policy dialogue.  Such a policy is not yet an appropriate short-term model for Africa, given the region's economic backwardness and lack of private institutions.","Delivery order no. 33","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-0085-I-00-9060-00","","10/1/1991 12:00:00 AM","","Private sector|Private enterprises|Export promotion|Credit|Policy reform|Economic policy","Africa south of Sahara","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABD291.pdf","4,979 KB","000356 - Checchi and Co.

"Mid-term evaluation of a project to conduct research on childhood communicable diseases in India to expand the range of vaccines, develop diagnostic techniques, and improve the efficacy of immunization programs. The project is implemented under the umbrella Indo-U.S. Vaccine Action Program (VAP). The evaluation covers the period through 5/91. Negative press coverage (aka ""VAP Flap"") in the very early stages of the VAP has greatly influenced project direction. Many applied research activities such as field trials for a malaria vaccine and epidemiological studies have been dropped. Instead, the project has focused on laboratory work, including development and testing of vaccines and diagnostic probes. The project has funded 8 collaborative research projects and another 20 pre-proposals are in the review process. Despite a very complex structure, the project has been effectively managed. The Secretariats in the United States and India have established procedures to provide researchers with the required support. Scientists from both countries have benefitted. Indian researchers have gained access to leading U.S. investigators, state-of-the-art techniques, and vital equipment for their laboratories. The U.S. side has improved its standing in India, especially among the scientific community, and has had the opportunity to work with diseases and materials not normally available in the United States. Research quality has varied from very good to fair. In some cases, the grants enabled researchers to develop their skills and laboratory equipment. Several other grantees were highly qualified and experienced and have carried out more balanced collaborations with their counterparts. However, the expectation that a vaccine in any of the priority diseases will be developed during the current project is unrealistic: the time is too short and funds are much too limited. Nonetheless, there have been notable intermediate scientific accomplishments such as new findings on rotavirus infections and greater understanding of hepatitis E and its impact on pregnant women. A number of VAP officials have voiced concerns about the project's bias toward basic research. It is recommended that the follow-on project, if approved, attempt a better balance between basic and applied research and involve the private sector.","Companion evaluation summary: PD-ABE-447","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-5929-I-00-2109-00","","5/1/1991 12:00:00 AM","","Immunizations|Disease research|Vaccines|Research collaboration","USA|India","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABD293.pdf","2,770 KB","005553 - John Snow, Inc.

"In the Philippines, there is little cohesive government structure capable of attacking the country's environmental problems or preventing new development from adding to them.  This report focuses on the Philippines' administrative and political framework for dealing with urban and industrial environmental problems.  The report covers:  (1) major environmental subsectors -- surface and subsurface water resources, domestic water supply and sewerage, the coastal zone, solid waste (domestic and industrial), and gaseous waste; (2)  relationships between the environment and the economy; (3) government and private sector roles; (4) research, information, and TA needs; and (5) a role for USAID.  The report finds that environmental degradation is visible in most urban centers of the country.  While it has been easy to point to industry as the major cause of environmental problems, in fact domestic sources contribute the majority of byproducts and residuals to water, air, and ground.  The public sector is bogged down by a maze of agencies, statutes, and layers of government, and there is no mechanism in place to coordinate government environmental actions.  On the bright side, however, there is convincing evidence that many major firms, both private and government-controlled, are willing to fully cooperate with government agencies in bringing industrial pollution under control. Numerous recommendations are made.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","5/1/1991 12:00:00 AM","","Urban development|Industrial development|Institutional aspects|Government departments|Political aspects|National level|Local level|Water resources|Solid wastes|Pollution|Natural resource management","Philippines","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNABJ564.pdf","24,214 KB","005072 - Tropical Research and Development, Inc.|000422 - Dames and Moore International","","008592 - USAID.

"Mid-term evaluation of a project to strengthen public sector family planning (FP) services, conduct contraceptive social marketing, and increase private sector FP service delivery in Costa Rica.  The evaluation covered the period through 6/91. Although the public sector FP program is still marked by numerous weaknesses, some progress has been made.  The project has contributed to the establishment of a Reproductive Health (SR) unit in the Preventive Medicine Department of the Costa Rican Institute for Social Security (CCSS), and FP services are available in virtually all CCSS and Ministry of Health service facilities.  Contraceptive supplies are generally adequate, FP informational materials have been distributed to all facilities, and supervision is good.  CCSS and the MOH recognize FP as an essential service, and CCSS will assume full financial responsibility for FP when USAID/CR support is terminated. Principal weaknesses of the public sector program include:  (1) serious delays in reforming medical and nursing school curricula to incorporate FP as a subject and in providing FP in-service training; (2) failure to integrate the SR unit into the CCSS; (3) lack of technical or administrative authority of SR unit supervisors, resulting in deviations from guidelines for contraceptive supply; (4) poor research skills and management information systems; (5) lack of SR unit skills in program planning and management; (6) lack of progress in sex education for the in-school population; and (7) lack of organized postpartum FP counseling. The contraceptive social marketing program has been implemented by PROFAMILIA, a for-profit subsidiary of the Costa Rican Demographic Association, using condoms provided free by USAID. PROFAMILIA's condom sales have increased from 500,000 to 2.6 million, or 30% of the market. The firm has not been successful in offering oral contraceptives, due to product registration requirements and lack of interest among suppliers. However, PROFAMILIA has made remarkable progress toward financial self-sufficiency. Net assets of $1 million and 100% self-sufficiency are expected by the end of 1995. The project has made little progress in expanding the alternatives for FP service delivery.  CCSS does give financial support to several doctors' cooperatives in urban areas.  Clients receive care free of charge, but in effect, if employed, are paying through their social security taxes.","Companion ES: PD-ABF-589|Project title: Population technical assistance (POPTECH)","Special Evaluation","Documents","DPE-3024-Z-00-8078-00","","10/1/1991 12:00:00 AM","","Family planning services|Contraceptive distribution|Commercial retail sale of contraceptives","Costa Rica","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABD302.pdf","781 KB","006243 - Dual & Associates, Inc.|000673 - International Science and Technology Institute, Inc.

"The justification for the existence of the Bean/Cowpea Collaborative Research Support Program (B/C CRSP) is as valid today as it was 12 years ago because:  (1) the estimated worldwide production is 7.7 million ha for cowpeas and 10.3 million ha for beans, and is mostly located in developing countries; (2) the crop provides an important dietary component (protein) for many of the world's poorest people; (3) the crops are better adapted to poor marginal soils and low, erratic rainfall areas where population pressures are forcing more intensive farming. This report deals primarily with the past 3 years (1989-1991). While the previous Administrative Management Review Team complimented the Management Office for its adept management of the CRSP during a period of declining budgets, this team compliments their sound management during a period of increasing budgets.  The team feels that the apportionment of the budget increase recognized new and needed research and training thrusts within the projects recommended in the five-year extension (1992-1997). Secondly, the team supports the initiation of new emphasis in the area of economics and women in development (WID). The latter two needs have been repeatedly stressed in recent External Evaluation Panel (EEP) recommendations. The team observed that the procedures and criteria used to initiate new projects, move projects to other countries, or to phase out projects are well documented and are carried out carefully and efficiently. The B/C CRSP is operating in its twelfth year.  Significant technological advancements have been developed through interdisciplinary research in the area of germplasm improvement for both U.S. and host country growers.  This CRSP is supplying ""upstream research"" in biotechnology areas that have tremendous worldwide potential.  At the same time, it is also generating simple technologies such as improved varieties, cultural practices, control of field and storage insects, and improved nutrition.  The CRSP scientists have used the full range of scientific methodologies to reach their research objectives. Linkages have been established with other CRSP's, international agricultural research centers, and other scientific research institutions around the world.  Through these linkages, the CRSP has been able to extend its technologies to other scientists and to producers in many countries.  This includes female farmers in Africa, Latin America, and the Caribbean. Training has been and continues to be an important component of the CRSP.  During its first decade, the program has provided degree training for 219 students and non-degree training for 899 participants.  During the last 3 years, significant increases in the number of students trained have been achieved. The WID component has contributed significant input to most of the projects.  The recent addition of an economics component will provide equally valuable contributions. In summary, the management of this CRSP has performed all the essential services and financial management requirements, as spelled out in the CRSP guidelines and the Program Grant Agreement.  During site visits and interviews, the team sensed no real problems at any time or at any place.  However, the review team has identified opportunities to improve overall management procedures.  Thus, the recommendations contained in this report are made in an effort to ""fine tune"" the management of an efficiently operated and productive research program which has had measurable impact in both the United States and in host countries.

"Evaluates the Food Security Management (FSM) project (3910491) to improve the Government of Pakistan's (GOP's) ability to manage the national food security system and the agricultural sector. Final evaluation covers the period 1984-1991.  The evaluation includes an interim assessment of the TA component of the follow- on Agricultural Sector Support Program (ASSP -- 3910492), which provides balance of payments support tied to agricultural policy reforms. Following initial delays, a combination of factors came together in the last half of the FSM project which brought remarkable institutional and policy changes and physical and managerial improvements.  Policy reforms already implemented and storage facility rehabilitation are estimated to save the GOP at least Rs. 3,863 million annually. Activities in economic policy analysis have increased GOP capacity to analyze policy issues, evidenced by the creation of the Economic Wing, and produced bases for significant reforms. Research produced by the economic analysis network contributed to the termination of the ration-shop system, actions to reduce subsidies and encourage private sector participation in storage, ending of mark-up free credit, and other reforms; especially valuable were the contributions of the International Food Policy Research Institute and the Agricultural Policy and Analysis project.  However, the Economic Wing needs to further increase its analytic capacity and its role in the decision-making process. Agricultural data collection has not yet produced usable national-level crop estimates; problems have included delays in applying the area frame sampling methodology (due partly to the Ministry of Defense's reluctance to allow use of aerial photos). Current plans are to produce the first provincial estimate in 1/92, and the first national survey in 7/93.  More accurate crop forecasts will result in savings from more accurate estimates of storage/import levels needed to assure food security. The postharvest management component produced tangible benefits  Over 578,000 tons of storage capacity were rehabilitated, which, in combination with training of managers and operators, reduced annual wheat losses by 3%; training of other managers and operators reduced losses by an additional 1%. Training has not yet been institutionalized, however. Rehabilitating existing facilities as opposed to new construction yielded a savings of Rs. 986 million in public borrowing. Research on the feasibility of bulk grain handling has been delayed, but there is a potential for a 45% increase in storage capacity, and the opportunity for private-sector manufacture of equipment. Agribusiness promotion activities have supported market-oriented GOP policies.  Accomplishments include greater recognition of the role of the private sector in the policy process, establishment of an Agribusiness Cell within the Ministry of Food, Agriculture, and Cooperatives (MINFA), and several studies to aid in policy formulation and stimulate private investment; investments in excess of $50 million in commercial seed production, citrus processing, and edible oil/feed mills are expected. Despite the projects' successes, several deficiencies remain, including failure of MINFA's economic units to work together in cohesive, supportive way.  It remains to be seen if the GOP has the ability and will to sustain all project components as a core effort to bring permanent policy reform. These lessons were learned.  (1) Projects targeting policy change take relatively long to achieve results, and hence require a design that permits adjustment during implementation. (2) Economic and policy analysis units must establish both horizontal linkages with complementary organizations and vertical linkages with policymakers.","Delivery order no. 08|Companion evaluation summary: PD-ABE-302","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-1406-I-00-0032-00","","7/1/1991 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural policy|Food security|Policy analysis|Policy reform|Government departments|Institution building|Post harvest operations|Agricultural storage facilities","Pakistan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABD308.pdf","2,207 KB","004307 - Winrock International.

"Final impact evaluation of a project (1983-91) to improve the Government of Peru's (GOP) capacity to formulate and implement agricultural policies. Due to Peru's tremendous political, economic, and social problems, the project has had little impact on agricultural production and farmer incomes.  It has, however, helped somewhat to increase the GOP's capacity to formulate and execute agricultural policy; 2 of 6 indicators for purpose achievement are present:  (1) leading policymakers turn frequently to the project-created Agricultural Policy Analysis Group (GAPA) for help; and (2) the example of the GAPA has instilled an official awareness of the need for, and created a demand for, an agricultural policy unit.  GAPA's position is precarious, however.  It does not include significant private sector participation as envisioned, depends almost entirely for its administrative functions on the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) and for salary support on USAID for salary support, and, for bureaucratic or financial reasons, has retained practically none of the high-ranking professionals trained through the project -- pointing out a major obstacle to this and similar projects in Peru: public sector salaries are not high enough to retain competent personnel, thwarting the intended institutional development goals of training. While the national rural household survey yielded valuable data, its usefulness was limited by the inclusion of many questions peripheral to the main topic -- rural income -- and by a failure to tabulate, analyze, and disseminate findings adequately (due in part to a lack of coordination between the survey's implementing agency and its main target audience, policymakers). Efforts to develop a system for generating continuous crop production statistics had only modest results; Peru still lacks a viable system for generating accurate, objective production statistics.  Problems included a failure to elicit Peruvian input in the design process. The Agroclimatic Impact Assessment activity also failed to meet expectations.  The data contained in the bulletins were not useful to either policymakers or farmers.  In addition, there are other mechanisms which already meet farmers' needs in this area (e.g., the Boletin Agroclimatico del Peru). Management support to the MOA had little impact, due to such factors as low salaries, policy shifts, institutional restructuring, and recent staff reduction.  Computer equipment and training supplied by the project are of potential value, however. Project training, instead of reinforcing the public sector, is enabling trainees to leave it, due to both low salaries and the GOP's reluctance (for political reasons) to place trainees in positions commensurate with their field and level of training. Of six persons who received U.S. training to work for GAPA, none work there today.  Also, the degree completion rate of MOA personnel and regional faculty at the National Agrarian University at La Molina has been low.  It appears that carefully targeted impact training -- training of professionals for at least a month abroad or in Peru -- is more productive than the seminar/short course approach.  Lastly, none of the training promoted the Quechua language and culture, which predominates over large areas of Peru, missing an opportunity to address one of Peru's major underlying sociocultural problems. Management of the project was compromised by its excessive scope and bureaucratic obstacles; in particular, GOP bureaucracy has obstructed the timely disbursement of P.L. 480 funds.  Nor has USAID maintained sufficient management oversight.  In general, projects this complex are simply not suited to Peru's situation, and should be broken into smaller, discrete projects.","Delivery order no. 6|Contract no. on cover page listed as: PDC-140G-I-00-0073-00","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","PDC-1406-I-00-0073-00","","10/1/1991 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural policy|Policy making|Institution building","Peru","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABD347.pdf","8,145 KB","005072 - Tropical Research and Development, Inc.","","008591 - USAID.

"Mid-term evaluation of a grant to Save The Children Federation (SCF) to conduct child survival activities in select areas of Showak and Um Ruwaba, Sudan.  The evaluation covered the period through 9/91. Despite famine and economic instability, the project has continued to operate with some notable achievements.  Both impact areas have met objectives for full coverage with childhood immunizations.  Training and educational activities have resulted in a high level of knowledge among mothers as well as village health committees about oral rehydration therapy (ORT) and Vitamin A supplements.  In addition, village mothers have modified their traditional practices by continuing feeding during episodes of diarrhea, thereby reducing the mortality risk as well as nutritional complications. On the negative side, despite high coverage rates, the quality of immunization activities is threatened by the Ministry of Health's (MOH) failure to monitor the cold chain in Showak District, where vaccines are stored.  Also, MOH supplies of oral rehydration salts are virtually unavailable in both areas.  Inadequate numbers of mothers have received nutrition education to enable them to understand the significance of growth monitoring. Consequently, very few children have participated in growth monitoring activities.  Due to external factors, SCF has failed to achieve its objectives regarding child spacing and family planning methods.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","OTR-0150-C-00-0143-00","","1/1/1991 12:00:00 AM","","Child survival activities|Oral rehydration therapy|Immunizations|Community health care","Sudan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABD355.pdf","490 KB","002892 - Automation Research Systems, Ltd.","","000088 - USAID.

"Mid-term evaluation of a project to establish a regional agricultural university for the humid tropics in Costa Rica.  The evaluation covers the period 9/85-7/91. La Escuela de Agricultura de la Region Tropical Humeda (E.A.R.T.H.) has made outstanding progress.  The education provided is relevant to the management of natural resources for responsible farming in the humid tropics; faculty, administrators, and students are of high quality; resources are more than adequate; and financial viability at least through 1999 is reasonably assured.  Emphasis now must be placed on making adjustments in strategy.  The university is in a transitional period in which the locus of control is shifting from outside to inside the institution.  As a result, there is considerable uncertainty among faculty, administrators, and students about E.A.R.T.H.'s fundamental purpose and direction, as well as conflicting interpretations of the educational paradigm. The following major strategic issues need to be resolved:  (1) the extent to which the curriculum should be expanded to cover additional functions of novel farming systems for the humid tropics; (2) the method by which an appropriate paradigm of responsible farming should be developed, adopted by the faculty as its own unique ethical praxis, and translated into theoretically sound and ethically defensible educational strategies; and (3) assurance of E.A.R.T.H.'s long-term financial viability in terms both of financial and risk management.","Evaluation summary: PD-ABH-629","Special Evaluation","Documents","LAC-0032-C-00-9036-00","","11/1/1991 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural colleges|Agricultural education|Natural resource management|Tropical zone|Institution building|Strategic planning","Central America|Costa Rica","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABD444.pdf","2,960 KB","000223 - Academy for Educational Development, Inc.

"PACR of a project (1983-1990) to (1) conduct research on predicting entrepreneurial performance and (2) evaluate entrepreneurial training programs. The first component, implemented by McBer and Co., was designed to involve research in three countries to identify (through several hundred personal interviews) the characteristics that differentiate superior from average experienced businesspersons. This plan proved too ambitious, and research was reduced to two countries.  McBer's analyses yielded only a limited ability to predict business performance from a knowledge of personal characteristics.  The initial working assumption that superior businesspersons would have higher ""achievement motivation"" was not demonstrated in the data.  Possible correlations were found between success and up-to-date business knowledge as well as good management information/monitoring patterns. The second component, carried out by Management Systems International, provided modest evidence that it is possible to affect business performance through entrepreneurial training. There is no evidence in these analyses, however, as to which forms of training are most cost-effective or that such training is likely to be any more effective than other form of technical, capital, or policy reform assistance to the small enterprise sector. Three major lessons were learned.  (1) The study of entrepreneurial psychological characteristics appears complex, costly, and unlikely to yield more than modest findings.  (2) The present analysis is not an adequate basis for a decision on whether to mount a major program of entrepreneurial training in developing countries.  (3) Project evaluation should be contracted to a different party than the implementing agent.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","7/1/1991 12:00:00 AM","","Private enterprises|Entrepreneurs|Entrepreneurship|Psychology research","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABD448.pdf","121 KB","006458 - USAID.

"Women typically comprise only a very small percentage of clients of government-owned financial institutions.  However, women make up a significant portion of the clientele of two Indonesian programs -- the Unit Desa network of the Bank Rakyat Indonesia (BRI) and the village financial institutions supervised by government provincial banks, the Bank Pembangunan Daerahs (BPD's).  This paper analyzes these female clients in terms of participation, loan sizes and terms, repayment, saving, occupations, access to credit, and income levels.  Major findings include the following:  (1) Female participation is higher in the BPD systems, which have the greatest outreach into the villages where women tend to live and work.  In the most decentralized BPD systems, women comprise as much as 72% of clients, compared with 24% at the BRI Unit Desa.  (2) Financial institutions that offer small loans at the village level and that charge market interest rates are more likely to reach women than cheaper, more centralized programs.  (3) Women are strong financial clients and have high savings levels relative to income.  (4) Women have fewer options to get credit than men.  The studies of the two programs drew conflicting conclusions regarding the effect on clients of increased access to financial services.  The paper reviews the survey methodologies to analyze these opposing results.","Project title: Growth and equity through microenterprise investment|(GEMINI)","Special Evaluation","Documents","DHR-5448-Q-18-9081-00|DHR-5448-Q-00-9081-00","","9/1/1991 12:00:00 AM","","Women in development|Gender analysis|Financial institutions|Loan administration|Credit|Savings and loan associations|Banks","Indonesia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNABJ902.pdf","982 KB","006727 - Development Alternatives, Inc.

"Evaluates project, jointly funded by USAID and the Canadian International Development Agency, to strengthen the Bangladesh Rice Research Institute (BRRI).  Mid-term evaluation covers the period 1/88-12/91.  USAID support of BRRI began in 1981. At this point in its development, BRRI, which was established in 1973, is a mature institution with some 210 research officers; about 60% hold M.Sc. degrees and 14% hold Ph.D.'s.  BRRI scientists have made it possible for Bangladesh to become almost self-sufficient in rice production over the past 20 years despite rapid population growth. However, BRRI management needs improvement in a number of areas:  the Institute has been unable to expand the responsibilities of its mid-level scientists; its task force approach to research management should be updated; regional stations do not have the necessary personnel; infrastructure development is inadequate; and laboratory facilities for testing soil pH or salinity are lacking.  Donor representatives are not always up-to-date on project or BRRI research activities. Support of BRRI at the national level has been weak. Insufficient government funding of operational research costs (only about one-fourth of the World Bank standard) is a serious constraint.  The Bangladesh Agricultural Research Council has weak management capabilities and does not coordinate closely with member research institutes in developing strategic planning documents.  Disbursement of research operating funds through the Council is slow and not based on targeted performance indicators. Salaries and benefits for scientists are unsatisfactory -- a major factor in the recent increase in staff departures from BRRI. BRRI progress in varietal development research is impressive. Since inception, BRRI has released 26 new rice varieties.  The marginal internal rate of return on rice research investment is about 165%.  The process for licensing approved rice varieties through the National Seed Board is cumbersome and delays distribution of certified seed to farmers.  Although there has been an apparent decline in yield of modern varieties since 1970, this is most likely due to expanded use of the varieties in less favorable areas by farmers unable to afford input application. Major increases in boro (dry winter season) yield could be obtained through irrigation. The BRRI farming systems research division pioneered site-oriented systems research in Bangladesh.  The BRRI methodology develops technology packages at a relatively low cost that reflect on-farm research conducted over a wide geographic area. However, since the early 1980's, donor-supported research activities have moved beyond BRRI's traditional crop-based FSR to include technology transfer.  The expanded programs require expensive infrastructure and permanent site-specific professional staffing, and have made research activities more tenuous and confusing. Additional weaknesses in BRRI research include:  lack of economic and financial analysis to assess commercial viability of whole farm systems and lack of on-farm testing of improved postharvest rice technologies targeted toward women. Technology transfer activities need to be improved, as evidenced by the major gap between technology available and that adopted by farmers. This can be achieved by integrating the functions of BRRI and private sector outreach organizations.","Delivery order no. 19|Companion evaluation summary: PD-ABE-115","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-1406-I-00-0033-00","","12/1/1991 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural research|Rice|Agricultural technology|Seed testing|Varietal research|Research organizations|Institution building","Bangladesh","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABD491.pdf","1,514 KB","001335 - Chemonics International Consulting Div.","","008511 - USAID.

"Evaluates project component to strengthen Honduras' National Elections Tribunal (TNE) and its dependency, the National Registry of Persons (RNP).  Midterm evaluation covers the period 9/87-12/90. Virtually no progress has been made in up-dating, verifying, and microfilming the RNP civil registration lists.  Only about 200,000 of 20 million records were microfilmed by 6/89, and even these will probably not be used.  Nor has it been determined whether the method planned for updating the records will result in a reliable electoral roll.  Further project assistance should be limited to a feasibility study of alternative updating procedures and an implementation plan and budget for the most feasible process. No progress has been made in institutionalizing and depoliticizing the RNP, and it is not clear that any can be expected in the near future.  A career law for the RNP was introduced in the Congress, but not passed.  The TNE is reportedly drafting its own career legislation. A high level discussion is needed to confirm whether or not the political will exists to seek a career law for RNP and TNE. On the positive side, support for the 1989 election was generally effective.  The election took place on schedule in a relatively orderly fashion with a high level of voter participation and relatively few complaints.  The training of election workers was important in this success; 41 supervisors were trained and they in turn trained 295 instructors, who trained 58,841 election workers.  USAID/H and TNE believe that the voting places were better managed in 1989 than in the 1985 election.  The evaluation team agrees, but thinks that follow-up surveys of election workers and the general public should have been undertaken to verify this conclusion.  Also, three public education campaigns were successfully carried out, covering voter registration, the work of the TNE, and the electoral process, but again, a follow-up survey should have been carried out. TNE generally was not pleased with the TA provided by the U.S. contractors, but spoke highly of Gerentes y Empresarios Asociados de Honduras (GEMAH), which conducted three seminars and helped plan the election. Three major issues surfaced during the evaluation.  (1) Close U.S.involvement in a Honduran election is not healthy.  (2) USAID/H should fund a study to ascertain the degree to which current electoral practices discriminate against women being included on the electoral rolls and/or being able to cast their vote.  (3) Because of their influence on hiring RNP employees and running the TNE, political parties must be included in discussions of future USAID support.","Related documents: PD-ABD-500, PD-ABD-501, PD-ABD-503|Companion Evaluation Summaries: PD-ABJ-168 and PD-ABJ-171|In: Evaluation report : strengthening democratic institutions|project, no. 3","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1991 12:00:00 AM","","Institution building|Elections|Electoral systems|Public administration|Civil service|Beneficiary count|Voter registration","Honduras","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABD502.pdf","1,405 KB","000436 - Development Associates, Inc.","","008555 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to strengthen democratic institutions in Honduras. Mid-term evaluation covers the period 9/87-12/90 and covers a project component to offer conferences and seminars in democratic processes for local elected officials and community leaders.  The evaluation also offers summary reflections on, and lessons learned from, the project as a whole. The only activity undertaken to date under this component, which is an adjunct to the three main components (administration of justice, legislative enhancement, and voter registration and elections improvement), has been a series of seminars -- six on political theory and eight on the principles of economics -- organized for union members by the American Institute for Free Labor Development.  While the seminars seem to have been well received, there has been no effort to determine their impact, and their content is only marginally related to the project purpose. This component is begging for a strategy, a plan, some thought. It could be used to promote discussion about, and possibly foster support for, some of the unfilled conditions precedent and covenants in the Memoranda of Understanding for the other project components.  Other groups besides labor unions are worthy of some attention.  Support for formal and informal civic education could also be fostered. A major policy issue that arose during the evaluation was a lack of progress in creating career services in the three counterpart agencies, a step that is considered essential to depoliticizing democratic institutions.  The evaluation found no evidence that this issue had been brought to high levels of the Government of Honduras.  However, subsequently some progress has been made, particularly with respect to implementation of the Judicial Career Law. Implementation progress has lagged in all components, due partly to lengthy contracting delays and partly to inadequate staffing within USAID/H (the latter remains a problem), partly to unsatisfactory (and at times recriminatory) contractor-USAID- counterpart relationships.  Two other negative factors have been: (1) the 11/89 election, which virtually brought all other activities under the project to a halt; and (2) the project's rush to update National Registry data without adequate analysis of the problem or the proposed solution. The project's potential impact on women was not addressed in the design stage, nor has it been considered during implementation. USAID/H should fund a study to determine to what extent women are able to exercise their right to vote, to run for office, and to be members of Congress and of the judiciary. The principal conclusions regarding the design of the project are as follows:  the assumption that there was commitment by political leaders to change has not been borne out; there was inadequate study of the issues surrounding cleansing of the voting rolls, leading to an attempt to do something on a crash basis, which even if successful might not have contributed to a higher credibility for the election; given the extreme political sensitivities surrounding the election, one would have expected the design to have provided for a less obtrusive role for USAID than it had played in the 1985 election; although the PP speaks of compartmentalizing the different components so that delay or problems in one component would not create problems for the others, the actual design had the opposite effect. Four general lessons have been learned.  (1) The attempt to implement this project as an umbrella project with three components, rather than as two or three distinct projects, did not really reduce management workload.  Implementation difficulties and delays seem to indicate that the umbrella concept is not worth maintaining.  (2) There is a lack of information sharing about common problems affecting Central America. Neither the Mission nor the contractor are well informed about similar Agency activities in other countries in the region.  (3) It is not in the best interest of either the United States or a host government to place the A.I.D. symbol on equipment or supplies to be used in polling places.  A.I.D. should waive this requirement in the future.  (4) Since the project was a new type of initiative for A.I.D., it would have benefitted from broader based and unrushed planning.  A.I.D. should also establish mechanisms to obtain outside review and advice fairly regularly during project implementation.","Work order no. 41|Contains summary of PD-ABD-500, PD-ABD-501, PD-ABD-502|Companion Evaluation Summaries: PD-ABJ-168 and PD-ABJ-172|In: Evaluation report : strengthening democratic institutions|project, no. 4","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-5317-I-00-8127-00","","1/1/1991 12:00:00 AM","","Political development|Democracy|Administration of law|Judiciary|Civil service|Legislature|Elections","Honduras","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABD503.pdf","4,153 KB","000436 - Development Associates, Inc.","","008555 - USAID.

"Mid-term evaluation of a project to provide technical and managerial training to Burundians at the middle and senior levels in selected private and public institutions.  The evaluation covers the period 8/87-7/91. The project, whose purpose was revised in 1989 to focus more sharply on the private sector and the development of markets for farmers and small and medium enterprises, has been carefully and professionally managed and has achieved most of its targets. Long-term U.S. training starts are completed, with 19 candidates either returned, in training, or selected and ready to begin. Short-term U.S. and third-country training measured by completed programs and planned starts, has reach 103 of 105 planned. In- country training has reached 214 persons vs. 350 planned, and several additional large in-country programs have already been designed, contracted out, and funded.  The project has also completed training in all thematic areas (agricultural/rural support, policy reform, business management, and market expansion) with the exception of rural-based microenterprise development, which is scheduled. Training has had some measurable impact on individuals, especially those from the private sector, who make up 37% of long-term trainees, 28% of short-term trainees, and 62% of in- country trainees.  Moreover, nearly all civil servants sent for training have responsibilities in economic development and private sector promotion.  The project has exceeded its 15% target for women's participation.  Except for the Agricultural Research Institute of Burundi and the Chamber of Commerce, training has not had a significant impact on institutional development. English-language training has been cost-effective, innovative in design, and supportive of the project.  Pre-departure orientation, however, has been less thorough than required, especially for U.S. short-term training.  Although training in French was appropriate for certain audiences and themes, training in Kirundi for low-income women was also highly successful, suggesting that more programs of this type should be organized. A series of entrepreneurial development workshops and a training needs assessment were too costly and produced few results.  Other in-country training programs were better tuned to Burundi's development needs.","French ed.: PD-ABD-505|Conpanion evaluation summary: PD-ABE-692","Special Evaluation","Documents","AFR-0121-C-00-1004-00","","10/1/1991 12:00:00 AM","","Education for development|Participants|Technical training|Management training|Private sector|Rural development","Burundi","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABD504.pdf","2,032 KB","006007 - AMEX International, Inc.","","008522 - USAID.

"Evaluates PVO crossborder programs to provide humanitarian and rehabilitation services in Afghanistan.  The evaluation covers the period from the mid-1980's to 12/91. The evaluation focuses on activities implemented by four U.S. PVO's: Volunteers in Technical Assistance (VITA); CARE; Mercy Corps International (MCI); and the International Rescue Committee (IRC). Emphasis is on information helpful in improving VITA activities. VITA was one of the first PVO's to establish a sizable rural works program inside Afghanistan.  VITA's strengths lie in the political sensitivity and judgment of its Afghan leadership. With good relationships with the tanzeems (Afghan politico-religious parties based in Peshawar, Pakistan) and with local commanders inside Afghanistan, VITA has managed to stay neutral in a volatile environment.  Its staff are technically competent, even overqualified, in implementing canal, irrigation, road, and bridge projects.  If VITA can be faulted, it is with respect to the single purpose, scattered nature of its interventions, providing little opportunity for continuing involvement with Afghan communities.  Also, VITA staff are not trained to evaluate impact (in fact, this is a deficiency among all four PVO's). Working at a few sites in two provinces adjacent to Pakistan, CARE implements highly labor-intensive agricultural and rural works projects. CARE runs a meticulous operation, yet has been caught in political crossfire, both between Afghan factions and with other PVO's. MCI's primary work is the distribution of seed wheat, fertilizer, and other farm inputs.  With support from the UNDP and other sources in addition to USAID, as well as food aid from the World Food Program, MCI has more flexibility than VITA in responding to the needs of particular communities. Also, political conditions in its area of operations are more favorable for long-term programming. IRC's Rural Assistance Project is of particular interest for the guidance and training it provides to its subgrantees, especially Afghan PVO's.  If institutionally strengthened, these local PVO's could play an important grassroots role in rural rehabilitation. Recommendations address the need for:  training of Afghan monitoring staff; more attention to working with villages in a more multi-dimensional manner; PVO coordination of operational activities at the field level; and more donor support for the Agency Coordinating Body for Afghan Relief at Peshawar.  In particular, VITA should be allowed to operate more freely, especially with regard to the types of projects it implements and the support it can draw from other donors.","Delivery order no. 7|Companion evaluation summary: PD-ABD-925","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-5517-I-11-0103-00","","12/1/1991 12:00:00 AM","","Private voluntary organizations|War relief|Rural development|Public works|Economic infrastructure","Afghanistan|Pakistan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABD526.pdf","5,129 KB","001335 - Chemonics International Consulting Div.","","008588 - USAID.

"Mid-term evaluation of a project to promote production of nontraditional export crops in Costa Rica's northern zone through TA to farmers, road maintenance and rehabilitation, community development, land settlement and titling, and environmental management.  The evaluation covers the period through 12/91. The project is in serious trouble.  Were it not for the high expectations of thousands of area residents and farmers, it would be advisable to terminate the project immediately.  A major problem has been the location of the project coordinating office as an extension unit of the Ministry of Planning.  The office's lack of autonomy has caused duplication of effort, unwarranted delays, and conflicts of interest for contractors and project personnel.  About 2 years were required to negotiate the agreements and contracts with public and private institutions participating in the project. Another problem occurred due to a misunderstanding concerning the expected role of the agricultural TA contractor, SISTTEMS.  While the project expected TA activities to include all factors needed for crop production from site selection to marketing, SISTTEMS felt restricted to providing only TA and training at the farm level. Nonetheless, SISTTEMS is technically competent and necessary adjustments can be achieved.  Currently, there are 1,500 farmers ready to plant 1,775 ha with four export crops:  passion fruit, black pepper, heart of palm, and cocoa.  Limited credit will soon be available. Market outlook for heart of palm and passion fruit is good.  In order for black pepper and cacao to be reasonably profitable, community-level fermentation and drying units will have to be installed.  Also, SISTTEMS should consider diversification to citrus crops. Progress in other activities has been as follows:  (1) Efforts to strengthen the Association of Road Maintenance have not produced visible results and there appears no sound evidence that it can become a self-sustainable organization.  (2) With project help, the Directorate for Community Development (DINADECO) has strengthened the ability of Development Associations to play a more meaningful role in area development.  The project should go on to help DINADECO provide seed and plant materials to enable the thousands of poor families in the project area to supplement their diets by planting bananas, fruit trees, and perhaps vegetables around their homes.  (3) Land settlement and titling is progressing slowly but according to plans.  No further funding from the project is recommended.  (4) The environmental management component is progressing normally, after a slow start. The project director has demonstrated a willingness to implement necessary administrative and technical adjustments.  With a 2- year extension, project goals and purpose can be achieved.","Delivery order no. 10|Spanish ed.: PD-ABD-546|Companion evaluation summary: PD-ABH-879","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-1406-I-00-0034-00","","12/1/1991 12:00:00 AM","","Nontraditional agricultural exports|Crop production|Integrated rural development|Agricultural extension|Farmer training","Costa Rica","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABD545.pdf","4,569 KB","006958 - International Resources Group (IRG)","","008533 - USAID.

"Evaluates a project to develop the capabilities of Omani institutions to manage water resources, and to undertake water supply and wastewater disposal improvement projects in the Capital Region and in selected towns and villages in Northern Oman.  Interim evaluation covers the period 1986-1991. Start-up was delayed nearly 3 years due to the project's complexity and shifting responsibilities for water sector management within the Government of Oman.  The Project Paper has been frequently amended: Salalah, in the South, has replaced the North as a project focus, and a new Ministry of Water Resources (MWR) was created and has become another subproject focus. However, the project seems to finally be on track, with a good mix of TA, training, and construction. At this early stage, it appears that the most successful elements are the 3 master planning activities and support to the MWR. Technical assistance and training are performing well.  Project momentum has picked up in recent months, with several construction contracts either already or soon to be awarded. The Omanis have just begun to experience the considerable capability of U.S. consulting and training institutions; these experiences will have to continue for several more years if technology transfer is to have its full impact.  Only then should the water sector be dropped from the Omani-American Joint Commission portfolio. Some key recommendations are as follows.  (1) Following completion of the preliminary master plans and training needs assessments, the PACD should be extended and remaining funds programmed accordingly.  (2) The project's future focus should emphasize its strengths in the areas of TA and training, especially for the support of policy and institutional objectives and technology transfer.  (3) Construction activities, if continued under the FAR (fixed amount reimbursement) method, should focus on short-term discrete projects and consider U.S. procurement interests where appropriate. An important lesson learned is that institutional arrangements should be settled in the design stage, and the Government of Oman should be in full agreement.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","5/1/1991 12:00:00 AM","","Water management|Water supply engineering|Water supply structures|Wastewater","Oman","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDCBK481.pdf","1,171 KB","008587 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (1985-1990) to increase contraceptive use in Tunisia by providing assistance to the National Family and Population Office (ONFP) in information, education, and communication activities (IEC); contraceptive social marketing (CSM); training; and demographic and operations research. The project achieved its goal of increasing contraceptive prevalence by 9% and was quite effective in strengthening ONFP's institutional capacity, particularly in the areas of IEC, CSM, and training.  The IEC/CSM program assisted ONFP in analyzing media research data, fine-tuning the computerized management information system for product distribution and billing, developing radio and TV spots, and designing strategies and marketing plans.  The media program was initially constrained by fears that conservative groups would react negatively to the family planning messages, the first to be aired on Tunisian TV and radio.  As a result, there was less systematic reliance on message testing and media survey findings than planned.  However, research results confirmed the positive attitude of the population towards media advertising for family planning. The project provided initial supplies of contraceptives and then assisted ONFP in developing the management capabilities and acquiring the financial resources necessary for sustainability of its CSM program. ONFP is now purchasing contraceptive products with its own funds, and is poised to introduce new product lines and adopt a pricing strategy that gradually decreases subsidies. The project strengthened and decentralized the capacity for family planning training.  ONFP personnel were organized into inter-regional teams and assisted in providing in-service, pre- service/academic, and postgraduate training to midwives, physicians, nurses, pharmacists, and social workers.  ONFP personnel were also trained to perform needs assessment and evaluation to identify changing needs and measure the impact of training programs. Significant gains have been made in the areas of research and management, although much remains to be done.  Eight research activities were conducted:  a knowledge, attitudes, and practices survey of medical and paramedical service providers; a national survey on continuation and failure rates of pill and IUD acceptors; integrated family health and family planning in the North and North Western governorates; a pilot project for integrated family planning services in peri-urban areas; a family health operations research project in the maternal/child health centers of Monastir and Sayada; a survey on the determinants of fertility in Tunisia; a survey and cost analysis of family planning service delivery functions in both the public and private sectors; and demographic health surveys. A major lesson is that while the project made remarkable achievements, ONFP is nearly overloaded with responsibilities, especially in the area of research.  In addition, ONFP will need targeted TA to ensure the continuation of innovative program elements for which there is little in-country experience.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","10/1/1991 12:00:00 AM","","Family planning services|Family planning education|Contraceptive distribution|Commercial retail sale of contraceptives|Social marketing|IEC","Tunisia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABD549.pdf","788 KB","008616 - USAID.

"Evaluates a project to develop infrastructure, particularly roads, bridges, seaports, and airports, to support economic growth in rural areas of the Philippines.  Interim evaluation covers the period 8/87-10/91. The project got off to an exceedingly slow start due to a series of unexpected problems, chief among which were the protracted and eventually fruitless contract negotiations between the Government of the Philippines (GOP) and a U.S. contractor, which consumed 40% of the original anticipated life of the project.  The project was then granted a 2-year extension.  Once the project got underway, however, implementation was reasonably satisfactory. Three major road subprojects (including bridges) are under construction, and a smaller fourth spur has been given the go-ahead.  Of the six seaports slated for construction, one has been completed and the other five are nearing completion; navigational aids equipment has been delivered, technical training provided, and the equipment is operational.  A number of other relatively minor subprojects have been given notices to proceed, or are awaiting such notice subject to availability of funds.  It is reasonable to expect that all the subprojects underway and in the pipeline, will be completed by the 12/94 PACD. Key recommendations include the following:  (1) improved GOP/USAID review of contractor selection under host country contracting; (2) formal definition by the GOP of the lines of authority in project implementation; (3) accelerated GOP procedures for contractor reimbursement and for resolving right- of-way, customs clearance, and tax reimbursement issues; and (4) establishment of a formal procedure by USAID/P and the GOP to accelerate issues resolution. Four major lessons were learned.  (1) Host country contracts require almost as much attention from USAID as direct contracts, and are less predictable.  (2) Greater attention should be paid to developing detailed cost estimates and projections.  (3) Time should be allowed for unforeseeable problems, especially during project start-up.  (4) Commitment rates are a more appropriate indicator of progress in infrastructure projects than actual expenditures.","Delivery order no. 40|Companion evaluation summary: PD-ABE-218","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-0085-I-00-9060-00|492-0420-C-00-1239-00","","11/1/1991 12:00:00 AM","","Transportation infrastructure|Economic infrastructure|Road construction|Bridge construction|Transportation facilities|Ports","Philippines","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABD560.pdf","6,191 KB","000356 - Checchi and Co.

"Interim evaluation of a project to provide TA to the Government of Honduras for a pilot program to denationalize 12-15 state-owned enterprises (SOE's), especially those of the National Investment Corporation (CONADI).  Second evaluation covers the period 3/89-9/91. Since the election of the Callejas administration 18 months ago, the project has stalled, with only one SOE privatized, mainly due to incompetent management by CONADI.  The situation is exacerbated by the fact that the administration, despite a stated commitment to privatization, has failed to give the Privatization Commission the legal authority to require CONADI -- which is in effect implementing its own dissolution -- to meet specific deadlines or otherwise impel the other institutional actors involved in the process to comply efficiently with their mandates.  There are also growing concerns that the integrity of the privatization process is being compromised by CONADI's refusal to make all pertinent information public. In other ways, the project is working well and to some degree even exceeding original expectations.  The project has begun to expand beyond statutorily targeted parastatals to include public service agencies, effectively creating a de facto privatization policy.  In addition, the privatization process itself remains intact.  The economic benefits of privatization are clear and significant.  The project has resulted in the creation of jobs, reductions in the fiscal deficit, increases in export and foreign exchange earnings, and improvements in the balance of trade. While organized labor continues to oppose privatization, it has not been very forceful or effective.  In the case of the Ministry of Communications, Public Works, and Transportation (SECOPT), for example, one-third of the workforce was laid off without a major confrontation with the unions.  In return, a small number of specific jobs were retained.  The use of USAID local currency to underwrite severance pay has proven to be an essential ingredient for success.  USAID/H and the implementing agency have maintained a low public profile, which has been effective in establishing the project as a Honduran initiative. The following lessons were learned.  (1) Clear and determined presidential leadership and a central management authority are essential for a privatization project to succeed.  (2) The political environment is perhaps the most important determinant of the success or failure of privatization.  (3) Privatization is a means to economic growth and development, not an end in itself. (4) Severance payments blunt criticism from organized labor and cushion the impact of lay-offs.  (5) Not all SOE's can or should be privatized.  Some assets are insufficiently attractive for investors and should be shut down to avoid the cost of maintaining them.  (6) Data bases on privatization should be kept to track economic benefits.  (7) The privatization process should include built-in institutional checks and balances.  (8) A central authority empowered to manage the privatization process is essential.","Companion evaluation summary: PD-ABD-561","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","9/1/1991 12:00:00 AM","","Privatization|Public enterprises|Political aspects|Management operations","Honduras","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABD561.pdf","2,781 KB","000354 - Carana Corp.","","008555 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of a project to improve Nigerian health education related to child survival activities.  The evaluation covers the period 5/87-8/91. In Niger State, the project assisted the Health Education Unit (HEU) of the Ministry of Health in improving immunization education.  The project persuaded the Ministry to finance the expansion of the HEU by constructing a graphics unit and a darkroom, and the HEU now has its own budget line in the annual budget.  Training of HEU staff focused on three elements:  the use of focus groups to determine the level of knowledge about childhood diseases, the importance of pretesting print and radio messages, and the wide use of print materials in face-to-face communications.  The importance of pretesting seems to be the most widely assimilated element.  The project also succeeded in developing close collaboration between the HEU and radio and television producers. HEU staff complained that they were not sufficiently involved in the planning of project activities and were not informed of the extent of available project resources. The project was also criticized for not working sufficiently with other development projects in Niger State. In the Rafi and Suleja local government areas, the project worked to improve school pupils' health through potable water and improved personal hygiene, organization of school health clubs, improved malaria treatment, and increased immunizations for measles.  One-week workshops were held for screeners and vaccinators from health facilities, for teachers, and for traditional birth attendants and members of some nongovernment organizations.  The intervention succeeded in establishing collaboration among organizations with a common goal and in obtaining the full support of local government officials. However, there was no evidence that the intervention had any impact on malaria treatment or measles immunization. attributed to:  overly broad objectives, unclear training, unrealistic expectations for student activities, and the termination of the monitoring and supervision system. At the federal level, the project aimed to improved the capacity of the HEU in Lagos.  The project succeeded in upgrading the graphics capabilities of the HEU dramatically through a combination of training and equipment purchases.  However, due to rapid turnover of counterparts, no one was sufficiently trained in the project methodology to carry on by themselves.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","DPE-1018-C-00-5063-00","","8/1/1991 12:00:00 AM","","Health education|Medical education|Child survival activities|Immunizations|Measles|Malaria","Nigeria","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABD565.pdf","1,834 KB","000223 - Academy for Educational Development, Inc.

"Ex post evaluation of a project to implement a communications campaign on child survival in Jordan and to institutionalize the communications methodology within Jordanian institutions.  The evaluation covers the period 7/87-7/89. The project developed a high-quality, effective communication program, even though administrative and technical delays consumed 9 of the project's 24 months.  The program addressed child- spacing and breastfeeding and developed radio and television messages on these topics.  The breastfeeding messages were broadcast in 1989 and 1990, but the child-spacing spots were never aired because of their controversial nature. Exposure to the breastfeeding media campaign was high; 94% of mothers reported having heard the song which was played in the radio and television spot, while 89% and 69% of mothers reported having heard, respectively, the television and radio spots. Initiation of breastfeeding within 6 hours after birth increased significantly during the campaign, but only among mothers who gave birth in a public hospital or at home.  Knowledge about correct breastfeeding initiation increased to very high levels, while results concerning awareness of supplementation were more mixed. The contractor -- the Academy for Educational Development (AED) - - provided on-the-job training to staff at the Noor al Hussein Foundation, the primary implementing agency. Formal training activities, conducted for Foundation staff and other institutions, including the Ministry of Health (MOH), included 5 workshops on the communications methodology, a national seminar on breastfeeding, and special sessions to train focus group leaders.  Parts of the methodology (pretesting, use of focus groups and formative research) have been adopted by participants, but only two people, both project staff at the Foundation, understand the methodology as a whole, and one has already left the Foundation.  This weakness is due to the project's short operational timeframe and the insufficient amount of formal training.  Although AED expected learning to take place primarily through on-the-job training, formal training was a priority among participants. Attempts to form a coordinated health communication team with representatives from various institutions were unsuccessful, as a strong cooperative spirit did not develop, again largely due to time limitations.  Most project participants felt the project should have been implemented through the MOH.  Although the Foundation, being outside the bureaucracy, offered flexibility, the MOH could have ensured greater continuity and sustainability. The major lesson learned is the importance of local participation in choosing the topics to be addressed in a communications project.  Child spacing seems to have been chosen primarily by USAID/J and AED, who deemed it appropriate for a communication campaign in Jordan.  By contrast, the Foundation and the MOH found the subject too controversial.  As an institution linked to the queen, the Foundation in particular was very careful about not promoting controversial activities.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","DPE-1018-C-00-5063-00","","3/1/1991 12:00:00 AM","","Health education|Child survival activities|IEC|Mass media|Radio|Television|Breastfeeding|Family planning education|Institution building|Political aspects","Jordan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABD566.pdf","3,083 KB","000223 - Academy for Educational Development, Inc.

"During the past 15 years, USAID has provided more than $50 million to family planning and maternal/child health (FP/MCH) activities in Morocco. Beginning with a focus on FP, USAID assistance has evolved into an integrated FP/MCH approach primarily through an outreach program known as Visite a Domiciles de Motivation Systematique. Current assistance consists of four components: FP, immunization, diarrheal disease control, and nutritional surveillance. According to this evaluation, the FP and immunization programs, which received the bulk of USAID support, have both been effective. Contraceptive use is becoming more widespread and the fertility rate is going down. Vaccination coverage is rising, mortality from immunizable diseases is declining, and reported incidence of vaccine-preventable diseases has dropped considerably. Success in combatting diarrheal disease, however, has been modest, with only slight improvement in knowledge and use of oral rehydration therapy. While nutritional status has improved, this is probably due more to a general improvement in the standard of living than to USAID programs. Although there have been a number of concerns about the efficiency and sustainability of the Moroccan program, the report concludes that Morocco's experience demonstrates the value of offering selected child survival interventions as an integrated package. The model is replicable, but its success cannot be divorced from the context in which it functions. The following lessons can be learned from Morocco's FP/MCH system. (1) If properly motivated, public health workers will deliver good care to rural populations. (2) An FP program can be successfully initiated even in the absence of a stated public policy. (3) Careful phasing in of activities can lead to a more successful program. (4) Giving priority to FP and immunization is a valid strategy in child survival. (5) Ideally, the private sector should be involved as soon as possible (as was not the case in Morocco).","French ed.: PN-AAX-259","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","12/1/1991 12:00:00 AM","","Child survival activities|Maternal child health care|Family planning services|Immunizations|Diarrhea|Integrated health care|Health outreach services|Nutritional status","Morocco","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAX254.pdf","2,689 KB","006917 - USAID.

"Many consider El Alto, Bolivia, to be a socioeconomic time bomb. Adjacent to the capital of La Paz, the town's population is growing at over 9% per year -- the highest growth rate of any municipality in South America.  Poor rural migrants form the overwhelming majority of El Alto's residents and are responsible for 90% of its annual population increase.  In 1988, A.I.D. sponsored the establishment of a nongovernmental organization, PROA, to work with local government and community groups in development activities.  PROA is now in transition from pilot project to established program.  This report reviews PROA's experience to date, assesses the organization's potential for financial sustainability, and presents lessons learned regarding A.I.D.'s role in promoting municipal development and local democracy in Bolivia.  The pilot project was very successful. PROA has helped attract $38.4 million in investment to El Alto and maintained good relations with local government and other organizations, despite a highly politicized environment.  Due to the weaknesses of local government, PROA channels most of its assistance to community organizations.  PROA's participatory method has gained credibility with local people and many organizations. However, PROA must become more project-driven in order to achieve higher cost recovery.  A.I.D. should continue to fund substantial portions of PROA's revenue gap over the next 3 years, but in declining amounts and on condition that PROA implement a business plan with targets for self-financing.  The Agency should also promote PROA to other donors.","Urban Institute [UI] project no. 6222|Companion evaluation summary: PD-ABD-109","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","12/1/1991 12:00:00 AM","","Urban development|Urban population growth|Rural urban migrations|Private organizations","Bolivia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNABK131.pdf","3,377 KB","002711 - Urban Institute (UI)","","008515 - USAID.

"In 1988, A.I.D. initiated a program to lessen Uganda's almost complete dependence on coffee by promoting nontraditional exports.  The program, which included a Commodity Import Program (CIP), complementary technical assistance, and P.L. 480 assistance, supported policy measures to:  (1) issue simultaneous export/import licenses for exporters of nontraditional commodities; (2) allow exporters to hold foreign exchange; (3) streamline procedures and reduce costs for obtaining export and import licenses and for using air cargo to export perishables. The program, according to this mid-term impact evaluation, is well on its way to achieving objectives.  The value and volume of nontraditional exports have risen at least fivefold, mainly in agricultural staples, which require relatively simple marketing and transport arrangements and a knowledge and technology base already available.  Increases in exports of fresh fruits and vegetables have not been as dramatic because their special production, infrastructure, and marketing requirements remain inadequately developed.  Other key factors in the program's success have included rehabilitation of major roads; active policy dialogue with the host government and other donors; an indigenous capacity for policy reform; and a strategy of demonstrating immediate benefits and focusing on limited, manageable policy changes.  On the negative side, collection and monitoring of baseline data, so necessary for measuring program achievements, were inadequately developed; foreign exchange subsidies, though initially helpful in stimulating the nontraditional sector, in effect provided windfall profits to some importers; and the USAID Mission's decision to choose beneficiary firms on a case-by-case basis also resulted in windfall profits for some firms.  A key lesson learned is that in Uganda, program success depends on well-conceived policies, not on the type of assistance.","Appendices: PN-ABK-411 (AID evaluation working paper report no. 148)","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","12/1/1991 12:00:00 AM","","Nontraditional exports|Export promotion|Export diversification|Nonproject assistance|Policy reform|Foreign exchange","Uganda","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAX252.pdf","2,469 KB","006917 - USAID.

"Since 1985, A.I.D. has assisted 19 African governments in restructuring their economies.  This report presents case studies of the economic reform programs in six of these countries -- Mali, The Gambia, Senegal, Cameroon, Uganda, and Malawi. The report concludes that the programs were generally successful, though in most cases they took longer than expected and many objectives have not yet been fully achieved.  Major findings are as follows.  (1) The removal of price and market controls generally had an immediate and positive impact, despite the occasional reluctance of the private sector to take full advantage of new investment and marketing opportunities.  (2) The elimination of subsidies and industrial protection spurred productive efficiency but required some painful adjustments for firms that had previously been protected.  (3) Removal of import and export controls improved efficiency, but did not prevent government bureaucratic delays.  (4) Elimination of monopolies held by state-owned enterprises opened markets and allowed the private sector to compete and deliver goods at a much lower cost. Constraints included linked markets (those still controlled by governments) and inadequate business infrastructure.  (5) Tax reforms to improve economic incentives, as well as tax collection and civil service reforms, appear promising but results are uneven.  (6) Programs to develop host country capacity for internal reform helped build long-term policy reform sustainability.  (7) The programs required large analytical staff input from both A.I.D. and the host government.  (8) Policy reform involves a highly complex set of political, economic, and social changes with winners and losers in both the public and private sectors.  Lessons learned are detailed in conclusion.","Evaluation highlights: PN-ABG-003|Summary: PN-AAX-253","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","12/1/1991 12:00:00 AM","","Economic policy|Policy reform|Economic reform|Structural adjustment","Mali|Gambia|Senegal|Cameroon|Uganda|Malawi","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAX253.pdf","93 KB","006917 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (1980-1990) to provide potable water, sanitation facilities, and health education in six western departments of Guatemala. The project was originally designed with many health activities and sub-activities, which made it very complex to implement.  The administrative organization did not function well, as the government agency responsible (the Directorate General of Health Services) did not have the required personnel for efficient and timely execution of the program.  In 1985, the project was modified to focus exclusively on the environmental sanitation component. However, several activities in primary health care were undertaken during the period 1980-1985.  Achievements included: training of 1,590 rural health promoters and 922 midwives; retraining of 1,210 rural health promoters and 556 midwives; anthropometric measurements of more than 6,600 newborn babies and more than 433,000 children under age 5, leading to detection of 362 undernourished babies and 19,515 undernourished children; and food and vitamin distribution to 15,673 persons.  Immunizations and oral rehydration were carried out as well. In the environmental sanitation component, construction of water systems faced numerous problems, including a scarcity of counterpart funds, untimely disbursement of funds, and high turnover of construction engineers.  Nonetheless, construction targets were met, with systems completed in 302 communities and in progress in 25 more.  Water committees are in place in all of these communities.  The project also constructed more than 29,000 latrines and provided training to 782 persons in water system maintenance and organization. In addition to meeting construction targets, the project also left an organized unit within the Government of Guatemala for future water supply and sanitation projects.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","11/1/1991 12:00:00 AM","","Water supply|Potable water|Primary health care|Health education","Guatemala","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABD590.pdf","229 KB","008550 - USAID.

"Evaluates a project to improve forest management in Honduras. Interim evaluation covers the period 1987-1991. The first project component, institutional reorientation of the Honduran Forestry Development Corporation (COHDEFOR), has produced mixed results.  A new standing timber sale program is in effect, as planned. Sales contracts now contain provisions requiring COHDEFOR to locate roads, skid trails, and landings according to environmentally sound standards.  However, residual value appraisals of standing trees have yet to be initiated, and both supervision and quality control need improvement. COHDEFOR is improving its capacity to monitor private sector lumber exports; e.g., a grading manual has been produced (but not yet implemented).  Planned improvements in COHDEFOR's marketing department have not yet taken place.  Finally, and most importantly, though some specific objectives have been met (e.g., reduced past due receivables, and development of operational manuals), overall management at COHDEFOR has not improved, due mostly to the employment of political appointees rather than professional managers in key positions, especially in the areas of financial management and accounting. In the pilot forest management component, two model forest management units (FMU's) have been selected:  La Union and Salama; a third remains to be chosen.  La Union is functioning well as the training and development unit for the new timber sales program, and many of its goals have been accomplished or are in process; however, the level of harvesting has been excessive.  Also, community extension work needs to be reinforced; more employment opportunities in forestry would increase the people's awareness of the forest's value, and thus help prevent forest fires.  Salama has had a management plan developed, but has not yet begun timber sale operations.  Two wildlife refuges have been established; their development and management will provide a basis for COHDEFOR's new mandate to manage Honduras's protected areas. The third component, to strengthen the private sector forest industry, has been well received and productive.  Band sawmill production has increased from 60% to 74%, and efficiency improved from 191 bd.ft./cubic meter to 220 bd.ft./cubic meter in the mills sampled; all mills are receiving over 100% more logs in the 6 to 10 inch range as a direct result of the new timber sale program.  However, improvement in harvesting methods has been nil; only one short course addressed logging.  Project TA has strengthened the Honduran Association of Sawmill Operators, but more assistance in sawmill operation and technology is needed. The training program has been quite successful, though it has not functioned through the Escuela Nacional de Ciencas Forestales as originally planned.  Due to a cumbersome loan process which requires buying new equipment in the United States, few mills took advantage of the credit portion of the project, which is being suspended; larger and medium-sized mills met project goals using private financing. Three significant lessons were learned.  (1) The success of TA depends on the individuals selected, not on parent organizations. (2) Management by objectives requires team leaders to monitor the project by reporting.  This did not occur under the long-term TA team.  (3) Managerial effectiveness and improvement depends upon hiring professionals rather than relying on political appointees.","Delivery order no. 6|Companion evaluation summary: PD-ABE-753","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-5517-I-00-0103-00","","12/1/1991 12:00:00 AM","","Forestry|Timber|Wood industry|Institution building|Environmental protection|Sawmills|Protected wildlife areas|Community participation|Technical training","Honduras","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABD604.pdf","6,265 KB","001335 - Chemonics International Consulting Div.","","008555 - USAID.

"Mid-term evaluation of a cooperative agreement with the Salesian Society to improve its institutional capacity for development work by upgrading its headquarters' managerial and technical capacity, training Salesians throughout the developing world in development methodologies, and improving its development projects.  The evaluation covers the period 1989-7/91. The Salesian Society has made substantial progress despite sharp reductions in A.I.D. funding and grant term (compared with the Society's proposed program).  The headquarters has increased staff, developed a consultant roster, prepared an operations manual, and installed a new accounting and financial management system, and professional staff have been trained in A.I.D. project procedures.  A major donor diversification effort was implemented by obtaining funding from the Kellogg Foundation for eight major projects.  The Society has also established operating relationships with Salesians worldwide and expanded contacts with foreign donors; the latter effort is constrained, however, by factors beyond the Society's control and should be dropped as an objective of the cooperative agreement. To institutionalize methodologies, the Society developed training programs in project design and implementation.  So far 152 Salesians from 24 Salesian provinces have participated in 5 courses, and another 4 courses are planned.  The programs have been well received, have awakened Salesian interest in development projects, and given Salesians a common language, orientation, and methodology for seeking donor assistance.  However, the training should be carried out by Salesian trainers, given the high cost of contracted training. Besides the eight large projects funded by the Kellogg Foundation, the Society has submitted ten small projects for financing under the project (six of which have been approved) and is engaged in five USAID Mission projects in Nicaragua, the Philippines, Indonesia, and Paraguay. At the same time, the ability of Salesians to implement projects varies considerably. It is recommended that the Society create provincial-level project units, especially for USAID projects, and scale back its development portfolio, which has grown too large for the headquarters to handle; elimination of the cooperative agreement's small projects element is especially urged.  The Society should also consider longer-term staffing requirements. A one-year extension of funding should be considered to help absorb the heavy project implementation burden and consolidate other achievements.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","9/1/1991 12:00:00 AM","","Institution building|Development project design|Management training|Development projects|Development project management","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABD605.pdf","1,568 KB","004929 - Charles Blankstein Associates, Inc.","","000088 - USAID.

"Mid-term evaluation of a project to provide training to Guinean private and public sector employees through programs in the United States and third countries and through in-country seminars.  The evaluation covers the period 4/88-5/91. In general, the project is strong and well managed.  Success is reflected in the level of support it receives from the Government of Guinea, as well as the recognition it receives from other donors.  The project has achieved objectives in terms of the number of trainees, with some 1,600 individuals participating, of whom 47% have been women and 54% from the private sector. Managerial capacity is high, especially in terms of the management information system.  The project has the opportunity to make significant long-term contributions not only to Guinea, but also to overall human resources development, especially in the areas of local institutional strengthening, development, and use of training impact indicators and needs assessment methodologies. As the project grows and evolves, attention should be paid to the following.  (1) The training office should take care not to let administrative work take precedence over program management.  (2) Reaching numerical targets for participants should not take precedence over assuring that all training placements are appropriate.  (3) With increased participant and dollar volume, the need for clarity and completeness of documentation will become more pronounced.  (4) Subcommittees of the Private Sector Advisory Boards should have more entrepreneurs as members.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","6/1/1991 12:00:00 AM","","Education for development|Participants|Management information systems|Participant program administration","Guinea","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABD610.pdf","2,576 KB","005159 - Labat-Anderson, Inc.","","008551 - USAID.

As a result of the recovery effort, nearly 7,000 families received credit for rebuilding their homes; over 3,000 businesses were re-established; 36,124 families received building materials to erect temporary living quarters and 2,000 families were relocated to more habitable areas.  All basic public services were restored to operation; 724 classrooms were constructed and another 240 were repaired; temporary hospital wards, operating rooms, warehouses, offices, and clinics were built; temporary markets were constructed; 3 municipal government buildings were restored; and nearly 50 temporary offices and buildings for critical governmental activities were built in 6 major complexes. The project also helped to re-open the streets of San Salvador by removing 115,000 cubic meters of rubble.  In the process of clean-up, about 900,000 person-days of employment were generated for people who were left unemployed by the earthquake.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","7/1/1991 12:00:00 AM","","Earthquakes|Environmental disasters|Disaster relief|Public works|Building construction|Beneficiary count","El Salvador","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDKAV671.pdf","749 KB","008540 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (1982-1990) to strengthen the institutional capacity of the Social Forestry Department (SFD) in the Indian state of Maharashtra in assisting villagers to manage communal and private lands for sustainable forestry production. The project purpose has generally been achieved.  Public and private nurseries produced 45.8 million seedlings in 1986-87 (the last year of project assistance for seedling production) vs. a goal of 23 million. Moreover, 167 million seedlings were produced with funds from the state of Maharashtra and the Government of India in 1989-90.  Some 75,000 ha of tree plantations were established with project funds (vs. a targeted 81,000 ha), and 199,000 ha were established subsequently with state funds. The state government's initiative to increase social forestry afforestation following termination of USAID/I field assistance clearly demonstrates SFD's intention to expand and sustain the program.  Also, all 4,300 targeted villages were reached by SFD extension staff. The SFD created divisions with trained, experienced staff in each of 27 districts.  In-country training programs were conducted for SFD staff and villagers, including social workers, council members, students, and teachers.  Villager training programs focused primarily on seedling growth and tree establishment, while staff training dealt with issues like rural sociology, extension, and communication.  The project also supported overseas training for SFD officials in specialized areas. However, while the in-country training programs exceeded targets, only 60% of the overseas training target was attained, due to elaborate or delayed government nominating procedures. Biological research and socioeconomic studies were carried out either through SFD departments or contracts with other institutions, and are expected to contribute to technical improvements and better market links.  Preliminary results of biological research have been disseminated through the state training and visit extension system. Findings of the socioeconomic studies will help SFD consider alternative policy options and changes to support social forestry and related wasteland development programs.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1991 12:00:00 AM","","Forestry|Community participation|Technical training|Biology research|Socioeconomic aspects","India","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDCBK936.pdf","287 KB","008557 - USAID.

"Final external evaluation of a project (1982-1992) to strengthen the capacity of public and private institutions in developing countries to manage and conserve natural resources.  The World Resources Institute's (WRI) Center for International Development and Environment (CIDE) implemented the project. After the 1985 project revision, project activities were carried out in 53 countries -- 24 in Africa, 14 in Asia/Near East, and 15 in Latin America -- under four interrelated programs:  (1) natural resource management strategies and assessments (NRMSA); (2) support to NGO's; (3) natural resource data management (NRDM); and (4) sustainable agriculture (SA). Nearly half of the project's activities were NRMSA related; these included environmental profiles, natural resource assessments, and environmental strategies and action plans.  The project's participatory approach helped strengthen host country capacities from the governmental to the grassroots level, contributing to policy formulation, the creation and strengthening of institutions, multi-sectoral coordination, capacity for data management and environmental assessment, and mechanisms for private sector/NGO participation in NRM.  Most NRMSA activities have been associated with extensive follow-on activities by host country institutions and external support agencies. NGO support activities have included the development and dissemination of guides and analytical tools on participatory approaches to NRM.  With financial and technical assistance, the project has actively brought NGO's into national level NRM policy and planning activities.  Through an NGO policy impact program (partially funded by the project and with major support from U.S. foundations), CIDE has undertaken a research and case study program to document community experiences in NRM. NRDM activities have increased the availability, analysis, and use of natural resources data to and by international agencies. While this component had less impact on the institutional level, the value of NRDM for strengthening national capabilities is being increasingly recognized, and tighter links between NRDM and NRMSA are planned. The sustainable agriculture program was a temporary casualty of the 1988 merger (which resulted in the creation of CIDE) between WRI and the original grantee, the International Institute for Environment and Development, which had given SA a prominent place in the project. However, in 1990 CIDE began to reestablish itself in the field of SA, and is currently examining how best to do so.  CIDE's renewed interest in SA addresses factors common to other project areas, e.g., increasing grassroots participation and promoting equity, and could also bring into focus elements not currently addressed under the project. The project has also partially supported a number of activities outside the four main theme areas, including the preparation of 30 biodiversity profiles and 15 tropical forestry and land use plans. Efforts to examine gender-related constraints in NRM were slight and unsystematic. The activity of implementing the project has strengthened CIDE's institutional and technical capabilities; the benefits could have been greater, however, had the study of CIDE's institutional strengthening needs called for in the 1989 Project Paper supplement been conducted. The evaluation recommends a follow-on project, focusing on developing host country institutional capacity for NRM, and characterized by host country institutional ownership of the NRM processes and public participation at the grassroots level.  The current NRMSA framework could, with some broadening, be made the overall framework for the follow-on project.","Supplemental appendix volume: PD-ABD-875","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","7/1/1991 12:00:00 AM","","Natural resource management|Environmental planning|Private organizations|Information management|Sustainable agriculture|Institution building","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABD874.pdf","9,771 KB","","","000185 - USAID.

"Midterm evaluation of a project to use institutional analysis as a guiding approach to the financing and management of rural infrastructure.  The evaluation covers the period 9/87-5/91. The project has been generally successful.  Starting from a focus on rural infrastructure, it has now expanded sectorally to include natural resource management and structural reform. Significant short-term TA has been provided to seven Missions (Nepal, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Cameroon, the Philippines, Zaire, and Mali) in the areas of roads, irrigation, forestry, local resource mobilization, decentralization, and parastatal marketing reform.  The TA in most cases has been regarded as well done, professionally sound, and highly useful.  However, long-term ""demonstration country"" TA has not been provided as planned, mainly because Missions have been reluctant to provide buy-in funding, although it now appears that two of the three anticipated long-term buy-ins are likely to be implemented. The absence of long-term applied TA has meant that the project has not been able to test its approach under prolonged field conditions.  To a certain extent, the project has been able to compensate for this by drawing on the experience of senior staff and taking advantage of other research, not funded by A.I.D. As a result, the project is on or even ahead of schedule in producing general analytical material, including a state-of-the- art paper (currently under review by a major academic publisher), three sector papers, and a theoretical article.  Information has been disseminated through two newsletters, seminars, lectures, and presentations to a variety of audiences.  The challenge of combining theoretical analysis and project-oriented TA in a single project has on the whole been met successfully. The project has had some success in interesting other development thinkers and practitioners in using its institutional analysis approach. However, most Missions and host country development professionals have seen the project as a useful source of project-specific expertise, rather than as a general method for understanding development issues and formulating policy. It is recommended that the project be extended 2 years.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","DHR-5446-Z-00-7033-00","","5/1/1991 12:00:00 AM","","Institutional aspects|Policy analysis|Methodology development|Decentralization|Rural areas|Economic infrastructure|Development research","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABD897.pdf","4,821 KB","","","003647 - USAID.

"PACR of a subproject (8/86-7/91) to help the Windward Islands' cocoa industries to increase export revenues.  The Pan American Development Foundation (PADF) was the implementing agency. The project established 210 acres of contract demonstration plots, slightly over target, as well as a research/demonstration field. However, production on the contract plots was well below target (though in the case of Grenada the targeted 30% increase in cocoa production was unrealistic).  Acreage rehabilitation substantially exceeded target in St. Lucia, but was only 50% and 33% of target in Grenada and Dominica respectively. The project failed to establish the two planned joint ventures to use advanced hybrid cocoa production techniques.  Also, St. Vincent was dropped from the project due to failure to negotiate a Memorandum of Understanding with the Ministry of Agriculture. Overall, the project served to maintain an interest in cocoa production at a time when cocoa prices were falling and major attention was being placed on banana production.  There is little doubt that cocoa yields would have declined even further without the project.  At least partially as a result of the contract demonstrations and training provided by the project, the participating countries are poised to take advantage of improved prices in the flavor cocoa niche market and eventually to substitute cocoa for at least some banana production. Several lessons were learned.  (1) Project design should not only consider all the systemic constraints to improved production and marketing, but should address them all.  (2) Full-time, in-country advisory linkages are necessary if regional projects are to attain maximum effectiveness. (3) To the fullest extent possible, administrative, monitoring, and promotional activities should be carried out by local people rather than by senior technicians.  (4) Use of short-term in lieu of long-term TA can increase flexibility as to timing and range of expertise. An 8-10 year follow-on activity that addresses all aspects of cocoa production and export is recommended for funding under Project 5380163.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","8/1/1991 12:00:00 AM","","Crop production|Cocoa|Contract farming|Demonstration","Eastern Caribbean|Saint Lucia|Grenada|Dominica|Saint Vincent and the Grenadines","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABD911.pdf","89 KB","001757 - USAID.

"Provides final A.I.D. report on a grant to World Wildlife Fund (WWF) to develop a plan to establish Les Arcadins Marine Park in Haiti to protect a fragile coral reef system there. The grant was a success. WWF produced an Action Plan for the establishment and management of Les Arcadins as Haiti's first marine park. According to the plan, the park will preserve important areas of biological diversity, revitalize the local economy by providing a major scuba diving center for tourists, and contribute to the welfare of nearby artisanal fishing communities. WWF also produced a Resource Document that includes: a qualitative survey of habitat zones in the park area and a list of deep sea species; a semi-quantitative survey of fish species and fishery yields; a survey of sociocultural factors affecting the neighboring artisanal fishing community of Luly; and a study of tourism in Haiti. Certain elements of the project were not fulfilled, due mainly to social and political upheaval in Haiti. The planned educational program was not developed, and the biological survey conducted by WWF is not adequate to support statements in the Action Plan concerning Les Arcadins's great biodiversity and tourism potential. Overall, project studies provide a model for the development of additional marine parks in the Caribbean. However, future studies of this type should include a more rigorous economic analysis of the returns of the proposed park, and discussion of potential adverse effects from tourism.

"PACR of a project (6/81-5/91) to provide training, TA, and commodities to help Central American regional and national institutions to help control the spread of coffee rust and other pests of coffee production on small farms. For the first time in Central American history, the project organized the technical, financial, and administrative forces needed to combat a serious economic threat to the coffee industry.  To accomplish this, the project established a network for exchange of information and rust-resistant genetic materials between countries.  In addition to the scientific experiences gained in research and extension, the project trained thousands of national technicians and more than 25,000 small producers in modern methods of coffee production.  The regional institutional network established is capable of dealing technically and administratively with any future threat from the introduction of new coffee diseases or pests. The project had a major positive effect on coffee production throughout the region.  Small farmers using only improved cultural practices and chemical controls increased their yields from 500 pounds per manzana to over 1,600 pounds.  Farmers receiving credit and using the complete project technological package exceeded rates of 5,000 pounds or more per manzana. The main spinoff of the project was the realization by Central American leadership that much more can be accomplished in a cost-effective manner by working together to overcome common regional problems than by working alone. Lessons learned include the following.  (1) Reduced levels of chemical application and improved farm sanitation can control coffee rust and bean borer at economically feasible costs.  (2) A.I.D. financial support through ROCAP was the determining factor in the project's success.  Also of great importance, however, was the participation of international institutions such as IRCC of France, ICFC of Portugal, CENICAFE of Colombia, and the Federal University of Vicosa, Brazil.  (3) The whole coffee industry benefits from programs which target small producers.  The latter, in turn, are more likely to benefit from projects such as this when they are represented on the board of directors of national coffee institutions.  (4) Multi-institutional projects are better served when responsibilities and contributions of participating organizations are spelled out in precise detail.  The formation of interdisciplinary groups could further this end.  (5) The Friendship and Working Group (GAT) extension methodology developed in Colombia was employed with great success in Honduras and Guatemala. Subsequently, GAT's which employ a mass media information transfer system have been established in all PROMECAFE countries.  GAT's are also being successfully used in the Regional Agriculture Network Project (5960127).","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","9/1/1991 12:00:00 AM","","Regional development|Crop pests|Pest control|Crop disease control|Coffee|Farmer training|Small farms|Agricultural extension|Disease resistance|Beneficiary count","Central America","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABD947.pdf","381 KB","002290 - USAID.

"Mid-term evaluation of a project to improve the administration and financial stability of Costa Rican agricultural cooperatives and commodity producer associations involved in export.  The project is implemented by Agricultural Cooperative Development International (ACDI).  The evaluation covers the period 3/89- 5/91. The project's first 15 months were severely hampered by a reduction in the level of technical effort, the lack of TA in coffee renovation credit, distractions in solving problems with FEDECOOP, and delays in contracting local staff.  This delay has been partially overcome by the dedication and hard work of the staff.  Except for the efforts (now completed) of the external advisor in coffee credit, project resources have been well used. Output targets for the first 2 years have been surpassed in nearly every respect except for supervision and recuperation of funds disbursed for coffee renovation credit and financial stability of the cooperatives.  The delinquency problem is especially vexing; of the 7 participating FEDECOOP cooperatives, 3 are in serious financial difficulty and the others are close behind.  ACDI should continue the studies, already underway, aimed at resolving this problem. In general, ACDI has correctly selected clients on the basis of their potential impact in nontraditional exports and the desires of the Boards of Directors to introduce important changes in their business philosophy.  Tangible benefits of the project include the construction of a coffee processing plant for COOPEATENAS and a contract with ASOFRUPAC for the sale of mangoes through BANACOL. International training has given good results.  It is still too early to assess the effects of coffee cooperative training, since it was oriented not only to improving skills but also to changing attitudes and instilling a businesslike mentality. Technical materials prepared on the subjects of budgets, financial analysis, and the preparation and evaluation of projects are of good quality. ACDI relations with UNIBANC, COPISA, and USAID are good, and have so improved with FEDECOOP that ACDI technical staff are now comfortable supporting changes recommended at the highest administrative levels. This situation opens up enormous prospects for the project. It is likely that, as a result of project delays, funds allocated for credit will not be fully utilized.  Alternatives uses should be sought.

"Interim evaluation of a project to strengthen small farmer cooperative organizations in Honduras through TA, credit, and training. The evaluation, conducted by one of the project's three TA subcontractors, covers the period 9/85-4/91. Early in the project a decision was made to focus on one agricultural organization -- UNIOCOOP -- rather than three or four.  While this may have reduced the number of farmers reached directly, the sharper focus led to several key achievements. First of all, the project succeeded in developing and transferring an effective strengthening methodology to UNIOCOOP and its affiliates.  The process was clear and consistent and by involving the directors and managers of each cooperative, it ensured that relevant skills and a sense of ownership were instilled in the institutions.  By linking grants and loans to goals and adjustments in financial and managerial policies, it required the cooperatives to respond to project assistance with efforts of their own. The project's three components -- institutional support, financial stabilization, and credit -- complemented each other in several ways. For example, grants that supported extension agents and computerized accounting systems also promoted cooperative training and proper loan management.  Debt buy-downs also motivated cooperatives to make specific changes in their credit, administrative, and marketing policies.  The planning and strengthening process was transferred not only to UNIOCOOP but to most of its member cooperatives as well.  UNIOCOOP also defined its mission more clearly to focus on the reliable and cost- effective delivery of services.  By providing credit for UNIOCOOP to acquire fertilizer and inputs in a time of scarcity, the project reinforced member loyalty. While much of the initial planning process revolved around stabilizing the cooperatives, the project is starting to help the more stabilized institutions plan for growth by investing in productive assets.  TA and credit are now focused on improving commodity quality and marketing to enhance cooperative profitability.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","4/1/1991 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural cooperatives|Institution building|Small farms","Honduras","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABD994.pdf","1,099 KB","000238 - Agricultural Cooperative Development International (ACDI)","","000088 - USAID.

"Midterm evaluation of a project component -- known as the Biodiversity Support Program (BSP) -- to help developing country nongovernmental and governmental institutions implement activities aimed at conserving biological diversity.  The project is a joint venture among the World Wildlife Fund, the International Institute for Environment and Development (IIED), and The Nature Conservancy.  The evaluation covers the period 9/88-10/91. The BSP has been extraordinarily successful, ranking among the highest of all A.I.D. projects for the rate of buy-ins from Bureaus and Missions.  It has been very successful in reaching beyond the immediate members of the joint venture to the broader conservation and development community.  More than 50 separate institutions have been involved as direct participants in roughly 100 activities, plus 45 individuals in small grant research activities.  More than 60 countries have participated. The project has undertaken a broad range of activities, which have been completed in a timely fashion and have been of high quality.  On the other hand, there has not been a strategic focus to the individual components, nor have the linkages between components and activities been articulated. The project design was deliberately vague.  A.I.D. in effect placed its faith in the members of the joint ventures to build an appropriate program.  This resulted in a flexible program and committed staff. However, the project could have been even more effective and more self-adjusting if strategic planning had become part of regular operating procedures.  Also, disseminating the lessons learned from BSP could place the program at the forefront of biodiversity conservation efforts worldwide, particularly with regard to topics such as buffer zone management or integrated conservation and development projects.

"Final external evaluation of a 1981-91 project to improve basic education (comprising primary and preparatory education -- grades 1 through 9) in Egypt. The project has made major contributions to improving basic education in Egypt.  It has had marked impact on school access and enrollment, particularly in rural areas, and has been a driving force for implementing basic education reforms and improving curriculum design. Effective project management by USAID and the Egyptian Ministry of Education (MOE), excellent contractor work, and good cooperation among USAID, Egyptian officials, and contract personnel have yielded significant professional results. The goal of increasing enrollment of females and rural youth through the school construction program was attained.  More than 1,850 rural schools were constructed, surpassing the target of 1,300 by 50%, and 100 more are under construction, representing an increased capacity for basic education of 875,000 pupils a year; nevertheless, classroom overcrowding and facility maintenance remain areas of concern.  All primary enrollments have increased over the last decade, but the increase was particularly dramatic in rural areas, and especially among girls; female participation in rural primary schools increased from 36% to 42% of total enrollment, and in rural preparatory schools from 180,000 to over 700,000.  In urban areas, female enrollment doubled. The two educational reform units established by the MOE in 1989, the Educational Planning and Information Division (EPID) and the Center for Curriculum and Instructional Materials Development (CCIMD), are fulfilling their intended roles with the help of project TA.  EPID's Educational Management Information System reaches all 27 governorates, exceeding the target of 15. However, it is not yet the management tool envisioned; this will require continued TA.  The project has also helped develop the MOE's research capacity through its assistance to the EPID's Research Directorate, which completed two national surveys; however, institutionalization of the capacity to effectively use research and analysis in policy and planning decisions will also require a continuation of TA. The MOE has designated the CCIMD as the authoritative body for curriculum reform as envisioned by the Egyptian Educational Reform Act of 1988.  CCIMD's first product is an excellent curriculum for grades 1 to 3 in Environmental Studies, which integrates Science, Social Studies, Health, and Home Economics; the course materials and teachers' guides have been distributed to all schools.  Curriculum work in other key subject areas is ongoing, and will require at least 2 more years before all 5 grades of primary school are covered.  CCIMD lacks a system for evaluating curriculum impact; linkages with the newly created National Center for Educational Evaluation and Examinations, to which the project has provided limited support, should be strengthened. Retention of quality staff at CCIMD will require resolving organizational status issues.  The project also added a small TA component to address problems concerning special education, an area of growing concern to the Government of Egypt. It is strongly recommended that assistance be continued in all project areas to allow the impressive accomplishments of the project to come to full fruition.","Delivery order no. 12|Project title: Advancing basic education and literacy (ABEL)","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","PDC-5832-I-00-0095-00","","12/1/1991 12:00:00 AM","","Educational development|Primary education|Secondary education|Educational reform|Access to education|Building construction|School buildings|Rural areas|Women|Curriculum design|Institution building|Beneficiary count","Egypt","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABE132.pdf","3,068 KB","001341 - Creative Associates International, Inc.

"Over a period of three weeks, a survey was conducted in the catchment area of the Loitokitok Child Survival Project in Kenya to assess the status of project activities as of the end of the fourth year. The project has made great strides in improving health and nutrition in the community.  For example, full immunization coverage is well above 78%, and has been maintained at that level since the midterm evaluation (MTE); in fact, less than 5% of the households reported a case of measles in the previous year. More mothers know how to prepare and use oral rehydration salts (ORS) than did at the time of the MTE; 71% had used ORS to treat their children during the last episode of diarrhea, well above the targeted level of 50%.  Clinic attendance for antenatal services came to about 80%, and 58% of the mothers (compared to 50% targeted) had received at least two doses of tetanus toxoid vaccine before the last delivery. Attendance rates of children at growth monitoring sessions have increased steadily since the inception of the project.  At the time of this survey, 35% of the children were attending at least one session every second month, compared to 15% at the MTE. The proportion of children whose weight was below 60% (weight-for-age standard) of the median National Council Health Services (NCHS) was 2.3%. The use of modern methods of family planning is still at 10%; however, many more women expressed a desire to use contraceptives.  The desire for more children and lack of awareness about the existing methods of contraception were the reasons given for not practicing contraception. The use of trained traditional birth attendants and community health workers was much lower than expected.  The survey was also not able to collect reliable results on important vital statistics. There is still much room for improvement in the health status in the community.  More emphasis should be placed on developing mechanisms that will secure the sustainability of project's activities and achievements; continuous community involvement and participation of both local leaders and government agencies working in the area are key elements in achieving project sustainability.

"In September 1991, World Vision/Haiti carried out two overlapping Knowledge and Practice surveys on the Island of La Gonave:  (1) a final assessment of the interventions in 7 sections where the CS III project has been active since 1988; and (2) a baseline survey of 11 sections in which the extended project will be working. The latter survey will be used as a tool for future planning. Only the CS III final survey is discussed in this report. The survey followed the WHO model of 30 clusters, focusing on mothers of children under two years old.  Two hundred and forty mothers were interviewed.  Data entry and data analysis were done in EPI INFO 5.1. The results showed that the levels of knowledge and coverage were generally consistent with the project's objectives.  Seventy-four percent of children 12-23 months were completely immunized, compared to the objective of 75%.  The project called for 80% of mothers to use oral rehydration therapy (ORT) in case of diarrhea; survey results revealed that 70% of mothers with children experiencing a diarrhea episode in the last two weeks gave the child ORT packets.  Only maternal care fell significantly short of project's objective -- 42% of mothers had received tetanus toxoid (TT) two immunizations, versus the project objective of 70% coverage. These results highlight the priorities the project should focus on in the future:  diarrheal disease control, maternal care, and breastfeeding.

"Final report on the CS III Koutiala Child Survival Project in Mali, covering the period 10/87-9/91. Project activities were implemented mainly in the subdistricts of Koutiala Central and Mpessoba.  The project's components included nutrition, diarrheal disease control, growth monitoring, maternal health, and immunization for children and women of child bearing age. From 1988 until 1991, the intervention area included 54 villages and the town of Koutiala; the immunization component was implemented throughout the district of Koutiala.  Future interventions (1991 to 1994) will target the 54 villages in the Koutiala Central and Mpessoba subdistricts, including the town of Koutiala, and 6 new villages. The KAP survey carried out by World Vision Mali in Koutiala district had two purposes:  (1) a final assessment of the immunization intervention in the entire Koutiala district; and (2) a baseline survey in the 60 villages of Mpessoba subdistricts and Koutiala Central, including Koutiala town. The WHO model of 30 clusters was used in the two subdistricts and an additional 30 clusters were taken from the rest of the district.  For the CS III final survey on immunization, a total of 391 mothers were interviewed on their knowledge and practice in the whole Koutiala district.  The results showed coverage for children of 12-23 months to be low -- only 26% were fully immunized.  Mothers' knowledge about how many immunizations are needed, and at what age measles immunization should be given, was poor -- less than 10%. For the CS VII baseline survey, a total of 271 mothers were interviewed on the following topics:  nutrition, diarrheal disease control, growth monitoring, maternal health activities, and immunization for children and women of child-bearing age. The baseline survey results showed a low level of knowledge across all the components of the project.  In the nutrition component, only 5% of mothers were supplementing breast milk by six months.  In the diarrhea component, only 8% of mothers surveyed knew that dry mouth, shrunken eyes, and decreased urine output are important signs/symptoms of dehydration.  In the EPI component, only 22% of the children 12-23 months were fully immunized.  The results regarding maternal care intervention were more positive than in the other interventions: 53% visited a health post during their pregnancy. The project staff recognized that they will need to focus their efforts on training and health education in the future as primary means to strengthen these interventions.

"This document examines and evaluates the role of labor unions in USAID democratization efforts, as part of a larger analysis of the role of political development (i.e., democratization) in USAID development strategies. Section 1 begins with an introductory statement on the relationship between the U.S. government, American labor, and the promotion of democracy abroad; Section 2 details those aspects of the AFL-CIO's international programs that contribute to the advancement of democracy abroad; Section 3 describes labor programs of the AFL-CIO in specific countries, representing each of the regions in which they operate; Section 4 provides information on labor programs sponsored by agencies and organizations other than the AFL-CIO; Section 5 focuses on the foreign policy of the AFL-CIO and criticisms of that policy; Section 6 introduces problematic issues regarding the relationship between USAID, the AFL-CIO, and democracy, including questions of definitions of democracy and the tension between economic and political priorities; Section 7 turns to the issue of evaluations, why they are problematic (even necessarily so) and how they must change to incorporate democratization as a goal; Section 8 turns to the future of democracy abroad, as seen through the eyes of labor leaders; and Section 9 provides several recommendations on how to better link USAID to democratic programs through the American labor movement, and on the types of structural and administrative adjustments that would be necessary.  Appendices are attached, as Section 10, that (a) list the projects undertaken by the American labor movement and funded by USAID; (b) list the people interviewed for this report; (c) list examples of courses on democracy, provided for foreign trade unionists, by the regional labor union institutes of the AFL-CIO; and (d) provide a sample syllabus of the labor courses sponsored by the U.S. Department of Labor. Footnotes for the entire report are attached, as Section 11, at the end of the manuscript.

"This report contains recommendations for USAID support to Chadian PVO's.  It is based on an assessment of the capabilities and needs of the Chadian PVO community and an examination of various issues and choices concerning the strategy and content of a PVO support program for Chad. Among the criteria used for the selection of PVO's to be supported are multi-community coverage, a proven track record, and a sound leadership with appropriate motivation and concepts of development.  The quality of management was not a criterion except in egregious cases, since management improvement would be a primary aim of the proposed project. Of the 6 official PVO's in Chad's nascent PVO community, four appear eminently worthy of support, a fifth deserves consideration, and a sixth, though currently a branch of an international PVO, is soon to be Chadianized.  Five other promising organizations were also identified. Other potential organizations may also exist, but a paucity of information on these organizations, registered only as associations but some of which may qualify to register as PVO's, made it difficult to judge their qualifications for support.  The PVO support project should be open ended, to permit the eventual inclusion of any PVO's that may develop to the point where they meet assistance criteria.  There are also many small associations, typically covering just one village, that are regarded as aspiring PVO's, but do not as yet serve a large enough population to warrant USAID attention, and which are in any case the target of a UNDP project. A common characteristic of the 4 PVO's identified for immediate support is a community-based, integrated approach to rural development, and a willingness to experiment with new approaches while quickly rejecting those that do not produce empirical results.  Thus, these PVO's are valuable potential intermediaries between international donors, public and private, and the populations they aspire to reach. This study proposes a full range of institutional development and program assistance, including operational support, facilities construction, TA, training, equipment and supplies, and support for projects, placing particular emphasis on assistance that will help the PVO's become sustainable (i.e., developing the capabilities to meet recurrent costs through funding from international donors, income generating activities, etc). Also proposed is assistance to the PVO association in Chad, CILONG -- most of whose members are, at present, international PVO's -- to develop its capabilities to provide a full range of coordination and support services, as well as limited support to the Chadian government office responsible for PVO's (SPONG) to develop an information system and data bank containing all pertinent data on Chadian PVO's, shifting the government's role from one of regulation and control to support for the PVO movement. The report proposes that the project be managed by a U.S. PVO working closely with CILONG, and concludes with recommendations for accelerating the start of project implementation, including amendment of an existing USAID Chad project supporting U.S. PVO's and exploration of the possible use of Government of Chad P.L. 480 Title III funds.  An annex describes fourteen Chadian PVO's and/or associations which were analyzed for their suitability for project assistance.

"Evaluates a project to expand and improve wastewater collection, treatment, and disposal systems in Alexandria, Egypt.  Interim evaluation covers the period 8/79-4/91. Construction is far behind schedule.  Two main factors caused the delays:  unforeseen and challenging soil and groundwater conditions, which necessitated major design adjustments, and the failure of the Alexandria Organization for Sanitary Drainage (AGOSD) to take timely action regarding effluent discharge, sludge disposal, and contracting management.  Nevertheless, given revised targets, construction activities have progressed well and the quality of work is high.  USAID has funded 6 subprojects, 3 of which are complete, and 3 of which are expected to be completed by the project's 1993 end.  AGOSD has funded 30 construction tasks, but the status of these is unclear due to AGOSD's failure to respond to requests for information. In terms of its social, and particularly health, impacts, the project has been successful.  Laterals and collectors have been installed in over 90% of previously unsewered portions of the project area, nearly eliminating sewage flooding/ponding in the streets, which in turn has reduced the incidence of waterborne diseases.  Impacts on water quality along the coastal Mediterranean and in Lake Maryout were difficult to quantify, for the following reasons:  domestic sewage flows are not yet being processed by the two primary treatment plants, which are still under construction; the project does not provide for treatment of industrial wastes, which continue to be discharged without pretreatment; and the impacts of discharging effluent have not been monitored. Project sustainability is a major issue.  The operations and maintenance (O&M) program is less than a third complete, and faces considerable obstacles. To transform AGOSD into a viable, sustainable organization, it will be necessary to train and motivate its O&M staff, promote changes in financial and management structure, reduce staff levels, and expand its authority to levy and collect wastewater tariffs. USAID should continue with O&M assistance for a year after the planned 1993 completion date for construction contracts.  It is also recommended that a preventive maintenance program be continued and expanded to protect completed project equipment until full operation begins.","Contents: v. 1.

"Findings of the evaluation team included a lack of awareness in the population about the project's objectives and activities; insufficient financial management skills among community pharmacy managers; limited involvement of the management committees in the management of community pharmacies; a lack of standardization of recurrent costs to be recovered by the system; the nonexistence of a real national drug policy; and a decrease in health spending by central and local governments.

"Final evaluation of an OPG to World Relief Corporation (WRC) to support a child survival (CS) project undertaken by the Evangelical Baptist Mission in Southern Haiti (MBESH) in Bonne Fin, Haiti.  The grant was originally to be carried out between 6/1/87-5/30/90, but because of delays in starting, was extended through 9/30/91. The MBESH/CS project has achieved or surpassed most of the objectives set forth in the cooperative agreement.  A health infrastructure is in place that will be a solid foundation for future CS initiatives in the region.  The training program for health promoters and traditional birth attendants which has been established is excellent, and significant levels of community participation have been generated. Some specific achievements include the following:  5 auxiliary nurses and 4 community animators trained; a health committee established in each of the 4 health zones, and in the 2 largest zones, sub-committees also established; 42 health posts established; 75 health promoters trained; and a computerized health management information system under development. Vaccination coverage is still rather low, because most of the health posts became operational towards the end of the project, and have not yet had time to complete a full cycle of coverage; for example, most children have yet to receive their third dose of DTP/polio.  That health post accessibility is good is demonstrated by the fact that over 70% of children under one have received their first dose of DTP/polio. As WRC and MBESH were both new to CS grants (and to each other), the project got off to a difficult start.  Communications between WRC's Illinois headquarters and field operations were sometimes slow. However, WRC and MBESH developed into a good team, and the experience they have gained makes them excellent candidates for additional CS grants.  Also, by forming a partnership with an established indigenous health services organization, WRC was able to avoid many start-up costs. Lessons learned included the following.  (1) Baseline data must be collected before the establishment of services to be of any value in establishing priorities.  (2) It is advisable to engage a qualified bookkeeper at an early stage in projects with complex financial arrangements.  (3) For a project which involves the development of as many infrastructural components as this one, 3 years is not really enough time to have a significant impact on the health status of the target population.  (4) Community participation, and particularly, developing a feeling of community ownership for project activities, is time consuming but critical for the sustainability of CS projects.  (5) Country nationals should assume leadership roles in health projects as soon as qualified persons can be identified and trained.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","OTR-0536-A-00-7224-00","","7/1/1991 12:00:00 AM","","Child survival activities|Paramedical education|Change agents|Nurses|Traditional birth attendants|Health outreach services|Immunizations|Growth monitoring|Oral rehydration therapy","Haiti","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABE272.pdf","3,414 KB","004004 - World Relief Corp.","","000088 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (12/84-9/90) to establish a training center at the U.S. Bureau of the Census (BUCEN) to provide Spanish-language training in statistics and data processing for private and public sector personnel in the Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) region. The project generally met objectives, creating a training program with associated curricula and materials which is capable of meeting the needs of the LAC region.  The Latin American statistical community had considerable input into the curriculum development and course instruction. All of the planned 7-month courses (8) and 3-month courses (1) were conducted.  However, due to funding problems, the number of workshops and seminars fell short of the target.  The relatively high cost and the duration of the U.S.-based courses prevented some individuals from participating.  Many institutions cannot spare key technical staff to attend the 7-month modular course. Very few countries have availed themselves of shorter-term options involving 1-2 modules.  In addition, the number of female participants was only 31% of target. A total of 294 individuals were trained by the project directly. In addition, a number of graduates shared their new skills and knowledge with colleagues through formal training sessions and on-the-job training.  Graduates from Paraguay's national statistical office formed an alumni association which organizes courses and promotes training within the institution.  In Guatemala, graduates established an in-country training program with Mission funding. Funding remains the biggest problem faced by the program. Operating costs do not cover expenses, and fellowship funding must be expanded, especially from A.I.D. Missions.  Missions accounted for only 31% of project fellowships, 22% if Guatemala is not counted.  The funding problem admits no simple solution, however.  To make the program self-sufficient, it will be necessary simultaneously to address cost, format, and content.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1991 12:00:00 AM","","Statistics|Statistical analysis|Data analysis|Data processing|Technical training|Participants|Beneficiary count","Latin America|Caribbean|Guatemala|Paraguay","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDKAX542.pdf","326 KB","001785 - U.S. Dept. of Commerce.

"Presents final Mission report on a project (7/83-9/88) to support family planning in Costa Rica. The project was successful, as it led to a new focus on the public sector as a provider of reproductive health services, increasing the responsibility of the public sector in both political and financial terms.  It also provided the foundation for a contraceptive social marketing program (CSM). Inputs were made by the International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF), in providing core support to the grantee, the Asociacion Demografica Costarricense (ADC), as well as by the national Social Security Agency and the Ministry of Health, which provided clinical services, personnel, and facilities.  The project financed contraceptives, communications, logistics, and research support. The project was modified in 1988 to change the implementing agencies to the public sector and to make PROFAMILIA a separate grantee for the CSM program.  This decision has proven beneficial, from both an institutional and a demographic point of view. There is now a strong relationship between the expenditures for the CSM program and its actual achievements.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1991 12:00:00 AM","","Contraceptive distribution|Social marketing|Family planning services|Health care administration","Costa Rica","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABE597.pdf","57 KB","008533 - USAID.

"Presents final Mission report on a project (4/87-6/91) to provide training to emergency medical personnel in Costa Rica.  Project Hope implemented the project. Training outputs far exceed initial estimations, the caveat being that some of those trained to be emergency medical technicians are not utilizing their skills, but performing administrative duties instead. Also, the Scope of Practice for paramedics was never approved by the College of Physicians and Surgeons, and as a result paramedics cannot perform as they do in the United States. Management of the training program has been fairly well institutionalized and is now financed with in-kind support from the University of Costa Rica, the national Social Security Agency, the Red Cross, and the National Insurance Institute, and with cash from the National Emergency Commission. The project's system development objectives were too ambitious for the project's time-frame, but progress was made in establishing clearer roles and guidelines among the multiple entities that intervene in emergency situations.  The project served to highlight both the need and the possibilities of greater and more effective coordination. A.I.D. should not undertake another project of this magnitude without more analysis as to feasibility.  The systems development component of this project required a capacity and resources that Project Hope did not have.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1991 12:00:00 AM","","Emergency medical care|Paramedical education","Costa Rica","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABE598.pdf","78 KB","008533 - USAID.

"Presents final Mission report on a project to provide pharmaceuticals and other disposable medical supplies to Costa Rica's health care system, and to help stabilize the financial position of the country's social security system, the Caja Costarricense de Seguro Social (CCSS). The project has had a positive impact.  Shortfalls in pharmaceuticals have dropped from 30% to a more manageable 3-5% as a direct result of project TA to improve the CCSS procurement system and rationalize the prescribing habits of physicians. Management Sciences for Health provided TA leading to installation of a computer package that will allow CCSS to monitor pharmaceutical use and predict need.  The Academy for Educational Development held a workshop for pharmacists regarding the development of educational materials for improving pharmaceutical usage.  In addition, a scientific journal, ""Farmacos,"" was launched by the project.  Its purpose is to provide technical updates on topics in drug therapy to CCSS doctors and pharmacists; 14 volumes were published and CCSS is committed to continuing biannual publication with its own resources. The project demonstrated that the CCSS procurement system was effective and very accountable, although purchases were at times delayed by bureaucratic red tape.  It was necessary, however, to have a project advisor on site to monitor the procurement process and answer questions regarding A.I.D. financing and eligibility. CCSS was strengthened financially as well.  The Government of Costa Rica (GOCR) has used project loan funds to pay off its accumulated quota-generated debt.  The GOCR also paid the 1984, 1985, and 1986 employer's quota to the CCSS and continues to pay the budgeted amount of the employers's quota on a quarterly basis. This is a significant achievement and provides financial stability to the CCSS.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1991 12:00:00 AM","","Pharmaceuticals|Social security|Government departments|Economic self sufficiency|Procurement","Costa Rica","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABE599.pdf","115 KB","008533 - USAID.

"Presents final Mission report on a project (8/84-6/90) to create a private investment corporation (PIC) in Costa Rica which would act as a catalyst in developing business projects capable of generating hard currency exports.  The project also included a development banking strategy to ensure availability of medium- and long-term financing. With project-funded TA, the PIC was able to establish itself in both the Costa Rican and U.S. business environments.  The level of TA provided enabled the PIC to rapidly focus on business opportunities, and to put together profitable and developmentally sound ventures.  Even though one of the major elements of the project, investor search and identification, was eliminated, the PIC is now a well-organized, efficiently run development institution. The project teaches two lessons.  (1) Grants should not be given to profitmaking financial intermediaries, such as the PIC, without a substantial cost contribution (50% in this project) from the recipient. (2) The grant should be automatically terminated once the institution reaches a profit level which allows it to pay dividends.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1991 12:00:00 AM","","Private sector|Investment promotion|Financial institutions|Institution building|Economic self sufficiency|Commercial credit","Costa Rica","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABE600.pdf","57 KB","008533 - USAID.

"Presents final Mission report on an OPG to the American Institute for Free Labor Development (AIFLD) to help the Costa Rican agrarian trade union, Confederacion Nacional de Trabajadores (CNT) to establish a marketing program and extension service for affiliated farmers.  The period of the OPG is not specified. The project has provided real benefits to rural agrarian union members, and yet there have been serious problems, not yet resolved, in the area of financial management. The benefits of the project include:  (1) alternative production and marketing opportunities for several crops, inter alia, blackberry, ginger, pumpkin, tuber, and cassava; (2) increased incomes and marketing margins for farm groups, who have been empowered to assume processing and marketing functions -- e.g., washing, sorting, packaging, transporting -- otherwise assumed by middlemen; (3) improved interinstitutional coordination among development organizations, increasing the technical and political influence of organized rural trade unions. Financially, however, there are three troubling aspects to the project.  First was the management of the credit fund, valued at about $225,000.  CNT accounting records were inadequate to identify all the farmers who owed money on loans and how much each one owed.  This condition was detected toward the end of the project, at which point CNT asked each member union to sign a note to pay back to CNT the total owed by the individual farmers of the union.  A.I.D. accepted this solution, but has now received a formal complaint (which is being investigated) from one union that its members did not receive the loans.  Second, CNT loaned money from the loan fund to some of the project's marketing operations.  Third, the marketing and loan program were too small to cover the staff costs on a sustainable basis.  Part of the reason for this was that many staff were involved in union organizing, an activity not directly related to the project.  It is doubtful that the project's financial problems will ever be resolved, since CNT no longer exists, its assets and records having been passed on to FEDETAICO.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1991 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural cooperatives|Trade unions|Crop production|Agricultural product marketing|Financial management|Loan administration","Costa Rica","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABE601.pdf","198 KB","008533 - USAID.

"Africa Project Development Facility (APDF) activities have generated a high level of response and the Facility has been successful in providing African entrepreneurs with advisory services to help them develop and finance investment in productive private enterprise activities.  APDF is a dynamic force in private sector development in Africa, its management visionary and creative, and it is continually developing new programs and initiatives to better serve the African entrepreneur. APDF criteria for screening and processing project proposals are stricter now than 4 years ago, and as a result, the number of completed projects relative to the number of projects identified is increasing. Also, fewer projects are being rejected by financial institutions after receiving APDF feasibility study assistance. APDF's eligibility criteria have remained constant over its life and still seem valid.  Nevertheless, APDF has not adhered strictly to the upper project size limitation of $5 million, with 6 projects, or 8% of the total, exceeding the limitation. However, the number of projects exceeding the limitation has decreased over time -- in 1988, the percentage of projects with investment costs exceeding the maximum was 15%.  This reflects improved success in refining and targeting activities. Interviews indicate that APDF officers, particularly investment officers in the field, have strong, expanding relationships based on mutual respect and common interests with bilateral funding institutions and with local commercial banks.  This is accomplished through regular communication, both informal and formal.  Since performance is judged on the number of projects completed, there is a built-in incentive to develop strong relationships with funding institutions. APDF's portfolio is well-diversified by country and by mix of industries.  As of June 1991, APDF had successfully completed 87 projects in 21 different countries:  over half of the projects were in agro-industry, including fishing; one third were in manufacturing; and the remaining 13% were in service industries. The pipeline contains 194 more projects, equally divided between East and West Africa, encompassing 33 countries. APDF interacts well with, and is highly praised by, other donors active in Africa.  There is a high level of synergy, cooperation, and responsiveness to donor concerns. APDF's decentralized organizational structure, with a heavy reliance on the field offices, is effective from both an organizational and cost point of view.  APDF staff, especially investment officers in the field, are highly experienced, effective, and well regarded. The level of U.S. firm participation in APDF activities is low. Only 2 of the 87 APDF-assisted investments involved U.S. firms (only 10-15% of total APDF investments involve any foreign private investors).  This is due to a number of factors, including the small size of most APDF projects and the requirement that they be majority-owned by an African. A.I.D. should consider other initiatives to increase U.S. firm knowledge and interest in investing in Africa. There has been little use of U.S. consultants; only 7 were employed in 1990 out of a total of 144, and APDF is steadily increasing the number of African consultants used in conducting its feasibility studies.  The decreasing use of foreign consultants is a positive development.  APDF has been quite successful in providing opportunities for African consultants; over half of those it hires are African, a percentage which will increase even further.  APDF has also made an effort to hire Africans as investment officers.  Of the 20 professional staff, 9 are Africans -- a figure which has increased over time. Although the overall costs of APDF operations are over $8 million per year, its operations are run efficiently and in a cost-conscious manner. New initiatives in partial cost recovery which were institutionalized in late 1990 are beginning to bear fruit and APDF is improving the monitoring of its activities.  It is increasing its operational effectiveness and has introduced better internal measurement and control systems over the past year. Finally, many bilateral assistance programs benefit from APDF in nonquantifiable ways.  APDF has become a focal point for lessons learned in private sector development and in the identification of bottlenecks and constraints to the private sector in Africa. The feedback that APDF operations provides to the donor community is invaluable in helping donors design other interventions to help the private sector.

"Presents final Mission report on a project (9/77-6/87) to implement a new system of primary health care (PHC) in Central Tunisia in an expanded network of facilities. The project substantively strengthened the provision of PHC in Central Tunisia.  A total of 74 PHC facilities were constructed/renovated and equipped -- including 22 new centers in Siliana and Sidi Bouzid; 36 new centers in Kasserine and Gafsa; 9 renovations in Siliana, Sidi Bouzid, and Sned; and 7 renovations in Kasserine and North Gafsa.  The project also restructured the role of paraprofessional health workers while simultaneously establishing a field practice setting in which medical students and interns are trained in community medicine.  Paraprofessionals were (re)trained, with a focus on preventive care, and now provide more systematic service delivery. Seven long-term U.S. trainees have returned to ministerial positions where they have an impact on PHC delivery.  The project also made special efforts to strengthen health education capacities and provide continuing education. The project succeeded in integrating preventive and curative PHC (including family planning) and in expanding community level outreach. The involvement of women in PHC delivery was supported by training traditional birth attendants, building new health facilities near girls' educational centers (when possible); and providing lodging at the 74 PHC facilities as an incentive to female health professionals to work in rural areas.  In addition, PHC planning and management were improved through inservice training of management personnel and an improved medical records system. The project had impacts beyond Central Tunisia.  It contributed substantially to the establishment of national standards for the broader, more effective use of nonphysician personnel at the local level.  The general level of services from dispensaries and regional hospitals throughout Tunisia is now more effective, providing a base for the provision of integrated PHC services. The health management system has been copied by other rural regional health directorates in the south and northwest governorates of the country.  Finally, Ministry of Public Health (MOPH) funds ""freed up"" by project construction of PHC facilities were used to construct dispensaries in isolated areas of southern Tunisia. Since project completion, the MOPH has made substantial progress in furthering the improvements initiated under the project.  It is recommended that the MOPH go forward with retraining and continuing education programs for paramedical workers throughout Tunisia's rural areas.  As opposed to previous efforts, which provided separate training for the various types of health workers (e.g., nutritionists, hygienists), each PHC worker should be trained to perform all the tasks of PHC.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","12/1/1991 12:00:00 AM","","Rural areas|Primary health care|Preventive health care|Community health care|Health facilities|Medical education|Health care administration|Beneficiary count","Tunisia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABE694.pdf","206 KB","008616 - USAID.

"Presents final Mission report on a project (8/79-12/84) to test renewable energy systems in rural areas of Tunisia.  The project was implemented by the U.S. NASA Lewis Research Center. The project succeeded in installing a very expensive experimental solar energy system in Hammam Biadha, a village 150 km southwest of Tunis.  Hammam Biadha is a village of about 150 people, with a primary school for 500 students, stores, a mosque, and a public well.  Most of the residents are engaged in smallholder agriculture.  At a cost of $1.4 million (USAID) plus 160,000 Tunisian dinars provided by the Government of Tunisia, a 20 kw photovoltaic electrical system was installed to supply residential, commercial, and institutional users.  Data on performance, consumption, demand, costs, etc. were collected over a 5-year period.  Residential uses were mainly for lighting, TV's, and in the summer, refrigeration. Both capital and installation costs were heavily subsidized by USAID. Each household was connected free and pays only the nationwide use rate for electricity, even though photovoltaic current is much more costly to produce than is conventionally fueled electricity.  Diesel-produced electricity is the preferred system because of less capital investment, despite more frequent maintenance and higher operational costs; a diesel system for the village would have produced a real user cost of about one-third the solar cost. Part of the high capital cost was due to the ""Buy American"" requirement, which added 100% to equipment costs.  U.S. consultant fees were also high (local skills, however, were substantially improved by project training). Agricultural applications of the new village solar system included three solar heated greenhouses -- which also seem to have economic feasibility problems.  They are plastic tents with expensive foundations, which were given free to farmers on a pilot basis.  Another application, a photovoltaic-powered water pumping system for drip irrigation systems, has encountered technical problems; moreover, farmers prefer the faster diesel irrigation pumps.  There is little evidence that either productivity or the local economy were helped by the project. On the plus side, the system is operating well and keeps up easily with demand.  Also, two small wind electric generators installed by the project at El Haouaria, an isolated and unattended site near the Mediterranean Sea, have provided an excellent additional wind energy resource.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1991 12:00:00 AM","","Alternative energy resources|Windmills|Solar energy|Small scale energy systems|Costs|Villages","Tunisia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABE695.pdf","89 KB","008616 - USAID.

"The Famine Early Warning System Project (FEWS) II has made important and timely contributions to decision-making, thus enhancing USAID's response capability.  There is strong general agreement that FEWS should continue.  Early Warning (EW) should not be delegated outside of the Africa Bureau at this time. Principal findings and conclusions are as follows.  (1) FEWS has provided important and timely contributions to decision-making, thus enhancing USAID's response capability, effectiveness, and impact.  (2) According to key USAID decision-makers, FEWS has paid for itself many times over in terms of the value of decisions made.  (3) USAID staff are in general agreement on the importance of famine early warning and of the need for requisite information and analysis; previous doubts are gone.  (4) There is strong Agency-wide agreement that early warning efforts should continue.  (5) Progress on other FEWS objectives, especially the development of host country early warning capabilities, and international coordination on EW methods, has been uneven, due to a lack of funding or a clearcut strategy.  (6) There has been insufficient interaction and coordination among AFR/TR and the two key implementing agencies, particularly on R&D questions. Project management has made strong efforts to remedy this, with notable results. Notwithstanding the accomplishments noted above, improvements are needed in the following key areas:  (1) coordination of implementing agencies; (2) focus of FEWS R&D (e.g., upon EW accuracy and related objectives); (3) efficiency and cost- effectiveness in reporting, analysis, and research; and (4) understanding of EW methods among USAID Washington and field staff.  USAID should immediately appoint a project officer, a position which has been vacant for about two months, and address these issues. Principal recommendations for the next phase of the project include the following.  (1) There should be a follow-on project to FEWS II; EW is a task that USAID should continue.  Three options are presented: continuation and improvement; greater efficiency and reduced funding; expansion of project objectives. (2) There is an immediate need to plan and schedule the design, review, and implementation of FEWS III.  (3) EW should not be delegated at this time; during design, however, options for enhanced host country EW capabilities and donor coordination should be explored, possibly leading to shared responsibilities during the next phase.  (4) If FEWS R&D objectives are expanded under the third option above, careful consideration should be given to their conceptualization.

"The University of Costa Rica's graduate legal studies program, established in 1982, has received USAID support since 1984.  The program has achieved its goal of providing a one-year program of high-quality specialized and practical training for lawyers working in the areas of criminal law, agrarian law, and public law.  With an outstanding faculty, the program is largely successful in achieving its twin objectives of teaching students how to think critically about law and legal institutions, on the one hand, and providing up-to-date training in each respective field of specialization, on the other. Total USAID support for the scholarship program amounts to $798,748. Of this sum, an estimated $750,000 has been or will be used to fund approximately 60 scholarships.  Two Panamanians received scholarships, as did nineteen Costa Ricans, six Salvadorans, eleven Hondurans, five Guatemalans, and eleven Dominicans.  Other scholarships are funded through bilateral programs. Of the three specializations reviewed, only public law appears to have serious deficiencies.  Only three of the scholarships -- all for Costa Ricans -- were in this field. The success of the UCR graduate legal studies program and USAID's scholarship support is significant, for it contradicts the accepted wisdom among U.S. legal academics who were involved in ""law and development"" programs in Latin America from the mid-1950's to the mid-1970's that such programs had negative impacts, and more specifically that U.S. assistance to law faculties is a risky enterprise in terms of political exposure.  Since the mid-70's there has been very little assistance to law faculties in the region -- a serious shortcoming in A.I.D.'s overall Administration of Justice and Democratic Initiatives strategy. In the countries visited during this evaluation, political sensitivity did not seem a significant problem, at least with programs such as this, which are designed to be minimally intrusive and administered with sensitivity. Specific suggestions are made for upgrading the program in the following areas:  faculty; curriculum; teaching methodology; faculty salaries; student recruitment.

"Evaluates support to the Clearinghouse for Development Communications (CDC), established under project 9311231, which provides information and services related to the use of appropriate development communication methods.  CDC is operated by the Institute for International Research (IIR).  Interim external evaluation covers the period 8/88-1/91. Overall, IIR has succeeded in improving the operation of the Clearinghouse.  IIR's computerization of cataloguing with its accompanying descriptors and identifiers has made electronic searches possible, greatly reducing the staff time involved in responding to requests.  Nevertheless, the CDC is near the threshold of the number of requests that can be given individual attention without increasing staff commitment to this effort.  In the latter half of the contract period, emphasis should be gradually shifted from cataloguing to dissemination, in order to ensure that developing country personnel who are directly involved in choosing communication strategies are familiar with CDC services and know how to access them.  Also, the CDC should gradually shift, over the medium term, from a central storage/passive participant approach to a more multi- centered/shared ownership information exchange. The need of developing country personnel for information about locally appropriate development communications options is growing.  This is likely to increase the demand for CDC services. The CDC should launch a limited campaign to advertise the existence and relevance of CDC services to developing country information managers; it should also initiate activities to build Mission awareness and promotion of CDC services. Increased use of new high tech communications options is desirable given the fact that the time currently required to access documents limits the usefulness of the service for many developing country practitioners; the CDC should begin pilot testing such options as high speed scanning, optical storage, and electronic dissemination.  This testing will need to be planned in steps commensurate with project funding limitations. Lessons learned included the following.  (1) Developing country planners and practitioners will not routinely send acquisitions from their latest projects to the CDC unless there is a mechanism for reciprocity.  (2) The Clearinghouse is more useful to USAID Mission staff and their developing country clients than to A.I.D./W staff.

"Presents final Mission report on a grant (5/88-2/91) to the Pan American Development Foundation (PADF) to provide orthopedic and plastic/reconstructive surgery to victims of Central American civil strife. While it was planned that PADF would set up a surgical care facility in Nicaragua, this was forbidden by the Nicaraguan government, so grant activities were switched to Honduras.  A total of 882 persons were treated by PADF, vs. 756 targeted.  An unplanned output was improved surgical facilities at a local nonprofit hospital in Honduras, which allowed PADF to use its facilities during the project. Because the project ran so smoothly, the primary lesson is that well-selected grantees offer the greatest potential for success in projects of this nature.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1991 12:00:00 AM","","Civil war|War victims|Rehabilitative medicine|Surgery|Private voluntary organizations|Beneficiary count","Central America|Nicaragua|Honduras","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABF300.pdf","43 KB","008555 - USAID.

"PACR for a project (9/82-9/91) to support community-based land and water management in upland forest, rainfed agricultural areas, and coastal zones in the Philippines. The project was divided into two cycles.  Cycle I (1983-86) was mainly institution building for resource monitoring, policy analysis, and community-based resource management systems.  Cycle II (1987-91) focused on field and farmer based oriented activities in the areas of agriculture, natural resources, research, and upland access. The project's research purpose was achieved.  Several technologies were developed that support community-based land and water management, and mechanisms to support technology transfer (seed production, farmer-researcher-extensionist linkages, farmer-to-farmer approach, and applied communication) are being strengthened.  The Department of Agriculture is capable of managing an expanded rainfed farming systems program as well as regional micro-level livelihood projects, while the Department of Natural Resources is being transformed from a regulatory agency to a developmental institution, capable of managing an expanded community-based agroforestry program and a contract reforestation program.  In the area of natural resources, decentralization has been effected and NGOs/PVOs have actively participated in rehabilitation of degraded uplands.  The access component did not meet targets, but did construct 73 km of rural roads and rehabilitate 64 km.  From its experiences at more than 60 sites nationwide, the project has produced voluminous publications, videos, etc., including manuals and other tools for situation analysis, technology extension, and use of low-input technologies for upland and rainfed areas. The following are among the lessons learned.  (1) Rolling design is not particularly appropriate to research programming, but could be effective in single agency projects having broad research areas and a single funding source.  (2) Focusing research on specific areas does not effectively address needs of broader upland/rainfed areas.  (3) Rapid rural appraisal, while useful, is expensive.  (4) Requiring untrained extensionists to conduct technology adaptation trials is not a cost-efficient way to bridge the gap between research and extension. (5) Working within existing government systems increases the chance of a smooth transition upon project termination.  (6) Sharing funding costs with implementing agencies promotes institutionalization. (7) Material support (e.g., seeds, agrochemicals, work animals) was important in gaining farmer cooperation.  (8) Livelihood projects should emphasize a market-led approach and engage community groups instead of individual farmers.  (9) Farmer-to-farmer training is effective, but care must be used in choosing farmer trainers.  (10) Where development resources are limited, site selection is a sensitive issue that is influenced by political as well as technical realities.  (11) Project staff should undergo a mandatory probationary period.  (12) Technology development should be participative. (13) Opportunities for local capital building must be encouraged. (14) Appropriate uplands technologies include:  multi-story cropping; livestock integration; communal reforestation; mangrove rehabilitation; and aquaculture.  (15) For sustainable reforestation, encourage the growth of naturally occurring trees, which can then serve as ""nurse trees"" that provide better microenvironments for the more exotic reforestation species. (16) Labor-based, equipment-supported road construction creates jobs, doesn't sacrifice quality, and proved marginally less costly than equipment-based methods.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1991 12:00:00 AM","","Upland cropping|Land management|Water management|Dry farming|Farmer participation|Farmer training|Agroforestry|Reforestation|Agricultural extension|Agricultural research|Agricultural technology","Philippines","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABF351.pdf","869 KB","008592 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (7/83-12/90) to improve the capacity of the Government of the Philippines (GOP) and other Philippine institutions to analyze development issues. The participant training component provided training for 301 persons: 84 received in-country academic training, 37 received U.S. or third country academic training, 86 in-country, non- academic training, and 94 received non-academic training in the U.S. or a third country.  All, except for two, were from the public sector.  All but two had returned to their respective agencies by the 12/31/90 PACD; of the non-returnees, one disappeared after the completion of her training and was reported to the U.S. immigration service, and the second requested a self-financed extension of her stay until 7/91 because of a pregnancy which prevented her from traveling to the Philippines. The development issues component supported 33 research studies, 26 workshops/conferences, and 23 technical and management assistance (TMA) projects.  Twenty-one of the studies, two of the TMAs, and one of the workshops fell under the project's regionalization effort.  Activities addressed employment, human resources, income distribution, financial resource mobilization, public expenditures, agriculture, agrarian reform, industry, trade, energy, science and technology, rural and regional development, and policy, planning, and institutional development issues. Lessons learned are somewhat contradictory.  On one hand, it is felt that the project's flexibility in responding to various demands, from either the Government of the Philippines or USAID, to assess current development issues, was one of its strengths. On the other hand, it is felt that funding such a broad range of activities produced diffuse and difficult to assess impacts.  It is therefore suggested that future projects of a similar nature address a more focused selection of development issues.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","6/1/1991 12:00:00 AM","","Institution building|Development planning|Government departments|Education for development|Policy analysis|Development research|Development project design|Research priorities","Philippines","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABF352.pdf","340 KB","008592 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (1984-90) to develop the capacity of the Filipino private sector to promote the growth of labor-intensive, small and medium enterprises (SME's) in priority regions outside of metropolitan Manila.  The report focuses on Phase II of the project (1986-90). In Phase II, activities were continued in regions I, V, VI, and XII, discontinued in region II, and initiated in regions IV and XI. Activities included:  (1) integrated support to targeted industries (food processing, metalworking, gifts, and housewares); (2) policy studies; and (3) support to People's Economic Councils (PECs) nationwide.  The International Executive Service Corps component was canceled.  Accomplishments in the three above areas were as follows. Targeted industry support was largely channeled through 218 SME sectoral associations (vs. a target of 30) and the Product Development and Design Center of the Philippines.  Besides needs analyses, this component conducted 142 TA programs, 177 local study missions, and 843 skills training programs on such topics as food packaging, production techniques, machinery maintenance and use, and adaptation of traditional handicraft designs to modern markets.  In addition, 12 small business institutes implemented management training activities and extended management services to associations in the targeted regions. Market development activities -- regional and island trade fairs, product display centers, domestic trade missions to bring regional producers to Manila, and production of promotional trade brochures -- were short of target numerically, but helped bridge the gap between producers and buyers.  It is estimated that the four island fairs generated cash sales of over $2.5 million. Support for common service facilities included equipment to upgrade a food testing laboratory of the Department of Science and Technology and detailed needs analyses and feasibility studies for foundries, smithies, and heat treatment facilities; the latter are not yet operational, however. The studies component financed 3 activities (vs. a target of 20): (1) a comprehensive list of local raw manufacturing materials, including source, and potential supply; (2) identification of traditional craftspersons, together with a program to promote traditional crafts; and (3) a study on filth levels aimed at improving the production, sanitation, and safety of processed ethnic roof exports. Support to PECs reached 726 councils (vs. a target of 300) and included implementation of 300 training programs to help PECs interact with government agencies in improving the delivery of government services and furthering local economic development. The PEC component also funded 67 seminars aimed at stimulating investment outside Metro Manila, as well as 3 regional and 2 national PEC assemblies. A survey of assisted entities indicates that the project was effective in promoting SME development.  For example, as a result of Phase II assistance to the SME associations, employment among responding SMEs rose from 500 to 1,200 and sales volume jumped from Pesos 92.5 M to Pesos 156 M.  Similar increases were reported as a result of assistance to the PECs. The project teaches that a little assistance can go a long way in equipping people with skills, raising their consciousness for enterprise, and helping them to see the value of cooperativism.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","2/1/1991 12:00:00 AM","","Small scale enterprises|Medium scale enterprises|Economic development|Institution building|Private sector|Associations|Beneficiary count","Philippines","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABF353.pdf","514 KB","008592 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (8/86-12/91) to increase agricultural production in the Philippines.  The project was essentially a funding mechanism for subprojects (SPs) to improve support services, agricultural marketing, and policy and program formulation. In all, 12 SPs were implemented:  marketing and information services; agricultural statistics; research and outreach; privatization; fertilizer development; economic and policy analysis; grain stabilization; planning and program development; crop diversification; irrigation; market development; and improved management services. The project was a huge success, having numerous and broad impacts. Perhaps most importantly, it helped the Department of Agriculture (DA) to reshape its vision and to gain visibility and respect.  The project press office even made major contributions to President Aquino's ""State of the Nation"" address.  Further, the project helped DA shift from a ""top down"" to a ""bottom up,"" approach, integrate research and extension, strengthen its economic and policy analysis and survey capability, increase administrative efficiency, and forge a new partnership with the private sector.  These efforts have equipped the DA to meet the challenges it will face when the new Local Government Code is implemented in 1/92.  Also, the success of pilot irrigation activities provided impetus for a World Bank follow-on. The project trained hundreds of thousands of farmers and some 37,000 DA and National Irrigation Authority staff, organized the farmers into productive communities, helped linked them to private businesses with whom they could conclude marketing agreements, and directed the DA toward helping farmers produce and sell profitable crops.  The project's successes are all the more remarkable in light of the constraints under which it operated, including GOP funding bottlenecks and USAID's inflexible requirements for U.S. sourcing. Lessons and recommendations include the following.  (1) Worthwhile projects can eventually emerge from a learning process design.  (2) During the latter part of the project, increasing emphasis was put on linking SPs; the additional effort required was justified by the resulting benefits.  (3) A revolving fund credit line for GOP Project Administration should be tested.  (4) Consultants should work on-the-job with regular line personnel for extended periods of time:  technology is transferred both ways.  (5) Because of Murphy's Law, projects always take longer to get started than anticipated.  This should be taken into account in project planning.  (6) Sourcing requirements for computer hardware and peripherals (not software) should be abandoned.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","12/1/1991 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural development|Government departments|Institution building|Agricultural research|Agricultural extension|Agricultural management","Philippines","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABF355.pdf","1,881 KB","","","008592 - USAID.

"PACR of a program (1/89-6/90) to support the Operation Land Transfer (OLT) component of the Philippines' Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program (CARP). A 12/91 assessment found that the program apparently exceeded targets for three of five program performance indicators, achieving 187% of target in land area surveyed (342,332 ha vs. 182,695 ha); 102% of target in emancipation patents distributed (by ha) (134,081 vs. 131,223); and 120% of target in emancipation patents generated (by number of patents) (166,912 vs. 138,130). The other two indicators, emancipation patents generated (by ha) and emancipation patents generated (by number of patents), achieved only 68% (121,681 vs. 176,987) and 80% (154,271 vs. 190,633) of target, respectively. Despite this apparent success, analysis of the above data yields several less sanguine observations.  (1) Performance in distributing emancipation patents was significantly enhanced by a backlog of patents generated before the program.  (2) The average patent generated and distributed was less than one ha -- considerably smaller than the typical small rice/corn farms already in existence.  However, farmers may receive more than one patent, indicating that the number of agrarian reform beneficiaries may be overstated by as much as a factor of four. (3) Generation of emancipation patents (running at 37% of land surveyed) is a major bottleneck.  Unless this problem is given greater attention, the overall system will soon run down. The CARP/OLT performance indicators give equal weight to intermediate items (survey and generation) and final output (distribution) indicators, reflecting internal distortions. CARP's program of agrarian reform appears to be more redistributive (i.e., for beneficiaries' sake) than productive (i.e., for the country's economic benefit).  Indeed, far from solving the problem of rural poverty, OLT may be exacerbating it. Small farms are generally not viable entities.  Most are operating below the per capita poverty level and off-farm employment is necessary to sustain the family, while many landless workers are no longer employed by the newly fragmented small farm families. Furthermore, CARP's objectives are hampered by weaknesses in farmer support services as well. This analysis raises warning signals about the need to:  (1) review the viability of the overall land redistribution policy; (2) provide support services in order to attain and maintain individual small farm viability; and (3) improve program planning to develop and maintain a sustainable thrust in CARP implementation. Lessons learned include the following.  (1) Precise definitions of performance indicators should be verified and/or field tested with line operating personnel before being established.  In this program, the terms established as performance indicators, although seemingly precise at the outset, were not the same as terms used operationally in existing government reports. Furthermore, methods, interpretations, and sources of data collection frequently differed among the implementing agencies and their field offices.  (2) Reporting requirements should be verified and/or field tested with line operating personnel as well.  (3) For maximum effectiveness and field cooperation, program monitoring should be concurrent with program operations.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","12/1/1991 12:00:00 AM","","Domestic government programs|Agrarian reform|Land reform|Nonproject assistance|Farm size|Small farms|Land surveys|Land titling|Beneficiary count","Philippines","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABF356.pdf","431 KB","008592 - USAID.

"Presents final Mission report on a project (1979-91) to fund feasibility studies, sector studies, reconnaissance visits, and investment promotion activities to speed the development of Egypt's private sector. Performance of the original implementing agency, the Government of Egypt's General Authority for the Investment and Free Zone (GAFI), was inconsistent, hampered by a cumbersome application review and approval process and general bureaucratic inertia.  As a result, in 12/88 project implementation was assumed by the Egypt/U.S. Joint Business Council, which established the United States Investment Promotion Office (USIPO). Despite Egypt's difficult investment environment, USIPO increased the usage and effectiveness of the project until its PACD in 9/91.  USIPO's small but private sector oriented staff, more experienced in serving U.S. businesses, were a critical factor in enabling USIPO to improve the range and quality of support services to serious U.S. investors. USIPO's general marketing of the project was only marginally better than GAFI's, but its follow-up with interested American companies made a significant difference. Even though GOE rules and regulations were still a disincentive for U.S. businesses, USIPO was able to complete 12 feasibility studies, 19 reconnaissance visits, and 6 investment promotion activities during its 18-month tenure, vs. GAFI's 10 sector profiles, 25 feasibility studies, 20 reconnaissance visits, and 5 approved projects in 9 1/2 years. The project teaches four lessons.  (1) The GOE's economic policies, procedures for foreign investment, and expected return on investment are the most important factors affecting foreign investors' decisions.  (2) Financial incentives such as cost sharing for feasibility studies and reconnaissance visits were useful to U.S. executives, but not critical to a decision to invest.  They were appreciated more by smaller and medium size firms than by large ones.  (3)  A GOE entity is not the preferred vehicle for promoting U.S. investment in Egypt.  (4) Project management took too much GOE, USIPO, and USAID staff time. Future projects should be bureaucratically leaner.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1991 12:00:00 AM","","Investment promotion|Foreign investment|Feasibility studies","Egypt|USA","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABF502.pdf","364 KB","008539 - USAID.

"This report summarizes an impact assessment of the rate of technology adoption by Swazi farmers in the Swaziland Cropping Systems Research and Extension Training Project, and finds that there is indirect evidence of the adoption of recommended practices.  The first section describes the research procedures including the samples utilized, the research design, and the design of the analytic approach.  The second section summarizes findings in regard to (1) the rates of adoption of a series of recommended practices, (2) the percentage of farmers who use the recommended rates of application of these practices, (3) the level of homestead self-sufficiency, (4) the extent of contacts by farmers with the extension and the research system, (5) the relationship between extension and research contacts and adoption rates, (6) levels of ownership of agricultural equipment, (7) an analysis of gender differences relating to the adoption of practices, and (8) the relationship of off-farm income to adoption of technology.  Conclusions are reported in the third section, and the last section of the report includes an appendix.

"PACR of a project (1984-9/91) to strengthen the ability of Morocco's public and private sectors to plan and implement family planning (FP) and maternal/child health (MCH) programs. The project met or surpassed its objectives:  (1) FP information and services have been established for 80% of the population (vs. a target of 70%); (2) contraceptive prevalence for married women of reproductive age has reached an estimated 41.5% (vs. 35%); and (3) planning and analysis capabilities in the areas of FP, child survival (CS), and population have been established at the Ministry of Public Health (MOPH). On a broader level, project and other donor assistance has helped the Government of Morocco (GOM) improve key FP/MCH indicators: infant mortality has declined from 112 per 1,000 live births in early 1970s to 57 in 1992; child (ages 1-4) mortality declined from 77 to 20 deaths per 1,000 in the same period; vaccination coverage increased from 40-50% in 1985 to at least 72% -- and possibly up to 90% -- in 1991; and total fertility rate declined from 5.8% in 1980 to 4.2% in 1992. The strongest elements of the project included:  (1) expansion of the VDMS (household visits) outreach program and the integration of child survival (CS) activities into the program, (2) increased awareness of population concerns among policymakers and the development of mechanisms to gather population data, (3) extensive management and technical training programs for local staff, (4) expansion of clinical services programs for long-term contraception, especially the voluntary surgical contraception programs established at 34 fixed centers nationwide, and (5) commercial sector activities, including social marketing of contraceptives. The project's primary weaknesses included:  failure to effectively apply information and recommendations derived from operations research and special studies; lack of focus within the IEC component; and inadequate information for efficient contraceptive logistics management. Although the follow-on project, already underway, calls for a phase-out of assistance to Morocco's population sector by 1996, it is unlikely that the program will be entirely self-sustaining by then.  The planned phase-out should be re-examined during the next project management review. A 1991 CS impact evaluation derived the following lessons from Morocco's experience.  (1) Integrated services are more effective than separate ones; the highly integrated VDMS outreach program is a good example.  (2) Giving priority to FP and immunization is a valid CS strategy.  (3) Careful phase-in of activities can lead to a more successful program.  The Morocco program has been a series of phases, each with its own characteristics.  (4) The Morocco model is replicable, but its success cannot be divorced from the social, economic, and religious context in which it functions.  (5) An FP program can be successfully initiated even in the absence of a stated public population policy; program achievements along the way can help build support from policymakers.  (6) The private sector needs to be involved as early as possible, as this leads not only to increased FP/MCH information and services, but greater sustainability as well.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1991 12:00:00 AM","","Family planning services|Family planning promotion programs|Maternal child health care|Population policy|Family planning policy|Public health care|Private health care","Morocco","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABH106.pdf","3,620 KB","008579 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (8/83-7/91) to improve basic skills training in Jamaica by strengthening the Human Employment and Resource Training (HEART) Trust and the Ministries of Education (MOE) and of Youth and Community Development (MYCD). Output targets have been achieved and considerable progress was made towards achieving the project's purpose:  all three agencies have strengthened their capacities to deliver skills training. The HEART Trust began functioning as a National Training Agency in 7/91, upon the recommendation of project policy studies.  The Trust assumed responsibility for the HEART academies from the MYCD, and developed a management information system (MIS) and fiscal auditing and analysis procedures.  Training for Trust staff included:  overseas training in institutional management and planning for 29 persons (including one B.A.); observation tours of U.S. Job Corps centers; and workshops conducted by the TA team. The MOE adopted competency-based vocational education curricula covering business education, home economics, auto mechanics, and entrepreneurial skills, and trained teachers in them, improving the pass rate of students in these areas by 45%.  The MOE also developed a MIS for its Technical/Vocational Unit, conducted seminars and in-service training for some 1,000 persons, and developed a 3-year program for school leavers who gained teaching diplomas in tech/voc education. However, attrition rates among newly trained personnel have been high due to lack of incentives and low remuneration.  Training for MOE staff included B.S. and M.S. degrees for 9 participants and short-term training, observational tours, and conferences for 24 others. In the MYCD component, not much was achieved at first because the academies were shifted to the HEART Trust and the planned establishment of a Nonformal Education Division never materialized.  In the later years of the project, the MYCD did establish new vocational training centers.  Participant training for MYCD staff included B.S. and M.S. degrees for 6 persons, and overseas training for 30 others, although there has been a 40% attrition rate in the latter group. By the PACD, the HEART academies had trained 10,827 women (185% of target) and 2,909 men (149% of target); 70-75% of graduates have been placed in jobs related to their training areas and others are self-employed or employed in other fields.  The technical schools had graduated 10,847 women (146% of target) and 9,743 men (116% of target). Some $6 million of equipment was procured for HEART academies and MOE technical schools.  While some problems were encountered, this component was generally a success, although maintenance is continuing concern. Construction and/or renovation of several facilities was added under a project amendment. The following lessons were learned.  (1) Projects involving more than one government ministry/institution are impractical.  In this project, the institutions failed to establish interagency agreements and continued to protect their own turf.  (2) The absorptive capacity of participating agencies was overestimated, the same incumbent having frequently to serve as counterpart to several TA teams.  At times there were no counterparts at all. (3) Although a condition precedent to the project was the establishment of a public-private National Training Board, the private sector was not given any specific responsibilities and did not participate in decisionmaking.  (4) Before USAID considers purchasing equipment, particularly high-tech equipment, it should impose a condition precedent that there be solid maintenance plans and budgets in place.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1991 12:00:00 AM","","Vocational training|Technical training|Institution building|Government departments","Jamaica","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABH336.pdf","240 KB","008563 - USAID.

"PACR of a pilot project (1979-8/89) to use satellite communications to promote rural development in selected developing countries.  The project was implemented by the Academy for Educational Development. Results were less than had been planned.  The A.I.D. leadership that had originally supported the project changed, planned sites in Senegal and the Philippines were dropped (due in part to political influences), and funding was eventually reduced by two-thirds.  Nevertheless, satellite networks were successfully established in Indonesia, the West Indies, and Peru. The satellite system in Indonesia included 15 sites:  12 universities in the Eastern archipelago, 2 sites in Jakarta, and the Bogor Agricultural Institute.  The system permitted student and faculty groups to talk to each other in a conference call over a 900,000 sq. mile area. Class discussions held during audio courses were longer (32 minutes on average) than the typical 4-minute class discussions held in face-to-face, traditional classrooms.  However, even though the system supported high-quality education on numerous subjects at less than half the cost of traditional instruction, it received only lukewarm support within the university system and the Ministry of Education.  This has been attributed to the unwillingness of the Eastern Island universities to collaborate. At the University of the West Indies, installation of a video satellite network on three main campuses and three small islands increased access to both university courses and professional seminars; decreased the student attrition rate in the smaller islands; increased the number of graduates from a Certificate of Education program; allowed nurses and physicians to receive special courses on reproductive health and AIDS; and provided teachers of the deaf with their first in-service courses. Additionally, the University used the system to improve its administration.  While the system has been well received, faculty are undecided whether students learn as much or more in distance classes as they do in face-to-face classes. In Peru, satellite links were used to establish commercial telephone service in rugged remote areas -- resulting, surprisingly, in collection of enough revenue to pay 90% of operating costs after 2 years -- and for audio conferences which reached 90% of the health, education, and agricultural professionals in the region.  The situation in the project region today is confused, since it is the center of both revolutionary and drug-growing activity.  Some of the earth stations have been moved to other sites, while others continue to operate. The project also worked with NASA to establish, in a remote area of Indonesia, a solar-powered earth station supporting a telephone system and two audio-conferencing channels.  The earth station demonstrated that a rural phone system can be run without electrical power or diesel generators. Many lessons were learned.  On the negative side, the project came into conflict with distrustful vested interests (ministries, foreign-dominated and local telecommunications companies); it also showed that in telecommunications investments, economic rather than technical considerations have the last word.  On the positive side, the project demonstrated that investments in rural telecommunications can very frequently be exceptionally productive:  telephone and audio-conferencing services proved highly reliable; distance teaching and consultation through audio-conferencing highly cost-effective; and a wide variety of otherwise unavailable courses and seminars were provided to extension workers, students, professionals, and citizens in remote rural areas. The PACR includes a historic sketch of A.I.D.'s involvement in satellite communications, from 1967 until project initiation.","Attached to PD-WAY-579","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","7/1/1991 12:00:00 AM","","Rural development|Educational development|Communication satellites|Telephone systems|Rural areas|Distance education","Indonesia|West Indies|Peru","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDWAY579A.pdf","1,322 KB","000182 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (8/78-12/90) to train a cadre of agricultural scientists to fill teaching and research positions within the Tunisian Ministry of Agriculture. The project resulted in the awarding of 98 U.S. degrees (40 Ph.D.s and 58 M.S.s) to 85 trainees; of note is that those who received their degrees from U.S. Land Grant universities received degree equivalency. The project also financed short-term U.S. training for 43 Tunisians, attendance by 200 Tunisians and Americans at a Tuniso-American colloquium on sustainable agriculture, and 13 agricultural research programs at Tunisian institutions. The project had a positive impact in three major areas: strengthening the Tunisian institutions responsible for developing and delivering agricultural technology, promoting use of the latest agricultural techniques by Tunisian administrators, faculty, researchers, and technical personnel, and making Tunisian agricultural institutions more responsive and action-oriented through the use of the most relevant technologies and management techniques.  These changes have led to increases in both production and farm income as small farmers have been provided, through a more effective delivery system, technologies related to fertilizer use, varietal selection, and other agronomic areas. On the negative side, the linkages component encountered serious problems and did not produce significant results.  Most Tunisians looked on it as exclusively a program of research grants and placed little or no importance on establishing or maintaining professional ties.  The program of individual linkages between Tunisian and U.S. researchers suffered from administrative delays and lack of a logical procedure for choosing proposals; the program succeeded only in cases where the two individuals already had worked together for an extended period of time. The institutional linkages programs was based on a ""Sister Universities"" concept quite different from the kind of linkages Tunisia was used to with European schools; the disparity in size between U.S. and Tunisian schools also posed a problem.  However, since the PACD there are still institutional linkages between two Tunisian institutions and Oregon State and Montana State universities.  Finally, the sabbatical program failed to generate much interest, as most Tunisian laboratories were not organized to host Americans, who generally want to spend their sabbatical time writing for publication. Several lessons were learned.  (1) The high return rate (95%) of participants is due to the fact that:  all long-term participants were mature individuals with practical work experience and a formal commitment to return to their jobs; no undergraduate degrees were offered; and extensions and second consecutive degrees were offered on an exceptional basis only.  (2) The number of students who went into research after degree completion was lower than expected; many opted instead for teaching, where the pay is better.  This had a direct effect on the amount and type of agricultural research conducted to date.  (3) U.S. trainees, especially at the Ph.D. level, ranked high in their exposure to the advanced technologies, knowledge of subject matter, and ability to relate their training to the Tunisian situation, but less well in solving administrative problems at their home institutions.  As a result, they frequently experienced extreme frustration upon their return.  French and Tunisian training programs, by contrast, generally require students to spend a longer time in ""the system"" learning how to resolve or circumvent administrative road blocks.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1991 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural education|Agricultural training|Participants|Doctoral degrees|Institution building|Agricultural research|Teachers|Institutional linkages|Beneficiary count","Tunisia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABH889.pdf","169 KB","008616 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (9/85-3/90) to institutionalize within the Government of Tunisia (GOT) the capacity to use computer technology, especially in public education and research.  The project was implemented by the Institute Regional des Sciences Informatiques et Telecommunications (IRSIT). IRSIT is now a leader in computer technology in North Africa.  In five years, the time it usually takes for an applied group to develop, IRSIT has not only established itself but increased its staff of scientists and researchers from 3 to 35 in number, and developed its reputation in Tunis as a well-trained and technically up-to-date (i.e., U.S. educated), and hardworking group that is able to respond quickly to demands.  Government funding of IRSIT has decreased to 45%. In addition to strengthening IRSIT, project outputs include, inter alia:  6 long-term relationships with private Tunisian companies; 8 linkages with U.S. universities or computer companies; production of the first satellite maps in North Africa; installation of microcomputers at pilot schools; and pilot projects in higher and secondary education and applications research. The following lessons were learned.  (1) Effective institutional linkages must be based on mutual benefits between the institutions. This often requires considerable time and exchange between the institution and the potential partner just to recognize the mutual benefits.  The time and cost (particularly that related to communications) must be included in schedules and budgets.  (2) Being the first or only user of any hardware or software in a country has several disadvantages.  ""First and Only"" users experience the most severe maintenance problems. This guideline may conflict with the desire to be a technology gateway, so a balance must be reached.  (3) Buy for quality rather than price; because of the cost and difficulty of maintenance in Tunisia, it was wiser to pay costs up front, and purchase more expensive high-quality equipment, which fails less often.  This minimizes work disruptions.  (4) At least 10% of equipment costs should be budgeted for maintenance and/or spare parts.  It is important to investigate the willingness of local vendors to service equipment procured directly from the United States  (5) Short-term professional training proved to be a very effective way of augmenting the technical education of B.S. and M.S. level staff.  For those with a Ph.D., however, short courses must be carefully screened to ensure high quality.  Staff and management beyond the Ph.D. level generally benefit most from seminars, conferences, and meetings with executives and staff of cooperating institutions.  (6) The project helped the GOT develop its plan to establish an international institution of higher education, called the Carthage Institute of Technology (CIT), but the plans were never executed.  Development of such an institution required considerable long-term political and non-political support within a country.  It also requires exceptional stability within the government. Tunisia's change of government and successive appointment of three Ministries of Higher Education during the CIT project made it difficult to achieve the necessary long-term stability.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1991 12:00:00 AM","","Computer technology|Educational development|Public education|Private sector|Institution building|Applied research","Tunisia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABH891.pdf","187 KB","008616 - USAID.

"The International Executive Service Corps (IESC) is a nonprofit nongovernmental organization that was set up in 1964.  The IESC started its operations in Pakistan in 1984 and by the end of 1990 had completed 81 projects.  In this report, Management and Financial Applications (Private) Limited (MFA) evaluates the effectiveness of IESC's operations. A survey of 35 IESC projects revealed the following.  (1) 44% of clients felt that benefits were either equal to or greater than the costs, another 25% said that the benefits were less than the costs, and the remaining 31% were not sure.  (2) There appears to be no discernible increase in the average cost of the project over time.  Instead, the receipt of USAID funding in 1988/89 has allowed the IESC to cater to smaller clients at a lower cost. (3) Larger clients pay significantly more than smaller clients for Volunteer Executive (VE) services.  (4) The majority of clients were introduced to the IESC through personal contact with the IESC representatives.  (5) In most cases, the IESC expert did not face any problems.  However, 28% of the clients responded that IESC experts faced some problems, including host organizational and environmental problems (62.5%), health/age problems (62.5%), and language/communication problems (22%).  The percentages total more than 100, due to overlapping.  (6) Projects lasted 3 months in 37.5% of the cases; 50% of clients were satisfied with the project duration, 34% were not.  (7) About 40% of the clients said that their requirements for assistance had not completely been addressed by the VE.  However, 25% of these held that the expert nonetheless provided useful advice.  (8) 38% of clients responded that they requested the IESC to send the VE again for a follow-up visit.  (9) Transfer of technology, broadly construed to include better working methods, modifications of plant processes, training of staff and improvement in organization, was reported by 53%. The subsector breakdown of the percentage of clients who reported that technology transfer took place was as follows:  food & agriculture (43%), construction (50%), textile, apparel, and leather (50%), health & education (66%), chemical (75%), engineering (40%), finance (50%), printing (100%).  (10) Only 50% of clients reported that the VE was familiar with their business and working conditions before arriving; 44% thought that the VE was unfamiliar with their business environment and had not been adequately briefed.  (11) A majority of the clients reported that they followed the VE's recommendations, and about half of these said that the VE was actively involved in the project implementation stage.  (12) Clients were mostly satisfied with the time taken by the IESC to respond to their request for assistance.  (13) Three of the six smaller clients were highly satisfied while one other was satisfied.  Only one smaller client was dissatisfied.  (14) Overall, 65% of the clients were either highly satisfied (31%), or satisfied (34%) with the VE's advice. The only respondent in the printing subsector proved to be satisfied; 75% of those in the chemicals subsector, 75% in the construction subsector, and 71% of those in the food/agriculture subsector were satisfied. Detailed information on the financial impact of the VE's visit was not available as the clients were mostly not aware of this themselves or did not consider it worthwhile to make a concerted effort to come up with this information.  However, some broad estimates are presented for some clients. On the whole, this is a useful service as clients are generally satisfied with the IESC's performance.  However, if IESC is to improve: (1) client's needs have to be identified more accurately than is now the case; (2) clients should be given wider latitude in the selection of the VE; (3) the VE should be briefed more thoroughly before arriving and pre-visit communication between the VE and the client should be encouraged; (4) counterparts to VEs should be properly identified and briefed about the purpose of the assignment; and (5) the IESC should carefully screen out VEs who may not be fit enough to carry out the tasks envisaged under the assignment (health problems of the VEs have marred certain assignments). Further, the IESC will have to carefully monitor the fees it charges clients as there are competitor organizations, such as the British Executive Service Overseas (BESO) and the Netherlands Management Consultancy Program (NMCP) that appear to provide a fairly cost-effective service in the market that IESC has targeted in Pakistan.

"Final report by the contractors, Associates in Rural Development (ARD) and Management Systems International (MSI), on a project (9/91-9/94) to help USAID's Africa Bureau (AFR) to develop a democracy and governance (D/G) strategic framework and program. ARD and MSI provided a core team of advisors and support personnel to offer a range of services to AFR.  In the area of policy development, the core team prepared a Working Concept Paper on Governance which stimulated discussions with AFR, USAID, Missions, and Regional Economic Development Services (REDSOs) in Africa, other U.S. government agencies, and members of the scholarly community.  Discussions helped focus USAID's governance policy and strategy, linking improvements in governance to democratic practice, and have brought about positive changes in the policy environment for broad-based, sustainable economic development.  The core team also helped to develop an AFR strategy paper to promote D/G, entitled ""A Blueprint for Sustainable Development Through Democratic Governance.""  The report's appendices developed key arguments and provided the structure for several new centrally funded projects. With regard to policy implementation, the core team developed a list of impact indicators which have been recommended for adoption to the Bureau's budget-allocation exercise; made a significant contribution to AFR's thinking about operational indicators at the strategic level by conducting a workshop for experts in this area; and provided assistance at the field level for the development of project level indicators. Other accomplishments in the area of policy implementation include: (1) promotion of the participation of women in democratic development; (2) improvement in the design and implementation of country D/G assessments under the requirements contract; (3) facilitation of dialogue with Africans through meetings and workshops; (4) improvement of communications between USG democracy advisors; and (5) coordination with other USAID D/G activities and donors.  The project also provided assistance in the development of medium- and long-term D/G strategies through the completion of 10 D/G assessments in 9 countries. In addition, the project developed for AFR and USAID timely approaches to assisting civil society and governance reform through the preparation of two papers; implemented a workshop on ""Economic Reform in Africa's New Area of Political Liberalization""; and, in response to the problem of corruption as a major obstacle to effective governance practices, organized two meetings of its D/G advisory panel on administrative corruption. To strengthen civil society, the core team planned a series of workshops to help AFR refine the concept and support the development of civil society; and prepared a paper which synthesized much of the best scholarly thinking regarding civil society in Africa, posed key questions to be addressed in developing an effective approach, and was used as the basis of a major workshop on the organization of civil society and its impact on policy-making and implementation. Lessons learned in terms of broad policy issues are as follows. (1) Corruption and overcentralization of decision making discretion are key constraints to sustained growth in Africa. (2) The effectiveness and extent of USAID's D/G activities in Africa suffered from an ambiguous U.S. legislative mandate.  Until mid-1993, there was a lack of clarity as to what kind of D/G activities were lawful and which were unlawful. (3) Activities were also limited by the long-standing competition within USAID over policy program development between field missions and the Washington regional and functional bureaus.  (4) A great deal of energy was focused on short-range concerns, and too little attention was paid to civic society, and non-state governance/advocacy structures critical to the achievement of sustainable improvements in democracy.  (5) Central guidance by USAID has been insufficient at the operational level to assure consistent, effective programming.  (6) Mission and embassy concerns with short- and medium-term objectives and political sensitivity with sitting regimes sometimes limited participation of host country nationals in the conduct and public diffusion of assessments. (7) Virtually all of Africa's new democracies must be considered at-risk. Democratic consolidation will require time and considerable changes at many levels -- there is little value in being involved only for the short-term. The following lessons were learned in terms of operations.  (1) Missions need a wide range of technical support on a variety of country and program level issues related to D/G.  (2) It has been valuable to develop and apply a broad-gauge political assessment methodology using a comparative approach in this project.  (3) Traditional bilateral projects are not effective in responding to political/governance opportunities and problems in a timely manner.  (4) Washington-based workshops on D/G were most useful when linked to a specific programmatic or policy need.  (5) Continuity in support provided by consultants and full-time core staff is very important to the success of USAID's D/G activities.","Contract numbers listed on document as: AFR-0542-C-1108-00 and|AFR-0542-Q-1109-00","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","AFR-0542-C-00-1108-00|AFR-0542-Q-00-1109-00","","9/1/1991 12:00:00 AM","","Development planning|USAID|Development strategies|Strategic planning|Development policy|Democracy|Policy analysis|Policy making|Civil society|Governance","Africa south of Sahara","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABL452.pdf","2,025 KB","001600 - Associates in Rural Development, Inc.

"Evaluates the impacts of four activities funded under USAID's South Pacific Fisheries Development Project (8790009):  three bilateral projects (Papua New Guinea's Manus Island Canoe Development Project, Western Samoa's Fisheries Development Program, and Kiribati's Nation Fisheries Corporation, Te Mautari Limited), and one regional activity (the South Pacific Commission's Tuna and Billfish Assessment Program). Overall, the program was a success.  In a very short time, USAID became involved in the fisheries development business in many countries in a meaningful and cooperative way.  The process of project planning, review, and monitoring was probably as important to generating goodwill as was the actual provision of assistance.  Much of the program's success can be attributed to the personnel who administered it in the field, yet, it cannot be concluded that this experiment can be widely replicated since the regional institutions who implemented the program also should get considerable credit for its success.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1991 12:00:00 AM","","Fisheries|Regional development","Oceania|Western Samoa|Polynesia|Kiribati","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABL957.pdf","1,935 KB","","","007215 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (1/86-9/92) to expand and improve village-level irrigated farming in the Bakel zone of the Senegal River Basin and to encourage private sector participation that can be replicated throughout the Basin. The project provided a total of 22 person-years of long-term TA and 20 person-months of short-term consultancies. It funded the design and construction of 239 hectares of irrigation systems, and the rehabilitation of 50 hectares of existing systems.  An office building was constructed for the long-term TA providers,  and funds were provided to renovate housing quarters for TA staff residing in Bakel, operate the demonstration farm, and establish a socioeconomic monitoring system of irrigation systems in the project area.  The project also financed a training program and observation tours for farmers, training for a development officer, and several reports, including 12 socioeconomic studies, a general feasibility study on medium-scale irrigation systems, and a study on land tenure issues. Despite these successes, the project failed to achieve its major objectives.  (1) There was no private sector involvement in irrigation development and agricultural services. (2) A financially-viable irrigation prototype was not developed and replicated by farmers.  (3) No technical improvements were made in the design and construction of project-supported irrigation systems.  (4) Employment and agricultural production did not increase in the Bakel area. Based on the recommendations of the 6/90 mid-term evaluation, the Mission and the Government of Senegal determined that it was no longer desirable to continue the project and formalized an agreement for its early termination. The following lessons were learned.  (1) Economic assumptions made during project design should be based on actual data or evaluated during the early stages of project implementation.  (2) The host country implementing agency's contracting capabilities should be assessed during project design in order to determine the best contracting mode early on and prevent unnecessary delays in implementation.  (3) The TA contract should be jointly assessed by the implementing agency and USAID on an annual basis to determine the need to continue or readjust TA services. Early response to unsatisfactory performance could have led to a reorganization of the TA personnel and improved implementation.  (4) Good communication between the TA and implementing agency personnel is essential for project implementation.  (5) A program and financial management audit of the project and of the TA contract should be carried out within the first 2 years of project implementation.  (6) It is difficult to mobilize an effective TA team for remote projects sites. (7) During project design, USAID should thoroughly investigate the priorities of the host country and its capabilities to implement the planned activity.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","12/1/1991 12:00:00 AM","","Pilot projects|River basins|Irrigated farming|Agricultural development|Agricultural training|Private sector|Senegal River","Senegal","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABP321.pdf","2,881 KB","008600 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of a project to improve family planning (FP) delivery by the public and private sectors and upgrade the demographic database in Senegal.  The evaluation covers the period 4/85-5/91 vs. a PACD of 9/92.  It was constrained by a number of factors, including lack of previous evaluations, missing and inaccurate data, and the impossibility of examining all of the project's many components.  In effect, the evaluation is a snapshot of the project at the time of the evaluation. Despite implementation problems, the project has contributed significantly to a dramatic improvement in Senegal's FP environment. Generally, the project increased knowledge and practice of FP planning; introduced FP services into clinics throughout the country; trained health workers and managers in various FP areas; developed an important FP program in the private sector; and increased the awareness of Government of Senegal (GOS) planners and policy makers to the importance of demographic factors in development planning.  As a result of these efforts, a National Population Policy was adopted in April 1988 and the President of Senegal signed a National FP Policy into law in March 1990. More specifically, from 1985-1990, the number of active contraceptive acceptors in public clinics increased on an annual average of 28% and in the private sector on an annual average of 44%; and combined public and private sector clients increased from 8,500 to 39,000.  However, the rate of increase of active clients slowed from 1988 to 1990 in the public sector to only 14%.  Also, against the original project goal of 200,000 acceptors by 1992, there were, in 1990, only 70,107 acceptors in all sectors using modern contraceptive methods.  This may be due to the fact that the project was overly optimistic given its time frame, budget, and Senegal's cultural and policy environmental and deteriorating economy that will reduce the GOS's ability to support a follow-on project under standard USAID arrangements. Finally, project management and supervision have been weak on the part of both the GOS and USAID.  The GOS is aware of these management problems and is moving to solve them in the soon to be integrated National FP Program. Individual chapters of the report cover:  (1) project administration and management; (2) information, education, and communication (IEC); (3) FP clinical services; (4) treatment of sexually transmitted diseases and infertility; (5) biomedical and psychosocial research; (6) construction and renovation of infrastructure and equipment maintenance; (7) contraceptive logistics management; (8) women in development projects; (9) FP service statistics, research, and evaluation; (10) the private and para-public sector (PPPS) and contraceptive social marketing; and (11) the demographic data base.  The report also includes two summaries: an extensive executive summary, which contains a cross-cutting synthesis of the substantive chapters; and a Summary of Findings and Recommendations contained in those chapters.","Contents: v. 1.

"Final evaluation of a project (9/89-8/91) to train a cadre of health workers and community leaders in three impact areas in Zimbabwe in HIV/AIDS awareness and prevention and in adult education techniques. Most project objectives were achieved. Specifically:  97% of rural health center staff and all three Ministry of Cooperatives and Community Development (MCCD) officers received 5 days of HIV/AIDS prevention training; 95% of Village Community Workers (VCWs) and Farm Health Workers (FHWs) attended at least 3 days of training of trainers (TOT) workshops, and 93% attended at least one 1-day refresher course; and at least 2 days of HIV/AIDS education were provided to 526 community leaders.  In addition, the VCWs/FHWs trained 4,640 families, or 76% of the three impact areas; 91% of the VCWs/FHWs were able to demonstrate the proper use of a condom on a model; 86% were able to name the three main modes of HIV transmission; and 96% were able to give three methods of preventing HIV/AIDS transmission.  Data from the Knowledge, Attitude, and Practices household survey conducted in two of the three impact areas showed that 87% of men and 85% of women surveyed correctly identified the three main modes of HIV/AIDS transmission, and an average of 34% of men and 37% of women could state three or more ways to prevent transmission. The following lessons were learned.  (1) An HIV/AIDS education project of 2 years' duration is insufficient to affect attitude and behavioral changes. (2) The effectiveness and sustainability of the HIV and AIDS Prevention in Africa (HAPA) project was enhanced by its high degree of integration into the existing child survival health program and Ministry of Health structure. (3) VCWs/FHWs and community leaders are the two keys to providing effective community-based HIV/AIDS education. The VCWs/FHWs are the direct conduit for HIV/AIDS information to families, while community leaders play a crucial role in creating awareness of and support for the efforts of the VCWs/FHWs.

"Final evaluation of a project (9/89-9/91) to prevent HIV/AIDS in Swaziland.  The project was implemented jointly by Project HOPE and the Family Life Association of Swaziland (FLAS). The project achieved all of its stated objectives.  These were to: assess the knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, and practices (KABP) of 2,000 persons concerning the prevention of HIV infection; (2) use baseline data and KABP surveys to develop education programs on HIV prevention for all persons in the target areas; (3) establish HIV/AIDS information and counseling centers at key institutions; and (4) improve outreach into the community by making HIV information dissemination the responsibility of traditional healers, Sebenta educators, and leaders for non-school going youths. Specific accomplishments are detailed in the report, along with areas needing improvement (in view of the 9/91-9/93 funding period) and related recommendations.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","AFR-0474-G-SS-9063-00","","12/1/1991 12:00:00 AM","","Disease prevention and control|HIV/AIDS|Development cooperation|Private voluntary organizations|Indigenous private voluntary organizations","Swaziland","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABP363.pdf","325 KB","001407 - Save the Children (U.S.)","","001554 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of a project (9/89-9/91) to increase HIV/AIDS awareness in Marondera District, Zimbabwe and reduce behavior or practices that expose individuals to the risk of HIV/AIDS.  The project was implemented by World Vision Zimbabwe (WVZ) and the Ministry of Health (MOH). The project achieved most of its goals. Educational seminars or training were provided to health workers, teachers, youths, community leaders, midwives, farmers, and church leaders.  In addition, posters, stickers, t-shirts, pamphlets, and leaflets, as well as nearly 200,000 condoms, were distributed by project staff.  Focus group surveys of targeted groups indicate that nearly one-third of respondents on commercial farms had heard about the project in Marondera, and nearly half of the same sample knew that HIV/AIDS is a disease, an improvement of 25% from the 1990 baseline Knowledge, Attitude, and Practice (KAP) survey.  While this change cannot be attributed directly to the project, it can be assumed that the project played a significant part. The most troublesome finding to come from the focus group discussions is that although more people know the seriousness of AIDS today than was the case 2 years ago, there is the continual problem of multiple sexual partners and a sexually active segment of the population.  Were this trend to be confirmed by a more detailed study, it would raise fundamental questions over the current strategy to promote AIDS awareness in the country.  In addition, comments from respondents indicate that health workers are setting a bad example by their own promiscuous behavior, suggesting the need to develop a health education campaign specifically targeted at health workers.  Further, health workers, especially in the hospitals, avoid dealing with HIV/AIDS patients, delegating their care to junior workers, who should be included in future HIV/AIDS outreach activities. The main lessons learned concern the difficulties of creating a host-country/PVO partnership for the implementation of a project.  (1) The failure to link a project with the government management system (in terms of transportation, subsistence, travel, materials production, etc.) can delay implementation and frustrate PVO staff.  Conversely, the use of government and community structures can be an effective way to extend scarce resources.  (2) It would be helpful to formulate an official protocol between the PVO and government ministry, outlining the responsibility of each partner, financial disbursement procedures, use of equipment and staff, and monitoring and supervisory responsibilities. (3) Inadequate planning capacity in both the MOH and WVZ hindered the use of survey results in developing new HIV/AIDS awareness strategies. (4) The project was particularly difficult to execute because it tried to address the changing of attitudes. It is recommended that, due to its late start, the project be extended for 1-2 years, with the stipulation that a protocol be developed to outline responsibilities between the MOH and WVZ.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","AFR-0474-G-SS-9097-00","","11/1/1991 12:00:00 AM","","HIV/AIDS|Disease prevention and control|Sex education|Health education|Human sexual behavior|Behavior change|Information dissemination|Public awareness","Zimbabwe","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABP367.pdf","1,095 KB","003794 - World Vision Relief and Development, Inc.","","001554 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (9/86-9/90) to develop an institutional framework and methodology for enhancing the ability of local government units (LGUs) to plan, finance, and construct self-sustaining water supply and sanitation (WS&S) systems for rural communities in the Philippines.  The implementing agency was the Department of Local Government (DLG). The project was originally planned to have four major components (institution building, community development, water system construction, and health and sanitation) as well as a financial and socioeconomic study.  However, only the institution building component and the financial/socioeconomic study were undertaken due to the substantial reduction of the project in 6/89. This reduction was mainly the result of a change in the DLG's responsibilities, which eliminated all but the DLG institution building component; the very slow disbursement of funds and the host country failure to meet conditions precedent were contributing factors. The strategy of the reduced project was to strengthen the ability of the DLG's Project Management Office (PMO) to train LGU trainers, who, in turn, would train local communities and water user associations in WS&S system development and construction.  Contractor-provided training was the major thrust of this institution-building effort.  PMO training activities focused on training techniques, training materials development, program management, and community organization and development methods -- the areas of greatest need; 103 modules were developed in these areas. PMO staff gained considerable theoretical and practical skills while developing and field testing these materials; as a result, they are now able to provide technical support and training to LGUs and water users associations in water systems development. Currently, the DLG is in the process of converting the PMO into a permanent program management unit with the Office of Program Development Services. This will be a major step towards the development of a long-term program-oriented strategy as opposed to the short-term individual project approach that was the cause of the lack of continuity and sustainability in the rural WS&S sector.  The PMO is now responsible for developing supplementary water supply programs funded by other foreign donors, and for coordinating with other national government agencies implementing water supply projects such as the Local Water Utilities Administration (LWUA) and the Department of Public Works and Highways (DISH). As mandated by the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA), DLG, through the PMO, is providing TA to these agencies in the areas of community development, organization, and training.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","3/1/1991 12:00:00 AM","","Water supply|Water sanitation|Government departments|Institution building|Public administration|National level|Local level|Rural areas|Decentralization","Philippines","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABP780.pdf","1,375 KB","008592 - USAID.
