"The purpose of this study is to assess the implementation of Plan Colombia's illicit crop reduction strategies in order to examine the validity of the hypotheses on which crop reduction strategies were designed under Plan Colombia (PC), and to evaluate the effectiveness of the strategies used and the resource levels employed to implement those strategies.  The study is charged with identifying lessons learned from PC's approach, and alternative performance measures for coca control programs.  This assessment is also intended to explore new policy initiatives, providing recommendations to USAID/NAS Colombia for future interventions.

"An assessment of U.S. Agency for International Development's (USAID) Health Policy Initiative (HPI) was conducted by a three-person team of consultants from the Global Health Technical Assistance Project (Gs Tech) from late January to May 2009.&nbsp; The assessment's three tasks were to: (1) determine the effectiveness and efficiency of the multiple-award indefinite quantity contract (IQC) and Task Order 1 (TO1) procurement mechanisms in meeting policy and advocacy programming needs of the Global Health (GH) and Regional Bureaus and Missions; (2) assess the quality and progress of HPI/TO1 program implementation and satisfaction of GH Offices, Regional Bureaus, and Missions with the accomplishments.&nbsp; Started in 2005, HPI is a complex global project designed to improve the enabling environment in developing countries for health, primarily for family planning and reproductive health (FP/RH), HIV/AIDS, and maternal health (MH).&nbsp; There are five activity areas that address intermediate results (IRs) in the HPI results framework.&nbsp; These areas are policy and advocacy, leadership development, financing, multisectoral coordination, and evidence-based decision-making.&nbsp; HPI covers the world geographically, working in 30 USAID-supported countries and in four regions.&nbsp; It implements diverse health policy and advocacy activities that address important health areas.&nbsp; Implementation of HPI has been challenging due to the procurement mechanisms, multiple contractors, numerous funding streams, ceiling constraints, and a time-consuming Field Support Review Process.&nbsp; Furthermore, the project works within a shifting environment for health policy and advocacy due to changes in the HIV/AIDS epidemic and levels and mechanisms of donor funding and uncertainties about health budgets in host countries.&nbsp; (Abstract from U.S. Dept. of State Library catalogue)","Project title: Global health technical assistance (GH tech)","Special Evaluation","Documents","GHS-I-00-05-00005-00|GHS-I-01-05-00005-00","","9/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","","Health policy|Family planning|Reproductive health|HIV/AIDS|Maternal health care|Advocacy","Africa south of Sahara","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACO773.pdf","699 KB","011976 - QED Group, LLC|011830 - CAMRIS International|011880 - Social and Scientific Systems, Inc.

"Since December 2006 the Mountain Institute (TMI) has implemented the Tibetan Plateau Development Program (TPDP) in Diqing Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture of Yunnan Province and Hongyuan County, Aba Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture of Sichuan Province under the support of USAID. The overall program goal was to ""strengthen the community's capacity for meeting their socio-economic needs while conserving the environment and preserving their cultural heritage."" The three main objectives of TPDP were: (1) to improve livelihoods by building capacity of targeted communities and enterprises to plan, implement and monitor development activities; (2) to improve environmental conservation and natural resource management of the rangeland; and (3) to increase the capacity of Tibetans to preserve their unique cultural heritage; As requested by USAID, an impact evaluation was to be conducted before completion of the projects.  The Center for Integrated Agricultural Development (CIAD) was commissioned by The Mountain Institute (TMI) for conducting the impact evaluation.  The evaluation team conducted the field evaluation survey in Diqing and Hongyuan from 24 August to 1 September 2009.  During the field evaluation survey, the evaluation team interviewed TMI project staff in Chengdu and Shangri-La, held interviews and discussions with governmental officials from counterpart institutions in the two project counties, carried out community and household survey and interviews in four project pilot villages.  This evaluation report summarizes the procedures, methods, major findings and recommendations made by the evaluation team.  Findings, observations and recommendations presented in this report only reflect the opinions and judgments of the evaluation team.

"The evaluation of the USAID Grant to WHO/AFRO for the period 2004 to 2009 was carried out in a participatory way jointly by USAID and WHO/AFRO team led by an independent expert.  The evaluation report summarizes in the few pages here documents significant contributions to improvements in health status by African countries, WHO, and development partners.  The USAID Grant has contributed to WHO/AFRO's effectiveness in strengthening the capacity of African countries in improving the health of their people.  The progress made by WHO, African countries and partners during the last five years and the changing health priorities require a reassessment of needs and opportunities for the next USAID Grant to WHO.  To consolidate achievements to date and accelerate efforts by African countries toward reaching the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), it will be critical for WHO/AFRO and USAID to coordinate efforts with other UN and health development partners.  The coordination between WHO/AFRO and USAID has been good.  However, the potential for realizing a greater mutual benefit has not yet been fully tapped.  To do so requires additional effort by the Bureau for Africa at USAID and WHO/AFRO to facilitate linkages at country, regional, and central levels to promote joint activities that further the common agendas of the two organizations.  Similarly, the staff at each level within WHO/AFRO should take full advantage of the technical and financial contributions of USAID and its implementing mechanisms to the development and implementation of health programs in African countries.
