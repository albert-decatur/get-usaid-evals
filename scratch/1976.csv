"Evaluates project to integrate family planning (FP) education into developing country (DC) home economics programs.  Evaluation covers the period 6/72-1/77 and is based on document review, visits to seven DC's, and interviews with staff at AID/W and at headquarters of the American Home Economics Association (AHEA), the contractor. The project has been moderately successful.  AHEA has developed working contracts with 28 countries, eight of which have carried out significant amounts of project activities.  Of these, progress -- which has depended on host country governmental and cultural support and the availability of solid institutional mechanisms -- has been greatest in Korea, Thailand, and the Philippines; least in Sierra Leone and Ghana; and moderate in Jamaica, Panama, and Nepal. Progress in integrating FP education into university home economics programs (where students, however, are relatively few) has been excellent, and has been good in vocational and teachers' colleges.  Rural outreach has been most successful in Korea, the Philippines, and Thailand. Educational radio messages and contacts with parents of day care children have been moderately successful. On the negative side, community development and extension services have been underutilized; recordkeeping is inadequate; few DC home economists have become actively involved; chronic shortages of teaching and reference materials exist; project leadership is too often concentrated in a few dynamic personalities; and assistance from AHEA headquarters to field workers and host country funding have been insufficient.  Planning has been hampered by AHEA's failure to utilize DC home economist advisory committees and by A.I.D.'s failure to provide indepth analyses of country environments. The project should be extended for 5 years, provided AHEA: increase its headquarters staff to provide stronger field management; increase the involvement of DC home economics associations; determine, with the help of A.I.D.'s Office of Population (DS/POP) whether a suitable environment for the project exists before beginning work in a given country; and place more emphasis on assessing DC needs for teaching and outreach materials and on helping to obtain these materials.","Evaluation period: Sep 1977-Jun 1980","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/pha/C-1100","","10/1/1976 12:00:00 AM","","Family planning education|Educational materials|Household management|Family planning|Manuals and handbooks|Rural areas|Education|Women|Family planning promotion programs|Technical assistance","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAF598.pdf","1,855 KB","000262 - American Public Health Association","","","English","application/pdf","Multi country evaluation|Evaluation team|Indepth evaluation|Onsite evaluation","","Muller, Willard C.|McGurk, Lois F.|Hayden, Mark S.","","6 Oct 1976","","","","Evaluation report on family planning promotion through home economics","","PD-AAF-598","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTUzMjE3","Development Support","9363006"
"Evaluates project to enhance Virgina State College's (VSC) capacity to provide expertise in general and agricultural economics to LDC poor farmers and rural businesses. Special evaluation covers the period 6/72-3/76 and is based on a team review of project documents and a visit to VSC. The 211 (d) grant has been the main factor in initiating and maintaining at VSC a graduate (Masters) program - basic to an increased VSC research capacity - in economics with emphasis on economic development and agricultural economics. Also, since the grant, VSC has internationalized its undergraduate program and is considering merging the schools of economics and agricultural economics. Grant funds are currently supporting eight undergraduate and seven graduate students. The grant's central focus was to allow VSC's Bureau of Economic Research and Development (BERD) to expand from domestic to overseas research. Since the grant, BERD's full-time faculty have increased from one to five. Still, short-term consultancies have been limited, although two more BERD faculty will be hired shortly. No possibility for long-term consultancies is apparent. Nonetheless, BERD has not moved rapidly enough beyond domestic research (in south central Virginia) to determine the relevancy of this research to A.I.D., although BERD's interest areas - agriculture, marketing, management, and manpower and production - are of special interest to A.I.D. Only in the last year has BERD established a formal LDC linkage, with Ghana's University of Science and Technology in Ghana. Collaboration with other 211 (d) grant institutions has been less than expected. It is recommended that: the grant be extended 2 years to allow VSC to develop further its project-related capabilities; A.I.D. (especially the Bureau for Africa) become more involved in guiding VSC research and examine the training possibilities offered by VSC's domestic research programs; VSC refine its work plans and develop a logframe for the current grant's final year; and that sustained collaboration be encouraged among the academic institutions, A.I.D. offices, other donor agencies, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture involved in international economic and especially agricultural development.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","3/1/1976 12:00:00 AM","","Institution building|Universities and colleges|Economic analysis|Agricultural economics|Economic research|Technical assistance|Project change","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAJ436.pdf","2,029 KB","002491 - Virginia State College","","","English","application/pdf","Indepth evaluation|Evaluation team|Onsite evaluation|Interim evaluation","","Eliot, Thomas L.|Taylor, Gary|et al.","Agricultural economics","Mar 1976","","","","Comprehensive review : agricultural economics 211(d) grant","","PD-AAJ-436","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTUzNDg1","Technical Assistance","9310139"
"THE RESULTS OF AN EVALUATIVE STUDY OF GUATEMALAN RURAL COOPERATIVES RECEIVING ASSISTANCE THROUGH AID. THE OBJECTIVES WERE TO DETERMINE MORE PRECISELY THE CHARACTERISTICS OF BENEFICIARIES OF THE PROGRAMS; THE KINDS, QUALITIES, AND IMPACTS OF SERVICES PROVIDED; THE RELEVANCE AND VIABILITY OF THE INSTITUTIONS OPERATING THE PROGRAMS; THE COST/BENEFIT RELATIONS OF PROJECT ACHIEVEMENTS; MAJOR ISSUES RELEVANT TO PRESENT AND FUTURE SUCCESS OF PROGRAMS; AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT. THE REPORT PRESENTS SIX GENERAL FINDINGS OF THE STUDY: (1) IN SIX YEARS GUATEMALA HAS DEVELOPED A LARGE AND STRONG COOPERATIVE MOVEMENT SERVING SOME 50,000 FARMERS. THIS IS 10 PERCENT OF ALL FARMERS, AND 18 PERCENT OF FARMERS IN THE ALTIPLANO, WHERE THE BULK OF EFFORT HAS BEEN CONCENTRATED. (2) RURAL COOPERATIVES SUPPORTED BY AID ARE REACHING ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY INDIVIDUALS WITHIN THE LOW-INCOME TARGET GROUP.  (3) THE AID INVESTMENT IN GRANT AND LOAN FUNDS HAS BEEN GENERALLY WELL UTILIZED. (4) THE PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN MEETING THE AID OBJECTIVES OF ASSISTING SMALL FARMERS TO INCREASE PRODUCTION, IMPROVE LIVING STANDARDS, PARTICIPATE IN NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT, AND INCREASE RURAL INCOMES; AND OF ASSISTING RURAL COOPERATIVES TO BECOME VIABLE, SELF-SUFFICIENT INSTITUTIONS. (5) THE PRINCIPAL SHORTCOMINGS HAVE BEEN OVER-CONCENTRATION ON SUPPLYING CREDIT AND FERTILIZER, WITH UNDER-CONCENTRATION ON TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE, CROP DIVERSIFICATION AND MARKETING IMPROVEMENTS. (6) GUATEMALAN COOPERATIVES HAVE A LARGE POTENTIAL FOR FURTHER GROWTH IN MEMBERSHIP AND FOR BROADENING THE RANGE OF SERVICES OFFERED. THEY ALSO ENJOY FOR THE FIRST TIME IN GUATEMALAN HISTORY THE STRONG SUPPORT OF THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/CM/OTR-C-73-198","","1/1/1976 12:00:00 AM","","Cooperatives|Rural areas|Foreign assistance","Guatemala","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAB626.pdf","2,863 KB","000256 - American Technical Assistance Corp.","","","English","application/pdf","","","Rusch, William H.|Mann, F.

"NUTRITION EDUCATION PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN CONDUCTED FOR MANY YEARS IN MANY COUNTRIES, BUT THEIR ACTUAL EFFECTIVENESS HAS NOT BEEN ESTABLISHED, PARTLY FOR WANT OF A SIMPLE AND EFFECTIVE SET OF METHODS FOR EVALUATING THEM. THIS IS WHY USAID DEVELOPED AN EXPERIMENTAL FIELD GUIDE FOR CONDUCTING SUCH EVALUATIONS. FROM 1973 TO 1975 THE FIELD GUIDE WAS TESTED IN BRAZIL ON THREE KINDS OF NUTRITION EDUCATION PROGRAMS: PERSON-TO-PERSON, GROUP TEACHING, AND MASS MEDIA. THE EVALUATION METHODOLOGY WAS APPLIED TO THREE BRAZILIAN PROGRAMS: SERVICO SOCIAL DA INDUSTRIA (SESI), THE ASSOCIACAO BRASILEIRA DE CREDITO E ASSISTENCIA RURAL (ABCAR), AND THE SUPERINTENDENCIA NACIONAL DO ABASTECIMENTO (SUNAB). THIS REPORT DISCUSSES THAT ACTIVITY AND PRESENTS CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS BASED UPON IT. THE REVISED FIELD GUIDE WAS PUBLISHED IN JUNE, 1975. THE RECOMMENDATIONS DERIVING FROM THE DEVELOPMENT WORK, CONFERENCES WITH A PANEL OF EXPERTS, AND EXPERIENCES IN THE FIELD DEMONSTRATION ARE SUMMARIZED BELOW: FURTHER FIELD APPLICATIONS SHOULD BE CARRIED OUT TO ENSURE THE UTILITY OF THE METHODOLOGY FOR COST-EFFECTIVENESS COMPARISONS. THE UNDER-FIVE TARGET AUDIENCE SHOULD BE GIVEN PRIORITY, AND SITES SELECTED SHOULD BE IN COUNTRIES LESS DEVELOPED THAN BRAZIL. THE USERS OF THE GUIDE SHOULD BE ORIENTED AND TRAINED. FURTHER APPLICATIONS OF THE METHODOLOGY SHOULD DETERMINE THE NEED FOR ALTERNATIVE AND LESS SOPHISTICATED METHODS, AND SHOULD EXPLORE POSSIBLE TECHNIQUES. CONSIDERATION SHOULD BE GIVEN TO DEVELOPING SUPPLEMENTS TO THE FIELD GUIDE TO PROVIDE PROCEDURAL MODELS FOR MEASURES OF ADDITIONAL FOOD BEHAVIORS SUCH AS FOOD ACQUISITION, STORAGE, AND PREPARATION. A SUMMARY HANDBOOK SHOULD BE DEVELOPED FOR PROGRAM ADMINISTRATORS AND PLANNERS. AID SHOULD PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO GOVERNMENTS AND TO VOLUNTARY AND INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS THAT MAY REQUEST SUCH HELP IN EVALUATING THEIR NUTRITION EDUCATION PROGRAMS.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/CSD-3358","","1/1/1976 12:00:00 AM","","Nutrition education|Evaluation methodology|Food consumption patterns|Project replication|Nutrition research","Brazil","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAC605.pdf","1,606 KB","001102 - Synectics Corp.|000202 - USAID.

"THE EVALUATION IS BASED ON STUDIES OF NINE AID PROGRAMS IN ECUADOR AND HONDURAS. THE EVALUATOR DISCUSSES AND MAKES RECOMMENDATIONS ON SMALL FARMER GROUPS, GROUPS AND LAND ACQUISITION, FEDERATIONS AND OTHER GROUP-ASSISTING ORGANIZATIONS, CREDIT UNIONS AND THEIR FEDERATIONS, CREDIT PROGRAMS FOR SMALL FARMER GROUPS, SELF-SUFFICIENCY AND AID SUPPORTED ORGANIZATIONS, INTER-AGENCY COORDINATION, AND MONITORING AND IMPLEMENTATION OF SMALL FARMER GROUP PROJECTS.  SMALL FARMER ORGANIZATIONS TEND TO DO BETTER WHEN THEY ORGANIZE AROUND A CONCRETE GOAL. AID'S PROGRAMS TO ORGANIZE SMALL FARMER ORGANIZATIONS HAVE HAD CONSIDERABLY LESS IMPACT THAN THEY MIGHT HAVE. AID-FINANCED ORGANIZATIONS PLAYED IMPORTANT ROLES AS BROKERS. CREDIT UNIONS AND THEIR FEDERATIONS, IN CONTRAST TO COOPERATIVE FEDERATIONS, HAVE BEEN MORE SUCCESSFUL CASES OF AID INSTITUTION BUILDING, AND THEY HAVE DONE BETTER THAN OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AT GETTING CREDIT TO SMALL FARMERS. THE EVALUATOR MADE 51 RECOMMENDATIONS INCLUDING: (1)AID SHOULD TAKE A SEQUENTIAL OR EVOLUTIONARY APPROACH TO SMALL FARMER ORGANIZING. IT SHOULD FOCUS ON CERTAIN ORGANIZATION-BUILDING TASKS, RATHER THAN ON CERTAIN ORGANIZATIONAL FORMS; AND (2)AID SHOULD TAKE MORE ADVANTAGE OF THE SMALL FARMER'S INTEREST IN ORGANIZING TEMPORARILY TO ACHIEVE CERTAIN LIMITED AND CONCRETE GOALS.","Spanish Ed.: PN-AAD-119","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1976 12:00:00 AM","","Small farms|Farmers|Agricultural product marketing|Agricultural cooperatives|Credit unions|Financial institutions|Agricultural development banks|Land reform|Institution building|Credit cooperatives|Agricultural credit","Honduras|Ecuador","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAD118.pdf","1,364 KB","000108 - USAID.

"In 1971, the Ivory Coast implemented a nationwide educational system reform designed to improve the reach and quality of educational offerings. A primary component of this reform is the intensive utilization of educational television (ETV) in primary schools. This report evaluates the Ivory Coast's system of ETV program production. Plans for broadcast and production output from the ETV Complex in Bouake have been consistently more ambitious than achievements. Comparing planning documents to actual results indicates that the system is presently operating at only 60% efficiency. The long run average production costs are estimated under three different assumptions, one representing the present situation and the others positing efficiency improvements. In any case, the Ivorian project seems relatively expensive when compared with other projects, although the large actual and projected student enrollments reduce the per student costs to reasonable levels. The different stages in the process of program production and the interactions between the three principal actors in the process -- the producer, the printed support materials writer, and the director -- are described in detail. This forms an essential background to the consideration of four key program production issues. The system lacks sufficient organization and planning to ensure that even the most straightforward necessities of program production are accomplished. There has been inadequate training of Ivorians to take over the management and operation of the ETV Complex, planned for 1980. Efforts to set up a feedback and evaluation system have been impeded by the heavy demands of the production schedule. The fourth issue, film versus videotape, is nonproblematic, but is included for the benefit of other LDCs. The authors conclude that the basic ingredients for a good ETV program production system are in place, and now that the initial coverage of the full six grades of primary school is almost complete, more time should be devoted to making improvements in the efficiency with which the system operates before the system is further expanded. A 20-item bibliography of French- and English-language references (1967-76) is included.","PREPARED BY AED AND STANFORD UNIV. INST.

TO DATE, 25 INDIVIDUAL PROJECTS HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED FOR ASSISTANCE. FOR TEN OF THESE, CARE MATERIALS HAVE BEEN INSTALLED. HOWEVER, IT IS NOT CLEAR WHETHER ALL THE SYSTEMS TO WHICH CARE HAS CONTRIBUTED ARE AS YET DELIVERING SECURE WATER, NOR WHETHER THE PORTION OF THE SYSTEM WHICH CARE HAS SUPPLIED IS AS YET OPERATIONAL. CAREFUL EXAMINATION OF THE DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS PROJECT INDICATES THAT IT WAS NAIVELY DESIGNED AND IMPERFECTLY IMPLEMENTED AND THAT THE GOVERNMENT OF KENYA, CARE, AND USAID ARE IN ALMOST EQUAL MEASURE RESPONSIBLE FOR A NOBLE IMPULSE BEING UNDERMINED BY POOR MANAGEMENT. THE EFFORT TO MEET THE OBJECTIVE OF IMPLEMENTING THIRTY PROJECTS ANNUALLY HAS RESULTED IN A PROLIFERATION OF WIDELY-SCATTERED AND VERY DIFFERENT TYPES OF WATER SUPPLY PROJECTS, RENDERING MANAGERIAL CONTROL DIFFICULT AND COSTLY.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","8/1/1976 12:00:00 AM","","Rural development|Women in development|Water resources|Natural resource development","Kenya","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAI721.pdf","1,057 KB","000256 - American Technical Assistance Corp.

"THE NATIONAL MAIZE PLAN (NMP) APPEARS TO BE HANDLING THE LOGISTICAL PROBLEM OF SUPPLYING VILLAGES WITH INPUTS IN A REASONABLY ORGANIZED AND EFFICIENT WAY. THE PROGRAM WAS SUCCESSFUL IN TEACHING FARMERS ABOUT GOOD MAIZE PRODUCTION PRACTICES. HOWEVER, IN BOTH CONCEPTION AND IMPLEMENTATION, THE PROGRAM SUFFERS FROM SOME CRITICAL FLAWS. AT NO POINT IN THE PROGRAM IS SERIOUS CONDIDERATION GIVEN TO DEVELOPING A LOCAL CAPACITY TO CONTINUE THE PROJECT FUNCTIONS. AS IT NOW OPERATES, THE PROJECT REINFORCES A PATTERN OF PASSIVE VILLAGE DEPENDENCY ON THE GOVERNMENT. THE PROBLEMS CONNECTED WITH PAYING FOR INPUTS SHOULD BE CAREFULLY REVIEWED. THIS INCLUDES THE ECONMONIC RETURN TO INPUTS AT UNSUBSIDIZED PRICES, THE EXTENSION OF CREDIT, AND IMPROVING THE TRANSPORT AND MARKETING SYSTEMS. LOCAL PEOPLE AND LOCAL CONDITIONS MUST BE INCLUDED AS A CENTRAL CONSIDERATION OF THE PROJECT. RECOMMENDATIONS MADE TO FARMERS MUST BE LOCALLY APPROPRIATE. PACKAGE SALES MUST BE LOCALLY EVALUATED. THE LOCAL NEED FOR CREDIT SHOULD BE EVALUATED. THE EXTENSION EFFORT SHOULD BE ADOPTED TO LOCAL CONDITIONS. LOCAL PEOPLE MUST BE INVOLVED IN THE PLANNING AND OPERATION OF THE PROJECT.

"BASED ON NATIONAL FIGURES AND EVALUATORS' OBSERVATIONS, IT IS EVIDENT THAT IN TEN YEARS, THE MOROCCAN NATIONAL FAMILY PLANNING PROGRAM HAD ALMOST NO DEMOGRAPHIC EFFECT. ANY MODEST FALL IN THE BIRTH RATE IS MORE THE RESULT OF SOCIAL CHANGE THAN THE EXTENSION OF FAMILY PLANNING. THERE HAS BEEN SLIGHT PROGRESS; HOWEVER, THE BASIC FIGURES ARE SO LOW THAT IT IS MORE APPARENT THAN REAL. IN ADDITION, THE DROP-OUT RATE IN HIGH. ON THE POSITIVE SIDE, THERE IS POTENTIAL WITHIN THE IMPRESSIVE NATIONAL PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE FOR AN EFFECTIVE FAMILY PLANNING PROGRAM. THE PRINCIPAL PROBLEMS ARE: (1)A LACK OF PRIORITY EMPHASIS, (2)AN ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE WHICH FORESTALLS THE POSSIBILITY OF EFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT, AND (3)INSUFFICIENT INFORMATION, EDUCATIONAL MATERIALS, AND TRAINING. THE PRINCIPAL RECOMMENDATIONS ARE: (1)THAT THE GOVERNMENT OF MOROCCO (GOM) ASSIGN A HIGH PRIORITY TO FAMILY PLANNING WITHIN ITS INTEGRATED HEALTH DELIVERY SYSTEM; AND (2)THAT ONLY IF THE GOM ACTS QUICKLY TO INCREASE THE EMPHASIS ON FAMILY PLANNING SHOULD AID ASSIGN A HIGH PRIORITY TO THE REAL NEEDS OF THE PROGRAM.

"THE PURPOSE OF THE PROJECT WAS TO ACHIEVE A HIGH LEVEL OF NET OFFTAKE IN THE MASAI DISTRICT.

THERE IS LITTLE EVIDENCE THAT PRODUCTION INDICES SUCH AS INCREASED CALF DROPS, LARGER ANIMALS, YOUNGER ANIMALS BEING MARKETED, AND INCREASED NET OFFTAKE HAVE MATERIALIZED.

THE EVALUATORS MADE 21 RECOMMENDATIONS, INCLUDING: (1)THE CONTRACTOR FOR THE MASAI TEAM SHOULD BE CHANGED; (2)THE TRAINING PROGRAM SHOULD BE ACCELERATED; (3)THE PARTICIPANT TRAINING PROGRAM SHOULD BE MODIFIED; (4)THE RANGE MANAGEMENT CAPABILITY SHOULD BE EXPANDED TO BRING IT INTO BALANCE WITH THAT OF THE WATER COMPONENT; (5)THE SOCIOLOGICAL INPUTS SHOULD BE REDIRECTED TO PROVIDE A MEANS OF MONITORING PROGRESS AND CHANGE AMONG THE MASAI; AND (6)THE HYDROGEOLOGIST SHOULD GIVE PRIORITY TO IDENTIFYING PROMISING BOREHOLE SITES.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/afr-C-1207","","2/1/1976 12:00:00 AM","","Range management|Land tenure|Disease prevention and control|Animal diseases|LIVESTOCK|Animal husbandry|Participants|Water resources|Natural resource development|ANIMAL HEALTH","Tanzania","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAA541A1.pdf","5,053 KB","001469 - Utah State University","","","English","application/pdf","","","","Livestock","1 Feb 1976","","","","EVALUATION OF THE MASAI LIVESTOCK AND RANGE MANAGEMENT PROJECT","","PD-AAA-541-A1","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc0MDkw","Tanzania","6210093"
"THE EVALUATORS DISCUSS THEIR SCOPE OF WORK AND METHODOLOGY AND REVIEW: (1)THE RESEARCH STRATEGY, METHODS, INPUTS, AND OUTPUTS; (2)THE RESEARCH PROGRAM, MANPOWER RESOURCES AND DEVELOPMENT, AND ADMINISTRATION; AND (3)THE SECTOR GOAL AND PROJECT PURPOSE. AFTER CONSIDERABLE DELAY, THE PROJECT WAS STARTED UP IN 1973, SHORT OF PROGRAMMED INPUTS BUT WITH A SCIENTIFICALLY SOUND APPROACH.

"EVALUATES ENTENTE AFRICAN ENTERPRISES LOAN. THE LOAN WAS RAPIDLY AND WELL-DISBURSED DUE PRIMARILY TO ITS FLEXIBILITY AT THE LEVEL OF THE DEVELOPMENT BANK WHICH ENABLED THE BANK TO USE THIS MONEY WHERE OTHER CREDIT SOURCES WERE EXCLUDED. A HIGH PERCENTAGE OF THE LOAN WAS USED FOR WORKING CAPITAL, REFLECTING ONE OF THE GREAT NEEDS OF AFRICAN ENTERPRISES AND SUGGESTING THAT THE COMMERCIAL BANK SYSTEM BE INDUCED TO PROVIDE THIS CREDIT. HOWEVER, FEW GUIDELINES WERE ATTACHED TO THE LOAN, AND A LEARNING EXPERIENCE DEVELOPED WHICH THE ENTENTE FUND FAILED TO GENERALIZE ACROSS COUNTRIES. ABUSE OCCURRED DUE TO SELECTIVE ACCESS TO CHEAP CREDIT, WHICH SOME BANKS CHOSE NEITHER TO PASS ON LOWER INTEREST RATES TO THE ENTREPRENEUR, NOR TO PROVIDE EXTRA SERVICES EXPECTED OF THEM UNDER THE LOAN. IN ADDITION, DOLLAR PROCUREMENT WAS ABUSED, IN THAT LITTLE EQUIPMENT WAS ACQUIRED,SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE OF THE LOAN,WHILE TAX-FREE STATUS SPECIFIED IN THE LOAN AGREEMENT LED TO UNNECESSARY ABUSE. THE FOLLOWING RECOMMENDATIONS WERE MADE: 1)THE DEFINITION OF AFRICAN ENTERPRISE MUST BE MADE MORE RIGOROUS; 2)THE LOAN SHOULD BE GUIDED MORE TO SMALL AND MEDIUM ENTERPRISES; 3)GREATER USE SHOULD BE MADE OF THE RESOURCES; 4)BANKS SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO HIRE BANKING PERSONNEL USING INCOME FROM THE LOAN; 5)THE EXPERIMENTAL CHARACTER OF THE LOAN SHOULD BE MAINTAINED BY KEEPING GUIDELINES AS LOOSE AS POSSIBLE; 6) NO REQUIREMENT SHOULD BE MADE TO LOAN IN SPECIAL SECTORS; 7)PARTICIPATION IN FIRMS SHOULD BE CIRCUMSCRIBED TO PREVENT ABUSE IN TERMS OF APPROPRIATION OF EXPATRIATE ENTERPRISES; 8)SATEC ASSISTANCE MUST BE CONTINUED FOR THE NEXT YEAR; 9)THE REQUIREMENT FOR CODE 941 PROCUREMENT MUST BE ABOLISHED DUE TO DIFFICULTIES AND ABUSES; 10)ON CODE 941 PROCUREMENT, THE WORDING OF THE LOAN MUST BE CHANGED TO PERMIT THE ENTREPRENEUR TO PAY DUTIES AND TAXES; 11)CODE 935 PROCUREMENT REQUIREMENT ON NON-LOAN ASPECTS SHOULD BE ABOLISHED AND; 12)SPECIAL ACCOUNTS KEPT BY THE ENTENTE FUND TO REPAY THE LOAN SHOULD BE AUTHORIZED.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","2/1/1976 12:00:00 AM","","Institution building|Banks|CREDIT|ENTENTE LOAN|Economic planning|Fiscal policy","West Africa","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAA475A1.pdf","6,084 KB","002680 - USAID.

"Evaluates project performance from 1973 to 1978 in Botswana. Purpose of project is to assist the Government of Botswana (GOB) to develop socially acceptable range and livestock production/management models. Evaluation methodology based on interviews and onsite observations. Project has enjoyed little success.  Underestimation of the importance of sociological surveys and staff to conduct them have been the greatest reason for failure.  In each of three communities chosen to benefit by the project all or some of the following situations exist: 1. conflict between farmers and herders as to who may benefit from the project; 2. disputes between neighboring villages as to the grazing rights and boundaries; 3. lack of communication since communities chosen are minority groups speaking minor languages & having been little studied as to their origin, customs, etc; 4. lack of help from government officials who were unsure as to what their responsibilities were; and 5. lack of a sense of directn and skills among personnel. Other minor problems have been poor grass species for fodder production, equipment shortages, inadequate living conditions for staff at the beginning of the project, and delays in vehicle repairs.  It is believed that project may not be economically feasible even with the two year extension being suggested. Recommendations are to:  1. improve interaction between AID and the Botswana communities served by utilizing Peace Corps type volunteers, junior officers, and team members; 2. add a rural sociologist to the team; 3. place team in a coordinate position in the Department of Agriculture; 4. agree upon policies and guidelines governing the organization of communal groups; 5. provide better servicing of equipment; 6. study the economics; 7. find other forms of training for personnel; and 8. perform an early evaluation of the next program.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/afr-C-1140","","6/1/1976 12:00:00 AM","","Range management|Livestock","Botswana","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAA575A1.pdf","10,784 KB","000387 - Consortium for International Development (CID)","","","English","application/pdf","Evaluation team|Onsite evaluation","","","","1 Jun 1976","","","","EVALUATION OF THE BOTSWANA RANGE MANAGEMENT AND DEVELOPMENT USAID PROJECT NO. 690-11-130-015 (PART I)","","PD-AAA-575-A1","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc0MTAy","Southern Africa Regional","6900015"
"THIS IS THE SECOND OF A TWO-PART EVALUATION OF THE BOTSWANA RANGE MANAGEMENT AND DEVELOPMENT PROJECT. IT EXAMINES (A)THE CATTLE MARKETING SYSTEM AND HOW IT AFFECTS THE ACHIEVEMENT OF EQUITY FOR THE SMALL CATTLE HOLDER, AND (B)THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE BOTSWANA RANGE AND LIVESTOCK MANAGEMENT PROJECT AND OTHER DEVELOPMENT SUCH AS WORLD BANK LIVESTOCK II AND THE TRIBAL GRAZING ACT POLICY. IT ALSO DISCUSSES THE ORIGINS OF SKEWED CATTLE OWNERSHIP AND THE BACKGROUND AND FACTORS AFFECTING THE SKEWED MARKETING OF CATTLE. THE CHAPTER ENTITLED ""MARKETING SYSTEM AND ITS RELATION TO RANCHING DEVELOPMENT"" POINTS OUT THAT IF SMALL HOLDERS ARE TO BENEFIT FROM RANCHING DEVELOPMENT, THEY MUST HAVE AN EQUITABLE POSITION IN TH MARKETING SYSTEM. ALSO, THE COMMUNAL RANCHES NOW BEING DEVELOPED ARE PROVIDING A USEFUL SERVICE IN UNCOVERING PROBLEMS THAT WILL BE FACED ON A BROADER SCALE WHEN RANCHING DEVELOPMENT IS ACCELERATED. SOME OF THE MATTERS THAT SHOULD RECEIVE ATTENTION ARE: (1)PROBLEMS OF GROUP FORMATION INVOLVING THOSE WHO OCCUPY MARGINAL ECONOMIC STATUS; (2)THE QUESTION OF MAFISA'S CATTLE WHICH WILL CONTINUE TO PRESENT MANAGEMENT PROBLEMS AND ECONOMIC LOSSES FOR THE SMALL HOLDERS; (3)RELEVANT SAFEGUARDS IN RANCHING DEVELOPMENT TO ASSURE PARTICIPATION AND SECURITY FOR SMALL HOLDERS; AND (4)THE CONCEPT OF ALLOWING FOR PARTIAL RATHER THAN TOTAL PARTICIPATION.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/afr-C-1140","","6/1/1976 12:00:00 AM","","LIVESTOCK|Agricultural product marketing|Agricultural planning|Agricultural policy|Range management","Botswana","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAA432A1.pdf","1,151 KB","000387 - Consortium for International Development (CID)","","","English","application/pdf","","","","","1 Jun 1976","","","","EVALUATION OF THE BOTSWANA RANGE MANAGEMENT AND DEVELOPMENT (USAID) PROJECT NO. 690-11-130-015 (PART II)","","PD-AAA-432-A1","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc0MTAz","Southern Africa Regional","6900015"
"THE DENTAL HEALTH INTERNATIONAL (DHI) PROJECT HAS CREATED CONSIDERABLE POLITICAL AND GENERAL PUBLIC FAVOR. IT HAS NOT MADE SUBSTANTIVE CHANGES IN ORAL HEALTH, NOR WOULD SUCH A BRIEF EFFORT BE EXPECTED TO HAVE SUCH AN IMPACT. UNIFORM SUPPORT FOR THE CONCEPT INDICATES THAT PROGRAM MODIFICATIONS COULD LEAD TO LONG TERM EFFECTIVE RESULTS. THE CURRENT REQUIREMENT THAT THE PROJECT BE ECONOMICALLY SELF-SUFFICIENT HANDICAPS ACHIEVEMENT OF OBJECTIVES IN PREVENTION AND EDUCATION AND IN REACHING THE GREATEST POSSIBLE RURAL POPULATION. IT IS BETTER SUITED AS A DEMONSTRATION PROJECT TO DEFINE ORAL HEALTH NEEDS, TO DETERMINE METHODS FOR DENTAL SERVICE DELIVERY AND TO ELEVATE PUBLIC RECOGNITION OF ORAL HEALTH AS A LEGITIMATE SOCIAL CONCERN. THE OPPORTUNITY PRESENTED BY THE PROJECT TO COLLECT DATA THAT WILL BE ESSENTIAL TO RATIONAL DENTAL PROBLEM DEFINITION AND PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT HAS SO FAR BEEN OVERLOOKED. THE DHI GRANT SHOULD BE CONTINUED BECAUSE IT: (1)IS AN EXCELLENT DEMONSTRATION PROJECT; (2)HAS THE POTENTIAL TO PROVIDE IMPORTANT DATA; AND (3)IS RESPECTED AND APPRECIATED BY THE GOVERNMENTS WHO ARE UNABLE TO CARRY ON AN ORAL HEALTH PROGRAM WITH NATIONAL RESOURCES.

"WORK UNDER THE PRESENT CONTRACT SHOULD BE CONTINUED AS PROGRAMMED. SUBSEQUENT TO THE COMPLETION OF THE PROJECT, MAJOR EFFORT SHOULD BE PLANNED DEALING WITH PROGRAMS TO ASSIST SMALL FARMERS IN ON-FARM WATER MANAGEMENT IN CENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA. IN ADDITION, THE SOCIO-POLITICAL STUDIES UNDERWAY SHOULD BE CONTINUED, BUT RESTRUCTURED ALONG SOCIO-ECONOMIC AND IMPACT ASSESSMENT LINES. IT APPEARS THAT WORK ON EVAPOTRANSPIRATION SHOULD NOT HAVE SUCH HIGH PRIORITY IN THE FUTURE. EARLY WORK HAD A LARGER COMPONENT IN FIELD DEMONSTRATION OF IRRIGATION METHODS AND PRACTICES. HOWEVER, THE PROJECT HAS DRIFTED FROM THE GOAL OF IMPROVING ON-FARM WATER MANAGEMENT. MORE EMPHASIS ON ADAPTIVE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND ""HOW TO"" DEMONSTRATIONS SEEMS TO BE DESIRED.

"THIS REPORT DESCRIBES THE RESULTS OF APPLYING EVALUATION TECHNIQUES IN THE ""FIELD GUIDE FOR EVALUATION OF NUTRITION EDUCATION: AN EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH TO DETERMINATION OF EFFECTS ON FOOD BEHAVIOR IN LESSER DEVELOPED COUNTRIES"". THIS GUIDE WAS DEVELOPED BECAUSE AID CONCLUDED THAT AN EFFECTIVE MEANS FOR DETERMINING THE COST-EFFECTIVENESS OF EDUCATION AS IT RELATES TO FOOD BEHAVIOR WAS NECESSARY. THE GUIDE WAS FIELD-TESTED ON THREE PROGRAMS IN BRAZIL, ONE FOCUSING ON CLASSROOM EDUCATION, ONE USING A NONFORMAL EDUCATION APPROACH, AND ONE USING THE MASS MEDIA. THE REPORT DISCUSSES THE BASIC REQUIREMENTS FOR THE METHODOLOGY AND THE KEY ISSUES IN THE FIELD DEMONSTRATION: EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN; WHICH FOOD BEHAVIORS SHOULD BE MEASURED; QUANTIFICATION BY FREQUENCY VERSUS AMOUNT; CATEGORIZED VERSUS CONTINUOUS DATA CONCEPTS; AND GENERALIZABILITY TO MULTIPLE PROGRAM LEVELS. FIVE RECOMMENDATIONS DERIVED FROM THE DEVELOPMENTAL WORK, CONFERENCES WITH THE PANEL OF EXPERTS, AND EXPERIENCES IN THE FIELD DEMONSTRATION: (1)FURTHER FIELD APPLICATIONS SHOULD BE CARRIED OUT TO ENSURE THE UTILITY OF THE METHODOLOGY FOR COST-EFFECTIVENESS COMPARISONS; (2)AN OBJECTIVE OF FURTHER APPLICATIONS OF THE METHODOLOGY SHOULD BE THE DETERMINATION OF NEED FOR ALTERNATIVE AND LESS SOPHISTICATED METHODS, AND EXPLORATION OF POSSIBLE TECHNIQUES; (3)CONSIDERATION SHOULD BE GIVEN TO DEVELOPMENT OF SUPPLEMENTS TO THE FIELD GUIDE TO PROVIDE PROCEDURAL MODELS FOR MEASURES OF ADDITIONAL FOOD BEHAVIORS SUCH AS FOOD ACQUISITION, STORAGE, AND PREPARATION; (4)CONSIDERATION SHOULD BE GIVEN TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF A SUMMARY HANDBOOK FOR PROGRAM ADMINISTRATORS AND PLANNERS; AND (5)AID SHOULD PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO GOVERNMENTS AND TO VOLUNTARY AND INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS WHICH MAY REQUEST SUCH HELP IN EVALUATION OF THEIR NUTRITION EDUCATION PROGRAMS.

LIKEWISE, THE PERCENTAGE OF GRANTEES RECEIVING TRAINING IN THEIR OWN OR THIRD COUNTRIES INCREASED FURTHER IN FULFILLMENT OF ONE OF THE CONTRACT'S MANDATES. GRANTEES WERE RECRUITED IN 25 LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES AND CARIBBEAN ISLANDS AND WERE TRAINED IN THE USA, PUERTO RICO, AND 15 LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES AND THE CARIBBEAN.

"THE EVALUATORS DISCUSSED THE OBJECTIVES OF THE WORLD FERTILITY SURVEY (WFS), THE DIFFERENCES IN OBJECTIVES, INTERNATIONAL COMPARABILITY OF THE DATA GATHERED, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OF NATIONAL CAPACITIES. AS THE WFS PROJECT CONTINUES TO GROW IN COMPLEXITY, IT IS INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT THAT THE VARIOUS OBJECTIVES BE RANKED ACCORDING TO PRIORITY AND THAT THE FUTURE WORK PLANS RELFECT THIS RANKING. THE WFS WILL ACHIEVE QUITE GOOD COVERAGE, ASSUMING THAT INDIA AND MUCH OF AFRICA WILL BE INCLUDED. THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT OMISSIONS, BUT IT APPEARS AS IF THE INITIAL GOALS OF COUNTRY PARTICIPATION WILL BE MET. WITH NECESSARY CONSTRAINTS ON THE SIZE OF THE QUESTIONNAIRE, THE CONTENT OF THE QUESTIONNAIRES DOES INCLUDE THE MAJOR FACTORS AFFECTING FERTILITY. THE WFS HAS ALSO BEEN ABLE TO RESIST THE TEMPTATION TO ATTACH OTHER ITEMS,OF INTEREST FOR SOCIAL RESEARCH BUT SEEN AS HAVING ONLY MARGINAL EFFECT ON FERTILITY ANALYSIS. THE WSF HAS PLACED CONSIDERABLE EMPHASIS ON THE PRODUCTION OF HIGH-QUALITY SURVEYS. THE WFS STAFF IS AWARE OF THE LIMITATIONS OF SURVEY DATA, AND PLANS ARE UNDERWAY FOR AN EARLY ANALYSIS OF THE QUALITY OF THE DATA. FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF DEMOGRAPHY AND DEMOGRAPHIC ANALYSIS, THE WFS IS MAKING TWO MAJOR CONTRIBUTIONS: (1)THE DATA THAT ARE BEING PRODUCED WILL ADD SUBSTANTIALLY TO THE BODY OF KNOWLEDGE ABOUT FERTILITY PATTERNS; AND (2)THE WFS IS HELPING COORDINATE AND CENTRALIZE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON FERTILITY THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION WAS INITIALLY FORESEEN TO LAST THREE YEARS. IT NOW SEEMS UNLIKELY THAT THIS SCHEDULE CAN BE ADHERED TO, AND THE INTERNATIONAL STATISTICS INSTITUTE HAS SUGGESTED AN EXTENSION OF THE WFS TO MID-1982.

"AS OF JUNE 1976, 764 FELLOWS HAD BEEN TRAINED AT FOUR INSTITUTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PROGRAM FOR INTERNATIONAL EDUCATION IN GYNECOLOGY AND OBSTETRICS (PIEGO). TRAINEES CAME FROM EAST AND SOUTHEAST ASIA, THE INDIAN SOUTH CONTINENT, THE MIDDLE EAST, EAST AFRICA, AND LATIN AMERICA WITH LITTLE REPRESENTATION FROM NORTHERN AND WESTERN AFRICA.

BY RESTRICTING THE SCOPE OF PIEGO TO A MORE GENERALLY-BASED EDUCATIONAL EFFORT, PIEGO WILL BE ABLE TO OBTAIN ACCESS TO AND CONTINUING SUPPORT FROM THE MAJORITY OF THE MEDICAL SCHOOLS IN THE LESS-DEVELOPED COUNTRIES OF THE WORLD.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","9/1/1976 12:00:00 AM","","Medical education|Sterilization (birth control)|Physician education|OBSTETRICS|GYNECOLOGY","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAA502A1.pdf","902 KB","000262 - American Public Health Association","","","English","application/pdf","","","BURNHILL, MICHAEL S.|MOULDING, THOMAS S.|WINFIELD, GERALD F.","","17 Sep 1976","","","","EVALUATION OF THE PROGRAM FOR INTERNATIONAL EDUCATION IN GYNECOLOGY AND OBSTETRICS; JOHNS HORKINS PIEGO","","PD-AAA-502-A1","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc0NTIy","Population and Humanitarian Assistance","9320604"
"AIRLIE FOUNDATION HAS PRODUCED APPROXIMATELY 100 FILMS ON FAMILY PLANNING AND RELATED TOPICS FOR LATIN AMERICAN AND WORLDWIDE AUDIENCES. MOST OF THESE FILMS ARE GENERAL INFORMATIONAL AND MOTIVATIONAL FILMS, BUT A NUMBER ARE TECHNICAL AND FOR PROFESSIONAL AUDIENCES. THE MAJOR FINDING WAS THAT THE AIRLIE-PRODUCED FILMS ARE OF SUFFICIENT QUALITY TO FULFILL AIRLIE'S CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS. THEY EXCELLED IN TECHNICAL QUALITY BUT DREW VARYING COMMENTS ON THEIR CONTENT. IN GENERAL TERMS, THE MORE SOPHISTICATED THE AUDIENCE, THE MORE CRITICAL THE COMMENTS, LESS SOPHISTICATED PERSONS WERE ALMOST ALWAYS FAVORABLY IMPRESSED, AND MANY FAMILY PLANNING AGENCY STAFF MEMBERS FELT THE FILMS WERE BEST USED FOR GENERAL AUDIENCES IN CONJUNCTION WITH MOTIVATIONAL AND EDCUATIONAL MEETINGS. BECAUSE LESS SOPHISTICATED AUDIENCES APPEAR TO BE MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO INFORMATION CONTAINED IN FILMS, IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT THIS INFORMATION BE COMPREHENSIVE AND ACCURATE. ANOTHER MAJOR FINDING WAS THAT THE DISTRIBUTION AND UTILIZATION OF THE FILMS HAVE NOT BEEN WELL CONCEIVED OR COORDINATED. THERE IS A CONTINUING NEED FOR SPANISH-LANGUAGE FAMILY PLANNING FILMS PRODUCED IN LATIN AMERICA AND DIRECTED TOWARD LATIN AMERICAN AUDIENCES. PEOPLE NOW SAY THEY WANT SPECIFIC INFORMATION ON BIRTH CONTROL METHODS AND RELATED FAMILY PLANNING SUBJECTS. MOTIVATION IS NOT AS RELEVANT AS IT WAS IN 1971, WHEN THE ORIGINAL CONTRACT WAS WRITTEN. AND ALTHOUGH THE COUNTRY-SPECIFIC FILMS ARE GENERALLY LIKED BETTER THAT THE REGIONAL FILMS, THE EVALUATORS BELIEVE THAT IT WOULD BE MORE COST-EFFECTIVE TO PRODUCE REGIONAL FILMS, ESPECIALLY FOR TECHNICAL AND SEMI-TECHNICAL SUBJECTS. IT WOULD APPEAR THAT THE ABILITY OF A GIVEN FILM TO EFFECTIVELY COMMUNICATE ITS SUBJECT MATTER WOULD BE SIGNIFICANTLY ENHANCED BY A MORE RESTRICTED DEFINITION OF THE INTENDED TARGET AUDIENCE. THE EVALUATORS MADE 2L RECOMMENDATIONS ABOUT PLANNING, PRODUCTION, DISTRIBUTION, AND EVALUATION.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","12/1/1976 12:00:00 AM","","FAMILY PLANNING|Family planning education|Family planning occupations|Medical education|Sterilization (birth control)|Audiovisual educational materials|Nonprint media","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAA519A1.pdf","4,594 KB","000709 - Juarez and Associates, Inc.","","","English","application/pdf","","","","","18 Dec 1976","","","","EVALUATION OF AIRLIE FOUNDATION FILM PRODUCTION; A FINAL REPORT","","PD-AAA-519-A1","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc0NTI4","Population and Humanitarian Assistance","9320953"
"IN GENERAL, THE EVALUATORS VIEWED WITH SATISFACTION THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF THE PROGRAM OF INTERNATIONAL TRAINING AND RESEARCH IN FAMILY PLANNING INFORMATION, EDUCATION AND COMMUNICATION OF THE COMMUNITY AND FAMILY STUDY CENTER (CGSC) OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO. AFTER FIVE YEARS OF OPERATION, THE PROGRAM APPEARS TO HAVE ACCOMPLISHED MOST OF THE TASKS IT ORIGINALLY SET OUT TO DO. THE CFSC HAD 7 FUNCTIONAL GOALS CONCERNING: (1)GRADUATE DEGREE PROGRAMS; (2)SUMMER WORKSHOPS; (3)NON-DEGREE SHORT-TERM PROGRAMS; (4)PUBLICATIONS AND MATERIALS; (5)A COMMUNICATION WITH FAMILY PLANNING PROGRAMS IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES; (6)SPECIAL SEMINARS; AND (7)A COMMUNICATION LABORATORY. ALTHOUGH THE NUMBER OF GRADUATES IN THE GRADUATE PROGRAM IS LESS THAN PLANNED, VIRTUALLY ALL HAVE RETURNED TO POPULATION-RELATED WORK IN THEIR HOME COUNTRIES. SUMMER WORKSHOPS ARE THE OLDEST FACET OF THE CFSC PROGRAM. THEY HAVE SERVED MORE THAN 1100 PARTICIPANTS SINCE 1963 FROM 80 COUNTRIES AND HAVE GAINED A STRONG REPUTATION AMONG FAMILY PLANNING PROFESSIONALS AROUND THE WORLD. THE SEMINARS AND WORKSHOPS HAVE BEEN VALUABLE IN BRINGING TOGETHER MEDIA SPECIALISTS AND OFFICIALS WORKING IN THE FAMILY PLANNING PROGRAMS AND MAKING THEM AWARE OF THE NEED FOR GREATER COLLABORATION. THE GENERAL REACTION TO THE PUBLICATIONS WAS THAT THEY WERE USEFUL IN GIVING BROAD GUIDELINES FOR DECISION AND ACTION. THE EVALUATORS ENCOURAGED CFSC TO CONTINUE ITS PRACTICE OF CONDUCTING RESEARCH AS A TOOL FOR DECISION-MAKING AND NOT SIMPLY FOR ITS OWN SAKE. THE SPECIAL CONFERENCES AND SEMINARS ARE A MOST IMPORTANT ASPECT FOR CONTINUOUS REVITALIZATION OF THE PROGRAM. THE ASPECT OF COMMUNICATION WITH DEVELOPING COUNTRIES IS A RECENT AND DYNAMIC PRACTICE THAT PROVIDES VALUABLE FEEDBACK. THE EVALUATORS MADE FIFTEEN PROJECT-SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS INCLUDING THAT CONTINUATION OF THE PROJECT FOR AN ADDITIONAL THREE TO FIVE YEARS BE SERIOUSLY CONSIDERED.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","8/1/1976 12:00:00 AM","","Family planning education|Family planning|Information storage and retrieval systems|Pamphlets|Family planning occupations|Medical education|Family planning research","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAA520A1.pdf","2,243 KB","000262 - American Public Health Association","","","English","application/pdf","","","FELICIANO, GLORIA|SHANAWANY, HAIFAA|CRAWFORD, ROBERT","","18 Aug 1976","","","","EVALUATION REPORT ON TRAINING AND RESEARCH ACTIVITIES IN POPULATION COMMUNICATION AND EDUCATION (AID/CSD/3314)","","PD-AAA-520-A1","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc0NTI5","Population and Humanitarian Assistance","9320958"
"THE MOST SIGNIFICANT SHORTCOMING OF THE PROGRAM AT THIS TIME IS THE LACK OF AN EFFECTIVE STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN GEARED TO CREATING CONSUMER DEMAND. IF THE PROGRAM IS TO SUCCEED, A COMMERCIAL DEMAND CREATION, MARKETING, AND CONTRACEPTIVE DISTRIBUTION PROGRAM MUST BE DEVELOPED, TESTED, AND IMPLEMENTED WITH DELIBERATE SPEED. DEMAND FOR BIRTH CONTROL SERVICES HAS STABILIZED AT A VERY LOW LEVEL. CONTRACEPTIVE ACCEPTANCE RATES ARE THE SAME AS THEY WERE IN 1968. ALL AVAILABLE WAREHOUSE SPACE AND ALL DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS ARE FILLED TO CAPACITY. MORE OUTLETS AT THE RETAIL LEVEL ARE NEEDED TO ABSORB THIS SUPPLY. PRESENT MARKETING EFFORTS IN SUPPORT OF THE INUNDATION PROGRAM ARE DEVOID OF STRATEGY, IMPROPERLY UTILIZE THE MEDIA CHANNELS, LACK APPROPRIATE POINT OF SALES MATERIALS, AND DO NOT STIMULATE CONSUMER DEMAND. THERE IS PRESENTLY UNDERWAY A HIGHLY EFFECTIVE STUDY OF COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION OF CONTRACEPTIVES THROUGH THE COMMERCIAL SECTOR, EMPLOYING SUCH FAMILIAR TACTICS AS ATTITUDINAL ASSESSMENT, PACKAGING, AND MARKETING TECHNIQUES DESIGNED TO GET SHOPKEEPERS TO BECOME SALES AGENTS. THE EVALUATOR DISCUSSED CURRENT CONSUMER ATTITUDES, THE COMMERCIAL DELIVERY SYSTEM, AND NEW PROGRAM MANAGEMENT NEEDS. HE MADE ELEVEN RECOMMENDATIONS INCLUDING THAT: (1)A PUBLIC OPINION RESEARCH PROJECT BE UNDERTAKEN; (2)A COMMERCIALLY-RUN CONTRACEPTIVE DISTRIBUTION AND MARKETING SYSTEM BE TESTED, MODIFIED AND IMPLEMENTED; AND (3)THE FAMILY PLANNING EFFORT BE NATIONALIZED.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/pha/C-1100","","8/1/1976 12:00:00 AM","","Contraceptive agents and devices|FAMILY PLANNING|Condoms|Oral contraceptives|Contraceptive distribution","Pakistan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAZ243.pdf","614 KB","000262 - American Public Health Association","","000148 - USAID.

"THE HAITIAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY HELP ORGANIZATION (HACHO) HAS THREE MAJOR FUNCTIONAL AREAS; MEDICAL; COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT; AND AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT. A SURVEY INDICATES THAT ALMOST 80 PERCENT OF AREA RESIDENTS HAVE RECEIVED IMPORTANT BENEFITS FROM PROJECTS UNDERTAKEN BY THE HACHO SERVICES. HACHO DEVOTES MORE RESOURCES TO THE MEDICAL SERVICE THAN TO ANY OTHER. WHILE THE AREA HAS BENEFITED GREATLY FROM THESE SERVICES, THEY COULD BE MADE MORE EFFICIENT. THE MEDICAL FACILIITES, THE OUTPATIENT FACILITIES, THE INPATIENT HOSPITAL SERVICES, AND THE DENTAL FACILITES ARE INADEQUATELY USED. WHILE THE NUTRITION CENTERS DO A GOOD JOB OF FEEDING NOURISHING MEALS TO THE CHILDREN ENROLLED, MANY PROBLEMS EXIST. COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT SERVICES ARE HACHO'S BROADEST ACTIVITY. THEY INCLUDE CONSTRUCTION OF POTABLE WATER SYSTEMS, ROAD CONSTRUCTION AND MAINTENANCE, AND COMMUNITY COUNCILS. THE ROADS HAVE LINKED THE AREA TO THE REST OF THE NATION AND HAVE STIMULATED THE GROWTH OF REGIONAL MARKETS. THEY ARE FUNDAMENTAL TO THE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OF THE REGION. HACHO IS CURRENTLY WORKING WITH 129 COMMUNITY COUNCILS. HACHO FIELD WORKERS BELIEVE THAT ABOUT 80 PERCENT OF THEM ARE WORKING EFFECTIVELY OR AT LEAST ACCEPTABLY. THE DIRECT IMPACT OF HACHO ON AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTIVITY HAS BEEN SLIGHT. A SURVEY INDICATES THAT, EXCLUSIVE OF FOOD COMMODITY PAYMENTS, ONLY 2.0 PERCENT HAVE BEEN SIGNIFICANTLY BENEFITED BY HACHO'S AGRICULTURAL ACTIVITIES. THE MAJOR IMPEDIMENT TO A SUCCESSFUL AGRICULTURAL PROGRAM IS THE LACK OF A WELL-DEFINED AND JUSTIFIED AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PLAN. THE EVALUATORS MADE 36 RECOMMENDATIONS ABOUT MEDICAL SERVICES, ROAD CONSTRUCTION AND MAINTENANCE, AGRICULTURE, AND COMMUNITY COUNCILS. THEY BELIEVE HACHO SHOULD BE RETAINED AS AN AUTONOMOUS REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT ORGANIZATION, BUT THAT ITS PRIORITIES SHOULD BE REORDERED AND THE ORGANIZATION RESTRUCTURED.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","10/1/1976 12:00:00 AM","","Rural development|Mobile health services|Hospitals|Maternal child health care|Dental care|Community development|Road construction|IRRIGATION|Educational facilities|Building construction|Sanitation","Haiti","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAA461A1.pdf","13,551 KB","","","","English","application/pdf","","","GOW, DAVID D.|JUD, G.

"IN THE FACE OF SIGNIFICANT OBSTACLES, THE CONSULTANT HAS BEEN PARTIALLY SUCCESSFUL IN THE INSTITUTION BUILDING OF THE SEPRRN (SERVICE D'ENTRETIEN PERMANENT DU RESEAU ROUTIER NATIONAL) ORGAINZATION. SEPRRN IS NOW PREPARED TO SOME EXTENT TO CARRY OUT ITS ASSIGNMENTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES. THE CONTRACTOR HAS COMPLIED WITH OR IS WELL ADVANCED IN COMPLETING A NUMBER OF THE SPECIFIC TASKS LISTED ON THE 1973 SCOPE OF WORK, SPECIFICALLY PREPARATION AND PRESENTATION OF TRAINING MANUALS, ARCHITECTURAL PLANS, SPECIFICATIONS, AND ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES. IN OTHER AREAS WHICH ARE MORE DIFFICULT TO MEASURE, THE CONSULTANT SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN LESS EFFECTIVE. CERTAIN APPARENT WEAKNESSES IN TEAM CHARACTERISTICS, PROCEDURES, AND METHODS COULD BE ALTERED TO RESULT IN GREATER EFFECTIVENESS. ALTHOUGH LIMITED MAINTENANCE IS BEING PROVIDED ON SOME SEGMENTS OF THE NATIONAL SYSTEM, MUCH OF THE WORK IS IMPROVEMENTS TO BADLY DETERIORATED SEGMENTS OF ROAD RATHER THAN THE NORMALLY ACCEPTED DEFINITION OF MAINTENANCE. THE PRODUCTIVITY OF THE WORK CREWS IS EXTREMELY LIMITED. EXTERNAL ADVISORS AREINVOLVED IN AN EXTENSIVE NUMBER OF MANAGERIAL FUNCTIONS. IF PROBLEMS RELATING TO WORK CREWS, EQUIPMENT AND SUPERVISION  CAN BE OVERCOME, THERE IS NO APPARENT REASON WHY WORK CAPACITY COULD NOT BE INCREASED ASSUMING THE BUDGET IS ADEQUATE. CONSULTANT CORRESPONDENCE INDICATES THAT, WITH FEW EXCEPTIONS, SEPRRN-CONDUCTED INSTRUCTION HAS NOT BEEN EFFECTIVE, MOSTLY BECAUSE OF POOR TRAINING DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION. WITH REGARD TO THE LABOR-EQUIPMENT MIX, A REVIEW OF SEPRRN'S MAINTENANCE ACTIVITIES INDICATES THAT, UNDER THE PRESENT WORK CREW ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE, A PRACTICAL RATIO IS BEING UTILIZED.

"THIS IS AN EXPERIMENTAL PROJECT WHICH IS SEEKING TO TEST AN INNOVATIVE GROUP-LENDING CONCEPT. WHEN THE PROJECT WAS DESIGNED, IT WAS ACKNOWLEDGED THAT IT WOULD HAVE TO BE ADJUSTED ON THE BASIS OF ACQUIRED EXPERIENCE. THIS REPORT IS PART OF THAT PROCESS. THE REPORT IS DIVIDED INTO THREE PARTS: (1)A DESCRIPTION OF THE EVALUATION METHODOLOGY; (2)THE FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE EVALUATORS; AND (3)A MORE DETAILED PRESENTATION OF THE INFORMATION USED BY THE ASSESSMENT TEAM IN REACHING ITS BASIC CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS. THE BUREAU DE CREDIT AGRICOLE (BCA) HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN TAKING THE FIRST IMPORTANT STEPS TOWARD THE CREATION OF A CREDIT DELIVERY SYSTEM CAPABLE OF REACHING AND SERVICING SMALL COFFEE FARMERS IN HAITI. HOWEVER, BCA'S ACCOMPLISHMENTS FALL SHORT OF THE TARGETS ESTABLISHED FOR THE FIRST TWO YEARS OF THE PROJECT. THIS FAILURE IS TO A SIGNIFICANT DEGREE DUE TO CONDITIONS BEYOND THE CONTROL OF BCA. THE PERFORMANCE OF BCA IN IMPLEMENTING THE PROJECT THUS FAR COMES VERY CLOSE TO WHAT THE TEAM WOULD HAVE CONSIDERED TO BE REALISTIC EXPECTATIONS. THE ASSESSMENT TEAM IDENTIFIED SERIOUS FLAWS IN THE ORIGINAL DESIGN OF THE PROJECT WHICH WOULD INDICATE THAT SEVERAL OF THE PROJECT PURPOSES COULD NEVER HAVE BEEN ATTAINED. IN ADDITION, IT HAS FOUND THAT UNEXPECTED CHANGES IN SOME OF THE ASSUMPTIONS MADE FOR PROJECTION PURPOSES HAVE BEEN EXPERIENCED DURING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROJECT. THESE FINDINGS LED TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THE PROJECT MUST BE SUBJECTED TO VERY SUBSTANTIAL REDESIGN. UNDER PRESENT CONDITIONS, THE PROJECT WOULD NOT REACH THE SERVICE TARGETS PROJECTED, AND MOST DEFINITELY, FINANCIAL VIABILITY WOULD NOT BE ATTAINED AS ORIGINALLY PROJECTED. THE EVALUATORS DISCUSSED THE FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO THE NEED FOR PROJECT REDESIGN, THE ISSUES TO BE RESOLVED, AND ALTERNATIVE STRATEGIES FOR THE PROJECT.

"INVIERNO (INSTITUTO DE BIENESTAR CAMPESINO) IS SERVING CLOSE TO 4500 SOCIOS THROUGH FIVE CEDE'S (CENTRO DE DESARROLLO) IN REGION V WITH A COMPREHENSIVE PROGRAM OF CREDIT, TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE, INPUTS AND MARKETING ASSISTANCE. LIMITED PROGRESS IS ALSO BEING MADE IN MOC (MOTIVATION-ORGANIZATION-CAPACITATION) ACTIVITIES RELATED TO COMMUNITY PROGRAMS, AND SEVERAL PILOT ACTIVITIES ARE UNDERWAY. CONTRACTS HAVE BEEN SIGNED TO BEGIN WORK IN MARKETING, APPLIED RESEARCH, MUNICIPAL DEVELOPMENT, LAND SALE GUARANTY, AND ACCESS ROADS EFFORTS. CONTRACTS ARE PENDING FOR HEALTH AND HOUSING ACTIVITIES. INVIERNO MET, EXCEEDED, OR CAME VERY CLOSE TO MEETING ALL IMPORTANT INPUT TARGETS AND SOME OUTPUT TARGETS IN ITS FIRST YEAR OF OPERATION. THE ENTIRE OPERATIONAL SYSTEM IS VERY EFFECTIVE. ALTHOUGH IT IS NOT COMPLETELY FUNCTIONAL, NOR HAS IT COMPLETED A TOTAL ANNUAL CYCLE, THE EVALUATORS ARE CONFIDENT THAT REMAINING WORK ON THE SYSTEM WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED, AND THAT IT WILL BE EXPANDED. THE EVALUATORS MADE MANY SUGGESTIONS ABOUT POSSIBLE IMPROVEMENTS AND CHANGES TO THE SYSTEM. THEIR FOUR SIGNIFICANT RECOMMENDATIONS ARE: (1)INVIERNO SHOULD CAREFULLY ANALYZE THE IMPLICATIONS AND PROCESS OF ""GRADUATION"", (2)INVIERNO SHOULD RESIST BOTH INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL EFFORTS TO EXPAND INTO NEW PROGRAMS OR NEW AREAS BEFORE IT HAS REASONED CONFIDENCE IN ITS ABILITY TO DO SO; (3)A SENIOR LEVEL CREDIT COMMITTEE SHOULD REVIEW ALL LOAN AUTHORIZATION OVER $10,000 AND EMIT ITS OPINION BEFORE DISBURSEMENT; AND (4)INVIERNO SHOULD PLACE A CEILING ON THE AMOUNT OF A LOAN MADE TO A FARMER FOR A SINGLE CROPPING SEASON.

"THE MATERNAL AND CHILD HEALTH AIDE (MCHA) TRAINING PROGRAM IS A WELL-DESIGNED AND CLEARLY FOCUSSED PROJECT. ALTHOUGH A YEAR BEHIND THE ORIGINAL AMBITIOUS SCHEDULE, IT HAS ALREADY RESULTED IN A SUBSTANTIAL EXPANSION OF THE CAPABILITY OF THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH TO EXTEND MCH (MATERNAL AND CHILD HEALTH) SERVICES TO TANZANIA'S RURAL POPULATION. FOURTEEN OF THE EIGHTEEN TRAINING CENTERS PLANNED HAVE BEEN OPENED. THE TRAINEE TARGETS ARE REALISTIC AND WILL MAKE TRAINED MCH PERSONNEL AND SERVICES ACCESSIBLE TO 90% OF THE RURAL POPULATION BY THE EARLY 1980'S. THE TANZANIA GOVERNMENT IS GIVING TOP PRIORITY TO PREVENTIVE HEALTH IN ITS TOTAL HEALTH PROGRAM, AND MCH IS GIVEN THE HIGHEST PRIORTIY AMONG ALL PREVENTIVE SERVICES. COOPERATION AMONG ALL OFFICIALS INVOLVED HAS BEEN GOOD. THE DEGREE OF EMPHASIS ON SUPPORT TO THE MCHA TRAINING PROGRAM VARIES FROM AREA TO AREA. WITH FEW EXCEPTIONS, THE COOPERATION OF MCHA SCHOOL STAFF AND THE NEARBY DISTRICT HOSPITAL STAFF APPEARED EXCELLENT. THE PLANNED UPGRADING COURSE FOR MCH PUBLIC HEALTH NURSES IS OF HIGHEST PRIORITY BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF ADEQUATE NUMBERS OF TRAINED NURSES WITH MCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH SKILLS. THROUGH FY 1976, OBLIGATIONS UNDER THIS PROJECT HAVE FUNDED THE CONSTRUCTION AND EQUIPPING OF THE EIGHTEEN SCHOOLS, TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE, PARTICIPANT TRAINING, EQUIPPING OF RURAL HEALTH FACILITIES, AND RECURRING COSTS WHICH WILL BE TAKEN OVER BY THE TANZANIAN GOVERNMENT. THE MCHA TRAINING PROGRAM CURRICULUM IS CONSIDERED TO BE APPROPRIATE FOR PREPARING THE MCHA'S TO WORK IN A RURAL SETTING. THE EVALUATORS DISCUSSED AND MADE 19 RECOMMENDATIONS ABOUT TANZANIA, US AND OTHER DONOR SUPPORT TO THE MCHA TRAINING PROJECT; AND THE CURRICULUM, STUDENT SELECTION, SCHOOL STAFF, FIELD PRACTICE, PHYSICAL FACILITIES, AND PARTICIPANT TRAINING ASPECTS OF THE PROGRAM.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","7/1/1976 12:00:00 AM","","Maternal child health care|Health facilities|Clinics|Participants|Medical education","Tanzania","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAA546A1.pdf","1,939 KB","000262 - American Public Health Association","","","English","application/pdf","","","KAISI, M.|MINKLER, DONALD H.|et al.","","9 Jul 1976","","","","EVALUATION REPORT; MCHA TRAINING PROJECT; TANZANIA","","PD-AAA-546-A1","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc0NTQx","Tanzania","6210121"
"WITHOUT STRONG SUPERVISION AND CENTRALIZED RESPONSIBILITY AT THE BEGINNING OF FIELD OPERATIONS IN 1971, THE PROJECT TOOK DIFFERENT COURSES IN THE THREE COUNTRIES CONCERNED. APPROXIMATELY 75 HEALTH COMMITTEES WERE ORGANIZED IN RURAL VILLAGES ALTHOUGH PROBABLY LESS THAN HALF OF THESE REMAIN ACTIVE. A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF NURSES, DISPENSARY ATTENDANTS, ITINERANT HEALTH WORKERS AND OTHER LOW-AND-MID-LEVEL HEALTH WORKERS WERE PROVIDED SPECIAL REFRESHER TRAINING IN HEALTH EDUCATION. DEMONSTRATION HEALTH CENTER STAFF EDUCATION PROGRAMS WERE INITIATED IN CHAD WITH APPARENT CONTINUITY, AND IN THE CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC ONLY TO BE DISCONTINUED. ALTHOUGH SIGNIFICANT TIME, EFFORT AND MONEY WENT INTO THE PRODUCTION OF HEALTH EDUCATION MATERIALS, LITTLE OF LASTING VALUE WAS DEVELOPED. OCEAC'S (ORGANIZATION FOR THE CONTROL OF ENDEMIC DISEASES IN CENTRAL AFRICA) PARTICIPATION IN THE PROJECT FROM THE BEGINNING HAS BEEN A MATTER OF CONVENIENCE DESIGNED TO MEET AID'S REQUIREMENTS. PERHAPS ONE OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL, ALTHOUGH INTANGIBLE ASPECTS OF THE PROJECT, HAS BEEN THE INTRODUCTION OF HEALTH EDUCATION CONCEPTS TO BOTH THE TOP POLICY AND MANAGEMENT LEVEL OF MINISTRIES OF HEALTH AND TO OPERATIONAL-LEVEL HEALTH WORKERS IN HEALTH CENTERS AND DISPENSARIES. HOWEVER, WHETHER OR NOT HEALTH EDUCATION ACTIVITIES WILL CONTINUE AS A PART OF HEALTH SERVICES IS UNCERTAIN. IN SUMMARY, THE GREATEST VALUES OF THIS PROJECT LIE IN ITS INTRODUCTION OF THE HEALTH EDUCATION CONCEPT TO HEATLH WORKERS IN THREE COUNTRIES, THE TRAINING OF A SMALL GROUP OF NATIONAL COUNTERPARTS, AND, MOST OF ALL, IN THE NEGATIVE LESSONS FROM THE CONCEPTION, DEVELOPMENT, OPERATION, AND EVALUATION OF THIS PROJECT. THE THREE SIGNIFICANT PROJECT AREAS IN WHICH MISTAKES WERE MADE ARE: (1)THE CONCEPT OF HEALTH EDUCATION; (2)THE RELATIONSHIP AND UNDERSTANDINGS WITH THE HOST GOVERNMENT; AND (3)THE PROJECT ITSELF -- ITS DESIGN, OBJECTIVES, RESOURCES, OPERATION, AND EVALUATION.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","8/1/1976 12:00:00 AM","","Community health care|Community participation|Medical education|Curriculum|Health education|Educational materials|Manuals and handbooks|Teacher training|Health care planning|Health policy|Public health care|Rural areas|Health workers|Nursing education|Community health workers","Central Africa|West Africa","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAA551A1.pdf","3,729 KB","","","","English","application/pdf","","","FURST, WALTER C.|DYER, ROBERT|CONWELL, DONALD","","27 Aug 1976","","","","REPORT OF EVALUATION OF REGIONAL PUBLIC HEALTH TRAINING PROJECT (625-11-540-510); CENTRAL WEST AFRICA","","PD-AAA-551-A1","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc0NTQy","Sahel Regional","6250510"
"CERFER (CENTRE REGIONAL DE FORMATION POUR L'ENTRETIEN ROUTIER) IS AN OPERATIONAL AND REASONABLY SELF-SUFFICIENT AFRICAN HEAVY EQUIPMENT AND ROAD MAINTENANCE TRAINING CENTER. CERFER'S SOLE AND LIMITED PURPOSE IS TO PREPARE MECHANICS, FOREMEN, AND WAREHOUSE/MAINTENANCE PERSONNEL IN PRACTICAL SKILLS FOR THEIR DAY-TO-DAY JOBS ON SECONDARY ROAD EQUIPMENT. HEAVY EQUIPMENT OPERATORS ARE NO LONGER TRAINED AT CERFER. CERFER IS CAPABLE OF TRAINING APPROXIMATELY 160 STUDENTS ANNUALLY AND COULD PROBABLY TRAIN UP TO 180. CERFER HAS A SUFFICENTLY BRIGHT FINANCIAL OUTLOOK TO CONTINUE WITHOUT AID ASSISTANCE. ITS OPERATIONAL BUDGET WILL BE COVERED BY REVENUES FROM THE ENTENTE STATES; ITS INVESTMENT BUDGET FROM NON-ENTENTE STUDENTS FINANCED BY OTHER AFRICAN COUNTRIES, OUTSIDE DONORS, AND, AS NEEDED, BY SERVICES RENDERED. THE TECHNIQUES USED BY CERFER TO ACHIEVE AFRICANIZATION MAY HAVE VALIDITY FOR SIMILAR TRANSFERS OF RESPONSIBILITIES IN ANALOGOUS SITUATIONS. DURING THE ENTIRE PERIOD, CERFER GRADUATED 1,370 STUDENTS, 919 OF THEM BETWEEN 1970 AND 1976. WITH MINOR EXCEPTIONS, EVERY IMPORTANT SPECIFIC ACTION PROPOSED IN 1974 AND 1975 HAS BEEN TAKEN: AFRICANIZATION OF CERFER STAFF; EFFECTIVE OPERATIONAL AND BUDGETARY CONTROLS; INSTALLATION OF EQUIPMENT-USE AND PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE SYSTEMS; REPAIR AND SALE OF USABLE EQUIPMENT; EVALUATION OF THE MOBILE UNIT CONCEPT; REVISION OF COURSES TO MAKE THEM MORE PRACTICAL; AND PROMPT PAYMENT OF CONTRIBUTIONS BY THE ENTENTE STATES. THE EVALUATORS MADE 8 RECOMMENDATIONS REGARDING PLANNING AND IMPLEMENTATION OF SIMILAR PROJECTS IN THE FUTURE AS WELL AS RECOMMENDATIONS FOR CERFER'S FUTURE ACTIVITIES AND ADMINISTRATION.

"THIS REPORT IS PHASE I OF A TWO-PHASE EVALUATION. THE FY76 ACCELERATED IMPACT PROGRAM (AIP) HAD EXPERIENCED DIFFICULTIES AND WAS BEHIND SCHEDULE DESPITE SUBSTANTIAL ADVANCE PLANNING AND THE WIDESPREAD DISSEMINATION OF THE AID CRITERIA AND DETAILED PROCEDURES. AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 1976, ONLY $2.3 MILLION OF THE $5 MILLION PROGRAMMED WAS OBLIGATED FOR 17 ACTIVITIES IN 5 OF THE SAHEL COUNTRIES. DESPITE EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE WITH SIMILAR SAHEL R&R PROCEDURES AND LENGTHY PREPARATIONS FOR THE AIP PROGRAM, IT WAS PERHAPS OVERAMBITIOUS TO EXPECT $5 MILLION IN OBLIGATIONS WITHIN A NINE-MONTH PERIOD. AIP WAS A NEW PROGRAM REQUIRING MORE DELIBERATE AND INTENSIVE DESIGN EFFORTS THAT R&R AND ALSO A CONSIDERABLY LARGER AID/W ROLE IN REVIEW, PROCESSING AND MONITORING. AIP PROGRAM DELAYS AND DEFICIENCIES WERE ATTRIBUTABLE TO TWO MAIN FACTORS: (1)VAGUENESS AND CONFUSION ABOUT AIP CRITERIA; AND (2)INADEQUATE DETAIL IN THE A-PID SUBMISSIONS. ALTHOUGH A SMALL NUMBER OF APPROVED AIP ACTIVITIES DID CONFORM TO THE LIMITS ORIGINALLY PROPOSED, I.E., PILOT, START-UP OR INNOVATIVE, THE BULK OF APPROVED ACTIVITIES FOR FY76 APPEARD TO FIT MORE NEARLY WITH IN THE EARLIER IMMEDIATE IMPACT CRITERIA FOR THE R&R PROGRAM FRAMEWORK. FOR FY77, HOWEVER, AFR/SFWA MISSIONS HAVE INDICATED THAT PILOT AND START-UP ACTIVITIES ARE APPROPRIATE TO THE SAHEL DEVELOPMENTAL SITUATION. THE EVALUATORS BELIEVE THE BASIC AIP PROGRAM OBJECTIVES AND CORRESPONDING CRITERIA REMAIN SOUND AND VALID. ORIGINALLY, ONE-TIME AFR/W APPROVAL OF DISAPPROVAL WAS TO BE BASED UPON THE REVIEW AND PROCESSING OF THE A-PID. HOWEVER, THE A-PID'S DID NOT CONTAIN SUFFICIENT INFORMATION AND THE REVIEW AND APPROVAL PROCESS STRETCHED OVER SEVERAL MONTHS.

"THE AGRICULTURAL PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT PROJECT HAS MADE SUBSTANTIAL PROGRESS IN ACCOMPLISHING ITS STATED PURPOSE. ACHIEVEMENTS BY SPECIFIED SUBAREAS HAVE VARIED CONSIDERABLY IN QUANTITATIVE RESPECTS, HOWEVER, AND QUALITATIVE PERFORMANCE CAN BE EVALUATED ONLY AGAINST STATEMENTS OF EXPECTATIONS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO INTERPRETATION. THE OUTPUT TARGET FOR DATA COLLECTION AND TABULATION HAS BEEN ACCOMPLISHED IN GENEROUS MEASURE, AS REFLECTED BY COMPLETION OF THE 1974 AND 1975 RICE SURVEYS, INITIATION OF THE 1976 RICE SURVEY, AND PUBLICATION OF THE STATISTICAL HANDBOOK. EXCEPT THAT THE RETURN OF PARTICIPANTS HAS LAGGED BEHIND THE TARGET COMPLETION DATE, THE ATTAINMENT OF FUNCTIONAL CAPABILITY HAS EXCEEDED ORIGINAL EXPECTATIONS. THE RANGE OF FIELDS OF TRAINING IS HELPING TO CREATE A BALANCED CAPABILITY FOR PRODUCING STATISTICAL DATA, CONDUCTING ECONOMIC STUDIES, AND PREPARING AND EVALUATING DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS. DURING THE PLANNING DIVISION'S RELATIVELY SHORT EXISTENCE IT HAS MADE UNCOMMON PROGRESS TOWARD EFFECTIVE OPERATION IN SEVERAL OF ITS AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY.

THE BROAD RESPONSIBILITIES AND THE LIMITED TRAINING OF THE PLANNING DIVISION'S STAFF OUTSIDE THE STATISTICS SECTION PLACE SHARP LIMITS ON ITS CAPABILITY AND PERFORMANCE IN DEVELOPING AND APPRAISING INDIVIDUAL PROJECTS, FITTING THESE TOGETHER IN ANNUAL AND LONG-TERM PROGRAMS RESPONSIVE TO THE NEEDS OF THE SECTOR, AND DEVELOPING THE KIND OF SECTOR ANALYSIS NEEDED AS A FRAMEWORK FOR THE FOREGOING ACTIVITIES.

"Evaluates end of project status of the North Carolina State Univ Agricultural Diversification & Trade project as of 4/76.  Review team focused on accomplishments, work methods & recommendations. With available rsrch findings, the project leader could neither analyze alternative means & costs of transporting & distributing vegetables from production zones nor evaluate domestic demand & consumption compared with export demand.  Project leader also found that vegetable storage & preservation could become important if domestic per capita income & employment increased.  However, lack of domestic demand for fresh vegetables precludes using statistical estimates at present. Alternative commodity transport to export markets & quality control cost returns need evaluation. Export market potential estimates must incorporate cost & volume effects of tariffs & quotas.  At ten times production cost, export marketing is high risk, and the exporter bears the entire cost of price decline, spoilage loss, waiting time, and market close-out.  Export expansion depends on 50% yield increases, 50% reduced production costs, introduction of quality control, volume markets, and large scale operations integration. Knowledge of markets, prices, and trade terms is required in comparative advantage studies of economic alternatives.  Phase I could have better established how vegetable production really was & its direction; then could have better judged what needed to be found out & how to find it.  Some data & country participation expectations were unfeasible.  Small farmer participation could have been ruled out.  The statistical demand estimation models and the quadratic programming model containing vegetable production & demand function data for various countries need to be explained to LDC planners. Recommendations are to distribute a technical appendix explanation of the demand estimation model and prepare a digest of project materials.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/CSD-3632","","1/1/1976 12:00:00 AM","","Trade|Agricultural prices|Exports|Agricultural economics|Economic research|Agricultural product marketing|AGRIBUSINESS|Agricultural diversification|Technical assistance|Project change","Latin America","","","000035 - U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)","","","English","","Evaluation team|Final EOPS","","STOVALL, JOHN G.|CATON, DOUGLAS D.","","[1976]","","","","PROJECT REVIEW - DIVERSIFICATION AND TRADE IN LATIN AMERICA","","PD-AAQ-685","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc1NDIw","Technical Assistance","9310641"

"Evaluates project performance from 4/76 to 11/76 in Indonesia.  USAID assists the Govt of Indonesia prepare the Luwu area for transmigration by improving its transportation system, developing irrigation areas. establishing health facilities, and providing agricultural assistance and community development training.  Evaluation is based on visits to 3 regional offices, meetings with sub-project bodies, and on-site observation. Evaluator feels project has outstanding possibilities for integrated development of resources and people if administrative obstacles can be overcome.  The various projects are still operating as sector programs with little commitment by agencies and lack of team work.  This divided authority makes delays and disruptions inevitable. The greatest need is to strengthen the Project Manager's position by giving him authority over budgets and all personnel.  Project manager should also receive more timely technical advice and divide his time equally between office and field work.  The special advisor needs to develop an area regional plan taking into account alternative development. It is estimated that the Luwu area has the potential to absorb up to 40,000 transmigrant families engaged in irrigation, fish farming, horticultural specialities, and service industries.  Before transmigrant families can be placed, however, a future water supply to maintain the area must be assured; further planning of water, mineral, and forest resources uses made; and Bina Marga's delay to begin the physical work on roads and irrigation mapping overcome.  It is recommended that an immediate engineering feasibility study of several low head streams as potential water storage reservoirs and hydro-electric power producers be made with forestry department responsible for the watershed of the irrigation supply streams.  Since project implementation also depends on trained personnel, arrangements are being made with the Ford Foundation and Community Development Society of North America to train community members as extension workers to work with transmigrant villages through self-help activities and acceptance of change.","Evaluation period: 12 Apr 1976-8 Nov 1976","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","11/1/1976 12:00:00 AM","","Rural development|Agricultural cooperatives|MIGRATION|Agriculture|Information services|Management training|Road construction|IRRIGATION|Communities|Fish ponds|Institution building|Agricultural technology|Transportation planning|Transportation policy|Community development|Reservoirs|Mineral resources|Health facilities|Hydrological surveys|Agricultural production|Forest resources|Sector planning|Agricultural policy|Beneficiary count","Indonesia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAD850A1.pdf","783 KB","001459 - University of Missouri at Columbia","","","English","application/pdf","Onsite evaluation","","DENNY, HUGH","","8 Nov 1976","","","","EIGHT WEEKS REPORT OF SPECIAL TECHNICAL ADVISOR TO THE LUWU PROJECT","","PD-AAD-850-A1","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc1NTk1","Indonesia","4970244"

"EVALUATES TWO URBAN AND REGIONAL SECTOR LOANS FOR THE PERIOD 8/71 TO 11/76 IN COLOMBIA (PROJECT NUMBERS 5140163 AND 5140172.) OBJECTIVES OF THE FIRST LOAN INCLUDE THE PROMOTION OF ECONOMIC GROWTH IN INTERMEDIATE-SIZED CITIES AND THE IMPROVEMENT OF BASIC INFRASTRUCTURE AND SERVICES TO LOW-INCOME AREAS IN FOUR MAJOR CITIES. THE FOLLOW-ON LOAN ADDED SEVERAL OT HER GOALS, EMPHASIZING THE PROMOTION OF LABOR-INTENSIVE INDUSTRY. EVALUATION IS BASED ON AVAILABLE DATA COMPILED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF NATIONAL PLANNING (DNP). THE ADMINISTRATIVE COMPLEXITY OF THE TWO LOANS MADE EVALUATION DIFFICULT. FOUR AGENCIES WERE INVOLVED IN IMPLEMENTING THE FIRST LOAN AND SEVEN AGENCIES WERE INVOLVED IN IMPLEMENTING THE SECOND LOAN. THIS PLACED A HEAVEY BURDEN ON THE COORDINATIVE FUNCTION WHICH FELL TO DNP. BUT DNP HAD NO OPERATIONAL ROLE AND CAME TOO LATE TO THE TASK.  THUS, INDIVIDUAL INVESTMENTS WERE NOT WELL COORDINATED WITH THE LOANS' SECTOR OBJECTIVES. IN ADDITION, THE LACK OF CLEAR THEORIES OF URBAN AND REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT CONTRIBUTED TO THE PRESENCE OF CONFLICTING OR POORLY CONCEIVED OBJECTIVES IN THE LOANS. FOR INSTANCE, THE LOANS SOUGHT TO PROMOTE ECONOMIC GROWTH IN INTERMEDIATE CITIES AS WELL AS TO IMPROVE THE FLOW OF CREDIT TO SMALL LABOR INTENSIVE INDUSTRIES. IN FACT, SMALL INDUSTRIES AND LABOR-INTENSIVE INDUSTRIES ARE LIKELY TO BE BETTER REPRESENTED IN THE LARGEST CITIES THAN IN INTERMEDIATE CITIES. THE EVALUATION PRESENTS LITTLE EVIDENCE OF THE LOANS' TOTAL IMPACT ON URBAN AND REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT IN COLOMBIA. THE AUTHOR DID, HOWEVER, CONSTRUCT VARIOUS STATISTICAL TESTS USING DATA ON HAND AT DNP. REGRESSION ANALYSES SHOWED A STRONG RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE INVESTMENTS FINANCED BY THE CREDITS AND THE VALUE ADDED AND EMPLOYMENT IN THE RECIPIENT CITIES. NO DIRECT CAUSATION IS IMPLIED HOWEVER, ANALYSIS OF EXPENDITURE PATTERNS SUGGEST THAT THE USAID-SUPPORTED CREDIT WAS NOT TOTALLY USED FOR FINANCING OF ""PRIORITY EXPANSION AREAS OF THE GOC'S URBAN/REGIONAL STRATEGY"". THE DNP HAD FAILED TO RANK PRIORITY INVESTMENTS, OR AT LEAST NOT PUBLICLY.

"Evaluates effectiveness of loans and grants in supporting an animal vaccine laboratory in Mali from 1962 to 1976.  Evaluatn team conducted a 2 week onsite evaluatn at Bamaro and 2 field stations, and performed a project analysis based on widely dispersed basic documents.  The Project was designed to:  1. diagnose animal diseases, 2. make vaccines to fight pleuropneumonia.Rinderpest, anthrax.pasteurella, and black leg; and 3.do research in regional animal disease. Vaccines for only the first 2 diseases are made in sufficient quantity to meet Mali's needs, due to an inadequate operating budget. Evaluator recommends increased quality controls (sterility control, pyrogeneity testing, and in-vivo testing of vaccine), and increased production of short-supply items and aviary vaccines. Establishment of priorities is also recommended for medium-range efforts in diagnosis and research, as is a conference of African countries aimed at coordinating laboratory functions and facilities in order to avoid duplication. Evaluator recommends investigation of the Central Veterinary Lab (CVL) by a specialist in occupational hazards of vaccine laboratories to avoid accidents like the 1974 explosion which resulted in disfigurement of personnel. Financial and procedural recommendations are aimed at seeking means of economizing and of supplementing finances, and at maintaining basic documents for periodic audit.  Negotiations with contractors have been beset by many problems due to inappropriate decisions, designs, and clearances, as well as to contractor's failures.  A notable exception was a maintenance contract with the Organization of Rehabilitation and Training which trained local personnel in repair and maintenance of CVL equipment. Investigation has determined that CVL's finances have been overburdened by association with the Ministry of Health Solution Production Lab.  This association has also overburdened the available water supply and led to the 1974 explosion.  Evaluator states that further efforts such as the tse tse research in ""Mali Livestock 2"" represents too great a drain on CVL's finances and facilities.","Evaluation period: 1 Sep 1961-15 Apr 1976","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","11/1/1976 12:00:00 AM","","Disease prevention and control|Animal diseases|RINDERPEST|Livestock diseases|Respiratory diseases|Vaccines|Veterinary medicine|Medical laboratories","Mali","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAA557A1.pdf","15,697 KB","000035 - U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)","","","English","application/pdf","Pre evaluation data|Indepth evaluation|Onsite evaluation","","LANDFIELD, SHERWIN","","1 Nov 1976","","","","EVALUATION REPORT.

"BACKGROUND PAPER ASSESSES NIGERIEN COOP & CREDIT ORGANIZATION (UNCC) & GOVT OF NIGER (GON) EFFORTS TO INCREASE CEREAL PRODUCTION, BASED ON NATIONAL & REGIONAL DOCUMENTS & TAPED INTERVIEWS WITH FARMERS & NIGERIEN LOCAL-LEVEL CADRE. A QUESTIONNAIRE WAS DEVELOPED & ADMINISTERED IN 5 VILLAGES; DATA NOT YET COMPILED. 3 AGRICULTURAL EXTENSION MODLES ARE DISCUSSED. THE 1ST IS COMPOSED OF A PROFESSIONAL AGRICULTURAL STAFF WITH A NETWORK OF PEASANT DEMONSTRATORS ELECTED BY VILLAGE MUTUAL COOPS. INADEQUATE TRAINING OF DEMONSTRATORS HAS RESULTED IN LOW FARMER RECEPTIVITY. IN ADDITION, FERTILIZER IS DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN ONCE FARMERS HAVE BEEN INTERESTED. MODEL II EMPLOYS AIDE-ENCADEURS WHO UNFORTUNATELY ARE USUALLY SELECTED ON THE BASIS OF FORMAL SCHOOLING AND/OR PERSONAL CONTACTS RATHER THAN ACTUAL KNOWLEDGE & SOCIAL ACCEPTABILITY. THEY DOLE-OUT LARGE AMOUNTS OF FREE FERTILIZER, IMPRESSING FARMERS WITH REMARKABLE RESULTS. MODEL III IS A VARIATION OF MODEL II,WITH AIDE-ENCADEURS CIRCULATED THROUGH VILLAGES IN A MULTITUDE OF JOBS. IN BOTH CASES, AIDE-ENCADEURS ARE POORLY TRAINED AND NOT WELL-SUPERVISED. TRAINING PROGRAMS WERE DEVISED FOR YOUNG FARMERS, BUT WERE ATTENDED MOSTLY BY SONS OF WEALTHY, INFLUENTIAL FAMILIES. PARTICIPANTS RECEIVED INCOMPLETE UNITS OF EQUIPMENT AND HAD NO SYSTEMATIC DEMONSTRATION ROLES. IN THE UNCC COOP STRUCTURE, MAJOR EMPHASIS WAS PUT ON MARKETING GROUPS, BUT FARMERS DISLIKED THE INCREASED EXPENDITURES OF TIME AND TRANSPORT. LOCAL-LEVEL COOPS REMAIN UNDER TRADITIONAL AUTHORITIES AND COOP EDUCATION EFFORTS HAVE BEEN MISDIRECTED. THE VOLUME OF LOANS AND THEIR SUBSEQUENT REPAYMENT IS GROWING STEADILY, BUT ACCORDING TO UNCC FIGURES DEFAULT IS VERY HIGH. LOAN RECORDS AT THE REGIONAL LEVEL HAVE BEEN FOUND TO BE INACCURATE, WHICH CASTS DOUBT ON THE ENTIRE SYSTEM.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/afr-C-1149","","11/1/1976 12:00:00 AM","","Storage facilities|Seed production|Seeds|Varietal research|Food production|Farmer training|Cereals|Credit cooperatives|Agricultural credit|Agricultural inputs|Agricultural training|Educational materials|Agricultural extension|Agricultural production|Agricultural extension training|Beneficiary interviews|Limited data","Niger","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAG639F1.pdf","1,956 KB","","","","English","application/pdf","Onsite evaluation","","CHARLICK, ROBERT B.","","1 Nov 1976","","","","BACKGROUND PAPER FOR US-NIGERIAN DISCUSSIONS OF THE NIGER CEREALS PROGRAM (ATTACHED PAR 77-1)","","PD-AAG-639-F1","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc2MDc3","Niger","6830201"
"RECORDS NIGER NATIONAL CEREALS PROJECT EVALUATION MEETING ON 12/11/76 WITH OFFICIALS OF USAID, GOVT OF NIGER (GON), AND CONSORTIUM FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT (CID). PURPOSE OF PROJECT IS TO PROVIDE GON WITH AN ECOLOGICALLY SUSTAINABLE AND REASONABLY PRICED CEREAL PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM TO SERVE A LARGER POPULATION AT A SMALLER RATE PER CAPITA OF LAND CULTIVATION. THE MOST OUTSTANDING PROBLEM AREAS ARE DELAYS IN THE ORDERING AND DELIVERY OF EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS AND DELAYS BY GON IN PAYMENT OF SALARIES AND IN PAYMENTS FOR EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES. THE NATIONAL AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH INSTITUTE(INRAN) SHOULD CONSTRUCT AND ORGANIZE ADDITIONAL RESEARCH SUBSTRUCTURES; DEVELOP ANIMAL TRACTION AND OTHER SIMPLE EQUIPMENT; CONSIDER AVAILABLE EXTENSION PERSONNEL IN PLANNING, EMPHASIZING TRAINING ACTIVITIES; AND DIVERSIFY ITS INVOLVEMENT IN THE PROJECT. AT THE SEED MULTIPLICATION CENTERS, SHORT-TERM CONSULTANTS ARE NEEDED TO SELECT AND PLACE OR DERS FOR CLEANING AND PROCESSING EQUIPMENT. LOCAL WORKERS MUST BE GATHERED AND TRAINED. A STRONG NATIONAL SEED POLICY IS REQUISITE TO PROJECT SUCCESS. A SPECIAL EFFORT SHOULD BE MADE IN THE ENSUING 6 MONTHS TO DEVELOP NEW EXTENSION TECHNIQUES REQUIRING LESS TRAINING; TO COORDINATE AND PERHAPS COMBINE EFOORTS; AND TO DECIDE WHETHER TO TRAIN AIDE-ENCADEURS AND WHERE TO PLACE THEM AT PROJECT TERMINATION. EVALUATORS HIGHLY RECOMMEND THAT THE EXTENSION ADVISOR BE CONCERNED WITH ALL ASPECTS OF EXTENSION. THE NIGERIEN COOPERATIVE AND CREDIT ORGANIZATION(UNCC) SHOULD BE EXPANDED TO INCLUDE A SPECIAL TRAINING CENTER, BUT THE PROJECT MUST INSURE THE SUPPLY OF ADEQUATE INPUTS AND A PROTECTED MARKET.

"SUMMARIZES DISCUSSIONS HELD AT THE SEMINAR ON ""NUTRITION POLICY IN ASIA"" HELD IN PENANG, MALASIA FROM 6/7/76 TO 6/9/76. SEMINAR WAS SPONSORED BY THE SOUTHEAST ASIA DEVELOPMENT ADVISORY GROUP AND INCLUDED REPRESENTATIVES FROM PHILIPPINES, INDONESIA, THAILAND, AND THE US. SEMINAR PARTICIPANTS EVALUATED THE NUTRITIONAL ACTIVITIES IN THE PHILIPPINES, INDONESIA, THAILAND, AND PAKISTAN. IN THE PHILIPPINES, THE TIMBANG CHILD-WEIGHING PROGRAM (COVERING 50% OF ALL VILLAGES) HAS: (1) IDENTIFIED MALNDURISHED CHILDREN AND THEIR FAMILIES, (2) HELPED FORM COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS, AND (3) CREATED AN AWARENESS OF MALNUTRITION PROBLEMS AT LOCAL LEVELS BY SENSITIZING DECISION MAKERS AND EDUCATING THE POPULATION. THE GOP HAS ALSO SUCCEEDED IN REDUCING COCONUT OIL PRICES BY REPLACING TIN CANS WITH BOTTLES OR SELLING OIL IN BULK TO CONSUMERS WITH THEIR OWN CONTAINERS. IN INDONESIA, THE GOI IS MAKING PROGRESS IN SALT IODIZATION AND APPLIED NUTRITION. MAJOR CONCERN IS FOOD ADULTERATION, ESPECIALLY OF MILK WHICH IS BEING SOLD IN PLASTIC BAGS. IN THAILAND, PROBLEMS HAVE RESULTED FROM UNQUALIFIED OFFICIALS IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH, LACK OF CONSENSUS AS TO WHAT CONSTITUTED A NUTRITION PROGRAM, AND LIMITED ACTIVITY DURING THE 1960'S. ALSO, DUE TO THE LACK OF GOVERNMENT SUPPORT, NUTRITION CENTERS WERE LOCATED IN ECONOMICALLY AVERAGE VILLAGES RATHER THAN IN POORER ONES. THAILAND'S MOST SUCCESSFUL PROGRAMS INCLUDE MEAT SUBSTITUTES FABRICATED FROM MUNG BEAN PROTEIN (A BY-PRODUCT OF MUNG BEAN NOODLE PRODUCTION), SALT IODIZATION, AND DISSEMINATION OF HEALTH INFORMATION BY VILLAGE VOLUNTEERS. PAKISTAN HAS BEEN UNABLE TO CONVINCE ALL BUT ITS POOREST POPULATION TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ITS FREE WHOLE WHEAT FLOUR PROGRAM SINCE LOW GRADE IMPORTED WHEAT IS USED AND PROCESSED IN A METHOD UNATTRACTIVE TO LOCAL POPULATIONS. SEMINAR PARTICIPANTS CONCLUDE THAT SUCCESSFUL NUTRITION PROGRAMS REQUIRE HIGH LEVELS OF POLICY COORDINATION, WORKERS WITH CAREER COMMITMENT TO NUTRITION, ADEQUATE RESOURCES FURNISHED TO NUTRITION WORKERS, AND AN ABILITY TO IDENTIFY AND SOLVE PROBLEMS.","Evaluation period: 7 Jun 1976-9 Jun 1979","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","6/1/1976 12:00:00 AM","","Voluntary organizations|Health care|Iodized salt|PALM OIL|Coconuts|Deficiency diseases|Nutrition improvement|Health policy|Sector planning|Information dissemination|Seminars","Asia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAF068D1.pdf","451 KB","003257 - Asia Society.

"THIS IS AN OVERALL EVAL OF $3.9 MILLION 1972-76 LOAN TO STRENGTHEN INCAE IN NICARAGUA ACADEMICALLY AND FINANCIALLY. EVAL, PREPARED FOR ROCAP, GUATEMALA, WAS BASED ON STUDY OF BACKGROUND MATERIALS, FIELD VISITS TO INCAE, INTERVIEWS WITH CA GOVT, BUSINESS OFFICIALS, DISCUSSIONS WITH ROCAP. EVAL NOTE  MAJOR INCAE ACADEMIC GROWTH UNDER LOAN (FACULTY, ENROLLMENT,PROG QUALITY) BUT CENTERS ATTENTION ON PROJ PURPOSE OF ENSURING INCAE'S LONG-TERM FINANCIAL VIABILITY. LATTER HAS NOT BEEN ACHIEVED. PROJ STRATEGIES FOR THIS (ACHEIVING ECONOMIES OF SCALE, DEVELOPMENT OF INCAE CONSULTING BUSINESS, STUDENT LOAN FUND, INCREASED FUND RAISING) HAVE PROVEN UNREALISTIC,INEFFECTIVE. ELEMENTS OF INCAE NOT ORIGINALLY GRASPED AS CONTRIBUTORY TO ITS COSTLINESS ARE: SCOPE OF ITS PROGRAMS (MODELLED ON HARVARD BUS SCHL), TEACHER-STUDENT RATIO (40-175), FULL RESIDENCE REQUIREMENTS FOR ALL STUDENTS, CASE METHOD OF INSTRUCTION, HIGH PERSONNEL TURNOVER, HIGH COST OF FUNDRAISING, COMPLEXITY OF MANAGEMENT, AND ESP  LACK OF ENDOWMENT AND OF FIXED ANNUAL SUPPORT. INCAE HAS OPERATED WITH DEFICIT SINCE ITS INCEPTION (1964). CUMULATIVE DEFICIT UNDER AID LOANS (1970-76) IS $1.5 MIL  AND TOTAL DEBT IS $4.5 MIL. PROBLEMSWILL WORSEN IN NEXT 2 YEARS, EVEN MORE WHEN LOAN REPAYMENT  COMES DUE IN 1983. YET BECAUSE OF EXCELLENCE, IMPORTANCE IN CA, INCAE MUST BE SALVAGED.

"THIS EX-POST EVALUATION WAS PART OF A LARGER PROJECT WHICH WILL COMPARE HEALTH PROGRAMS IN AT LEAST SIX COUNTRIES. THE EVALUATORS AGREED THAT THE BASIC PROJECT PURPOSE -- INCREASING PUBLIC HEALTH KNOWLEDGE AND THUS IMPROVING PUBLIC HEALTH STATUS -- WAS NOT SATISFACTORILY ACHIEVED. THERE WERE MANY INADEQUACIES IN THIS PROJECT. THE PROGRAM WAS WEAK ADMINISTRATIVELY FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF COORDINATION WITH HOST GOVERNMENTS, WITH OTHER DONOR AGENCIES AND INTERNAL MANAGEMENT. NOR WAS A REALISTIC STRATEGY PROVIDED AS TO WHAT COULD/SHOULD BE ACCOMPLISHED IN THE AID TIME FRAME GIVEN THE RESOURCES AVAILABLE. ALTHOUGH THE PROJECT DESIGN WAS SUPPOSED TO ALLOW IT TO BE REPLICATED ELSEWHERE, IT WAS TOO RESOURCE INTENSIVE TO ALLOW FOR WIDESPREAD IMPLEMENTATION. ADMINISTRATIVE PROBLEMS WERE EXACERBATED BY (1) POORLY DEFINED LINES OF RESPONSIBILITY AMONG AID, OCEAC (ORGANIZATION FOR THE CONTROL OF ENDEMIC DISEASES IN CENTRAL AFRICA), AND THE CONTRACT PERSONNEL, AND (2) THE LACK OF A SUITABLE DATA BASE. THE PROBLEM OF IMPLEMENTING THE HEALTH EDUCATION PROGRAM, THE MOST CRUCIAL COMPONENT OF THE PROJECT, REFLECTED THE INADEQUACIES OF ADMINISTRATION AND DATA COLLECTION. IN THE SELECTION OF CANDIDATES FOR ADVANCED TRAINING HEALTH EDUCATION, LITTLE EFFORT WAS EXPENDED IN DETERMINING WHO WOULD BE THE MOST APPROPRIATE CANDIDATES, WHAT TYPE OF TRAINING WOULD MEET THE NEEDS OF THE RESPECTIVE COUNTRIES, WHERE THIS TRAINING COULD BEST BE OBTAINED OR WHETHER, IN RETROSPECT, THE EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCE HAD BEEN EFFECTIVE. WITH REFERENCE TO TRAINING MATERIALS, THERE WAS A LACK OF SIMPLE, AVAILABLE, PORTABLE MATERIALS IN THE LOCAL LANGUAGE. IN THE REALM OF HEALTH DELIVERY, A SERIOUS GAP DEVELOPED BETWEEN THE TRAINING OF HEALTH EDUCATORS AND THE TRANSFER OF THEIR INFORMATION TO THE RURAL POPULATION. THIS PROBLEM WAS REFLECTED IN THE ORIGINAL AID/OCEAC PROJECT DESIGN AND RESOURCE ALLOCATION WHICH NEGLECTED THE DELIVERY COMPONENT.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1976 12:00:00 AM","","Rural areas|Public health care|Medical education|Health delivery|Educational materials|Statistical data|Teacher training|Health education","Central Africa|West Africa","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAA552A1.pdf","6,952 KB","","","","English","application/pdf","","","SILBERFEIN, MARILYN|BLOCK, DONN|LASKMAN, KAREN","","1 Jan 1976","","","","USAID/OCEAC REGIONAL HEALTH EDUCATION PROJECT","","PD-AAA-552-A1","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc2MzQz","Sahel Regional","6250510"
"THE BENEFITS DERIVED BY AID FROM THE LEAGUE FOR INTERNATIONAL FOOD EDUCATION (LIFE) AND THE NATIONAL ACADEMY FOR SCIENCES/COMMITTEE ON INTERNATIONAL NUTRITION (NAS/CIN) ARE MORE THAN COMMENSURATE WITH THE RESOURCES INVESTED. THE WORLDWIDE DISTRIBUTION OF LIFE'S COMMUNICATION NETWORK INVOLVES CLIENTS WORKING ON ALL LEVELS OF NUTRITION DEVELOPMENT. LIFE HAS BEEN CREDITED WITH PROVIDING SIGNIFICANT ASSISTANCE IN SOLVING MALNUTRITION PROBLEMS. THE EFFORTS AND SUPPORT OF NAS/CIN TO AID'S NUTRITION STRATEGY HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO A NUMBER OF KEY ISSUES IN SOLVING PROBLEMS OF MALNUTRITION. THE UTILIZATION OF THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROVIDED BY LIFE HAS HAD A SUBSTANTIAL IMPACT ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF PROJECTS TO SOLVE MALNUTRITION PROBLEMS AND HAS COVERED A BROAD RANGE OF TOPICS AND ISSUES IN INTERNATIONAL NUTRITIONAL PROGRAMS. LIFE HAS DIRECTLY ASSISTED IN THE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OF SPECIFIC PROJECTS TO SOLVE MALNUTRITION PROBLEMS IN LESSER DEVELOPED COUNTRIES (LDCS). GENERALLY, LIFE WAS VIEWED BY THOSE WHO RECEIVED DIRECT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND BY THOSE ON THE LIFE  NEWSLETTER MAILING LIST AS AN IMPORTANT SOURCE OF TECHNICAL INFORMATION AND ASSISTANCE. THE LIFE NEWSLETTER WAS CONSIDE RED TO BE ONE OF THE FEW SOURCES OF INFORMATION ON THE LATEST DEVELOPMENTS IN FOOD TECHNOLOGY; IT IS WIDELY CIRCULATED IN THE NUTRITION COMMUNITY. DESPITE THE SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE WHICH IT IS EXERTING ON SOLVING PROBLEMS OF MALNUTRITION AND FOOD TECHNOLOGY FOR VARIOUS CLIENTS IN LDCS, THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT LIFE HAS AN EVEN GREATER POTENTIAL IN ASSISTING LDCS TO RESOLVE THEIR PROBLEMS IN NUTRITIONAL DEVELOPMENT.

"EVALUATES PROJECT TO ESTABLISH RURAL ELECTRIC COOPERATIVES TO SERVE THE INHABITANTS OF RURAL NORTH CENTRAL NICARAGUA. EVALUATION, A LOAN COMPLETION REPORT, COVERS A PERIOD ENDING 6/30/76. NEITHER THE STARTING-POINT OF THE EVALUATION NOR ITS METHODOLOGY ARE INDICATED. THE EMPRESA NACIONAL DE LUZ Y FUERZA (ENALUF), A PUBLIC POWER UTILITY OWNED BY THE GOVERNMENT OF NICARAGUA, IS IMPLEMENTING THE PROJECT. MAJOR PROJECT ACHIEVMENT TO DATE HAS BEEN THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A NEW RURAL ELECTRIC COOPERATIVE FOR THE SEGOVIAS (CODERSE). CODERSE'S DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM IS IN PLACE AND OVER 24,000 PEOPLE ARE NOW CONNECTED TO THE SYSTEM. THIRTY MILES OF 69KV TRANSMISSION LINE; A 5,000KVA SUB-STATION; 410 MILES OF 14.4/24.9KV DISTRIBUTION LINES; AND 280 MILES OF 120/240 VOLT SECONDARY LINES AND SERVICE INSTALLATIONS WERE CONSTRUCTED. THE PROJECT WAS DELAYED NINE MONTHS BY THE FAILURE OF A GUATEMALAN SUPPLIER TO DELIVER POLES AND CROSSARMS AS CONTRACTED. LOAN FUNDS WERE USED TO PURCHASE TOOLS, POLES, AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FROM THE NATIONAL ELECTRIC COOPERATIVE ASSOCIATION (NRECA), INCLUDING ASSISTANCE NOT ORIGINALLY PLANNED FOR IN THE AREAS OF RATE STUDY, ACCOUNTING, EVALUATION OF POLE AND MATERIAL QUALITY, AND ADMINISTRATION. THE TRAINING COMPONENT, HOWEVER, HAS FALLEN FAR SHORT OF STATED OBJECTIVES. GENERAL MANAGEMENT OF OPERATIONS MUST BE UPGRADED. A CONTINUING TRAINING PROGRAM SHOULD BE IMPLEMENTED AT THE FIELD OPERATIONS LEVEL. AID HAS AUTHORIZED A GRANT AGREEMENT WITH THE NATIONAL ENERGY INSTITUTE (NEI) TO PROVIDE SUCH TRAINING. THE PROJECT LOAN ALSO FINANCED THE EXPANSION OF FOUR EXISTING RURAL COOPERATIVES, ENABLING THEM TO PROVIDE ELECTRICITY TO AN ADDITIONAL 4,700 CUSTOMERS. (APPROXIMATELY 22,000 FAMILIES ARE SERVED BY THESE COOPERATIVES.) IT IS CONCLUDED THAT A STRONG RURAL ELECTRIC NETWORK, SERVING OVER 150,000 PEOPLE AND A NUMBER OF IMPORTANT AGRO-INDUSTRIES AND LARGE AGRICULTURAL PRODUCERS, HAS BEEN DEVELOPED. ALTHOUGH IT WAS ANTICIPATED THAT THE MAJOR IMPACT OF THE PROJECT WOULD FALL ON THE MIDDLE INCOME FARMER, THE RURAL POOR ALSO BENEFITTED FAR BEYOND EXPECTATIONS.","Loan no. 524-L-025|Evaluation period: Through 30 Jun 1976","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","7/1/1976 12:00:00 AM","","Rural areas|Electric utilities|Management training|ELECTRIFICATION|Transmission lines|Electric power lines|Cooperatives|Electric power distribution|Limited data","Nicaragua","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAG280A1.pdf","395 KB","008584 - USAID.

"EVALUATES LOAN PROJECT WITH THE GOVERNMENT OF PERU TO ASSIST IN THE REHABILITATION OF THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR IN THE AREA AFFECTED BY THE EARTHQUAKE OF 5/31/70. THIS USAID LOAN COMPLETION REPORT COVERS THE ENTIRE PROJECT FROM 7/25/72 TO 10/31/74. THE EVALUATION WAS BASED ON DISCUSSIONS WITH AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT BANK (AGBANK) OFFICIALS, VISITS TO SEVERAL SUBPROJECTS, SELECTIVE REVIEW OF SUB-BORROWER CARDS AND FILES, AND REVIEW OF AGBANK DOCUMENTS. THE LOAN FUNDS WERE TO PROVIDE MEDIUM-TERM CREDITS AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO SMALL AND MEDIUM FARMERS, EITHER FARMING INDIVIDUAL PLOTS OR ORGANIZED INTO ASSOCIATIVE ENTERPRISES, IN ORDER TO REPLACE CAPITAL LOSSES AND RESTORE THE DISASTER-VICTIMIZED PRODUCTION CAPACITY OF THESE UNITS. IN THIS RESPECT, THE LOAN HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL. MOST SUB-LENDING OCCURRED IN THE COASTAL AREAS OF AGRARIAN ZONE III (TRUJILLO, CHIMBOTE AND CASMA) AND AGRARIAN ZONE IV (HUACHO, HUARAL AND LIMA). SPECIFIC SUB-LOAN ACTIVITIES INCLUDED: HOUSING, BRIDGE, AND RIVER DEFENSE (RE)CONSTRUCTION; PLANTING PEACH TREES AND GRAPE VINES; AND PURCHASING FARM MACHINERY, FERTILIZERS, INSECTICIDES, AND CATTLE. ALL $5 MILLION IN LOAN FUNDS WERE DISBURSED. THE MAJOR PROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED INCLUDED VERY LATE RESOLUTION OF A DUAL ADMINISTRATION PROBLEM INVOLVING THE MINISTRY OF AGRICULTURE AND THE AGBANK, RESULTING IN HIGH DEFAULT RATES. MANY PARTICIPATING SMALL FARMERS RECEIVED LITTLE OR NO ADVICE FROM EXTENSION AGENTS BECAUSE OF MANPOWER SHORTAGES AND TRANSPORTATION DEFICIENCIES. RAPID CHANGES IN THE LAND TENURE SYSTEM BROUGHT ABOUT BY THE AGRARIAN REFORM OFTEN PRECLUDED GRANTING OF CREDIT, WITH THE MOST RECURRENT INSTANCES INVOLVING THE LACK OF LEGAL STATUS OF THE APPLICANT. FINALLY, AGBANK SUB-LOAN CONTROL AND AUDITING PROCEDURES AND PRACTICES WERE OFTEN DEFICIENT. A DETAILED REPORT HAS BEEN SUBMITTED TO THE AGBANK OUTLINING SPECIFIC MEASURES TO CORRECT THESE DEFICIENCIES. AN ESTIMATED 5,500 FARM FAMILIES DIRECTLY BENEFITTED FROM THE CREDIT PROGRAM, SIGNIFICANTLY EXCEEDING INITIAL PROJECTIONS OF 3,500.

"EVALUATES PROJECT IN HONDURAS TO RECONSTRUCT PRIMARY SCHOOLS DAMAGED BY HURRICANE FIFI TO 1974 AND TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF RURAL PRIMARY EDUCATION. THE EVALUATION COVERS THE PERIOD 3/75 TO 12/76. NO METHODOLOGY IS INDICATED. A TOTAL OF 194 CLASSROOMS WERE CONSTRUCTED AND 64 SCHOOLS REPAIRED, THUS COMPLETING RECONSTRUCTION OF ALL DAMAGED SCHOOLS AND PROVIDING FACILITIES FOR 27,000 STUDENTS. THE SCHOOLS ARE FUNCTIONAL, DURABLE, AND IN MANY CASES A CONSIDERABLE IMPROVEMENT ON PREVIOUS FACILITIES. CARE WAS CONTRACTED TO REBUILD AND REPAIR SMALL SCHOOLS (SIX CLASSROOMS AND UNDER), PRIVATE FIRMS FOR THE REMAINDER. THE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION (MOE) EXPANDED A RECENT PROGRAM EMPHASIZING AGRICULTURAL AND VOCATIONAL ASPECTS OF THE CURRICULUM. THE PROGRAM SHOULD INCREASE RETENTION RATES, KEEP CHILDREN IN SCHOOL LONGER, AND ENGENDER BETTER RELATIONS WITH PARENTS AND THE COMMUNITY. TO SUPPORT THE NEW CURRICULUM, TRADITIONALLY SCARCE SCHOOL SUPPLIES, E.G., MAPS, SCIENCE EQUIPMENT, AND TOOLS, WERE PROVIDED, AS WERE ONE-MONTH IN-SERVICE TRAINING COURSES (COSTING ONLY $300 EACH) FOR 3,400 TEACHERS. TRAINING COURSES WERE CONDUCTED BY THE SUPERVISORY DEPARTMENT OF PRIMARY EDUCATION AND WERE WELL RECEIVED. SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION WAS DELAYED BEYOND THE PLANNED ONE YEAR BY HEAVY RAINS AND BY FUNDING TO CARE INSUFFICIENT TO PROVIDE FOR SIMULTANEOUS CONSTRUCTION OF ALL BUILDINGS. PROCUREMENT OF EDUCATIONAL MATERIALS WAS DELAYED BY SLOW ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES AND THE MOE'S DECISION TO FUND MATERIALS ONLY AFTER FURNITURE COSTS WERE DETERMINED. AS A RESULT, $48,000 IN LOAN FUNDS WERE NOT DISBURSED. THE HOST GOVERNMENT WILL FUND THIS AMOUNT. THERE WERE ALSO DIFFICULTIES IN WORKING WITH CARE. ITS CONTRACT WAS NEGOTIATED ONLY AFTER ITS UNREASONABLE FEE REQUEST WAS REDUCED AND MANY OF ITS REIMBURSEMENT REQUESTS NEEDED REVISION.

"EVALUATES LOAN TO THE GOVERNMENT OF PERU (GOP) FOR THE AGRIBUSINESS SECTOR TO ESTABLISH A PRIVATE INVESTMENT FUND (PIF). EVALUATION, A LOAN COMPLETION REPORT, COVERS THE PERIOD 4/25/68 TO 4/15/76 AND IS BASED IN PART ON VISITS TO BENEFICIARIES. IN 10/68 A MILITARY GOVERNMENT TOOK CONTROL OF PERU, REVERSED THE FORMER REGIME'S PRIORITIES, AND ACCORDED THE PRIVATE SECTOR THE LOWEST PLACE. THIS, PLUS THE CONTINUAL REORGANIZATION OF THE ORIGINAL IMPLEMENTING AGENCY, THE CENTRAL BANK, RESULTED IN ONLY FIVE SUBPROJECTS BEING FINANCED 1968-71. ONLY ONE COMMERCIAL BANK PARTICIPATED DUE TO THE LOW INTEREST RATES ESTABLISHED UNDER THE LOAN AND THE COMPLEXITY AND RIGIDITY OF LOAN OPERATING PROCEDURES. ALTHOUGH A 1972 USAID-FINANCED STUDY SHOWED THAT AMPLE DEMAND FOR LOAN FUNDS EXISTED, IT WAS NOT UNTIL TRANSFER OF IMPLEMENTATION RESPONSIBILITY TO THE GOP'S DEVELOPMENT FINANCE CORPORATION (COFIDE, ESTABLISHED 1972) THAT SUBLENDING RECOMMENCED. EVEN THEN PROGRESS WAS SLOWED BY PROCESSING BOTTLENECKS, ESPECIALLY REGARDING LOAN ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA AND BY COFIDE'S FAILURE TO COMMIT SUFFICIENT FUNDS TO APPROVED SUBPROJECTS. ONE SUBPROJECT HAD TO BE CANCELLED. AS A RESULT OF ALL THESE FACTORS, 80% OF LOAN FUNDS WERE DEOBLIGATED. ONLY $1.5 MILLION OF ORIGINALLY ALLOCATED $7.5 MILLION WAS ULTIMATELY DISBURSED. GOP DISBURSED $1.8 MILLION OF THE SAME AMOUNT ALLOCATED. NINE SUBPROJECTS WERE FINANCED. OF THE FOUR SUBPROJECTS VISITED, THE TWO FOR PURCHASING AIRCRAFT -- ONE TO TRANSPORT PASSENGERS AND BEEF, THE OTHER FOR A FUMIGATION SERVICE FOR AGRARIAN REFORM FARMERS -- WERE DOING WELL, ESPECIALLY THE FORMER. A THIRD SUBPROJECT, A FEEDER MILL, EXPERIENCED ADMINISTRATIVE PROBLEMS AND HAD TO OBTAIN A LOAN FROM THE INDUSTRIAL BANK TO REPAY THE PIF; WHILE A FOURTH, A PRODUCER OF VETERINARIAN PRODUCTS, HAS FALLEN IN ARREARS WITH PIF PAYMENTS.

"Evaluates project to assist the Government of the Dominican Republic (GODR) to use videotape technology to bring technical knowledge to small farmers. This special evaluation, whose time frame is unspecified, is based on onsite visits and interviews with USAID, GODR and Ideas, Inc. personnel, and farmer beneficiaries. The project was successful. At least 21 videotape presentations were conducted for use in:  (1) vocational education center programs; (2) farmer education; (3) technician education; (4) support to extension services; (5) recording one-time education experiences; (6) recruitment; and (7) documentation for official and public awareness.  These materials reached a total of 31,397 rural people from 179 communities, who responded well to them and applied knowledge acquired through their use. Twenty-five people were trained in the use of videotape recording technology and in the preparation of audiovisual and other materials during two five-month training programs  Several other small-scale workshop training programs were held and peer training occurred sporadically. The modified Foxfire approach (an approach in which students document a community problem and then work with experts in preparing a video message containing a potential solution for community residents) was used in at least one case. Although this approach, the proposed major thrust of the program, was a successful innovation, it was discontinued due to the loss of two educational institutions from the program.  Since the approach depended on student availability, there were no other formal schools involved in the program. Problems were observed in the areas of coordination of video production, transportation, evaluation, and program expansion. Recommendations were made as follows:  (1) officially acknowledge program integration; (2) equitably transfer video units; (3) strengthen leadership; (4) document project participants' acquired knowledge on videotape; (5) establish maintenance equipment funding; (6) reinstate the modified Foxfire approach; and (7) update training materials.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","8/1/1976 12:00:00 AM","","Video tape recorders|Audiovisual educational materials|Educational materials|Institution building|Nonprint media|Libraries|Education|Rural areas|Nonformal education|Vocational training|Agricultural education|Agricultural extension|Agricultural extension training|Agricultural technology|Agricultural training|Agricultural technicians|Technicians|Technical training|Farmer training|On the job training|Indigenous education|Limited data","Dominican Republic","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAF926A1.pdf","1,000 KB","","","","English","application/pdf","Onsite evaluation","","BLACK, KARL D.","Nonformal education","27 Aug 1976","","","","EVALUATION OF THE IDEAS, INC., VIDEO-BASED NON-FORMAL EDUCATION PROGRAM","","PD-AAF-926-A1","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc2ODgx","Dominican Republic","5170109"
"Evaluates project to construct a 238 km class two highway between Tarapoto and Rio Nieva in Peru.  Evaluation covers the period from 1/75 to 3/76.  No evaluation methodology is indicated. The loan was reactivated on 1/10/75 after an interruption between 1969-74, due in part to a change in administration of the Government of Peru (GOP). The GOP delayed six to eight months replacing the Chief of Party (CP) and three engineers from the Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MTC), whose poor management has delayed construction. Under a new CP, construction has accelerated since the last quarter of 1974.  A major problem has been delays by MTC's Lima Headquarters in procuring equipment and spare parts.  As a result, only $3.058 million of $9.49 million reactivated funds has been disbursed.  It should be noted that although the GOP has already contributed $1 million to the project, it will have to contribute another $2 million if the project is to be completed satisfactorily. AID/W backstopping has generally been satisfactory.  Performance of the heavy equipment specialist, the USAID contract project monitor, and of local labor, has been excellent. MTC has investigated bridge foundations at three problem sites, but has yet to provide a comprehensive study of landslides, which continue to threaten completed road sections.  Construction progress has been satisfactory, and its technical quality is very good.  Due to the inaccessibility of the area, costs are comparatively high.  A final survey of centerline and road design were recently completed.  Still to be completed are:  clearing of 7 kms of construction area; excavation of 15 1/2 kms of jungle mountain terrain; placing of culverts and construction headwalls; construction of seven bridges (five should be completed by 12/77); 33 kms of final shaping of the roadbed; 79 kms of subbase; and 120 kms of course and final road improvement. If commodities arrive by 9-10/76 (MTC/Lima has begun procurement), and the Army Construction Company lends assistance, all loan funds could be disbursed by the terminal disbursement date of 12/31/77.","Loan no. 527-L-028|Evaluation period: 1 JAN 1975-31 MAR 1976|Bibcode changed from 32 to 22, 2008-05-19","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","4/1/1976 12:00:00 AM","","Labor intensive technology|Road construction|Forests|Access roads|Roads|Transportation system design|Bridge construction|Geological surveys|Limited data","Peru","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAH217A1.pdf","199 KB","008591 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to assist activities of the Population Council (PC).  This special evaluation covers the period 1973-1975 and is based on interviews with personnel from A.I.D. and PC. PC conducted 50 subgrants and 13 in-house projects between 10/73 and 12/75.  In addition, PC pioneered two new approaches to family planning delivery, urban hospital-based postpartum programs and rural mother child health/family planning projects. Despite its fulfillment of the terms of the contract, there has been a growing sense of dissatisfaction with PC.  PC and A.I.D. have been collaborators since A.I.D. entered the population field in 1965. However, as the Office of Population gained experience, it became less willing to let PC follow its own priorities when using A.I.D. funds.  In turn, PC renewed its determination not to permit outside control of its programs.  Serious professional and technical differences also occurred.  For example, while PC stressed the importance of continuation rates of acceptors in evaluating projects, A.I.D. considered the number, age, and parity of acceptors more significant.  In addition, PC favored IUD's, while A.I.D. promoted oral contraceptives, sterilizaton and, for a time, menstrual regulation.  In addition, A.I.D. shifted its priorities from education, research, and fellowships to direct support of programs and supplies.  With regard to future collaboration, it is recommended that A.I.D.: (1) support the Population in Development Planning Program and collaborate with PC in making population data and issues an important element in development planning; (2) assist the International Committee on Applied Research in Population (ICARP) to evaluate and encourage sterilization techniques and delivery networks; (3) encourage PC to provide additional assistance to overseas information programs and to tailor its publications, especially translations, to local needs; (4) encourage PC to serve as an executing agent for the United Nations Family Planning Agency; and (5) encourage PC to include women, blacks, and non-U.S. citizens on its staff.","Evaluation period: 1 Jan1973-31 Dec1975","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/CSD-2897","","1/1/1976 12:00:00 AM","","Population programs|Population growth|Population and demography|Journals|Population education|Population policy|Population planning|Demographic research|FAMILY PLANNING|Data collection|Family planning education|Development program evaluation|Family planning promotion programs|Information storage and retrieval systems|Family planning research|Technical assistance","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAC111.pdf","638 KB","000262 - American Public Health Association","","","English","application/pdf","Evaluation team|Indepth evaluation|Onsite evaluation","","GELFAND, HENRY M.|PIOTROW, PHYLLIS T.","","16 Jan 1976","","","","CONSULTANT REPORT FOR THE EVALUATION OF POPULATION COUNCIL ACTIVITIES UNDER AID/CSD-2897, 1973-1975","","PD-AAC-111","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc3MTE2","Development Support","9363005"

The sample projects resulted in a per household increase in paddy area of .07 ha and in improvement in the ratio of fully irrigated to total paddy of 56.6 points.  Overall changes included the following:  the double cropping ratio increased from 135.6 to 148.5 %; the area devoted to the production of new high-yielding varieties (HYV's) increased 21.8% while that for the production of native rice declined 28.3%; labor inputs for Tongil rice and native varieties increased 2.1% and 3.7%, respectively, but declined 1.1% for barley; the transplanting date for rice was advanced from 9 to 15 days due to the more widespread cultivation of HYV's; and the quantity of chemical fertilizer used per 10 ha increased 16.4%.  Pure yield increases associated with the projects tended to be higher for rice and lower for barley than anticipated -- Tongil rice yields increased 17.4%; native rice, 35%; common barley, 7.5%; naked barley, 9.9%; and white potato yields, 11.7%.  While favorable, such changes may precipitate future problems affecting labor requirements, agricultural inputs (chemicals, machinery, information), and crop production. Among the many general and component-specific conclusions drawn are: Lack of sufficient information or inputs rather than poor irrigation facilities may account for why HYV's were adopted less in northern than in southern provinces.  Shifts in labor were especially acute--improvements in paddy acreage, drainage, and irrigation reduced labor required for plowing and water management activities and increased labor required for seed bed preparation and transplanting. Finally, the IRR's associated with the sampled areas are likely to be greater than planned.","Evaluation period: 10 Oct 1974-[31 Dec 1976]","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","12/1/1976 12:00:00 AM","","RICE|BARLEY|IRRIGATION|Land development|Agricultural inputs|Cultivars|Crop yield|Agricultural production|Economic analysis","Korea R","","","002270 - Korea.

"Evaluates documented response of Tulane University Technical Assistance Project, 8/75-3/76, to modifications of Phase 1 (Plan and Design) and Phase 2 (Implementation) of Research Program in Health Delivery Prototype Services (PRIMOPS) in Colombia.  This program was created to develop, implement, and evaluate health delivery system model providing wide coverage of services, including family planning, at reasonable cost to Ministry of Health, State of Valle, Health District of Cali. Phase 1 is essentially complete and satisfactory, except for refinement of design cost analysis study and lack of computer-programmer capabilities.  Tulane University has fulfilled its obligations to supprot and train three counterparts in PRIMOPS/Cali (PIC) in order to accomodate expansion of progrm to other areas.  Satisfactory consultation has been provided to PIC as requested in identifying problems and solutions. The model design for delivery of health objectives: rational patient flow to different health service providers, delegation of tasks to most efficient levels of service, and extension of health care and disease prevention to the home.  Model design is incomplete in measures for integrating training and supervision, and concern continues about quality of data collection, flow, cleaning, reduction, and analysis necessary for evaluation of program as a model. Indications are that projected simulation models would be invalid until data quality improves.  Evaluator recommends that hospital data be largely excluded from health system evaluation due to data flow constraints. Selections from Tulane University Report of 3/76 indicate a positive response to areas of concern expressed above, including integration of training and supervision, design of monitoring system, methodology for choosing control area and area profile, and evaluation of acceptance of health services and their effect on morbidity, mortality, and family planning.","TASK ORDER NO. 5|Evaluation period: 1 Jul 1974-30 Jun 1976","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/TA-BOA-1070","","6/1/1976 12:00:00 AM","","Health research|Data collection|Health care planning|Health policy|Health care|Cost benefit analysis|Health delivery|Operations research|Health care administration|Technical assistance|Limited data","Colombia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAP105.pdf","436 KB","000262 - American Public Health Association","","","English","application/pdf","Pre evaluation data|Evaluation team|Onsite evaluation","","HABICHT, JEAN P.|RIZZO, EDWARD E.","","30 Jun 1976","","","","REPORT OF APHA CONSULTANTS RELATIVE TO TULANE/PRIMOPS (RESEARCH PROGRAM IN HEALTH DELIVERY PROTOTYPE SERVICES - COLOMBIA) DOCUMENTATION (PHASE 1 AND 2)","","PD-AAP-105","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc3NDI4","Technical Assistance","9310055"
"Evaluates project to rehabilitate small and medium enterprises in industry, services, and commerce which were victimized by the earthquake of 3/31/70 in Peru.  This loan completion report covers the period from the signing of the loan agreement (7/25/72) to final disbursement (12/31/75) and was based on visits to sub-borrowers and survey data. The loan was used to establish a fund (CRECE fund) in the Central Reserve Bank of Peru.  Sub-loans were granted for investment in the reconstruction of 106 small businesses and the development of 96 new enterprises.  Approximately 30 sub-loans were made to entrepreneurs (mostly individuals) involved in the production of goods or provision of services directly related to construction.  The project also resulted in at least doubling employment in CRECE-funded enterprises and in introducing sub-borrowers to the modern credit system.  Two patterns were noticed concerning repayment performance.  First, the overall record is significantly better in the sierra than on the coast.  Second, repayment performances of service enterprises were generally superior to those of industry. In aggregate terms, delinquency rates appear high compared to traditional commercial lending experience, but the record is quite respectable considering the nature of the project. Although project objectives were accomplished, success has been costly, both in direct per capita costs of credit and indirect administrative costs.  Unfortunately, it appears as if the institutional impact will not be a lasting one, which may be the cause of the current severe liquidity shortage in Peru or could reflect the lack of adequate commercial incentive inherent in this project. Finally, the technical and administrative performance of the new implementing agency, the regional office for the Development of the Earthquake Zone (ORDEZA), was less than optimal, owing to its conflicting and overburdening dual role in technical design and in credit approvals, and to the lack of personnel, policy, and organizational stability.  The CRECE fund will be used in the future to support cooperative enterprises.","Loan no. 527-L-053|Evaluation period: 25 Jul 1972-31 Dec 1975","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","4/1/1976 12:00:00 AM","","Small scale enterprises|Earthquakes|Disaster relief|Institution building|Financial institutions|Credit|Beneficiary interviews|Limited data plus","Peru","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAI460A1.pdf","348 KB","008591 - USAID.

"Evaluates, for the period 4/25/69 to 6/30/76, loan to the Central American (CA) Bank for Economic Integration (CABEI) to help CABEI to promote economic integration by financing infrastructure subprojects, especially in the public sector. Evaluation methodology is not indicated. Terminal Disbursement Date (TDD) was extended twice, to 3/31/76 and to 6/30/76, to permit subproject completion.  Loan agreement was amended l0/21/70 to permit procurement from Code 940 countries and to exclude CA Member Countries for loan purposes; and amended 4/10/74 to delete the paragraph on security assignment and add an article on CABEI's obligation to AID. Loan funds were used to finance construction and engineering supervision on 15 highways, one airport, an Atlantic Coast inland waterway, and two highway signal projects, all of which are complete. Construction of the Gotera/Perquin Highway in El Salvador, however, is only 80% complete due to heavy rains and contractor's need to do other Government of El Salvador priority work.  Completion is not expected before 6/30/77. To avoid a further TDD extension, it was agreed to transfer $1.1 million in construction completed under Loan 014 to Loan 008.  A report on each subproject is contained in CABEI's final report of 6/76. CABEI has fully complied with the Loan Agreement, including the special covenants on a $40 million guarantee by member countries of CABEI borrowings and on export diversification and tourism. SIECA and CABEI jointly financed ""CA Manual of Maintenance of Highways"" and also produced manuals on regional highway signs and signals and on loan control and vehicle dimensions. ROCAP and CABEI are currently conducting an ex-post benefit/cost analysis (scheduled for completion in 11/76) on several roads constructed under the program, with stress on their development impact. No problems are foreseen with CABEI's compliance with post-disbursement period covenants.  ROCAP will monitor loan amortization and will periodically report to AID/W on progress of the uncompleted subproject.","Loan no. 596-L-008|Evaluation period: 25 Apr 1969-30 Jun 1976","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","9/1/1976 12:00:00 AM","","Road construction|Roads|Cost studies|Road maintenance|Airports|Transportation facility construction|Economic integration|Limited data","Central America","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAI464B1.pdf","171 KB","003289 - U.S. Dept. of Commerce.

"Evaluates project to assist the Planned Parenthood Federation of America/Family Planning International Assistance (PPFA/FPIA) in institutionalizing and expanding the outreach of family planning (FP) services in LDC's.  Evaluation covers the period 2/1/75-4/12/76 and consists of an annual review by the A.I.D. Project Manager. FPIA's performance is improving and a recent AID-FPIA agreement will clarify FPIA's policy objectives.  FPIA has implemented the recommendations offered in the 2/75 evaluation and has improved its management of subgrants.  In addition, FPIA has demonstrated its ability to identify and develop innovative, cost-effective projects with LDC groups.  Nevertheless, communications between FPIA field and headquarter staff have been poor and problems exist concerning the timely submission of subproject proposals. FPIA's specific accomplishments include the following:  FPIA has emphasized service programs through the promotion/support of non-medical distribution of FP commodities and by encouraging the integration of voluntary sterilization, particularly minilaparotomy, into FP programs. Also it has developed FP projects with LDC women's organizations and increased its efforts to engender local support so as to minimize long-term dependence on FPIA funding.  FPIA is exploring ways to expand commodity distribution through church-related and other PVO channels. Also, FPIA has filled its technical staff positions, established field personnel in four LDC regions, and appointed a new project director. Efforts are underway to improve its communication network. Progress reports are now systematically answered by technical backstoppers in New York.  FPIA field personnel were also delegated greater responsibility in subgrant management, and subgrant proposals and disbursements are now issued in a more timely manner. Additional A.I.D. funds should be provided for FY 1976. Several recommendations to improve FPIA policy and management are also made, e.g., FPIA should continue to support PVO efforts in FP activities and further upgrade its management and administrative practices.","Evaluation period: 1 FEB 1975-12 APR 1976","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","4/1/1976 12:00:00 AM","","FAMILY PLANNING|Development program evaluation|Family planning services|Delivery systems|Family planning education|Family planning promotion programs|Information storage and retrieval systems|Logistics|Contraceptive agents and devices|Administrative occupations|Financial management|Contraceptive distribution|Cost benefit analysis|Sterilization (birth control)|Private voluntary organizations|Limited data","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAH516.pdf","3,468 KB","000148 - USAID.

"THE PURPOSE OF THE EVALUATION IS TO EXAMINE AND COMPARE EXPERIENCE UNDER EDUCATION SECTOR LOANS TO DETERMINE THE IMPLICATIONS OF THAT EXPERIENCE FOR FUTURE ASSISTANCE TO EDUCATION PROGRAMS IN OTHER COUNTRIES, NOT TO APPRAISE THE SUCCESS OR FAILURE OF INDIVIDUAL PROGRAMS. THE MAJOR ELEMENTS OF THE HOST COUNTRY EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS SUPPORTED BY THE AID LOANS WERE VERY SIMILAR, INVOLVING MAJOR CHANGES IN CURRICULUM TO SUBSTITUTE A HIGHER VOCATIONAL CONTENT AND AN ORIENTATION TOWARD WORK INSTEAD OF ACADEMICS; TEACHER TRAINING; AND THE CONSTRUCTION AND EQUIPPING OF MULTI-PURPOSE SCHOOLS. IN CONTRAST TO THESE COMMON ELEMENTS, THE AID APPROACH IN SUPPORT OF SECTOR PROGRAMS DIFFERED SIGNIFICANTLY AMONG THE COUNTRIES. METHODS OF LOAN IMPLEMENTATION VARIED FROM COUNTRY TO COUNTRY WITH VARIATIONS DEPENDENT IN PART ON THE PURPOSES OF THE LOAN AND THE APPROACH TO SUPPORT OF THE SECTOR. THE NATURE AND EXTENT OF AID EVALUATION ALSO DIFFERED FROM COUNTRY TO COUNTRY. NO PROVISION WAS MADE UNDER ANY OF THE LOANS FOR EVALUATION AT THE PROJECT PURPOSE LEVELS AND BEYOND. SUFFICIENT TIME HAS NOT YET ELAPSED TO PERMIT AN APPRAISAL OF THE EFFECTS OF THE PROGRAMS UPON BROADER PURPOSES AND GOALS. THERE IS APPRECIABLE IMPROVEMENT IN THE NUMBER OF SCHOOLS BUILT, THE NUMBER OF CLASSROOMS PROVIDED, THE NUMBER OF TEACHERS AND OTHER EDUCATIONAL PERSONNEL TRAINED, BUDGETARY AND PAYMENT PROCEDURES, AND PLANNING AND IMPLEMENTATION PROCEDURES. THE EVALUATION CONTAINS CHAPTERS ON THE PROGRAMS; AID ANALYSIS; PROGRAM PHILOSOPHY, ASSUMPTIONS AND STRATEGY; METHODS OF IMPLEMENTATION AND EVALUATION; PROGRAM ACHIEVEMENTS; AND IMPLICATIONS FOR SECTOR APPROACH CONCEPTS. THE EVALUATORS MADE NINE RECOMMENDATIONS REGARDING SUCH MATTERS AS REDEFINING PURPOSES AND EXPECTATIONS OF THE SECTOR PROGRAMS, SETTING UP AN EVALUATION SYSTEM, RECONSIDERING THE ROLE AND NATURE OF SECTOR ASSESSMENTS, AND CONSIDERING ALTERNATIVES FOR DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF THE EDUCATION SECTOR PROGRAM.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","12/1/1976 12:00:00 AM","","Educational development|Educational research|Educational facilities|Multiple use","Panama|Colombia|Brazil","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAD115.pdf","2,916 KB","000108 - USAID.
