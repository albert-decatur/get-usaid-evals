"Evaluates project to construct a storage dam and irrigation facilities covers the period 1960-78 and is based on field research and socioeconomic and financial analyses. The project changed the region from one largely devoted to cereals and pastures into one in which citrus fruits, market vegetables, and sugar beets predominate.  A large dairy herd has arisen where none existed before.  Net return per ha has increased 9 to 13 times in current or 4 to 6 times in constant dirham.  In terms of incremental returns, the benefit-cost ratio is 1.25 and the internal rate of return is 10.5% in real terms.  Almost 2/5 of project benefits go to farm managers, over 1/3 to farm laborers, and 1/4 to landowners. The project has had several socioeconomic benefits: the increased supply of food has lowered its cost; the development of agricultural processing firms has been stimulated; peasants -- except on the Bou Areg -- who formerly produced primarily for household consumption have become commodity producers; farm employment has increased; the land reform program has provided land to 10,000 people; and an active merchant class has arisen.  The region has returned more to the public coffers than it would have had there been no project. There are four major reasons for the project's success: the region's natural agricultural potential; the existing supply of experienced laborers; sound project management; and the region's reasonably efficient market structures. It is recommended to: determine why some farmers cannot obtain irrigation water and remedy the situation; ensure that credit for irrigation is available to needy farmers; provide incentives to farmers who produce cereal for home consumption to farm their land more productively or sell it to someone who will; focus extension activities on younger farmers and those likely to take over farm management; gradually increase the charge for water; and encourage livestock production by farmers outside the irrigated area. Because of their relative inefficiency, transferring state farm lands to small farmers should be considered.  It is hoped that project returns will alleviate economic inequities still existing in the area.","French ed.: PD-AAU-133|Evaluation period: 1960-1978","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/ne-C-1507","","8/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Irrigated farming|Dams|Land development|Agricultural credit|Agricultural diversification|Vegetables|Agricultural product marketing|Crop production|Farmer training|Citrus fruits|Crop yield|Sociology research|Economic research|Agricultural economics|Economic analysis|Land reform|Water supply structures|Employment|Beneficiary count","Middle East","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAI738.pdf","6,381 KB","001234 - University of Minnesota.

"Assesses the organizational, administrative, and financial aspects of the Government of Nepal's (GON's) Community Health and Integration Project (CHIP), based on site visits and discussions with GON personnel. The lack of fiscal and financial management systems is the CHIP's greatest problem.  In addition, the CHIP headquarters is inadequate and the CHIP staff too small to accomplish stated objectives.  In terms of the logistical support system, the supply of drugs and equipment for health facilities is inadequate and their distribution and storage poor; the private drug contractor is often slow, inefficient, and expensive. Continuing, administrative and personal procedures are lacking and supervision is insufficient at all levels. The reporting system is too complex and the reporting staff inadequate. Training for village health workers is too short. Lastly, a proposal for 1981-82 CHIP activities is too vague. Technical problems include the continued incidence of malaria in several integrated districts; differences in the efficiency of health care delivery in the six project districts; and the lack of an adequate methodology and process for identifying districts ready for integration. Further, family planning services lack good organization, contraceptives are frequently stored improperly, and laparoscopy is used more frequently than the simpler mini-laparotomy.  Nineteen recommendations are made to address the above problems.","Evaluation period: Dec. 1980-Apr 1981","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/dspe-C-0053","","7/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Financial management|Management training|Community participation|Primary health care|Malaria|Disease prevention and control|Development program evaluation|Health delivery|Operations research|Clinics|Personnel management|Medical education|Indigenous education|Community health workers|Integrated health care|Family planning services|Health care|Health care administration|Beneficiary count","Nepal","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAL244.pdf","1,135 KB","000262 - American Public Health Association","","","English","application/pdf","Pre evaluation data|Indepth evaluation|Onsite evaluation","","Hays, Charles W.","","20 Jul 1981","","","","Examination of the organizational, administrative, and financial structures of the community health and integration project of the Ministry of Health, Nepal","","PD-AAL-244","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTUyNzM4","Nepal","3670126"
"Evaluates project to increase production of edible oils in India through support of an integrated system of oilseed cooperatives (co-ops).  Special evaluation covers the period 1/79-3/81 and is based on document review, site visits, and discussions with officials from USAID/I, the Cooperative League of the U.S.A. (CLUSA), and the National Dairy Development Board (NDDB), the implementor. The project -- representing the largest commitment of P.L. 480, Title II commodities in history ($160 million) -- is well-conceived, feasible, and necessary.  Farmers receive 10% over the market price and thus reap significant income benefits.  Also, 3% of project funds are allocated to research and development. Nonetheless, production enhancement activities have several flaws: field teams are few and poorly organized; farm laborers and sharecroppers are excluded from co-ops; credit and input supply systems have repeatedly broken down; improved seed is scarce; demonstration plots show poor experimental design and weak recordkeeping; price supports have risen due to high market prices; plans for farmer and extensionist training are lacking; only two of eight district farms have been established; linkages with agricultural research institutions are weak; and village and block storage facilities are inadequate. Surprisingly, CLUSA monitors have not recognized the seriousness of these problems. While acquisition of the Bhavnagar Vegetable Products plant was a wise move, additional and more sanitary processing equipment, especially for soybeans and other proteins, is needed to meet high domestic demand. In terms of marketing, the project does not contemplate using donated oil to build a buffer stock but rather plans to purchase soybean oil to resell, thus expanding marketing channels.  This would be a safe and profitable venture. Because the relationship between USAID/I, CLUSA, and the NDDB leaves much to be desired, it is recommended that USAID/I demand and that CLUSA provide monthly reports and meetings on project progress; that CLUSA hire an agronomist to monitor progress; and that USAID/I take a more active role in project management.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","4/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Oil crops|Agricultural cooperatives","India","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAI847.pdf","3,393 KB","001659 - Cooperative League of the United States of America (CLUSA)","","008557 - USAID.

"Analyzes the feasibility of a comprehensive rural health project to reduce fertility and child mortality in India.  Report is based on review of health, nutrition, and population documents and interviews with appropriate Indian officials. A substantial reduction in infant mortality in India depends upon improved antenatal care; better maternal nutrition during pregnancy and lactation; prompt, simple, and accessible treatment of diarrheal diseases and respiratory infections in infants; and improved nutritional status among infants and young children.  Existing programs must include alternatives to sterilization (which has received almost sole emphasis to date) such as I.U.D.'s, condoms, and oral contraceptives.  Also needed are better evaluation and logistical supply systems. To successfully implement the proposed project, India's state and national governments should:  (1) allow peripheral health workers to use one or two antibiotics under carefully specified circumstances and enlist the support of prominent Indian physicians who accept this approach; (2) recruit intelligent middle-aged women who have borne children and practice family planning to be community health workers; (3) recruit Indians with good management skills and insight into the problems of the health care system; (4) develop evaluation procedures, define measureable standards for evaluating health care workers and the entire health care system, collect baseline data, and devise a methodology for collecting the minimal essential evaluation and monitoring information; and (5) assign priority to the development of pilot health centers which demonstrate an optimum health care methodology in concrete terms and provide a setting for training community health volunteers and other workers.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/dspe-C-0053","","1/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Family planning|Child mortality","India","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAI493.pdf","229 KB","000262 - American Public Health Association","","","English","application/pdf","","","Wray, Joe D.","","8 Jan 1981","","","","Report on a consultation to the USAID/India integrated rural health and population project","","PD-AAI-493","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTUyNzY3","India","3860468"
"Evaluates project to increase agricultural productivity and farmer income in rural Swaziland.  Final evaluation covers the period 10/71-10/79; no methodology is stated. The project goal of improving the lives of the masses was largely achieved.  Nine Swazi civil servants were trained and posted in the positions for which they were trained.  Rural infrastructure construction - including 800 km of fencing, 400 km of access roads, 20,000 acres of terraced arable land, and a number of irrigation schemes - is 95% complete.  A heavy equipment repair shop and five equipment field service units were constructed and equipped in 1973, and all are currently functioning.  An 11,500 acre breeding and demonstration ranch opened ahead of schedule and is being run by managers trained under the project.  Due to delays on the part of the Swaziland Development and Savings Bank, the entire $750,000 production credit fund was not disbursed.  In 1977, at the request of the Bank, A.I.D. deobligated $231,736.99 of the project loan money.  By January 1980, $992,195 in production credit was being provided to 3,447 small farmers.  Repayment is expected to begin 3/85. Despite these significant accomplishments, the project purpose was not achieved.  While productivity has increased through the use of hybrid seeds, fertilizer, and pesticides, and provision of production credit has made the purchase of these inputs easier, overall domestic food production has remained relatively static.  Farmers have failed to respond as enthusiastically as expected to the various project inputs primarily because there are more favorable off farm employment and earning opportunities than had been foreseen.  Future projects should carefully consider such factors in project design.  In addition, the project area was reduced from six to four rural development areas at the request of the Swazi Government. No further monitoring, evaluation, or reporting is recommended except for the monitoring of loan repayment.  A final fiscal report should be prepared by USAID/S and the remaining unexpended balance of $12,280.70 deobligated.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","7/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Food production|Rural development|Limited data","Swaziland","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAH422.pdf","174 KB","","","","English","application/pdf","Final EOPS","","","","17 Jul 1981","","","","Project completion report : Swaziland rural development","","PD-AAH-422","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTUyNzkw","Southern Africa Regional","6900024"
"Evaluates project to develop activities promoting cooperatives (co-ops) in India.  Special evaluation covers the period 1978-3/81 and is based on site visits and document review. The project produced positive results and developed a replicable co-op assistance model.  The Cooperative League of the United States of America (CLUSA) developed six projects, the most important of which was the the enormous Oilseeds Growers Co-op Project (OGCP), a product of extensive CLUSA involvement.  The projects were funded by USAID/I and other donors (e.g., UNICEF) and were in such areas as oilseeds management and milk grid computerization.  However, much responsibility rested with India's National Dairy Development Board (NDDB), the co-op involved in five of the projects; four were already being developed; CLUSA's role was, in some cases, peripheral; and project size varied greatly.  Three other projects are being planned; 10 initiatives were abandoned as infeasible. The CLUSA representative's performance was mixed -- he devoted too much attention to the OGCP, neglecting problems in the Oilseeds Management Project, and his reporting on grant progress was inadequate. However, he did initiate contacts with 17 Indian and 26 foreign co-ops or organizations, attended various local co-op sponsored events, and oversaw professional exchanges between U.S. and Indian co-ops. The ""India model"", characterized by an independent, long-term CLUSA commitment to providing expert assistance to Indian co-ops, was judged a success.  Nonetheless, CLUSA's ability to assist a wide spectrum of Indian co-ops, use U.S. co-ops' expertise, and maintain its autonomy vis-a-vis the Indian Government and USAID/I have yet to be clearly demonstrated. It is recommended that: (1) the grant be renewed for 3 years; (2) more detailed evaluation criteria be prepared; (3) CLUSA's pre-project and project implementation assistance roles be carefully delineated, with emphasis on the former, half of which should be given to co-ops other than the NDDB; (5) the CLUSA Representative provide more detailed and useable information on each project; and (6) CLUSA reassess staff requirements and focus the duties of the representative more explicitly.","Evaluation period: 1978-Mar 1981","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","9/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Cooperatives|Business enterprises|Management operations|Marketing|Agricultural cooperatives|Oil crops|Information dissemination|Development project design|Development project implementation|Development project evaluation|Private voluntary organizations","India","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAI866.pdf","1,332 KB","001046 - Rural Development Services","","008557 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to improve the managerial and technical level of India's national oilseeds cooperative.  Evaluation covers the period 8/78-3/81 and is based on site visits and interviews with the Cooperative League of the United States of America (CLUSA) advisors and Indian counterparts. CLUSA and India's National Cooperative Development Corporation (NCDC) achieved significant progress -- the operations manual (OM) is nearly complete; informal in-plant training is on-going; and significant technical advances in oil processing were achieved. Nevertheless, the expected training of six Indian trainers and a general manager and staff of eight for each plant was unrealistic although may, with a 6-month extension, be feasible on a reduced scale. CLUSA's technical advisor wrote a lengthy oil processing manual, but made few field visits, had no experience in expeller or solvent oil extraction, and offered little counterpart training.  By contrast, the management advisor (MA) was exceptional.  He worked with three NCDC counterparts, contributed to the OM, visited 12 processing plants, and at five of these provided intensive assistance which markedly increased lint recovery, expeller through-put, and/or solvent extractor output and lowered costs. CLUSA's India representative provided adequate reporting and logistical oversight, but made infrequent field visits and devoted too much time to the larger Oilseeds Growers Cooperative Project (OCGP). The NCDC initiated a groundnut promotion scheme and a successful employee incentive plan, but overemphasized the OM as a cure-all and did not assign counterparts on a full-time basis or provide them the expected back-up. It is recommended that CLUSA: (1) request a 6-month extension of the project and of the MA's tour to 7/81; (2) recruit skilled practitioners rather than academics as advisors and require them to make frequent field visits; (3) ensure that the NCDC provides adequate counterpart participation; (4) postpone a U.S. tour by NCDC technicians until late 1981; (5) brief all new NCDC staff; (6) discuss with the NCDC the envisioned use of the OM; (7) address the Representative's over-involvement with the OGCP; (8) obtain a waiver on air travel restrictions for NCDC counterparts; and (9) require expatriate staff to submit brief monthly reports.","Evaluation period: Aug 1978-Mar 1981","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","4/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Oil crops|Food processing|Agricultural cooperatives|Marketing|Management training|Management operations|Cooperatives|Business enterprises|Indigenous education|Teacher training|Private voluntary organizations|Food industry|Vegetable oils|Food processing technology","India","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAI867.pdf","1,343 KB","001046 - Rural Development Services","","","English","application/pdf","Indepth evaluation|Onsite evaluation","","Hatch, John K.","","6 Apr 1981","","","","Evaluation report on the NCDC/CLUSA oilseeds management OPG","","PD-AAI-867","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTUyODAw","Asia Regional","4980251"
"Evaluates project to establish a nationally replicable, low-cost, integrated primary health care (PHC) delivery system to serve South Korea's rural poor.  Final evaluation covers a period ending 10/80 and is based on site visits and interviews with project officers and USAID/K and Korean Government officials. The Korean Health Development Institute (KHDI), the implementing agency, successfully established township-level public health units (PHU's) which were found to be clean; adequately equipped, staffed, and supplied; and possessed a satisfactory referral system.  Community health practitioners performed creditably (despite being underpaid and overworked) and apparently helped PHU's meet project targets in maternal/child care, family planning, and immunization services.  The major weakness of PHU's - tuberculosis control - resulted mainly from inadequate health education and lack of patient cooperation and interest. Community health centers (CHC's), the county-level health care dispensaries and supervisory centers, enjoy good facilities, management, and supply.  CHC problems included a satisfactory to poor referral system and staff dissatisfaction due to low pay, heavy workload, and borrowing of staff by other government agencies.  Village health aides were found to be competent and dedicated but expressed a need for more specialized training. Overall, the KHDI program enjoyed high acceptabililty and incurred lower costs than previous programs; however, it also stressed curative over preventive care like its predecessors.  It is recommended that the KHDI intensify anti-tuberculosis efforts, re-examine the role of non-physician practitioners, emphasize preventive medicine, and take steps to reduce attrition among health personnel.  For the long-term, it is recommended that the Korean Government replicate the KHDI program nationwide and that KHDI provide technical assistance in implementing a national health care system, develop new demonstration projects, and conduct health care research and policy analysis and planning. Recommendations to improve training and program evaluation are also provided.","AID Loan No. 489-U-092","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","AID/dspe-C-0053","","1/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Rural areas|Clinics|Health workers|Assistants|Health outreach services|Evaluation methodology|Health facilities|Health care|Information and referral services|Maternal child health care|family planning|Immunizations|Community health workers|Primary health care|Health delivery|Pilot projects|Institution building","Korea R","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAI491.pdf","1,536 KB","000262 - American Public Health Association","","","English","application/pdf","Pre evaluation data|Onsite evaluation","","MacCorquodale, Donald W.|Davis, James E.|et al.","","5 Jan 1981","","","","Final evaluation of the Korea health demonstration project","","PD-AAI-491","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTUyODA5","Korea, Republic of","4890710"
"Evaluates project to institutionalize a small farmer integrated agricultural production and marketing system in the Philippines. Special evaluation covers the period 4/79-4/81 and is based on site visits and interviews with project staff. Progress has been made in each of the project's five thrusts. The National Policy Thrust has demonstrated to the Ministry of Agriculture the value of accurate and timely economic information and has improved the capacity of the Bureau of Agricultural Economics (BAEcon) to generate reliable statistical estimates. It is recommended that a statistical advisory committee be created to integrate statistical support systems; a national policy analysis capacity be organized; the challenge of regional policy analysis capabilities be confronted; agribusiness/small farmer linkages be fully examined; and national and regional abilities to analyze food policy alternatives be enhanced. The Central Luzon State University (CLSU) and the University of the Philippines at Los Banos have achieved most of the objectives of the Academic Thrust with the formation of a B.A. major in agricultural marketing and two M.A. programs in agricultural marketing and agribusiness management.  This thrust can be terminated provided all current and fall 1981 enrollees are permitted to complete their degrees. Under the Technological Package Thrust, CLSU has devised a replicable system to develop, test, and disseminate small farmer technological packages. CLSU ought to increase staff and student involvement in the project and expand research efforts with other institutions.  A study should be made of possible uses of the food/feed grain processing facility. The Extension/Outreach Thrust has developed a model of extension services delivery, which is being considered for national expansion, directed toward small farmers and rural families. This thrust should be terminated as planned when current activities are completed. Lastly, the Marketing/Agribusiness Thrust has supported the development of two regional agribusiness councils and two market assistance centers and has improved the viability of at least 14 area marketing cooperatives. A.I.D. and the Government of the Philippines should give priority to developing a policy environment conducive to improved agribusiness/small farmer linkages.","Evaluation period: Apr 1979-Apr 1981","Special Evaluation","Documents","492-0302-S-00-1024-00","","4/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Small farms|Farmers|Agricultural product marketing|Agricultural production|Agricultural training|Agricultural policy|Agricultural planning|Agricultural research|Agricultural economics|AGRIBUSINESS|Technology transfer|Agricultural education|Agricultural extension|Graduate education|Agriculture|Statistical data|Delivery systems|Agricultural inputs","Philippines","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAI773.pdf","1,966 KB","","","008592 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to increase small farm income by providing credit to rural cooperatives (RC) in Panama.  Impact evaluation covers period 11/74-6/81 and is based on survey data and site visits. The project was very successful.  A Revolving Loan Fund (RLF) was established to provide credit to RC farmers, and institutional development was promoted by providing RC's with agronomic technical assistance, management subsidies, training, and other services.  For a detailed account of project outputs as well as shortfalls, see the abstract of the attached PES (PD-AAI-683). A survey of 24 of the 46 RC's benefitting from the project indicated that assets increased by 119%, savings by 96%, profits by 81%, and patronage refunds by 35%.  Moreover, rural households were able to capture otherwise unobtainable yield and income opportunities (e.g., fertilizer and insecticide use increased, and traditional farmers were able to undertake small livestock operations). Other significant but unexpected benefits also resulted.  The creation of the RLF for exlusive use by RC's helped reorient Panamanian Government policy away from its prior emphasis on group farms, enabled RC's to demonstrate their viability, and resulted in RC's becoming the Agricultural Development Bank's preferred borrowers.  Greater unity and cooperation among credit, consumer, and agricultural RC's was fostered and in turn lead to the establishment of the Autonomous Cooperative Institute (IPACOOP) and the passage of a National Cooperative Law. However, the project in fact may have been too successful in that it awakened a demand for credit among RC farmers which far exceeds the present supply of loanable funds. With this in mind, it is recommended that in a fixed follow-on project: (1) the RLF be expanded by $6 million; (2) borrowers be required to provide a 20% rather than 10% share capital subscription on loans; (3) the commerical debt of COAGRO (the agricultural RC federation) be refinanced on a matching basis up to $3 million; (4) successful RC's in each region be provided subsidies to assist smaller, weaker RC's; and (5) IPACOOP continue to be strengthened in the areas of audit, training, supervision, and support of RC's.","Evaluation period: Nov 1974-Jun 1981","Special Evaluation","Documents","525-0187-C-00-1006-00","","6/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural cooperatives|Agricultural credit|Credit cooperatives|Financial management|Cooperatives|Business enterprises|Financing|farm income|Credit|Consumers|Institution building|Revolving fund|Sampling method","Panama","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAI674.pdf","4,666 KB","001046 - Rural Development Services","","008589 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to help the Caribbean Epidemiology Center (CAREC) provide epidemiological surveillance (ES) training and support to member countries (MC's).  Special evaluation covers the period 10/79-1/81 and is based on document review, interviews with project and MC personnel, and visits to six MC's. Of 24 project outputs, 21 are on target.  The project has effected major improvements in ES.  It has fostered the creation of public health positions for designated epidemiologists, surveillance statistical officers (SSO's), and deputy epidemiologists and has trained the persons filling these positions. A CAREC training unit established by the project has organized both CAREC-based and in-country training in public health, ES, and microbiology.  Three short-term ES traineeships have been provided; workshops were held for designated epidemiologists and SSO's; and 11 in-country training sessions were held for public health nurses and inspectors and medical officers.  Epidemiologic investigation supplies have been purchased and the CAREC Surveillance Report has greatly enlarged its circulation.  Medical traineeships and medical student clerkships, however, have lacked targeted numbers of candidates and computer use has been delayed by electrical and delivery problems. CAREC has provided MC laboratories with formal training on bacteriology and malaria, workshops for their directors, proficiency testing, referrals for cultures and specimens, onsite training in microbiology and laboratory management, and limited emergency supplies. CAREC has also provided training, equipment, and evaluation for the Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI).  All CAREC activities have been well received and it is essential that CAREC be maintained as a regional resource. Key recommendations are to: (1) emphasize outbreak/problem recognition and control; (2) seek country-specific solutions to ES and EPI shortcomings; (3) improve EPI management and cold storage equipment; (4) gear future training more to specific MC needs and formalize training objectives and evaluation procedures; (5) train more public health nurses; and (6) intensify efforts to identify major causes of death and illness (including noncommunicable diseases) and determine effective prevention and control measures, especially for gastroenteritis.","Attached to PD-AAJ-137|Evaluation period: Jan 1978-Jan 1981","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","2/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Disease prevention and control|Epidemiology|Public health care|Beneficiary interviews","Eastern Caribbean","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAJ137A.pdf","2,238 KB","001757 - USAID.

"Evaluates project, implemented by CARE, to assist the Kenyan Ministry of Water Development (MOWD) to foster self-help water projects. Final evaluation covers FY76-77 and is based on an 8/76 mid-term evaluation and CARE/Kenya's final report. Of the 49 sub-projects, 38 are fully operational.  Although equipment has been installed at the other 11 sites, implementation has been slow due to weak community support and inadequate MOWD technical expertise. Many sites have received further assistance from the Government of Kenya (GOK) or CARE, and CARE is still working to upgrade local management capabilities.  Most projects were in the Central, Eastern, and Rift Valley provinces since the MOWD was better able to field design teams and meet CARE selection criteria in these areas. Progress has lagged most in Nyanza and Western Provinces.  The financial breakdown has been as follows:  CARE (6-7%); USAID/K (16-19%); GOK (25-46%); and communities (32-38%).  Data on the project's impact on women's role as collectors of water is expected soon.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","8/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Water resources|Natural resource development|Limited data","Kenya","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAL549.pdf","680 KB","008565 - USAID.

"Evaluates two Entente Fund (EF) projects to increase, respectively, food and livestock production in West Africa (WA).  Evaluation covers the period 1976-12/81 and is based on document review, interviews with project personnel and EF staff, and site visits. Fifteen small-producer subprojects (SP) -- eight in food and seven in livestock production -- have been implemented in five EF countries in such areas as staple food crops and alternative animal protein, marketing, transportation, credit, and farmer-oriented research. Managers were trained for each SP, as planned, but only 11 of a planned 20 Africans are receiving U.S. training. In addition, four 18-month research studies on livestock production and marketing were conducted for seven WA countries.  Some SP's suffered from faulty assumptions about actual conditions, thus indicating a need for further studies. SP's to stimulate village institutions, e.g., cooperatives, have been highly successful, and project findings have helped shape national agricultural policy and have spurred regional seminars. Problems include the lower than expected economic returns from SP's (although adequate data are lacking); failure to develop a plan to finance SP's after project completion; reduction of the Project Management Team (PMT) to one in late 1981; EF's loss of the responsibility formerly given it by the Entente Council for coordination and sectoral analyses among member states; and EF's failure to comply with several A.I.D. reporting and monitoring regulations. Recommendations are that: (1) the PMT be restored to four members as soon as possible; (2) EF respond to the 5/79 letter of the Regional Economic Development Services Office (REDSO/WA) under pain of discontinuance of disbursement; (3) REDSO/WA hold regular monthly meetings with the PMT; (4) EF prepare a more adequate quarterly report, especially in regard to SP costs and financial viability, and comply with A.I.D. regulations; (5) PMT formalize and simplify reports on SP's and include in them data on technology feasibility and SP financial viability and send REDSO/WA copies of reports from SP managers and technicians; and (6) recurrent SP costs and the willingness of EF members to assume them be assessed.","Attached to PD-AAJ-079|Evaluation period: 1976-Dec 1981","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","12/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","entente loan|Integrated agricultural production|Food production|Institution building|Small farms|Farmers|Agricultural production credit|Agricultural research|Agricultural production|Livestock|Animal husbandry|Agricultural policy|Agricultural planning|Agricultural product marketing|Agricultural management|Agricultural training|Agricultural technicians|Management operations|Beneficiary interviews","West Africa","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAJ079A.pdf","6,582 KB","000027 - USAID.

"Evaluates subproject (of the Caribbean Regional Development Training Project) to upgrade public and private sector managerial and technical skills in 12 Caribbean countries.  Special evaluation covers the period 6/80-8/81 and is based on document review and visits to Barbados and Guyana. Despite initial delays due to slow selection of training officers, the implementor (Caribbean Community Secretariat -- CARICOM) now has the project nearly on target with 91 of a planned 300 participants enrolled. However, possibly due to unexpected trainee desire for long-term training (38%) and U.S. training (42%), per trainee costs have been high ($5,380 rather than $4,126) and could force a reduction in the number of participants to 220. Four of the 12 planned public sector seminars have been held with an average attendance of 22; a fifth seminar is underway. None of the regional private sector seminars and only 11 of 48 island-specific private sector seminars have been held.  Attendance has been poor (10-11 attendees), apparently due to insufficient private sector involvement.  Also, five grants from a discretionary fund have been provided -- four to CARICOM and one to the University of the West Indies. Although a Barbadian consultant was hired to develop ongoing evaluation procedures, the resulting data is inadequate.  Nonetheless, it appears that a disproportionate number of junior individuals have been selected for training, in part because host governments have not afforded the project high priority.  Further, submission of training workplans has been consistently slow due to the use (for reasons of economy) of relatively inefficient mail service.  Providing U.S.-bound trainees with advance funds has been the chief procedural difficulty. Finally, CARICOM has failed to submit several progress reports.","Attached to PD-AAJ-219|Evaluation period: Jun 1980-Aug 1981","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","8/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Civil service|Vocational training|Indigenous education|Participants|Management training|Technicians|Technical training","Eastern Caribbean","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAJ219A.pdf","1,632 KB","","","001757 - USAID.

"Evaluates Special Development Activities (SDA) Program to provide grants to low-income, non-profit community groups in the Caribbean. Impact evaluation covers the period FY77-FY80 and is based on site visits to six countries and interviews with project leaders and participants. SDA projects have generally had a significant, cost-effective impact on socioeconomic development at the community level.  Of the 28 projects visited (14 complete and 14 ongoing), 10 were judged as having a direct impact, generating substantial income for participants; eight were producing an indirect impact; and l3 were having little or no impact. The most successful projects involved training in home construction and development of an agricultural science curriculum in Dominica; women's home economics cooperative groups in St. Kitts; sewing and handicrafts programs in Nevis; two woodworking programs in boys' training schools in St. Vincent; and construction of an access road in St. Lucia. Most of the resulting employment opportunities were informal (i.e., self-employment in small businesses, often on a part-time or seasonal basis) rather than formal, full-time positions. These successful projects were characterized by the presence of strong, highly motivated local leaders; use of established groups; emphasis on skills training efforts; and assistance from Peace Corps Volunteers (PCV) -- although too great a reliance on PCV's resulted in project failure.  The amount of the SDA grant was not a factor. Besides lacking the above-mentioned positive characteristics, other projects were less successful due to various factors such as hurricane damage, difficulty with A.I.D.'s disbursement procedures, lack of participant motivation, a shortage of qualified teachers of agricultural subjects, a scarcity of farm land, and a water shortage (in Antigua). Recommendations are to: (1) involve dynamic, competent local individuals in projects; (2) restrict PCV's to supportive roles; (3) recognize the value of projects creating informal employment; and (4) direct aid to successful, established groups.","Attached to PD-AAJ-221","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Villages|Cooperatives|Community leadership|Employment|Women|Associations|Small scale enterprises|Rural areas|Business enterprises","Eastern Caribbean","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAJ221A.pdf","3,960 KB","001757 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to collect, analyze, and utilize in planning data on rural development and manpower in Mauritania.  Final evaluation, conducted in response to a request for a project amendment, covers the period 2/78-1/81 and is based on discussions with project personnel, document review, and site visits. The project design was unrealistic and overambitious, in light of its short time frame and the logistic difficulties in conducting research in Mauritania.  Staffing was inadequate; no experienced development planner was part of the project organization, and few of the consultants were experienced in macroeconomic planning.  Performance of the contractor (Checchi and Company) under the first chief of party was very poor in terms of financial management, recruitment and assignment of personnel, and the design and conduct of research.  Despite improvement under the present chief of party, effects of the earlier period remain.  Because of a failure to integrate and coordinate the component studies adequately or to properly design the surveys, there are serious problems in interpreting and analyzing the data. Nonetheless, the data, although of poor quality, must be utilized since no other data are available. Phase I baseline, subsector, and functional studies are seriously behind schedule, and completion of Phase II option papers and studies is unrealistic in light of available time and staff. Finally, little progress has been made in institutionalizing a data collection and analysis capacity within the Mauritanian Government (GIRM). Detailed recommendations (16) are presented to address these problems. Highest priority should be placed on preparing integrated, high-quality policy option papers and supporting the preparation of the GIRM's 1981-85 Five-Year Development Plan. Additional funding for the project or for a follow-on project is not recommended.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","AFR-0211-S-00-1013-00","","1/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Data collection|Data analysis","Mauritania","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAI926.pdf","2,604 KB","","","","English","application/pdf","","","Hoben, Allan|Rutherford, William|et al.","","Jan 1981","","","","Rural Assessment Manpower Study, RAMS assessment team","","PD-AAI-926","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTUzMDEx","Mauritania","6820211"
"Evaluates project to establish in Paraguay a rediscount mechanism to provide long-term credit to agribusinesses serving small farmers. Evaluation covers the period 1977-80 and is based on interviews with USAID/P, participating bank staffs, and participant and nonparticipant farmers. About $6.5 million of A.I.D. funds were lent by the Central Bank of Paraguay (CBP) and commercial banks (CB) to 56 small and medium agricultural storage (15 loans), farm input and services (19), and processing (22) firms. Borrowers were required to do at least 50% of their business with small farmers.  The high caliber of CBP and USAID/P staff, the prior experience of CB's in rediscounting with the CBP, and the fact that CB's could rediscount 60% of the value of the loan, made the rediscounting mechanism operate smoothly.  On the negative side, CB's had difficulty in loan administration, as evidenced by inadequate loan appraisal (for which consultant help was needed) and the lack of loan follow-up (even after CBP took over the responsibility). Participating farmers had incomes 39% and 35% higher than did nonparticipants in 1978/79 and 1979/80 respectively (of which difference 38% and 39% were due to the project) -- realistic figures given the spread of project benefits among many farmers and indirect project benefits enjoyed by nonparticipants. Participants decreased off-farm employment to expand the size -- if not the efficiency -- of their operations by intensifying or expanding land use.  The project also increased awareness in government and the banking sector of the needs and abilities of small farmers.  Direct data collection regarding the changes in attitudes toward small farmers that were observed in this project is recommended. The limited number of loans possible and the project's limited time frame make it questionable whether adequate provision was made for permanent institution-building in the CB sector.  CB's may not have found the loans profitable if they had had to bear full administrative costs.  In addition, the lack of specific social criteria for loans made the monitoring of loan benefits difficult; it would have been better to formally limit loans to certain geographic areas or types of agribusinesses.","Evaluation period: 1977-1980","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","6/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Agribusiness|Banks|Small scale enterprises|farm income|Agricultural production|land use|Institution building|Long term credit|Financial institutions|Credit|Small farms|Farmers|Financial management|Beneficiary count|Beneficiary interviews","Paraguay","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAH914.pdf","10,261 KB","","","","English","application/pdf","Evaluation team|Indepth evaluation|Onsite evaluation|Comparative effect evaluation","","Smith, Bryant D.|DeFay, Jacques|et al.","Agribusiness","Jun 1981","","","","Agribusiness development with small farmer participation : evaluation of the Paraguay rural enterprise project","","PD-AAH-914","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTUzMDE5","Paraguay","5260107"
"Evaluates project to create a soil and water management unit (SWMU) in The Gambia's Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources (MANR). Special evaluation covers the period 1/78-2/81 and is based on site visits, document review, and interviews with USAID/G, project, and Government of the Gambia (GOTG) personnel. Project implementation is 12-18 months behind schedule due to a one-year delay in the arrival of U.S. Department of Agriculture's Soil Conservation Service (SCS) personnel, difficulties in establishing the SWMU in the GOTG Approved Budget Estimates, and an inability to locate participants for long-term B.A. training in the United States (which will take 4 years and not 2 as assumed in the project paper).  As a result, it has not yet been possible to establish a permanent, functional SWMU sufficiently trained and experienced to benefit from SCS assistance. Good progress toward project goals has been made by temporarily forming the SWMU at Yundum, assigning approximately 10 technical staff, and providing vehicles, equipment, supplies, and the execution of work plans. The SCS team is now in the process of training eight conservation specialists in field practices and is performing soil surveys.  A few soil conservation practices are in place on Mixed Farming Centers and villages in three locations.  Work on plant data and on a technical guide is going well. It is recommended that:  SCS technical assistance be scaled down to two full time specialists -- one to assist the Gambian head of the SWMU and the other responsible for interim field work and training of MANR officials and assistants; the SWMU be formalized as soon as possible and no later than 7/1/82; MANR provide a total of 9 personnel for long-term U.S. training (this is critical to 1982 decisions regarding funding and project continuation; SCS increase short-term in-country training (virtually non-existent to date), providing annually at least two short courses at Yundum College and general courses for MANR personnel; GOTG/MANR formalize their working relationships for the next year with a formal agreement further clarifying responsibilities; and that SCS use a standard reporting format permitting comparison of progress with work plans.","Attachment: XD-AAI-699-A","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","3/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Natural resource management|Soil management|Water management|Institution building","Gambia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAI699.pdf","489 KB","001433 - U.S. Dept. of Agriculture.

"Evaluates publications component of the Lampang Rural Health and Family Planning Project in Thailand.  Evaluation is based on document review and interviews with project and A.I.D. staff; no evaluation period is given. The substantive content of the five drafts and the seven outlines of the monographs is good.  However, because the books were written by different authors, were edited differently, and have different formats, they tend to be confusing to the reader. Although project staff are dedicated, information dissemination within Thailand is excellent, and efforts were made to anticipate problems based on similar A.I.D. experience in the Danfa (Ghana) Project, publication of Lampang Project materials faces several problems. Chief of these are insufficient English-speaking professional staff and the location of data processing services 600 km from the project site. To overcome the above difficulties and complete the books on schedule will require: (1) relieving senior staff engaged in drafting the books of other duties; (2) allowing several weeks for data analysis; (3) hiring a team to translate Thai training materials; (4) locating a skilled editor familiar with health training materials and primary health care; (5) obtaining English-language proofreaders and typists; (6) devoting several weeks to final preparation, including advising the printer; and (7) employing a distribution clerk full-time for 2 months and 1-2 hours per week for an additional 6 months. Further, since A.I.D. is already receiving numerous requests for information on the Lampang Project, it is also recommended that: (8) the series be consolidated into three volumes to avoid duplicating material; (9) the need for an additional visit by the evaluators be determined by late 1980; and (10) a detailed plan for printing and distributing the 2,000 copies of the monograph series and l,000 copies of the training materials be devised.","Author title incorrect: document evaluates the Lampang health|development project","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/dspe-C-0053","","2/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Family planning|Publications","Thailand|Ghana","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAI492.pdf","1,282 KB","000262 - American Public Health Association","","","English","application/pdf","Indepth evaluation|Onsite evaluation","","Neumann, Alfred K.","","18 Feb 1981","","","","Ghana comprehensive rural health and family health project : a review of the managerial, procedural, and mechanical dynamics of producing training materials","","PD-AAI-492","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTUzMDI3","Thailand","9310971|9365900"
"Evaluates the nurse training programs -- the basic program (BP) and the nurse practitioner program (NPP) -- of a project to improve and expand rural health care delivery in Swaziland.  Evaluation covers the period 1979-5/81 and is based on site visits, a review of project documents, and interviews with project personnel. Overall, the nursing programs are progressing on schedule. Recommendations from a 1979 evaluation have been implemented: a principal was appointed to the Institute of Health Services (IHS), a midwife and psychiatric nursing tutor joined the IHS, and two rural areas were identified as sites for giving nurses clinical experience. However, faculty training and regional health planning and research were judged unfeasible overextensions given IHS resources. Regarding the BP, it is recommended that: (1) coordination be improved between classroom and clinical work and between curriculum content and faculty activities; (2) faculty assessments using program objectives as criteria be continued; (3) supervisory and administrative skills and personal development training be given added emphasis; (4) mental health concepts be integrated into the project; (5) the Year IV curriculum be structured; (6) a faculty manual and long-range plans to maintain sufficient faculty be developed; and (7) collaboration between nursing educators and the nursing service be improved. For the NPP it is recommended that: (1) supervision of students and graduates in clinical training be increased; (2) the role of the NP be defined; (3) the possibility of integrating NP specialists be explored; (4) admissions procedures be upgraded by having faculty select NP students on a competitive basis; (5) a reward system be developed for graduates; and (6) rural physical facilities and support services be improved.","Evaluation period: 1979-May 1981","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/dspe-C-0053","","9/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Nurse practitioners|Institution building|Indigenous education|Nursing education|Libraries|Universities and colleges|Health delivery|Medical education|Curriculum|Health education|Educational materials|Health facilities|Training centers|Nurse midwives|Limited data plus","Swaziland","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAI164.pdf","999 KB","000262 - American Public Health Association","","","English","application/pdf","Onsite evaluation","","Gallagher, Judith","","16 Sep 1981","","","","Swaziland health manpower training project : an evaluation of the nursing programs of the institute of health sciences","","PD-AAI-164","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTUzMDI5","Swaziland","6450062"
"Evaluates project to provide credit and training to rural women in Upper Volta (UV).  Special joint USAID/UV-Government of UV evaluation covers the period 5/79-5/81 and is based on a review of documents and previous evaluations, site visits, and interviews with beneficiaries and project personnel. Due to reasons detailed in the 5/79 project evaluation, implementation is at least 2 years behind schedule and the project has been extended to 9/81.  To date, 75% of technical assistance funds have been used to place 15% of credit funds. Further, because Regional Development Organizations (ORD's) have failed to justify expenditure of 60% and 47% respectively of credit and operating funds advanced by USAID/UV, the latter in 10/80 blocked all further advances.  Due to unclear USAID/UV instructions, ORD's have not, as required by the USAID/UV controller, kept records of incidental operating funds; ORD's claim such funds are insufficient.  Thus, although ORD's still have funds to lend, project management is without funds to place or monitor loans. To date, a total of 244 loans have been made to some 1,100 women. Contrary to the project design, however, about 80% of loans have been for individual rather than group projects, with 50% of the loans going to produce millet beer (dolo) and to process shea or locus beans. Individual loans have averaged $48 and brought a profit of only $4-5 - hardly enough to make a significant impact. Project training has focused on ORD personnel, not on village women. The UV Government's lack of extension workers has caused many villages to fall out of the project. The project has demonstrated the existence of a high demand for credit among rural women; the need to educate women in the range of activities eligible for project financing and to focus project training on village women; and that village men, when approached in a non-threatening way, can be supportive of women's economic activities. General and specific recommendations are made to rectify the project's problems, release blocked funds, and justify extending the project further (to no later than 12/81).  Appended is a criticism of the evaluation by the Project Manager (XD-AAI-994-A).","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","5/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Women in development|Credit|Education|Beneficiary interviews","Burkina Faso","","","008620 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to establish railway communication system in Zaire. Evaluation covers the period ending 5/8l and is based on document review, interviews and site visits. The project is neither complete nor ready for final test and is seriously deficient in installation quality. The quality of existing dispatch and station-to-station voice circuits is poor, signaling is unreliable, and the 2-wire speech plus teleprinter terminals are not operational.  VHF base stations are not controlled according to specifications, making full route radio coverage impossible. The inadequacy of the installation practices and poor workmanship at the Kinshasa Center and at stations along the route have caused interference problems.  Of 10 planned circuits, none are operational; only the port and shunting services are functioning. The current contractor did not provide certain design services and tests called for in the specifications: the contractor did not conduct tests on the transmission characteristics of the National Transport Office's (ONATRA) 16 ga. quad and paired cable between Kinshasha and Lufutoto; no engineering was performed on the 19 ga. 25-pair cable installed between Lufutoto and Matadi; some terminal modules are defective and no spares were provided; and the cable carrier system, the l8 channel telegraph system, and the l8 channel telegraph multiplex are out of service because of rodent damage and lack of spare parts. To conclude the project in a satisfactory and cost-effective manner, the contractor and ONATRA should upgrade the system according to original specifications.  To this end, a consultant overseer should be hired to determine the best way to integrate test boards for each site, assure proper installation and the proper functioning of all equipment, and provide periodic status reports to A.I.D. Also, a bill of materials for each site, procedures for quality inspection, performance test plan requirements, and a solicitation for spare parts should be prepared. The contractor should supply a cable-completion engineer and a technician who can test transmissions, equipment installations and alignment, as well as an installation supervisor and two skilled installers.","Evaluation period: May 1981","Special Evaluation","Documents","OTR-8011-O-00-1011-00","","5/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Communications technology|Telecommunications technology","Congo DR","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAI975.pdf","832 KB","001296 - T-CAS America, Inc.","","008626 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to build and install a floating dry dock in Zaire. Evaluation covers the period l976-5/15/81 and is based on document review and an on-site visit. The project is still not complete due to omissions and neglect by USAID/Z and project contractors. The main reason for delay, however, has been the original planners' failure to take acccount of the inadequacies of the 50-year old mooring system and the failure to include in the final invitation for bid a provision to test the dry dock section's performance and all installed equipment before transporting the dry dock to Boma from Florida (where deficiencies could have been easily corrected). To complete the dry dock, it is still necessary to: supply and install a mooring system; connect the existing power source to the dry dock; repair the power distribution system; repair the leaking safety decks and the Worthington deep well pumps; provide a 220 VDC generator inside the floating dry dock (and make the three crossover pipe conduits watertight); protect the flapper valves; and provide for a gangway to allow easy access to the dry dock. A complex combination of proposals submitted by two contractors for equipment costs and repair of the dry dock, with a portion of the work to be handled by the Maritime Routes Administration, is recommended. Since most of the remaining work is electrical, it is strongly recommended that USAID/Z appoint a competent engineer with a strong electrical background to supervise and coordinate the repairs.","Evaluation period: Jan 1976-May 1981","Special Evaluation","Documents","OTR-8011-O-00-1011-00","","5/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Ports|Management operations","Congo DR","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAI976.pdf","487 KB","001296 - T-CAS America, Inc.","","008626 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to increase sorghum and rice production in the Gao Region of Mali.  Special evaluation covers the period 1977-6/81 and is based on site visits, document review, and interviews with project staff and beneficiaries. While some outputs have been achieved, overall agricultural production has not been improved.  This has been due to poor understanding of traditional cultivation, leading to the use of a technical package which required excessively early planting, underestimated the growth cycle, and did not entail leveling of newly irrigated land.  In addition, extensionists were too few, poorly trained, and reached (at most) 6,400 of the 10,000 targeted farmers. Cited as achievements are the construction of a new Gao administration building and of insubmersible dikes, the latter to protect 1,310 ha of the planned 5,000 ha in Tacharane and Gargouna; preparation of a research and seed production facility in Bagoundie to open 6/81; provision of inputs for farmers and earth-moving equipment for dike construction; U.S. training of three agronomists; and on-the-job experience for construction teams.  Flood gates and fish screens serving 1,000 of a planned 5,000 ha have been repaired but their impact has not been assessed. In 1980-81, sorghum was harvested from 3,374 ha, surpassing the goal of 3,300 ha, and the total harvest of 1,932 tons was more than double that of the previous year (851 tons); however, the yield of 440 kg/ha was below the goal of 600 kg/ha.  From 1976-77 to 1978-79, rice production increased from 4,295 to 6,173 tons -- approximately half of the project increase -- and hectarage rose 65%.  Production plummeted during the disastrous 1979-80 season. It is recommended that:  (1) USAID/M fund follow-on activities only if the project's strategy and administration are revamped; (2) research be multipurpose and multi-year, building on traditional farm practices; (3) Malian Agricultural (Ag) Office personnel be trained; (4) agents provide farmers with knowledge and techniques, not material inputs; (5) delivery of inputs to farmers be transferred from the Ag Office to the Regional Cooperative; (6) demonstrations be conducted to prove the value of the new technology; and (7) the Ag Office's administration section better coordinate project activities.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","4/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Irrigation|Financial management|Accounting|Financial records systems|Financial resources|meat products|Beneficiary count|Beneficiary interviews|Limited data","Mali","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAJ516.pdf","2,834 KB","008575 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to institutionalize an urban employment and community development program in Costa Rica.  Evaluation covers the period 8/78-12/80 and is based on document review, site visits and interviews with project personnel.  For a quantitative account of project progress, see the attached PES (PD-AAJ-239). The job training and job placement (JP) programs have been hampered by inadequacies in government inter-agency coordination, trainee selection, participants' work attitudes, and by lack of private sector awareness of the program.  Unexpectedly, informal JP programs have been more effective than those of the project. The small business (SB) development and job creation programs are proceeding, albeit slowly.  The credit and technical assistance program for SB's has been hampered by commodity delays, low salaries that have only attracted untrained staff; departure of trained staff to obtain better jobs; and restrictive loan criteria.  A.I.D.'s Productive Credit Guarantee program has enabled SB's lacking collateral to enter the loan program.  The ratio of jobs created to dollars invested is well below projected levels.  The housing development project has had problems with a lack of government interest in housing and by municipality concern that the projects would turn into slums. With government commitment to the programs, however, progress is now being made. Infrastructure development has been paralyzed by the requirement that l00% of costs be recuperated. It is recommended to: extend the project 2 years to allow the JP component to be redesigned in light of studies on target population, the business community, and the economy; restructure the employment component to meet increasing demand and solve its personnel and vehicle problems; implement the housing component separately from the infrastructure component and resolve the latter's cost recuperation problem; streamline project coordination; and make project outputs, purpose, and goal more realistic and continue A.I.D. technical assistance for this effort.  It is strongly recommended in future to make each component a separate project within an integrated strategy so as to improve inter-agency coordination.","Attached to PD-AAJ-239","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","2/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","housing|employment|Employment services|Small scale enterprises|Credit|Water supply structures|SEWAGE|Fee collection|Electric power distribution|electrification|Beneficiary count|Public data|Project change","Costa Rica","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAJ239A.pdf","1,223 KB","","","008533 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to institutionalize an urban employment and community development program in Costa Rica.  Evaluation, which summarizes an attached special evaluation (XD-AAJ-239-A), covers the period 8/78-12/80. With the project over 50% complete, progress has been slow and achievement of all objectives by the completion date is unlikely. Only 436 and 64 people have received pre-job and on-the-job training, of respective targets of 3,000; and only 367 of a planned 8,000 workers have been placed. A total of 204 small business (SB) have received $715,000 in credit, against targets of 970 and $5.8 million; and only 320 of 3,500 SB jobs have been created.  Business skills training has fared better, with 461 of 800 SB owners and managers completing courses at the National Training Institute (INA).  Design and feasibility work for the worker-owned/operated firms is in process. Due to the National Housing and Urban Development Institute's (INVU) aversion to the sites and services approach, the shelter program is still being planned, and the Institute for Muncipal Administration (IFAM) has found valorization unworkable as a cost recovery method for the community infrastructure program.  However, repeated land invasions and a deteriorating fiscal situation have caused INVU and the Ministry of Housing to begin to show interest in the two programs. Offices have been set up for the urban policy, planning, and administration component, but systematic operational procedures are still evolving.  Housing and interest rate studies are underway, and a contract is being negotiated for a plan to expand the project to secondary cities (preferably by developing individual plans). However, due to poor leadership in the Evaluation Unit of the National Planning Office, no evaluation targets have been completed. Failure to collaborate with host country institutions at the design stage, a delay in purchasing vehicles for the Ministry of Economy's Small Industry Unit, and government reluctance to spend other than what is necessary have also slowed implementation, resulting in as much as $1.25 million of project funds available for reprogramming. USAID/CR will modify or add to the project in a way consistent with project objectives.","Attachment: XD-AAJ-239-A|Evaluation period: Aug 1978-Dec 1980","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","7/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","housing|employment|Employment services|Small scale enterprises|credit|Water supply structures|SEWAGE|Fee collection|Electric power distribution|electrification|Project change","Costa Rica","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAJ239.pdf","1,518 KB","008533 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to assist the Government of the Dominican Republic (GDR) to eradicate African Swine Fever (ASF).  Special evaluation covers the period 12/78-1/81 and is based on site visits and interviews with the project staff. With the help of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the GDR has achieved greater success in less time than anticipated.  After addressing staff and organizational problems, assembling a clinical/pathological picture of ASF, readying an ASF laboratory, and conducting a media campaign on the dangers of ASF and the benefits of the project, 40 veterinarian-led brigades began depopulating the Eastern Region (ER) in 8/79.  Pigs were confiscated and farmers compensated at above-market prices.  In 3/80, the GDR banned pork imports and pig breeding, threatened confiscation without compensation, and fielded 92 brigades to depopulate the rest of the country, including 15 large ASF-free commercial herds. Depopulation ended 8/31/80, and only 200 contraband pigs have been captured since. A sentinel pig program in which disease-free imported pigs were placed at 126 suspected ASF sites in ER and then monitored 90 days for signs of ASF, began 11/80, was extended to the Central Region in 1/80, and is expected to be ongoing or complete in all areas by 9/81. Repopulation plans have been drafted and external funding is being sought to distribute 10,000 pigs by late 1981 -- first to large cooperatives and commercial operators -- and 1 million pigs by 12/85. Given that the last clinical ASF case was detected 7/6/79, the maximum life of the ASF virus is 400 days, and neither wild pigs nor soft ticks appear to be harboring the virus, it is likely that ASF is no longer present in the country.  To avoid reinfestation, eight veterinarians and 24 inspectors are patrolling air and sea ports and the Haitian border. Among the unplanned aspects of the project were the acceleration of activities following successes in ER, the need for and construction of the El Seibo Quarantine and Breeding center, generation of significant scientific and medical data, and the institutionalization of project efforts in the form of a special unit within the GDR's Secretariat for Agriculture. For recommmendations concerning the future direction of the project, see the abstract of the attached PES (PD-AAJ-235).","Attached to PD-AAJ-235|Evaluation period: Dec 1978-Jan 1981","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","2/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","swine|Animal husbandry|animal health|Animal diseases|Disease prevention and control|Laboratories|livestock|Agricultural planning|Agricultural policy|Agricultural research|Pilot projects|Customs operations|Disease vectors|Disease transmission","Dominican Republic","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAJ235A.pdf","13,962 KB","","","","English","application/pdf","Indepth evaluation|Onsite evaluation|Evaluation team","","Mason, John P.|Converse, James|McCauley, Hunt","","7 Feb 1981","","","","Evaluation of the African swine fever eradication program in the Dominican Republic","","XD-AAJ-235-A","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTUzMDY1","Dominican Republic","5170135"
"Evaluates project to expand the capacity of the Quito Working Boys' Center (QWBC) in Ecuador to provide income-generating vocational training. Special evaluation covers the period 12/78-7/81 and is based on site visits and interviews with QWBC staff and with trainees and their families. There has been a notable shortfall in meeting trainee targets, with only 30 of 90 and 9 of 30 boy trainees employed, respectively, outside and inside QWBC; 17 of 100 trainee mothers employed at QWBC; and 62 of 150 trainee sisters completing the Corte y Confeccion program. The job placement and follow-up program, still informal, has been only a nominal success.  In a sense, these shortfalls have been outweighed by successes in building up QWBC's institutional capacity; e.g., by the development as planned of market studies and, of a QWBC sales department which increased 1981 monthly on-property wages by 75%. Two key issues, however, render future USAID/P support to QWBC doubtful: low enrollment (only 15-20% of all eligible youth) and high drop-out rates. These are due, according to the evaluation team, to the fact that QWBC's program is open only to entire families and especially to the rigorous code of behavior (Regalamento"" required of all participants.  It is recommended that QWBC make its ""Regalamento"" an ideal to work towards within a family counselling context rather than an absolute daily requirement; make instruction student/family rather than teacher-centered; develop a formal recruitment program; and consider decentralizing some activities to distant community-based schools, churches, homes, or businesses. To increase the number of female participants, it is recommended that QWBC hire a women's development specialist to expand women's programs (11 possible course areas are suggested); add courses in consumer education, foods and nutrition, family relations, and child development in the pre-vocational program; and consider co-educational courses. QWBC should also hire a person with vocational training experience to help develop the instructional programs and improve its procedures for assessing and reporting program status --  especially when making major changes such as expanding the total course from 2 to 3 years.","Attached to PD-AAJ-233|Evaluation period: Aug 1978-Jul 1981","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","","","Vocational training|Institution building|Basic education|Family relationships|Women in development|Small scale enterprises|employment|Indigenous education|Employment services|Youth|Management operations|Curriculum design|Boys|Beneficiary count|Beneficiary interviews","","","","","","","English","","Evaluation team|Indepth evaluation|Onsite evaluation","","Lamb, Gene|Buesing, Orville|Shea, John","","Oct 1981","","","","In depth evaluation and end of project status report on the Quito Working Boys'center","","XD-AAJ-233-A","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTUzMDY3","","5180001"
"Evaluates project to provide special education/vocational training (SE/VT) to disadvantaged Ecuadorean youth.  Special evaluation covers the period 1/80-6/81 and is based on site visits and interviews with local officials, project personnel, and beneficiaries. The project has directly assisted 3,162 people and improved the welfare of 86,000 Ecuadorean children in need of SE/TV. Objectives for Vocational Training and Placement, the first of three FASINARM (Fundacion de Asistencia Psicopedagogica a los Ninos y Adolescentes Retardados Mentales) project components, have been met with 41 students receiving individualized rehabilitation, training, and evaluation in pre-vocational or sheltered workshops. Under the Personnel Training (PT) component, 18 FASINARM personnel were trained at the University of Idaho; 432 people attended project courses, workshops, and conferences; contact has been maintained with SE staff at Guayaquil universities to prevent duplication of services; and 16 instructional packages are being developed by volunteer professionals. Under the third component, the Resource and Technical Assistance Center (RTAC), with over 1,500 volumes, has become one of the most complete SE centers in Latin America.  RTAC has begun acquiring and translating SE materials recommended by surveyed SE professionals and has carried out exchanges of information and resources with other SE centers.  RTAC also provides technical PT support by preparing bibliographies, translations, and instructional packages. It is recommended that: (1) parents be more involved in SE/VT and use FASINARM-developed activities in the home; (2) a student remuneration policy consistent with Ecuadorean labor laws be developed; (3) a ""graduation"" be used to advance students from SE to VT and finally to job placement; (4) an instructional package be developed to provide technical assistance for the SE/VT and job placement programs; (5) RTAC specialize in the needs of handicapped persons and make its facilities more accessible to those in wheel chairs; (6) RTAC provide non-printed aids, such as teaching materials, and publish lists of local, regional, and national resource people; and (7) Spanish textbooks be used to reduce translation requirements.","Attached to PD-AAJ-229|Evaluation period: Jan 1980-Jun 1981","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","6/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","School buildings|Vocational training|Handicapped persons|Education|employment|Employment services|Occupational opportunities|Equality before the law|Labor laws and legislation|Educational units|Teacher training|Teacher education|Faculty|Educational materials|Educational centers|Youth|Disadvantaged groups|Disabilities|Professionals|Textbooks|Translation services","Ecuador","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAJ229A.pdf","1,894 KB","002119 - Partners of the Americas|000896 - Organization of American States (OAS)|000886 - University of Guayaquil|002326 - U.N.

"Evaluates project to increase the income and productivity of small businesses in the Port-au-Prince area of Haiti.  Special evaluation covers the period 7/80-6/81; no methodology is specified. In its second year of operation, the Haitian Development Fund (HDF) has made marked progress toward its long-range economic development goals.  The number of businesses receiving loans or technical assistance (TA) increased from 89 to 302, of which 251 are still active in the program.  A total of 88 short- and and medium-term loans, ranging from $122 to $15,240 were made to a boradened clientele. The average loan was $2,056, and 41% were for less than $750, showing that marginal enterprises were well represented.  Loan processing operations were simplified, resulting in a decrease in processing time from 67 to 50 days.  The loans generated 204 jobs and a $122,400 annual increase in local incomes.  Most clients view TA, rather than loans, as the most important service.  TA is provided by animateurs -- HDF extension agents -- who also help clients prepare dossiers for loan requests; 11 new animateurs were recruited, making a total of 15.  Progress has also been made in promoting the formation of business development groups.  Nine such groups received credit assistance, and animateurs are helping to form eight new groups. Due mainly to unsuccessful local fund-raising efforts, HDF has an operating deficit of $71,496.  Foreign fund-raising has been more successful, but only by extending more loans in order to collect increased interest and charges and by improving fund-raising performance can HDF solidify its financial position. Recommendations are to: (1) find more cost-effective means of raising local funds, such as increasing dues-paying membership; (2) maximize foreign fund-raising, possibly by using a fund-raising firm and stressing HDF's grassroots success; (3) analyze clients' financial status to determine the return on loans; (4) develop a plan to coordinate business interrelationships among loan beneficiaries; (5) prosecute delinquent debtors as soon as possible; and (6) seek to further reduce loan processing time.","Attached to PD-AAJ-227|Evaluation period: Jul 1980-Jun 1981","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/521-G-88-T","","7/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Small scale enterprises|Private enterprises|Short term credit|Credit|Financial management|Employment|Private voluntary organizations|local financing|Beneficiary count","Haiti","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAJ227A.pdf","3,859 KB","008554 - USAID.

"Evaluates P.L. 480 Food for Peace (FFP) program in Ghana. Evaluation covers the period l959-l981, focusing on the last several years, and is based on document review, surveys and interviews with project personnel and beneficiaries, and onsite visits. In 1980, 28,095 metric tons of FFP commodities were distributed and helped to reduce food shortages, especially for the very poor, and were critical in reducing malnutrition.  The Government of Ghana's (GOG) allocation to Catholic Relief Services (CRS), the implementing agency, of funds to hire private truck drivers to transport FFP commodities directly to CRS warehouses.  This reduced pilferage from l8% to 4.23% in the second half of l980, although the figure rose again to 12.7% in the first half of l98l after the stevedores ""adjusted"" to the new system. Due to transportation and distribution problems and discrepancies between the authorized and actual number of participants, all food distribution centers sampled reported notable shortages or total depletions of FFP commodities in the last 12 months. These centers were the program's major source of strength: procedures were carefully conducted; storage was adequate; reports were submitted regularly; and staff work and concern for the recipients was commendable.  The quality of the nutrition education sessions was particularly high.  Although there are serious problems in evaluating the data, the feeding program has reduced malnutrition and benefitted children who had been at the 60th percentile for their age and weight. High population growth, low agricultural production levels, large numbers of the very poor, and increased malnutrition argue the need to continue food aid in order to meet the minimum requirements of the severely malnourished and to aid in development tasks that could increase Ghana's food self-sufficiency.  The selection process for the feeding program should assure that all persons at high nutritional risk receive rations, with flexibility granted to the distribution center managers to issue double rations to the severely malnourished. Reduction of pilferage and improvement in the distribution system to assure reliable supplies of rations would increase the program's effectiveness.","Evaluation period: Jan 1959-Dec 1981","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/SOD/PDC-C-0262","","9/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Food for Peace|Child feeding programs|food for work|Food aid programs|Deficiency diseases|Malnutrition|Health facilities|infant nutrition|Nutrition education|School feeding programs|Growth monitoring|Charts|Weight|Height|Nutritional analysis|Beneficiary count|Project change","Ghana","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAI761.pdf","7,305 KB","006727 - Development Alternatives, Inc.

"Evaluates project to develop rural financial institutions in Peru. Evaluation covers the period 4/79-5/81 and is based on site visits. Given the adverse economic conditions in Peru in the late 1970's (e.g., negative GDP growth and 60% inflation) the performance of the Banco de las Cooperativas (BANCOOP), a bank for rural agricultural cooperatives, was very strong.  BANCOOP's flexible, aggressive interest rate policy; its savings mobilization campaigns (four held from 12/79-4/81 and a fifth planned for 7-8/81); and the opening of 12 new offices, two in project areas, netted $800,000 in new savings deposits, well over the project goal of $150,000.  In addition, 1980 deposits (approximately $4.5 million) were over eight times the 1976 level; new and outstanding loans in 1980 increased; and the deflated value (in 1979 soles) of new and outstanding loans roughly doubled from 1979 to 1980. On the other hand, while BANCOOP met the project goal of lending $400,000 to production agriculture, 85-90% of its loans went to short-term commercial borrowers because these borrowers were more reliable and accessible than farmers, BANCOOP had little experience with high-risk agricultural loans, and farmers preferred lower-interest Agrarian Bank loans to those of BANCOOP. Also, despite substantial long- and short-term technical assistance provided to strengthen BANCOOP's capacity to advise member cooperatives, the newly created BANCOOP Programming and Development Office was never fully staffed and was more concerned with BANCOOP programs than with assisting rural cooperatives. The evaluators recommend that USAID/P send a representative to the Colloquium on Rural Financial Markets to be held in Washington, D.C. from 9/1-9/3/81.","Attached to PD-AAJ-225|Evaluation period: Apr 1979-May 1981","Special Evaluation","Documents","527-0166-c-00-1020-00","","5/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Finance|Workshops|savings|Banks|Cooperatives|Development banks|Rural areas|Agricultural credit|Agricultural development banks|Interest rates|Monetary policy|Savings and loan associations|Technical training|mass media","Peru","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAJ225A.pdf","771 KB","","","","English","application/pdf","Evaluation team|Indepth evaluation","","Larson, Donald W.|Adams, Dale W.","Financial institutions","8 May 1981","","","","Evaluation of USAID-BANCOOP pilot project on the development of rural financial institutions in Peru","","XD-AAJ-225-A","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTUzMDgx","Peru","5270174|5270166"
"Evaluates project to develop anti-malarial vaccines. Special evaluation covers the period 6/78-3/81 and is based on the proceedings of an American Public Health Association-sponsored workshop (held 1/14-1/16/81) for A.I.D., AID-supported, and other international health research personnel. Improvement in continuous culture systems, the research priority since 1978 for the 11 AID-supported subprojects, has been largely achieved, at least with respect to P. falciparum.  The Critical Path Method is being applied to chart the most time-effective sequence of steps and decisions necessary to develop a viable vaccine.  Two new techniques are becoming increasingly important -- genetic engineering, which has already permitted cloning of parasites to insure stability, and the hybridoma technique, adopted by a number of investigators to produce monoclonal antibodies. Further, there have been several apparent research breakthroughs, e.g., the production of effective P. falciparum gametocytes by using an aged culture media incorporating hypoxanthine, and the growth of preerythrocytic stages of P. berghei using human lung cells.  In addition, mini-workshops were held to discuss the state of the art in hybridoma technology and genetic engineering; in vitro cultivation systems; monkey models for P. falciparum malaria; and antigen isolation. It is recommended that: (1) characterization and purification of antigenic material be the first priority of future research; (2) experimental design techniques and selection of strains for cloning be standardized; (3) Aotus monkeys be bred in limited quantities; (4) continuous culture methods for species of human malaria other than P. falciparum be developed, with emphasis on P. vivax; (5) present efforts on erythrocytic, sporozite, and exoerythrocytic stage be continued; (6) studies on adjuvants be deferred temporarily; (7) policies for patenting experimental malaria vaccines be devised; (8) cooperation be increased with the World Health Organization; and (9) funding be concentrated in areas most likely to result in the development of a viable malaria vaccine.","Attached to PD-AAJ-102|In: Malaria immunity and vaccine research","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/SOD/PDC-C-0164","","3/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Malaria|Disease research|malaria|Immunizations|Endemic diseases|Disease prevention and control|Animal experimentation|Health research|Pharmaceuticals|Vaccines|Technical assistance","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAJ102A.pdf","926 KB","000262 - American Public Health Association","","000186 - USAID.

"Evaluates two projects (9310206 and 9310463) to develop and utilize weed control systems.  Special evaluation covers the period 9/79-4/81 and is based on site visits and discussions with project personnel in the Philippines. The International Plant Protection Center (IPPC) is becoming recognized as a worldwide disseminator of weed control information and technical assistance (TA).  IPPC staff continue to develop small farm application equipment and to train researchers and extensionists.  In addition, project staff have presented papers at scientific meetings and maintained contact with other weed science organizations. In Costa Rica, IPPC staff developed, tested, and are now introducing to small farmers a new weed control technology -- chemical mulch. While progress in the Philippines has been hampered by staff turnovers and a lack of support from Regional Crop Protection Centers (RCPC), weed control research for upland rice and maize has progressed. However, it is too soon to study farmers' adoption of the new practices (e.g., economic analysis of improved upland rice weed control techniques failed to show a consistent advantage over farmers' standard methods). Progress has also been made in training and involving local counterparts at RCPC's. Requests for information from the aquatic program's information retrieval center at the University of Florida are increasing, but technical consultation has been hampered by personnel turnover. It is recommended that: (1) the IPPC program not become part of a Title XII project or of the Integrated Crop Protection contract but be separately funded for 5 years to maintain and strengthen present activities; (2) the IPPC research and TA components be combined; (3) the aquatic weed subcontract be thoroughly reviewed so IPPC can continue providing TA on aquatic weed problems; (4) USAID/Philippines establish that Government of the Philippines' counterpart funds earmarked for RCPC's are in fact being made available; (5) IPPC staff produce the AID-mandated final project report but place most emphasis on making available all possible technical information useful to extension personnel, small farmers, and the scientific community.","Attached to PD-AAH-423|Evaluation period: Sep 1979-Apr 1981","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","4/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Weeds|Aquatic weeds|Pest control|Agricultural research|Maize|Small farms|Farmers|Rice|Agricultural extension training|Agriculture|Information services|Agricultural training|Agricultural technicians|Information dissemination|Plant science education|Institution building|Technical assistance|Limited data plus","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAH423B.pdf","722 KB","000064 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to develop an environmentally acceptable insecticide to control DDT-resistant Anopheles aconitus mosquitoes. Special evaluation, attached to a PES (PD-AAJ-092), covers the period 6/78-4/81 and is based on interviews with local project personnel and on site visits to Semarang and Bali, Indonesia. The Vector and Rodent Control Research Unit (VRCRU) in Jakarta and its sub-unit in Semarang have demonstrated a unique ability to conduct house-scale (Stage IV) and village-scale (Stage V) field trials of alternative insecticides. The evaluators recommend beginning or continuing research on: (1) new (as well as proven) insecticides and applicant equipment, emphasizing areas where the Anopheles vectors of malaria are already resistant to DDT and other chlorinated hydrocarbons; (2) developing and evaluating the ultralow volume concept of adult anopheline control; (3) developing comprehensive, integrated methods of malaria vector control (e.g., attacking larval habitats, changing irrigation practices, and testing biological control agents), possibly including methods which reduce the amount of residual spray; and (4) the ecology of malaria vectors on Java, Bali, and the Outer Islands, focusing on mosquito breeding in irrigation and brackish water (e.g., rice fields, fish ponds, and lagoons) and also exploring the location and seasonal variations of larval populations and of adult movements and resting habits. In addition, special efforts should be made to involve and facilitate technology transfer to Indonesian and other Asian government personnel, and a coordinating committee, including representatives of organizations concerned with malaria research in Indonesia, should be formed. Finally, it is recommended that the project be extended and gradually expanded to incorporate the suggested research topics over a 3-year period.","See annexes: XD-AAJ-092-B, XD-AAJ-092-C|Attached to PD-AAJ-092|Evaluation period: Jun 1978-Apr 1981","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Pest control|Insects|pesticides|DDT alternatives|Pesticide resistance|fenitrothion|malathion|Pesticide application|Disease prevention and control|Insecticides|Chemistry research|Malaria|Anopheles mosquitoes|Disease vectors|Disease transmission|Technology transfer|Biology research|Technical assistance|Human diseases","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAJ092A.pdf","266 KB","","","","English","application/pdf","Evaluation team|Indepth evaluation|Onsite evaluation","","","","1981","","","","Development of environmentally acceptable replacement for DDT; site visit review","","XD-AAJ-092-A","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTUzMDk4","Technical Assistance","9310068"
"Evaluates El Salvador subproject of a project to develop social progress indicators (SPI).  Special evaluation covers the period 5/79-12/80 and is based on document review and discussions with project personnel. Five of seven planned SPI's have been developed and are being incorporated into Salvadorean Government (SG) policymaking.  The existence of a system for periodic socioeconomic data collection has been helpful in that most of the survey data is basic and useful. However, the survey questionnaire was hastily patterned after models not particularly well-suited to developing nations (e.g., it excludes housewives' economic activity and masks underemployment). The quality of the indicators themselves is uneven.  The employment SPI has through its simplicity improved upon previous SG employment indicators. The education SPI, measuring literacy and schooling, is straightforward but would be improved by inclusion of an overage variable.  The health SPI includes morbidity, medical attention, hospitalization, disability, vaccination, and alcoholism, but does not address mental health status and is based on data which is infrequently gathered.  The validity of the food consumption SPI, based on a 7-day food recall survey and the National Household Consumption Survey, has not been fully documented, and in fact results from this indicator are at odds with other studies.  The housing SPI is unfinished but appears weakened by attempting to describe housing conditions both by sector and over time and by the grouping of unrelated variables. Regarding the general variables upon which all the SPI's are based, the sociological control variables are clear, but the economic control variables do not reflect the informal and rural sectors of the economy. The evaluators present specific recommendations regarding each SPI and conclude that the Salvadorean SPI's are applicable to other Central American countries, but that some countries, lacking systems for periodic data collection, may not find the SPI's cost-effective.  In addition, SPI's can only signal changes and needs; decisionmakers must determine the causes and the appropriate remedial actions.","Attached to PD-AAJ-100|Evaluation period: May 1979-Dec 1980","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","2/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Rural development|Baseline studies|Data collection|Data analysis|Sociological surveys|Economic indicators|Reporting systems|Economic policy|Economic planning|Educational planning|Educational policy|National level|Employment|Labor surveys|Health care planning|Health policy|Housing planning|Housing policy|food economics","El Salvador","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAJ100A.pdf","1,644 KB","000064 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to improve the tax collection of the Government of Sierra Leone.  Evaluation covers the period 4/79-3/81 and is based on document review and interviews with project personnel. The project is progressing satisfactorily and is only slightly behind schedule. Over 75% of tax office managers and technicians have been trained -- 22 in tax collection techniques; 36 in advanced auditing techniques; five by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service; and over 50 in work simplification and communication.  Additional training in tax liability audit techniques is badly needed.  Some tax files have been modernized, but records are still inadequate due to use of a British tax system which requires no tax return if a taxpayer agrees with the government assessment. With the assistance of a tax advisor, a system to control the accounts of delinquent taxpayers was developed but implementation was delayed when tax records were transferred to the Ministry of Finance.  A universal tax identification numbering system, essential to more accurate tax assessments, has not been developed.  Detailed procedural manuals for collectors are being used and short-term advisors are scheduled to prepare manuals for inspectors and office managers. Standardized forms and letters, a management information system, and procedures for clearing business transactions have been devised; nonpayment of tax penalties is being reported; and a taxpayer education and information program has been created.  An internal audit unit is still being planned. The project was hindered by the absence of short-term advisors during the second year, constant shortage of personnel, lack of data, and managers' failure to use sanctions to enforce compliance with tax laws. Tax revenues grew 7.2% (adjusted for inflation) during 1979-80 and 22.3% in 1980-81.  National economic growth and changes in the rates and bases of various direct taxes have not been, but should be, included in final estimates of revenue effects. However, because irregular annual fiscal flows make it is impossible to measure the project's contribution to development, the target of a l5% annual increase in revenue should be deleted as a stated goal.","Attached to PD-AAJ-390|Evaluation period: Apr 1979-Mar 1981","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","7/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Statistical data|Taxation|Tax audits|Technical training|Manuals and handbooks|Tax collection|Information storage and retrieval systems|Training personnel","Sierra Leone","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAJ390A.pdf","224 KB","","","","English","application/pdf","Indepth evaluation","","Austin, Charles O.|Firestine, Robert E.","","Jul 1981","","","","Interim project evaluation, increased revenue for development","","XD-AAJ-390-A","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTUzMTIw","Sierra Leone","6360108"
"Evaluates Collaborative Research Support Program (CRSP) to increase production of grain sorghum and pearl millet in LDC's.  Evaluation covers the period 7/79-12/80 and is based on the findings of an external review committee. Eight Title XII universities are conducting 41 research projects; memoranda of understanding have been signed with two LDC's and discussions are continuing with six others.  Research is being conducted on plant breeding, genetics, physiology, and pathology as well as on nutritional and socioeconomic aspects of sorghum and millet cultivation. While it is too early to judge the scientific quality of the research, certain topics do not seem germane to LDC needs --  sorghum fill period, toxins in resistance screening, mechanisms of sorghum disease resistance, sweet sorghum diseases, insect vectors of viral diseases, and drought screening. On the other hand, all the nutrition and socioeconomic studies appear well-suited to small farmers in the Third World. Recommendations are to:  (1) emphasize research more relevant to LDC requirements (e.g., on striga, quela birds, stem borers, long smut, and Sphacelia disease); (2) conduct more projects in LDC's and encourage greater involvement by LDC universities and scientists, international research institutes (the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics in particular), and private industry; (3) test new technologies and plant material in Latin America, because of its geographical proximity and climatic similarity to the United States, before transferral to Asia or Africa; (4) expedite the flow of germplasm to the United States and assure adequate plant storage and maintenance; (5) allow universities to hire all necessary staff, especially scientists willing to work overseas; (6) encourage LDC scientists to participate in strong U.S. graduate training programs; (7) initiate a system to allow for limited funding of added projects; (8) emphasize to Missions the importance of prompt, effective implementation of CRSP projects; (9) allow the project director more freedom of operation and hire a part-time assistant director to share his travel burden; and (10) curtail the planned project review meetings.","Attached to PD-AAJ-122|In: Collaborative research support program-grain sorghum/pearl|millet","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","7/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Sorghum|Millet|Hybridization|Seeds|Cereals|Crop production|Agricultural research|Graduate education|Crop pests|Crop diseases|Plants|Pathology|plant genetics|Cultivars|Crop yield|Varietal research|Universities and colleges|International cooperation|Educational networking|Insects|Biology research|Research collaboration|Technical assistance","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAJ122A.pdf","2,172 KB","000180 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to promote agro-industrial exports in Honduras. Final report covers the period l976-9/81 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with project staff. Although the project demonstrated potential, the unrealistic goal of raising small farm income in 4-5 years was not achieved.  The proposed Government of Honduras (GOH) project management group never developed -- the project was instead managed on a year-to-year basis by the Standard Fruit Company -- and no 3-year operating plan was ever formulated; there was a high rate of turnover and disagreement within the GOH; and the GOH provided less than 20% of its expected financial contribution.  In addition, USAID/H apparently assigned little importance to the project. The processed vegetable component failed because USAID/H did not hire a tomato specialist and under the terms of a contract with the processing company farmers incurred heavy losses which caused them to cease tomato production after 1 year.  Under the fresh vegetable component, field trials of cucumbers and tomatoes (rather than the seven planned crops) were conducted among two farmer groups. After initially mixed results, U.S. test marketing proved successful. In 1980/81, although previously high cucumber yields fell, two more farmer groups were added, formal credit sources were tapped, and a packing plant was built.  Regarding institution building, although most formal training targets were met, trainees did not always proceed to serve the project. It is recommended that: (1) the project be extended 3 years; (2) institution building at the national and cooperative levels be given high priority; (3) USAID/H provide a full-time project manager and clarify project management; (4) both the GOH and the contractor assign trained technicians; (5) a research program addressing key problems (e.g., irrigation techniques, weed and insect control) be immediately designed; (6) all newly participating farm groups utilize progressive field trial systems; (7) production be diversified; (8) a proposal be submitted for handling cucumber sales; (9) arrangements be made for producing and processing tomatoes; (10) market studies be conducted; (11) a clear lending and capital development policy be developed; and (12) agricultural inputs be obtained in a timely manner.","Attached to PD-AAJ-405|Evaluation period: 1976-30 Sep 1981","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","9/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural diversification|Agricultural prices|Exports|Vegetables|Agricultural product marketing|Tomatoes|agribusiness|Food processing|Institution building|Limited data plus","Honduras","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAJ405A.pdf","1,498 KB","001203 - U.S. Dept. of Agriculture.

"Evaluates project to develop water resources in the Tarrafal region of Cape Verde.  Special evaluation, attached to a PES (cf. DOCID: PD-AAJ-392), covers the period 1/77-11/81 and is based on site visits and interviews with project staff. Under the soil conservation component, 27,000 acacia trees have been planted; 22,000 m. of rockwork dikes and 10,000 m. of terraces completed; a 25 ha pilot watershed in Achada Carreira has been useful in increasing crop yields and soil moisture; however hard data is lacking on the effects of watershed protection. The water resources component is seriously behind schedule with 23 of a proposed 50 test wells drilled but only four pump tested.  Sediment and hydrological data needed for dam construction have not been gathered, but tests indicate large infiltration losses, making storage dams impractical. The utility of galleries is unproven. Under the irrigation component, analysis of current irrigation systems shows them to be well-managed, efficient, and replicable, but more comparison between traditional and proposed methods is needed. Overall, project implementation has been slowed by management problems (i.e., technical staff have often misunderstood their roles, allowing problems to go unresolved for long periods); difficulty using drilling equipment; and delays in obtaining commodities and spare parts. It is recommended that: (1) added funding be negotiated to complete Phase I and extend the project 1 year; (2) soil conservation efforts be directed to private farmers and smaller upstream works and emphasize gathering watershed exploitation data; (3) future development emphasize increased well drilling, building small-scale observational dams, and exploring gallery use; (4) a baseline study be made on current irrigation uses and technologies; (5) well water be exploited and allocated for household use, experimental farms, and small farm plots; (5) experimental farms be located near small farm plots to allow technology transfer to selected farmers; (6) improved procurement plans be developed; (7) non-degree, short-term training be increased; and (8) A.I.D. respond to needs for technical assistance to complete Phase I plans.","Attached to PD-AAJ-392|Evaluation period: Jan 1977-Nov 1981","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Water conservation|Natural resource management|Irrigation|Agricultural research|Water management|Water resources|Natural resource development|Hydrological surveys|water supply|wells|Soil conservation|Soil management|soil research|Dams|Indigenous education|Watersheds|Project change","Cape Verde","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAJ392A.pdf","1,817 KB","008525 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to improve vital statistics systems (VISTIM project) in developing countries.  Evaluation covers the period 2/79-4/81 and is based on document review, a site visit (Peru), and meetings with staff at A.I.D., the Office of International Statistics (OIS), and the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS -- the implementing agency), and with U.S. and UN personnel. NCHS has achieved planned targets by conducting two regional conferences, two training workshops in Africa, and training programs in Peru and Thailand.  Key innovative approaches developed include preparation and use of a manual of registration practices and its translation into French; publication of a study of systems in five developing countries; provision of data processing equipment and software for record processing; installation of microfilm equipment to develop national archives of vital records; improved data collection forms; and design of prototypes of national demonstration areas. Technical advisory services totalled 26 person-months.  VISTIM field projects are operating in Jamaica, Peru, and Thailand, and have facilitated the input of backlogged vital statistics. A new and usable civil registration system was installed in three demonstration areas in Peru.  Since 1979, the U.S. Census Bureau has provided training to foreign nationals in vital registration. Lessons learned are the need to commit funds for the full project period and to allow more time and effort in obtaining host-country approval; the desirability of awarding subcontracts to highly qualified organizations; and the soundness of VISTIM's multi-faceted strategy. A.I.D. funding of the project will terminate with $100,000 in FY81. Evaluator recommends continuation of VISTIM to avoid future start-up costs and loss of experience gained, and to enable countries to profit from VISTIM activities.  Review of proposed projects in Ecuador, Brazil, and Indonesia is also recommended.","Evaluation period: Feb 1979-Apr 1981","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/dspe-C-0053","","6/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Statistical analysis|Technical training|Educational materials|Manuals and handbooks|Vital statistics|Vital statistics registration|demography|Sociology research|Demographic data collection|Research methodology|Population and demography|Research centers|Computers|Institution building|Pilot projects|civil service|Indigenous education|Family planning|Evaluation methodology","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAI054.pdf","1,507 KB","000262 - American Public Health Association","","","English","application/pdf","Indepth evaluation|Onsite evaluation","","Gura, Benjamin","","25 Jun 1981","","","","Evaluation of the progress, quality, and impact of the measurement of demographic change project (VISTIM)","","PD-AAI-054","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTUzMTYx","Population and Humanitarian Assistance","9320621"
"Evaluates project to promote community-level delivery of maternal/child health (MCH) and family planning (FP) services in rural Peru. Special evaluation covers the period 7/79-3/81 and is based on document review and onsite interviews with health personnel at all levels. With most MCH and FP services being offered through hospitals, the project has had little impact to date, although services are also being delivered at 100 health posts, 45 of which are new and have been equipped. FP is being increasingly accepted, although 80% of acceptors have entered through a hospital. The recent distribution of materials to health posts augurs expansion of the project into rural areas. Opposition of the Church has delayed progress. A series of costly, but well prepared manuals for training promoters will soon be ready for printing; they may be useful as a national model and might be adaptable for use by sanitarians and health promoters (HP). A good deal of training, mainly for professional staff, has been conducted, but a large percentage of trainees have left for better jobs. This includes nine of 12 HP's trained (of 100 targeted). Further training of HP's should be delayed until support subsystems are in place. Lack of a clear administrative structure has kept the system, the essentials of which are now in place, from being made fully operational. Efforts are being made to integrate the project with the Primary Care Project to clarify leadership problems and to allay suspicions that the project is solely concerned with FP. With the appointment of a director, delivery of peripheral services should begin shortly. Besides addressing administrative and logistic problems noted above, key among the 53 recommendations made are to: concentrate on pre-natal and post-partum care; train Area 2 HP's and sanitarians in FP methods and develop strategies to help Area 1 workers overcome resistance to services; extend the food subsidy program to rural areas through mothers' clubs and use the program to identify problems affecting children; simplify HP manuals and use them to teach HP's how to control intestinal parasites; seek expert help in redesigning the vaccination strategy; create a program to detect cervical and breast cancer in Area 3; and replace stress on staff training with information/education activities.","Evaluation period: Jul 1979-Mar 1981","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/dspe-C-0053","","5/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Indigenous education|family planning|Educational materials|Delivery systems|Manuals and handbooks|Family planning services|Health care administration|Family planning surveys|Food subsidies|Immunizations|Paramedical education|Change agents|Data collection|Data analysis|Maternal child health care|Beneficiary count|Beneficiary interviews","Peru","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAF705.pdf","1,046 KB","000262 - American Public Health Association","","","English","application/pdf","Indepth evaluation","","Holley, John","","11 May 1981","","","","Evaluation of the MCH/FP project in Sur Medio, Peru","","PD-AAF-705","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTUzMTgy","Population and Humanitarian Assistance","9320632"
"Evaluates project to promote family planning (FP) and health services through Community-Based Family Planning Services (CBFPS) in Thailand. Evaluation covers the period 6/1/77-11/30/80 and is based on project records, interviews with project personnel, and a non-representative mini-survey of 2,463 project villages. Initial free distribution of contraceptives failed to increase long-term sales and the inclusion of household drugs increased program costs without generating more income.  A new CBFPS strategy --  the project's fifth -- was therefore developed, in which village distributors (VD): (1) provide FP services by selling contraceptives (especially oral contraceptives -- OC) at subsidized prices and refer clients to the government for IUD and sterilization services; (2) sell and promote household drugs such as oral rehydration salts, vitamins, and anti-parasitics; and (3) promote breastfeeding, conduct certain economic development activities, and make referrals for immunization and curative care. The mini-survey revealed that while delivery of services in the second and third categories was fairly low, there has been much success with the first category.  OC sales in 11/80 were at 440,000/year, and have increased 14%/year each of the last 2 years. The project, expending $7.87 per couple-year of protection, is cost-effective, although costs could be further reduced by using staff more effectively now that the project has passed the experimentation stage. It is recommended that a full-scale feasibility study of a national subsidized contraceptive retail sales program be conducted; that the project be kept intact until the role of government village health volunteers in distributing contraceptives is clarified; and that the program be re-evaluated in 2 years in the context of the National FP Program.  To solve operational problems, it is recommended to increase VD stocks by as much as 50%; have district supervisors and field officers reactivate inactive accounts; reduce staff where possible; take steps to increase cost-recovery from 25% to 50% within 2 years; compensate district supervisors for fuel costs; and provide further training to VD's, stressing referrals in addition to female sterilization and vasectomy and allowing VD's to meet referral personnel.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/dspe-C-0053","","6/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Family planning services|Delivery systems|Cost benefit analysis|family planning|Contraceptive distribution|Community health workers|Oral contraceptives|Oral rehydration therapy|Drug therapy|Parasitic diseases|Vitamins|Contraceptive acceptor characteristics|Condoms|Beneficiary count","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAI166.pdf","726 KB","000262 - American Public Health Association","","","English","application/pdf","Comparative effect evaluation|Evaluation team|Indepth evaluation","","Chen, Kwan H.|Farley, John U.","","23 Jun 1981","","","","Evaluation of the family planning health and hygiene project of the community-based family planning services, Thailand","","PD-AAI-166","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTUzMTg0","Population and Humanitarian Assistance","9320632"
"Evaluates management of a grant to Family Planning Internatonal Assistance (FPIA).  Evaluation covers the period 1/77-5/81 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with A.I.D. and FPIA personnel. FPIA is meeting a critical need by providing seed money to support and expand the reach of innovative family planning (FP) service delivery programs operated by PVO's and, to a lesser extent, the public sector in developing countries.  Moreover, FPIA has a commendable system (Management By Objectives) to develop the management skills of project directors and staffs; is staffed by high caliber people; and exercises, through its headquarters, comprehensive financial management and cost-effective administration of AID-funded programs. On the other hand, regional offices are unnecessarily restricted from handling support services and have inconsistent financial management capabilities; assistance in areas other than management and programming is sometimes weak; long-range planning, including establishing interim objectives and work plans, is poor; staff have logged excessive overtime; and FPIA lacks a proper framework for evaluating programs or following up on terminated activities. It is recommended that A.I.D.: (1) continue to fund FPIA for at least 5 years; (2) streamline translation and processing services; and (3) allow FPIA to increase a program's funding by 10% or $10,000 without prior A.I.D. approval. It is recommended that FPIA: (1) periodically review its programs and FP strategies; (2) increase the role of regional offices; (3) establish a fund for small-scale (under $10,000) projects to be operated by the regional directors under headquarter's oversight; (4) improve long-range planning and increase the standard program funding period from 12 to 18 months; (5) collaborate more closely with USAID's, host governments, and prospective subgrantees; (6) develop ways to systematically disseminate proven programming strategies; (7) secure an appropriate range of contraceptives for youth FP projects; and (10) modify documents to include information on other donors.","Evaluation period: Jan 1977-May 1981","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/dspe-C-0053","","9/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Financial management|Management operations|family planning|Contraceptive agents and devices|Contraceptive distribution|Family planning services|Delivery systems|Supply management|Development program evaluation","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAH955.pdf","4,185 KB","000262 - American Public Health Association","","","English","application/pdf","Indepth evaluation","","Muller, Willard C.|Epstein, Sharon|et al.","","9 Sep 1981","","","","Evaluation of the management components and administration of the family planning international assistance grant","","PD-AAH-955","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTUzMjEw","Population and Humanitarian Assistance","9320955"
"Evaluates project to control barley diseases in LDC's. Special evaluation is based on attendance at the Barley Disease and Associated Breeding Methodology Workshop held 4/20-22/81 in Rabat, Morocco, and onsite visits to Morocco, Tunisia, and Egypt. Various efforts are being made by Montana State University (MSU) to reduce barley yield losses.  The workshop was attended by about 50 participants from national programs of various LDC's and from sponsoring organizations.  Barley disease problems were discussed; awareness of the problems demonstrated was better than in a 1977 workshop.  Criticism of the recurrent selection population (RSP) methodology may have been due to a lack of understanding of this innovative approach. Barley disease research by MSU has involved examination of isolates of pathogens and identification of resistant strains, producing a sufficient base of information for initiating large-scale breeding programs.  Local resistance is being developed to scald, net blotch, leaf blotch, and Xanthomonas blight through a process of recurrent selection. The MSU educational program currently involves three Ph.D. candidates from Tunisia, Morocco, and South Korea, and two M.S. candidates from Turkey and Syria; other foreign candidate requests are pending.  Three U.S. students have completed degrees - one Ph.D. and two M.S.'s. Short-term training has been completed by trainees from India, Turkey, Syria, Morocco, and South Korea. It is recommended that the project be continued.  MSU staff should continue communications and annual visits with their graduates and trainees.  Consideration should also be given to:  introducing additional Mariout or other base germ plasm into the RSP, maximizing disease exposure by growing all RSP's at as many locations as resources permit, and selecting the most suitable source of strains resistant to barley yellow dwarf virus.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Barley|Crop disease control|Varietal research|Agricultural research|Agricultural training|Technical assistance","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAJ124.pdf","98 KB","000815 - Montana State University at Bozeman","","","English","application/pdf","Indepth evaluation|Onsite evaluation","","Poehlman, John M.","","1981","","","","Control of barley diseases for LDC's of the world; team evaluation report","","PD-AAJ-124","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTUzMjI0","Technical Assistance","9311318"
"Evaluates project to support the University of Florida's (UAF) Training in Alternative Energy Technologies (TAET) Program for developing country (DC) technicians.  Evaluation covers the period 9/79-8/81 and is based on document review and interviews with TAET Program staff and trainees. In general, the TAET Program serves its stated purpose; operates within A.I.D. guidelines; and is well received by students.  Several problems are apparent, however.  The overall curriculum provides insufficient exposure to non-solar technologies, overall applications analysis (including socioeconomic evaluations), and to the status of technology (including commercial availability of systems, components, and special materials); and its bias toward small-scale rural applications prevents adequate coverage of issues significantly affecting DC energy balance.  In addition, the faculty lacks the background to cover material outside the area of solar-thermal technology and the guest lecturers do not compensate for staff weaknesses. Handouts are poorly organized and do not cover all material available and relevant to DC problems.  Administrative lines are not clearly defined, resulting in an excess of administrative staff. Finally, UAF and A.I.D. do not seem to agree fully on the Program's goals and objectives. It is thus recommended that the Program aim to: (1) teach technically-oriented DC participants to analyze and implement applicable technology options; (2) provide participants with current information on technology in the United States and elsewhere and identify sources of goods and services to assist DC in energy technology; (3) teach participants to evaluate the technical performance of both large and small systems important to DC's; and (4) outline methodologies for assessing the overall national systems of renewable energy as a basis for decisions on allocating manpower and financial resources.  The last of these, now wholly neglected in the TAET Program, may be the most important in furthering A.I.D.'s policy of promoting energy self-sufficiency in DC's.  Recommendations are also made to redress the other problems noted above.  Finally, it is recommended that the UAF Advisory Committee play a more active role in the overall running of the TAET Program.","Attached to PD-AAJ-135|Complete ed.: PD-AAW-667|Page 6 missing","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","8/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Alternative energy resources|Technical training|Alternative energy technology|Renewable energy resources|Solar thermal energy|Biogas|Technical assistance|Project change","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAJ135A.pdf","537 KB","000743 - Arthur D.

"Evaluates project to strengthen the Ivorian Center for Economic and Social Research (CIRES).  Final evaluation covers the period 1/76-1/81; no methodology is stated. Effective and capable leaders, a strong internal commitment to institutional development, and the ability to obtain increased Ivorian Government and donor support (e.g., from the Ford Foundation and the Governments of Canada and France) have all contributed to CIRES' becoming the leading agricultural economics research institute in French-speaking Africa. In addition, CIRES possesses substantial expertise in savannah farming, livestocks economics, trade in French-speaking Africa, and money and banking. Students returning from advanced U.S. studies in l985 will triple the number of researchers (currently l6) and add expertise in demography, industrial economics, management, education, and cooperatives. CIRES has also participated in numerous conferences; produced several publications; developed an adequate French and English library; and -- by stressing interdisciplinary, applied research -- had a positive impact on the University's Department of Economics. On the other hand, CIRES has been slow--l0 years--to reach this plateau and remains remote from the national decisionmaking process. The research staff, while motivated, includes few women and has limited professional experience; the library staff is inadequate and the quality of publications inconsistent. It is recommended that CIRES: (l) secure funds for training in subjects in which it is weak (e.g., economic planning, land tenure); (2) work to increase its role in national decisionmaking; (3) locate a qualified librarian; (4) ensure that research trainees return to CIRES and that some become part-time teachers (e.g., in economics at the University); and (5) seek added U.S. and foreign donor funding. A.I.D., in turn, should promote CIRES's participation in conferences, project evaluations, and professional exchanges, and provide a follow-up grant to support CIRES as a Regional University Center.","Attached to PD-AAJ-507|Bibliography: p. 36-44|Evaluation period: 1976-1980","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","6/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Sociology research|Social science education|Research methodology|Technical training|Research organizations|National level|Research centers|Agricultural economics|Economic research|Libraries|Graduate education|Institution building|Limited data","Africa south of Sahara","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAJ507A.pdf","5,054 KB","000027 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to identify, isolate, and analyze nitrogen(N)-fixing plant-bacteria (P-B) systems for use in developing country agriculture. Evaluation covers the period 6/78-6/81 and is based on a review of the project by A.I.D. and contractor, the University of Florida (UF), personnel. The complex nature of the research slowed progress in identifying bacteria with consistent N-fixing responses and in developing methods to measure such responses.  Nonetheless, use of a multi-disciplinary approach, effective project management, and added financial support from the UF and the U.S. Department of Agriculture enabled researchers to successfully collect and evaluate bacteria from all over Florida, to investigate the factors affecting N-fixation, to develop techniques for studying P-B systems, and to lay the groundwork for genetic modification of these bacteria. Regarding specific experiments, inoculation of grasses has increased yields significantly only half the time; tests have revealed time after planting, soil moisture, soil pH, N fertilization, and light intensity to be the primary variables.  Attempts to measure biological N-fixation with 15N dilution experiments were inconclusive due to the location and low N status of the test soils and to inadequate controls.  Studies with combinations of tissue culture and Azospirillum strains have indicated that a plant factor influences the N-fixing efficiency of Azospirillum. Also prepared were six journal papers, four Ph.D. dissertations, ten professional papers, and three book manuscripts.  In addition, unanticipated requests for assistance by the Governments of Mali and Egypt have provided an opportunity to establish research contacts in developing countries. It is recommended that: (1) research activities be coordinated with international and LDC research efforts; (2) economic feasibility studies of P-B systems be deferred until a consistently active system is identified; (3) research on chemotaxis and axenic P-B combinations be de-emphasized; (4) continued emphasis be given to developing P-B systems suited to food crops; (5) in designing experiments, greater consideration be given to basic regulatory and genetic constraints of N-fixing bacteria; and (6) a soil scientist experienced in 15N isotope techniques be involved in 15N dilution field experiments.","Attached to PD-AAJ-290","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/ta-C-1376","","6/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Nitrogen fixation|Plant genetics|Varietal research|Agricultural research|Agricultural training|Nitrogen fixing bacteria|Technical assistance","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAJ290A.pdf","767 KB","000180 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to survey fertility and mortality levels and trends in developing countries. Special evaluation, attached to three special country reports (XD-AAJ-293-A, 293-B, and 293-C) covers the period l0/78-3/8l and is based on a review of project documents and interviews with A.I.D. and project staff. To date, the staff of the International Program of Laboratories for Population Statistics (POPLAB) at the University of North Carolina (UNC) has conducted site assessments in 63 countries and negotiated seven of a targeted 14 demographic survey projects, six of which, based on POPLAB/UNC documentation, were approved by AID/W for implementation. The Bolivian survey, to be completed in 9/81, and the Colombian survey, extended until 7/81, are national in scope and involve 10,000 households. The national Mexican survey, completed in 3/81, sampled 18,000 households; the results have been analyzed and published and are expected to influence Mexico's population policies and programs. Nearly 20,000 East Javan households will be sampled in the Indonesian survey, to be completed in 12/82. The Somalian survey, due to end in 3/81, involves both settled and nomadic populations in the Bay, Lower Shebelle, and Mogadishu regions. Sample surveying of 21,000 households in Jordan will be completed by 9/82. The seven additional surveys to be initiated by 9/82 have not been negotiated due to a lack of A.I.D. funds. A.I.D. should advance year 4 funds and restore what was withheld of year 3 funds and approve the previously negotiated survey of Korea to enable POPLAB/UNC to complete implementation of this uniquely important project; if these steps cannot be taken, the scope of work should be modified. The POPLAB/UNC staff has provided high-caliber technical assistance (TA) and sound training to field supervisors and enumerators and has worked with host country technicians -- who have generally proved competent -- to analyze survey results. Short-term training is advised, however, to minimize problems caused by turnovers in specialized host country personnel. POPLAB/UNC should also assure control over the sample design and correct processing of the resulting data, provide a manual and TA for the final country reports, and pursue planned collaborative research with other developing countries.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/dspe-C-0053","","7/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Demography|Household surveys|Demographic research|Fertility surveys|Mortality rate|Demographic surveys","Colombia|Indonesia|Somalia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAJ293.pdf","955 KB","001318 - American Public Health Association.

"Evaluates a project to conduct a demographic survey in Colombia as part of a larger project of the International Program of Laboratories for Population Statistics of the University of North Carolina (POPLAB/UNC).  Evaluation, attached to a special evaluation (PD-AAJ-293), covers the period 10/78-5/81 and is based on a site visit to the subcontractor, the national statistical office of Colombia (DANE). The 1980 Demographic Survey was administered as scheduled and the introductory and analytical sections of the final report have been drafted and should be published by 8/81 after the data and results are carefully reviewed.  DANE staff members are technically competent and experienced in survey work and have been closely monitored by POPLAB/UNC personnel, who have also assisted DANE in using computer software. Sample design and procedures provided by the Colombian Ministry of Health were carefully followed in conducting the survey, and the questionnaire and instructions and manuals for its application were well-designed.  Field work was successful largely due to the relatively small number of enumerators assigned to each field supervisor and to well-conceived training programs.  DANE is expected to use survey results to revise downward its population estimates and projections. It is recommended that:  (1) a program of in-house seminars and workshops be organized for intermediate level DANE staff in order to reduce turnover; (2) POPLAB/UNC make an additional monitoring visit in connection with the review and publication of the final report and provide the DANE with short-term technical consultations in sampling and software application in order to insitutionalize project techniques; and (3) the DANE develop its own sampling frame for future household-survey activities.","Attached to PD-AAJ-293","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","5/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Demography|Demographic research","Colombia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAJ293A.pdf","220 KB","001318 - American Public Health Association.

"Evaluates project to conduct a demographic survey in Indonesia as part of a larger project of the International Program of Laboratories for Population Statistics of the University of North Carolina (POPLAB/UNC). Country report, attached to a special evaluation (PD-AAJ-293), covers the period 10/78-5/81 and is based on a site visit to the subcontractor, the Indonesian Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS). The East Java Multiple Round Survey (EJMRS) is well designed to meet A.I.D. requirements and is expected to provide Indonesia with policy-relevant data.  Although CBS personnel are experienced in administering demographic surveys, POPLAB/UNC assisted in designing the survey and a representative random sample, completing fieldwork, producing data, and preparing a manual for the editors of the EJMRS. All aspects of data production were carefully planned and POPLAB/UNC prepared manuals and memoranda to guide discussions and guarantee the quality of the results.  The East Javan branch of the CBS trained 700 interviewers, managed the fieldwork, and coded and edited data.  The demographic survey capabilities of the Indonesians have improved as a result of working with POPLAB/UNC staff. Additional time required for data entry and processing has delayed the project by 6 months.  Data analysis, which had just begun at the time of the evaluation, has not been carefully planned - no division of labor between participating entities has been specified, no outline of topics to be covered written and no list of tabulations prepared.  These shortcomings are the result of POPLAB/UNC's failure to prepare a manual of technical recommendations for data analysis. It is recommended that planning for data tabulation and analysis be improved; that the CBS subcontract be examined to determine whether changes in forward-funding procedures are merited; and that POPLAB/UNC reconsider whether it should administer a broad survey in Indonesia if funds for such a project become available.","Attached to PD-AAJ-293","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","6/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Demography|Demographic research","Indonesia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAJ293B.pdf","249 KB","001318 - American Public Health Association.

"Evaluates project to conduct a demographic survey in Somalia as part of a larger project of the International Program of Laboratories for Population Statistics of the University of North Carolina (POPLAB/UNC). Country report, attached to a special evaluation (PD-AAJ-293), covers the period 1/80-3/81 and is based on a site visit to the subcontractor, the Somalian Central Statistics Department. The survey is on schedule and within the planned budget.  Survey samples were drawn with great care, despite serious difficulties in the field and the lack of good maps. from government offices and trained in survey methods.  Substantial support for the interviewers in the form of transportation and supplies was provided by the GOS.  Field conditions were harsh; work was delayed by numerous vehicle breakdowns, heavy rains, and occasional sickness of team members.  The identification of the locations and size of water points and villages proved to be very difficult and more government support in this area would have been helpful.  The extensive duties of the team supervisors included being responsible for food, transportation, general supplies, and the review of completed questionnaires.  POPLAB/UNC staff have made short-term visits to Somalia to provide technical assistance and have demonstrated both their ability to work as a team and their sensitivity to the technical needs of their Somali counterparts.  Turnover among the Somalis in charge of the project has been high; POPLAB/UNC has assumed more responsibility for some work than initially planned, although the project is still on schedule. Much of the fieldwork has been completed and remaining activities are well under way, although unexpected rains prevented complete interviewing of targeted nomadic households and may cause the nomadic population to move out of areas where water is concentrated - the principal areas selected for sampling.  A manual review of returned questionnaires, which are essentially legible and complete, revealed no major problems and a computer check for errors has begun.  Sampling instructions seem to have been followed carefully. Tabulation, however, is expected to be a problem because many respondents could not provide the desired information.  There is a substantial concentration of ages divisible by five and ten and it will be necessary to develop data analysis procedures which take this factor into account.","Attached to PD-AAJ-293","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","5/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Demography|Demographic research","Somalia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAJ293C.pdf","220 KB","001318 - American Public Health Association.

"Evaluates project to provide mobile primary health care services in Kenya's Kitui District.  Evaluation covers the period 2/79-7/81 and is based on document review and interviews with CODEL project staff, beneficiaries, community members, and Government of Kenya (GOK) officials during site visits. Strong community support has enabled the project, despite many obstacles, to achieve its goal.  Immunization programs and curative and prophylactic care have reduced morbidity rates for diseases such as measles, whooping cough, polio, worms, scabies, and tetanus. Malaria, malnutrition, and diarrhea (the latter due to a lack of potable water) remain major problems, however, and tuberculosis is increasing. By the end of 1980, four mobile teams, attending 66 centers, had provided health care to 19.6% of children under five in Kitui District. From 1978-80, the program covered 29.9% of registered live births, although family planning is severely restricted due to the prevailing Catholic philosophy (which appears inadequate in this male-dominated society). Since 1981, all clinics have provided health education in such areas as basic hygiene, nutrition, malaria, antenatal care, the importance of vaccination, and prevention of diarrhea and worms.  Progress has been slow, however, due to the staff's lack of preparation and high turnover rate and the large number of those seeking health care. Instruction for women's groups and community leaders has been sporadic and lacks direction.  Nonetheless, data collected from 60 women at three clinics showed a reduced incidence of scabies; high rates of pit latrine use (41.7%), daily bathing (75%), composting/burning of garbage (63%), breastfeeding (90%), and home food growing (70%). General knowledge of disease causation and prevention, however, especially regarding the disease potential of water, is rudimentary. Problems include the need for better cooperation between GOK and project mobile clinics and the failure to collect the baseline data needed for final program evaluation due to lack of a formal agreement with the University of Nairobi. The project should be continued (except at static centers such as Kimangao).  For USAID/K action decisions consequent upon the other 17 recommendations made, see PD-AAJ-165.","Attached to PD-AAJ-165|Evaluation period: Feb 1979-Jul 1981","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","8/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Indigenous education|Immunizations|Health education|Health research|Data collection|family planning|Mobile health services|Measles|Malaria|Disease prevention and control|Deficiency diseases|diarrhea|pertussis|child nutrition|Child health care|Community participation|Primary health care|Maternal child health care|Breastfeeding|Beneficiary interviews","Kenya","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAJ165B.pdf","2,137 KB","","","","English","application/pdf","Evaluation team|Indepth evaluation|Onsite evaluation|Social science evaluation|Interim evaluation","","Morris, Rita|Smith, Sally","","Aug 1981","","","","Midterm evaluation of the primary health care project (Kitui district)","","XD-AAJ-165-B","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTUzMjcw","Kenya","6150185"
"Evaluates project to strengthen the capability of Egyptian villages to finance income-generating development projects. Special evaluation covers the period 1978-81 and is based on interviews with project personnel and visits to 21 villages. The project is well on its way to achieving its purpose; all participants - the Organization for the Development of Egyptian Villages (ORDEV), Checchi and Company, and USAID/E - have done their part well. ORDEV has established a Local Development Fund (LDF), received 426 loan applications, and made over 200 loans totaling $5.5 million; about 100 village projects are now being implemented.  The geographic distribution of the loans - 83 to Upper Egypt and 124 to Lower Egypt - is consistent with population distribution but not with economic hardship; 81% of loans have gone to low-risk poultry, cattle fattening, and transportation projects.  Most projects will be or are already profitable. Many training programs have been carried out.  Thirty-three ORDEV staff have attended courses in enterprise development, management, and finance at the Bluegrass Consortium in Kentucky, and 30 have returned to work with the LDF.  The Consortium has developed 15 case studies of LDF projects for use in training. Also, 36 participants spent 1 month in the Philippines for training in rural development and small scale industries. Locally, 614 village council members and head executive officers have attended 21 seminars on local government and the LDF.  The good quality of village recordkeeping can be traced to this training. Establishment of the ORDEV training academy has been delayed by Egyptian budgetary constraints. It is recommended that:  ORDEV give increased attention to building and maintaining the LDF and assisting maturing village enterprises institutionally; Checchi strengthen and refocus its technical assistance on management and finance, based upon close examination of village projects; and USAID/E carefully assist and monitor progress.  Fifteen more detailed recommendations are also included.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","10/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Credit","Egypt","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAI324.pdf","6,511 KB","008539 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to institutionalize health education on the West Bank and in Gaza.  Special evaluation covers the period 10/79-1/81; no methodology is indicated. Project staff positions have been filled by retaining staff from a previous project and recruiting additional teaching, clerical, and medical personnel.  In-service training included courses in the three program phases. Staff from 49 of a projected 60 charitable societies (CS) in Nablus, Jenin, Jerusalem, and Hebron attended first aid classes, with the number of graduates (107) exceeding the target by 17.  Lesson plans in all three project areas were developed or revised, but expansion, simplification, and translation into Arabic are needed. To date, 4,242 versus a targeted 2,500 mothers have participated in nutrition classes; P.L. 480 Title II commodities were distributed to mothers; and 1,290 children were weighed monthly, showing annual weight increases.  CS teachers kept accurate weight records and made home visits to seriously underweight children.  Of 3,760 mothers interviewed before and after the course, 80% had changed their food habits. A total of 2,044 (versus an overambitious target of 7,500) mothers completed or are attending first aid classes.  Responses to a pre-course questionnaire were used to help determine course content and will be compared to post-course answers to assess course impact. Child development courses for a targeted 1,500 mothers will begin mid-1982. The health classes have been popular with mothers, doctors, and government/community leaders, resulting in unexpected spinoffs: several mothers were offered jobs in day-care centers; food served in schools improved; several CS centers were enlarged to accomodate more mothers and additional services. It is recommended that: (1) CS staff training be increased to allow continuance/expansion of mothers' nutrition classes; (2) nutrition and first aid refresher courses emphasizing hygiene and sanitation be organized for instructors; (3) Catholic Relief Services (CRS) consider extending the project 1-2 years to allow expansion of activities to Gaza; and (4) AID/W and CRS continue to strongly support the project.","Evaluation period: Oct 1979-Jun 1981","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/ne-G-1652","","7/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Nutrition education|Nutrition improvement|Curriculum design|Nutritional status|child nutrition|Infant nutrition|Maternal nutrition|Children|Physiological growth|Health education|Volunteers|Weight|Height|Nutritional analysis|Mothers|Food for Peace|Teacher training|Institution building","Middle East","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAI485.pdf","4,541 KB","007337 - Catholic Relief Services (CRS)","","","English","application/pdf","Indepth evaluation","","","","28 Jul 1981","","","","Report on first evaluation of health education project","","PD-AAI-485","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTUzMjk4","Near East Regional","2980156"
"Evaluates an integrated area development (IAD) project in the Bicol River Basin in Southern Luzon, Philippines.  Evaluation covers the period 1/78-6/81 and is based on a review of project documents, site visits, and interviews with USAID/P and Government of the Philippines (GOP) officials. The Bula-Minalabac Land Consolidation Subproject (BMLCS) is a six-part program whose accomplishments are as follows: (1) Agricultural Production -- estimated end-of-project net increase in rice production is 11,341 tons; (2) Incomes -- data not yet collected; (3) Organizational Development -- numerous rural associations created including one designed for women; (4) Health, Nutrition, and Education -- 2,446 people trained in these fields as well as in agricultural and other skills; (5) Land Reform -- escalating costs indicate that land reform should be attempted only on areas of 1,000 or more ha of contiguous, flat, irrigated land inhabited by beneficiaries of Operation Land Transfer; (6) IAD -- the GOP's policy has resulted in no significant replication of the BMLCS model project. Because of design changes, physical infrastructure development has been delayed and an extension of the project activities completion date from 12/31/82 to 6/30/84 is recommended if nine preconditions are met. Of the 28 remaining recommendations, the evaluation team considered the following seven to be the most important: USAID/P approve short-term technical assistance (TA) funds to help design a strategy for the Irrigators' Association organizational development and training; Ministry of Agrarian Reform (MAR) analyze the project's current cost structure; MAR and USAID/P discuss restructuring the current Fixed Amount Reimbursement Agreement; a USAID/P officer take responsibility for TA and monitor the project's Institutional Development component; MAR fund subdivision surveys of BMLCS Phases I-V; the Project Management Office hire an additional survey team; a private contractor be hired to provide land consolidation surveys, computations, and mapping services for BMLCS phases IV and V.","Evaluation period: Jan 1978-Jun 1981","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","6/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Land consolidation|Land development|Land reform|Agricultural production|Rice|Nutrition education|Health education|Indigenous education|Agricultural cooperatives|Community development|Integrated rural development|Irrigation|Pilot projects|Women in development|Education for development|Agricultural education|Project change","Philippines","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAI157.pdf","5,706 KB","008592 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to improve the capability of the National Program for Agricultural Research (PNIA) in Honduras to provide improved technology to small farmers.  Evaluation covers the period 2/80-3/81 and is based on document review and discussions with project personnel and farmers during an in-country visit. PNIA researchers have attempted to improve crop yields by conducting onfarm and station research on (regionalized) crop varieties that are high-yielding and disease and insect resistant, and by providing localized information about planting dates, fertilization, and pest control.  Progress seems to have been made in maize (3 varieties), beans, sorghum, and rice, but data is inconclusive.  Onfarm research is increasingly seen as necessary to the total research effort, but experience has shown that it must be primarily conducted not by interdisciplinary teams, but by individuals with the support of such teams. Major recommendations are to: (1) use project funds to purchase vehicles to increase logistical support for onfarm researchers; (2) reorganize the technical support units -- using Hondurans to fill the positions -- to include six disciplines (plant pathology, entomology, agricultural economics, biometrics, soil management, and weed control) in each unit; (3) provide laboratory equipment and short-term technical assistance (TA) to researchers; and (4) prepare long-, short-, and medium-range plans and obtain long-term TA for designing a planning system. Among the 14 recommendations for onfarm research are that: researchers stake out (at harvest) and measure a given section of the crop rather than try to simulate farmer technology experimentally; commodity programs be limited to varietal improvement; trained, full-time assistants be assigned to commodity program directors; the multidisciplinary concept of PNIA methodology be enhanced; fertilizer trials be focused on responses to an individual element, rather than a formula; non-basic grain commodity programs be supported; the economic impact of Cenicilla, Babosa, soil conservation, and post-harvest grain loss be determined; and the characteristics and stability parameters of native crop varieties be evaluated.","Attached to PD-AAJ-313|Evaluation period: Feb 1980-Feb 1981","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","3/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Cereals|Varietal research|Cultivars|Crop yield|Crop disease control|Demonstration|Farms|Laboratories|Agricultural research|Farming systems research|Beneficiary interviews","Honduras","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAJ313A.pdf","2,729 KB","008555 - USAID.

"Evaluates P.L. 480, Title II food distribution project in Upper Volta. Special evaluation covers the period 10/71-1/81 and is based on site visits and interviews with personnel from the Voltan Government, USAID/UV, and Catholic Relief Services (CRS). Although the number of beneficiaries tripled to 352,000 and food distribution has reached 22,500 MT, the three programs under the project have had mixed results. The pre-school feeding program has provided large rations, but children's nutritional status has not greatly improved, and nutrition and health education have not altered mothers' behavior.  To achieve nutritional goals, the program must be strengthened and be made more responsive to local constraints and desires.  Specific actions include developing, testing, and implementing improved programs with emphasis on severely malnourished children and pregnant women; limiting program size; continuing the Outreach Grant to CRS; reducing oil wastage; gaining greater public and private support; and using growth charts and other means to monitor program impact. Because the school feeding program has improved children's nutritional status and is a Government priority, it should continue to service all qualified schools.  To accomodate the rapidly increasing number of students, it is recommended that:  the take home ration and the distribution of milk be eliminated; a least-cost acceptable ration be distributed; program expansion focus on areas where malnutrition is highest; and nutritional education be linked to the growth surveillance system. Finally, although the food for work program has supported a variety of projects, termination is recommended because it is debatable that community action has been stimulated, the program is small and amenable to abuse, and the problems and expense involved in improving program operations are too great.  If continued, it is recommended that:  the program's scope be narrowed; staffing be modestly increased; the time of the year when applications are processed and food distributed be limited; sorghum or maize be substituted for rice; commodity use be restricted; legally binding agreements be drawn up between CRS and participants; and the program's impact on community action be investigated.","Attached to PD-AAJ-909","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","9/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","School feeding programs|Food aid programs|Child feeding programs|Child nutrition|Maternal child health care|Nutrition education|Food for Peace|Food for work","Burkina Faso","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAJ909A.pdf","2,633 KB","007337 - Catholic Relief Services (CRS)","","008620 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to assist ""Solidarios"", a private development foundation, to provide credit to member National Development Foundations (NDF) in Latin America and the Caribbean.  Evaluation covers the period 2/80-4/81 and is based on site visits. Solidarios and the NDF's have made substantial progress in their cooperative efforts to promote and finance activities which yield significant socioeconomic benefits for the poor.  Although first-year funding was limited to the four strongest NDF's (in Guatemala, Nicaragua, the Dominican Republic, and Mexico); 61% of project funds have been expended to date with additional loans having gone to NDF's in Bolivia, Colombia, Costa Rica, and Quito (Ecuador); and it is expected that by late FY83 all NDF's -- the aforementioned plus those in Guayaquil (Ecuador), Honduras, Trinidad and Tobago, Argentina, and Haiti -- will have received loans. Two NDF's which exemplify the project's successes and difficulties are the Mexican Development Foundation (FMDR), one of the oldest NDF's, and the Uruguayan Institute of Socio-Economic Promotion (IPRU), one of the newest. The FMDR has developed an impressive institutional structure to benefit 100,000 campesinos.  Solidarios (i.e., project) funds have given the FMDR greater flexibility and allowed it to develop a successful strategy of using its reserves to guarantee and leverage commercial loans for campesino groups. The IPRU, as typical of NDF's in the Southern Cone, has been impeded by a highly inflationary environment and constant foreign exchange risk, and has been reluctant to quickly develop a large credit program.  Nonetheless, A.I.D. funds are filling a critical gap and are allowing the IPRU to help establish and assist rural cooperatives. The project has thus taught that: (1) non-government organizations (NGO's) such as the NDF's can be an excellent vehicle for aid; (2) pushing too rapidly can exacerbate the shortcomings of less experienced NGO's; (3) NGO's lack a constant, reliable source of funds; and (4) the strong demand for credit faced by larger NDF's will require Solidarios to solicit international contributions in the future.","Attached to PD-AAJ-328|Evaluation period: Feb 1980-Apr 1981","Special Evaluation","Documents","LAC-0000-C-00-1031-00","","5/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Credit|Financial institutions|Credit cooperatives|Agricultural extension|Agricultural finance|Rural areas|Finance|Inflation|Agricultural inputs|Agricultural production Credit|Agricultural cooperatives|Institution building|Foundations|Development organizations|National level|Limited data plus","Latin America","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAJ328A.pdf","911 KB","008537 - USAID.

"Evaluates rural health improvement project in Niger. Special evaluation covers the period 1/79-4/81 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with project officials. Although the project has substantially improved rural health services delivery, several implementation problems have been encountered. The project's position within the administrative structure of the Ministry of Health (MOH) does not reflect its supra-divisional nature; the resulting bureaucratic delays and inter-agency conflicts have hampered progress. In regard to rural health services, important gaps exist in the control of malaria, immunization for measles, treatment of diarrheal diseases, and sterilization of needles and syringes.  With respect to rural water supply, the installation of reinforced concrete open wells alone cannot provide a safe protected water source; adoption of a lifting device offers a low-cost easily adaptable means of improving open well sanitation.  The training program for sanitary agents meets project goals but must be expanded to meet future needs. Although incomplete, the MOH data system is sufficient for establishing major health priorities.  Data system deficiencies stem from the lack of an ability to monitor health-related interventions.  A construction program for seven dispensaries and two departmental centers risks failure because of faulty construction and inadequate water supply and sanitation systems.  Funds allocated for sanitary improvements to existing medical units are insufficient.  Major resupply problems could occur if the expansion of the village health team network increases at a faster rate than the supervisory staff.  Minor improvements in the design and content of medical kits are needed.  Good progress has been made in the training of village health team members; 1,235 secouristes (41% of target) and 926 matrones (31% of target) have completed training. It is recommended that the project be extended until 12/84. Further detailed recommendations are made regarding the project's administrative structure (10), rural health services (8), rural water supply (8), sanitation (15), the MOH data system (5), institutional development and logistical support (11), and manpower development (10).","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","8/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Rural areas|Health care","Niger","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAI047.pdf","4,207 KB","000186 - USAID.

"Evaluates P.L. 480 Title II food distribution component of a project to assist the Djibouti Government's (DG) refugee relief efforts. Special evaluation covers the period 9/79-4/81 and is based on site visits, document review, and interviews with Catholic Relief Service (CRS) and USAID/D personnel. CRS distributed 5,700 metric tons of food to 48,250 recipients, fielded a professional staff, and worked well with USAID/D, the DG, and other donors. The DG's Office National d'Assistance aux Refugies et aux Sinistres (ONARS), however, overestimated the refugee population (28-30,000 versus 25,000) and was lax in commodity storage and accounting -- deteriorating stacking procedures at ONARS's warehouses preclude an accurate physical inventory, and until two new warehouses are ready in 1/82 storage will remain squeezed. Refugee feeding (accounting for 70% of program food) became less hectic in recent months, but abuse is growing as many who do not qualify for the program by reason of need or residence are nonetheless collecting monthly rations.  By providing rations (900 metric tons) and food demonstrations to 15,000 mothers and children, the Maternal/Child Health program decreased malnutrition nationwide. The School Feeding program mitigated mid-day hunger among 4,500 rural school children and provided an economic boost to local schools.  The Food for Work (FFW) program motivated unemployed refugees (3,750 people including dependents) to work in self-help activities (e.g., housing construction and dam repairs), and as a result, CRS plans to increase participation in FFW projects. It is recommended that CRS: (1) help ONARS improve stocking procedures; (2) investigate a 100 sack discrepancy at Ali Sabieh as a means of checking ONARS's commodity accounting system; (3) provide ONARS with a simple food distribution program operating manual; (4) request an internal audit from its home office; (5) advise USAID/D on its procedures for disposing with unsuitable food; and (6) implement a loss, diversion, theft reporting and follow-up system. USAID/D ought to transmit CRS quarterly commodity, recipient, and loss reports to AID/W and investigate storage at Djibouti port.","Attached to PD-AAJ-330|Evaluation period: Sep 1979-Apr 1981","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","11/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Food for Peace|Food aid programs|food for work|food storage|Warehouses|Commodity management|Maternal nutrition|Maternal child health care|child nutrition|Community self help|refugees|Housing|Refugee relief|School feeding programs|Beneficiary count","Africa south of Sahara","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAJ330A.pdf","2,497 KB","000027 - USAID.

"Evaluates projects in Central America (CA) to strengthen the Tropical Agricultural Research and Training Center's (CATIE's) capacity to devise and disseminate small farm production systems and to support the Agricultural Research and Information Systems Program (PIADIC) which provides technical assistance (TA) on small farm data collection and analysis. Special evaluation covers the period 4/79-11/80 and is based on site visits to four of six cooperating countries and interviews with PIADIC, CATIE, and A.I.D. personnel and with small farmers. CATIE has developed and tested workable crop, animal, and mixed farming production systems methodologies; provided training in methodology development; and involved extension workers in research so they are motivated to teach the new methods. CATIE is now recognized as a valuable contributor to small farm development in CA.  However, it has made little progress on mixed farming methodologies and has not yet begun family farming systems research. PIADIC, which has been reorganized to focus on individual country rather than regional needs, has effectively stimulated interest in improved methods of data collection, analysis, and use.  National advisory committees are functioning to varying degrees in all six countries and local participants have been provided high-quality TA and training in developing frame sampling and related survey techniques.  On the other hand, TA has been insufficient to meet countries' needs and some countries have been slow to institutionalize PIADIC technology. Further, the Inter-American Institute of Agricultural Sciences (IIAC), which is to assume PIADIC TA and training functions at project end in 6/81, has not shown a strong commitment (e.g., 47 person-months of IIAC-financed professional positions are unfilled). It is recommended that CATIE:  (1) strengthen efforts to garner staff and budgetary support from high-level officials and Missions in CA; (2) encourage mixed farming by having crop and animal researchers work as teams; (3) continue to help farmers supplement, not replace, their traditional corn/bean crop with higher value crops; (4) develop 2-3 rather than the six planned mixed farming technologies; (5) conduct a pilot family farming system study in 1981; (6) involve extensionists in evaluation and validation; (7) not use substantial resources to develop group farm methodologies; (8) negotiate realistic extrapolation methodology outputs; (9) evaluate technology transfer by measuring spread effects and adoption rates; (10) continue introductory training indefinitely, due to high personnel turnover; and (12) shift the acceptance date for annual plans from 11/80 to 2/81 to allow time for research evaluation.","Attached to PD-AAJ-278|Evaluation period: Through 15 Nov 1980","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","3/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Small farms|Farming systems|Agricultural research|Information management|Information systems","Central America","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAJ278A.pdf","2,391 KB","002290 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to develop a replicable integrated rural development (IRD) model in Abyei, Sudan.  Evaluation covers the period 7/77-2/81 and is based on document review and site visits. Inadequate project design, planning, and funding by A.I.D.; poor management and implementation by the contractor, Harvard Institute for International Development; and lack of cooperation from the Government of Sudan (GOS) caused the project to fail in meeting its ill-defined objectives. Only one of six scheduled research reports was delivered in the form and content mandated.  Except for construction and health services, other outputs (e.g., farm trials, job training) were similarly disappointing.  A local institution, the Abyei Development Project Office, was created but was granted excessive autonomy by GOS standards and is unlikely to be able to continue post-project IRD activities. Also contributing to failure were insufficient reconnaissance of the target area (which would have indicated the sociopolitical tensions between the Dinka and Messiriya peoples, the latter of which were largely bypassed by the project); the GOS's delay in funding and its down-grading of IRD projects relative to export-oriented agriculture; and Abyei's remoteness.  Thus, the only beneficiaries to date are 180 project employees, 150 group farm members, and a number of health care recipients. The project taught that: (1) the management-intensive nature of experimental projects tends to be overlooked and that such projects are incompatible with an OPG framework; (2) the implementor must accept the full burden of implementation and must adequately direct field teams; (3) isolated IRD projects require more field observations by USAID personnel; (4) more attention must go into designing a timetable and coordinating project components; (5) the target area must be thoroughly investigated; (6) human and financial resources must be more carefully matched; (7) beneficiaries must be incorporated into the learning process at an early stage; and (8) assigning national status to a small project is unwise.  Because of the project's overall failure, the evaluators recommend A.I.D. cease funding after the project's 6/81 expiration.","Evaluation period: Ju1 1977-Feb 1981","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/DSAN-C-0065","","4/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Integrated rural development|Rural development|Development project design|Development project implementation|Development project evaluation|Institution building|Development research|Sociology research|Economic research|Agricultural technology|Decentralization|Pilot projects|Agricultural production|Business enterprises|Medical education|Beneficiary count","Sudan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAH698.pdf","2,993 KB","006727 - Development Alternatives, Inc.

"Evaluates project to support credit insurance programs in Latin America and the Caribbean.  Special evaluation covers the period 8/78-11/80 and is based on site visits and interviews with contractor, Inter-American Institute of Agricultural Sciences (IICA), and A.I.D. personnel. Strengthening the Panamanian Agricultural Insurance Institute (ISA) and establishing new programs in Bolivia and Ecuador have benefitted small farmers by reducing risk, raising production, and stimulating similar indigenous efforts; and have also yielded a store of data useful in continuing this project and in analyzing rural credit insurance in general. Programs are expected to be underway soon in Costa Rica and Venezuela. Nevertheless, the project is 18 months behind schedule due to difficulties in hiring skilled personnel, obtaining government approval in Ecuador and Bolivia, and locating necessary data. Among the evaluators' recommendations are that A.I.D.: (1) double funding to ensure completion of project research and operation; (2) transfer remaining P.L. 480 funds to Bolivia to finance the local program; and (3) clarify the project's relation to the Productive Credit Guarantee Project; and that IICA: (1) extend coverage to medium farmers to reduce costs and raise output; (2) assist insuring agencies to recoup the costs of technical assistance; (3) relocate its Insurance Division to Washington and hire a deputy director to speed research and promote staff morale; (4) schedule subgrants in decreasing annual amounts to persuade local governments to bear a greater share of costs; (5) emphasize the project's institution building nature over research; (6) encourage private reinsurers and multilateral agencies to promote underwriting of risk; (7) investigate local production of inputs (e.g., seed) in Bolivia; (8) target the training of the permanent staffs of the insuring agencies; (9) assist ISA to become a source of planning, research, and training assistance to other insurers; and (10) promote dialogue between the insuring institutions and Missions.","Attached to PD-AAJ-280|Evaluation period: Aug 1978-Nov 1980","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","4/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural credit|crop insurance|Crop losses|Institution building|Agricultural economics|Economic research|On the job training|Small farms|Farmers|risk aversion|Financial management|Management training|Project change","Latin America","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAJ280A.pdf","8,011 KB","001266 - Washington Evaluation Associates","","","English","application/pdf","Multi country evaluation|Evaluation team|Indepth evaluation|Comparative effect evaluation","","","","20 Apr 1981","","","","Evaluation of the LAC/C crop credit insurance systems project","","XD-AAJ-280-A","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTUzMzky","Latin American Regional","5980579"
"Evaluates project to upgrade the institutiional capability of Zaire's National Institute of Studies and Research in Agriculture (INERA). Evaluation covers the period 7/79-2/81 and is based on document review, a site visit, and interviews with project personnel. Major objectives are not likely to be met prior to the project's 1983 completion date.  The excessive number of disparate activities called for in the Project Paper (PP) forced the contractor, Multi Agricultural Systems, Inc. (MASI) to focus on a few components and these required strong logistical support -- an area in which problems abounded.  The failure of AID/W to review the PP more thoroughly and the lack of USAID/Z support added to the project's woes.  Finally, INERA's Mulungu Station was in a declining condition. Despite innumerable practical problems, the chief of party conducted legumes and forage crop trials; demonstration terrace plots and seed multiplication and distribution have also been undertaken.  The sociologist did not conduct systematic farming practices research, but instead focused on extension activities while neglecting the extension role of government agencies. Counterparts complained they were not assigned practical field problems nor English instruction; only two of 11 planned are receiving U.S. training. Priority activities for the future are to have social and agricultural scientists work together to determine the characteristics of the Kivu Region. The possibility of using Belgian sources and aerial photographs to determine crop research priorities should be seriously considered.  Social science research should be more agressive and disciplined and extension trials should not be undertaken until both social and technical suitability have been determined.  Strengthening social science competence will require recruitment from the best U.S. and Zairean social science faculties and additional personnel. Specifically, there is need to revise the PP (and the scopes of work) and resolve the project's logistical problems, e.g., by granting more autonomy to the Mulungo team and by providing an administrator and a mechanic full-time.  Also needed are a clarification of the MASI-INERA relationship (given INERA's complexity) and an improved counterpart program.","Attached to PD-AAJ-332|Evaluation period: Jul 1979-Feb 1981","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","2/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Institution building|Laboratories|Agricultural research|Agricultural extension|Sociology research|Economic research|Seed production|Seeds|Distribution|Soybeans|Crop diversification|Project change","Congo DR","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAJ332A.pdf","2,606 KB","008626 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to upgrade the institutional capacity of Zaire's National Institute of Studies and Research in Agriculture (INERA). Evaluation covers the period 7/79-2/81 and is based on document review, a site visit, and interviews with project personnel. Delays in the delivery of equipment and supplies have impeded almost every segment of the project and completely blocked some.  Warnings to the contractor to expect these delays were not reckoned with in planning, leading to a premature posting of technicians (only one of whom has an adequate language capacity). The soils fertility analysis and soil characterization laboratories can conduct only two of the 20 tests essential to soil analysis. No soil tests correlations have been completed both because the necessary soil analysis is unavailable and because the test results from lime and phosphate additions are unlikely to be useful as the soil is high in phosphate and maize is a low acid sensitive plant.  Soil classification, which requires laboratory testing in addition to field observation, is also stalled.  As an alternative, raw data left behind by the Belgians are being used to categorize the soils; results will be correlated with the list of crop soil requirements being assembled to produce the final maps. Nonetheless, a fairly broad range of food legumes obtained from U.S. and South American sources has been planted.  These included soybeans, dry beans (Phaseolus), winged beans (Psophocarpus), mung bean, broad-bean, lentils, cowpeas, chickpeas, pigenonpeas, and asparagus beans.  Local soybean and dry bean varieties were also planted for purposes of comparison.  Six varieties of alfalfa and one of U.S. clover have been planted and are surviving. Important basic work on soil losses due to erosion has led to the design and installation of contour terrace erosion control structures capable of reducing erosion by as much as 90%. The isolation of the Mulungu site -- making it difficult to reach, communicate with, and supply -- and the lack of will or capacity by the Government of Zaire and INERA to support a sustained research capacity argue against the creation of a Zaire-wide soil services organization at Mulungu.","Attached to PD-AAJ-332|Evaluation period: Jul 1979-Feb 1981","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","2/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural research|Institution building|Varietal research|Soil conservation|Rural areas|Soil types|soil fertility|Soil erosion|Crop diversification|legumes","Congo DR","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAJ332B.pdf","1,178 KB","002575 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to upgrade the institutional capacity of Zaire's National Institute of Studies and Research in Agriculture (INERA). Evaluation covers the period 7/79-2/81 and is based on document review, a site visit, and interviews with project personnel. The results of the modern farmer experimental plots are inconclusive. Planting corn in rows produced greater yields, but soy and dry beans did equally well whether planted traditionally or in rows. The major advantage of the program was the farmers' easy access to seeds.  The attempt to raise chicken and rabbits has run into problems due to disease (several rabbits have died of syphilis), and lack of vaccines and feed. Efforts to use foyers (groups of women selected by their villages) to train women in nutrition and vegetable growing failed due to the use of ill-advised recipes and untried seeds, respectively; INERA was unable to assist in either case.  Learning to sew -- which was clearly the women's first priority -- seems of marginal importance to the project.  Given the importance of women in the area to agricultural production, the extension team ought to concentrate its efforts on helping women to become better producers. There has been no effort at systematic collection of data on labor inputs to different crops, sex division of crops and labor, intercropping systems, and land tenure arrangements despite their critical importance to agricultural research. Long-term training, perhaps the project's most important aspect, has been hindered by lack of equipment, poor language skills of U.S. technicians, difficulties in recruiting and retaining counterparts, a dispute between A.I.D. and INERA on responsibility for housing costs, the plant pathologist's administrative responsibilities as chief of party, and the lack of interaction between the project's technical and extension components. If training is to be effective, it is necessary that the laboratory equipment arrive, English instruction continue, the U.S. staff learn French, and INERA solve the counterpart housing problem.","Attached to PD-AAJ-332|Evaluation period: Jul 1979-Feb 1981","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","2/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural production|Institution building|Demonstration|Farms|Livestock|Animal husbandry|Agricultural research|Education|Women|Indigenous education|Associations|Data collection|Data analysis","Congo DR","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAJ332C.pdf","703 KB","002575 - USAID.

"Evaluates Housing Guaranty (HG) project to repair war-damaged homes in Lebanon.  Special evaluation covers the period 7/79-8/80 and is based on data from a three-part questionnaire -- two parts of which were completed by A.I.D. and the Ministry of Housing and Cooperatives (MCH), with the third part based on onsite inspection of 74 homes (involving 192 housing units) and interviews with their owners by an evaluation team. Despite delays due to incorrect spellings of names, inaccurate addresses, changes of owners, etc., and the failure of all homeowners to provide full and accurate information, the team found that most of the loans were used, as intended, for repair (as distinct from reconstruction). Recipients' averaged LL 10,000 in annual income. The team found the MCH's method of estimating costs to be inconsistent, with many estimates being prepared haphazardly and indicating no relationship to the repairs to be made.  The ratio of total loans to total annual income was 4:1, making the rate of repayment 27.4% of total income, over a period of 15 years.  The fact that many of those interviewed need help in repaying their loans raises the question of whether additional grant help is possible. The evaluators concluded that: (1) People have made good use of their loans.  Of the units visited, 88% were complete.  Most were small, single floor, reinforced concrete dwelling units.  Nine individuals apparently did not use all of the loan for repairs. (2) The criterion of providing loans to people with an income of 12,000 LL or less per year was not always met; the standard of living of many of the people seemed higher than their declared income suggested.  (3) Loan repayments are not being made according to the original schedule.  Although information on repayment was incomplete, the repayment schedule reveals that 86% of the borrowers have missed two or more payments. Some recipients have told evaluators they do not intend to pay back the loan. Other findings reveal: a discrepancy exists between the total value of loan monies and that indicated by the dossiers; over 96% of the repairs involved new plaster, doors, windows, and painting; 56% of the loans were for multi-family buildings; and over 90% of the units had electricity and sanitary toilet facilities.","Attached to PD-AAJ-348|Evaluation period: Jul 1979-Aug 1980","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","3/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","housing|Housing cooperatives|Building repairs|Income distribution|Disaster relief|Project change","Lebanon","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAJ348A.pdf","375 KB","","","","English","application/pdf","Pre evaluation data|Evaluation team|Indepth evaluation","","Khouri, Adeeb G.","","26 Mar 1981","","","","Lebanon housing guaranty","","XD-AAJ-348-A","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTUzNDAy","Lebanon","268HG01"
"Evaluates project to assist the Syrian Directorate of Soils' (DOS) soil survey/land classification program.  Evaluation covers the period 10/79-3/81 and is based on interviews with contractor, Louis Berger International (LBI), and DOS personnel. Progress was uneven and marked by discord between DOS and LBI.  LBI assumed A.I.D. would cover a funding shortfall or accept incomplete project outputs.  DOS stated it would be unable to complete any unfinished work and claimed that LBI, if operating efficiently, could stay within budget and complete all outputs.  Thus, the 1: 500,000 general soil map is 40% finished, but DOS feels progress was too slow and that LBI should have emphasized the detailed (1: 100,000 and 1: 25,000) maps.  LBI argued that care in preparing the general map will speed preparation of the detailed maps.  Against LBI desires, both parties agreed that, pending arrival of 150 Landsat images, work on the 1: 100,000 map would start before the general map is finished in 6/81. DOS has promised to supply five soil technicians and eight support personnel for training in 4/81 and start-up in 6/81. DOS was slow in soil analysis but is now aware of the task's priority and has hired a soil physicist.  LBI prepared an irrigation plan but did not consult DOS or perform preliminary field studies. Both parties agreed to eliminate the planned 1:250,000 land use map and concentrate on the more useful 1:100,000 map.  Ten DOS personnel finished participant training, seven are now training, and one (in computers) remains to be chosen.  LBI provided on-the-job training to only one Syrian, and was lax in keeping DOS abreast of project activities.  Most equipment needs were specified, but LBI was slow in placing orders, and it appears funds will not cover all requests.","Attached to PD-AAJ-346|Evaluation period: Oct 1979-Mar 1981","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","3/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Land surveys|land use|Satellites|remote sensing|Technical training|maps|Geological surveys|Participants|On the job training|Soil types|Irrigation|Institution building|Beneficiary interviews|Limited data","Syria","","","008610 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to promote mother-centered approaches to teaching pre-school children on the West Bank.  Special evaluation is based on a series of assessments of and interviews with program beneficiaries; no time frame is given. To evaluate the program's effectiveness in delivering cognitive skills to children and instilling in mothers the willingness to follow non-authoritarian child-rearing options, two groups of mother/child pairs -- a group of 15 from the program and a test group of 10 unenrolled pairs -- were administered a series of tests on a pair by pair basis.  The tests were designed to assess or compare:  (1) the child's ability to relate familiar objects of two categories into cross-category pairs and to coordinate and construct sets; (2) the mother's ability to construct simple stories from picture sets and relate them to her children; (3) the mother's readiness and preference for non-authoritarian child rearing options; (4) the thematic contents of the mother's interpretation of hypothetical situations involving a child, as expressed in sentence completions to her children; (5) the child's facility and originality in performing the sentence completions following his mother's examples; (6) the child's performance in a group of eight visual discrimination problems; and (7) the incidence of different styles of maternal intervention as the child attempted each problem. The evaluator concluded that program children demonstrated a heightened level of readiness in pre-academic skills in terms of both specific cognitive gains and preparation for new learning experiences. Moreover, while program mothers did not articulate different attitudes concerning childhood and child rearing roles, positive practical differences were demonstrated.  Program mothers have emerged with new functional skills and role orientations that support their children's autonomous development and promote their appreciation of their own worth. Program costs compare favorably to less beneficial local school and charitable nursery programs, and program staff appear highly motivated. Supervisors could prove helpful in the future in updating materials.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","2/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Educational methods|Youth|Vocational training","Middle East","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAI486.pdf","337 KB","","","","English","application/pdf","Indepth evaluation","","Shamas, Charles A.","","Feb 1981","","","","Evaluation of the mothers home teaching program - introduction and background","","PD-AAI-486","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTUzNDEx","Near East Regional","2980157"
"Evaluates pilot project to determine feasibility of introducing small-scale fish pond culture in Sierra Leone.  Special evaluation covers the period 9/79-1/81 and is based on a review of project documents and in-country reports, site visits and interviews with farmer participants, Ministry of Natural Resource (MNR) fisheries personnel, Peace Corps volunteers (PCV) and local officials. The project has succeeded in introducing a promising new technology. To date, a total of 33 farmers in seven chiefdoms have begun small-scale farming of Tilapia nilotica in 34 managed ponds with three more under construction.  Fish production ranged from 1,200 to over 3,000 kg/ha/yr. Returns above costs are nearly triple those of swamp rice production. Outputs were below target due to a shortage of PCV and MNR personnel for field supervision. Lack of vehicles and of gasoline created transport difficulties.  Change in the availability of rice millings may affect project expansion, since the millings are in demand for fish food.","Attached to PD-AAJ-339|Evaluation period: Sep 1979-Jan 1981","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Nutrition|Extension services|Fish ponds|Fish pond construction|Fertilizers|Fish protein|Concentrated foods|Rice|Small farms|Farmers|Appropriate technology|Rural areas|Agricultural technology|Fishing industry|farm income|Pilot projects|Fisheries","Africa","","","000286 - Auburn University.

"Evaluates project to establish a mid-level agricultural technology training institute in Liberia.  Evaluation covers the period 8/77-3/81 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with project staff by a joint USAID/L, Government of Liberia (GOL), and Protestant Episcopal Church (PEC) team. The PEC has been outstanding in developing theRural Development Institute (RDI) at Cuttington University College (CUC), including facilties for 200 students and a curriculum for a 2-yr program. When fully operational, RDI will graduate 75-90 students per year; the first class of 61 graduated 12/80.  The one major problem -- the lack of money to operate -- was not identified until A.I.D. funds were nearly depleted, reflecting poor project management and monitoring by PEC or A.I.D. The following recommendations were made: (1) A.I.D. should provide emergency funding to RDI for the 1981 school year and then phase out assistance over the next 2 yrs.  (2) PEC will assume a greater share of RDI recurrent costs through 1983 and be fully responsible for RDI operations in 1984, requiring greater GOL assistance, increased tuition and fees, expanded PEC support, and other donor assistance.  (3) Future A.I.D./PEC agreements should identify amount and type of support pledged.  (4) USAID/L should monitor project implementation and expenditures of A.I.D. funds.  (5) RDI should undertake no further major construction or renovation.  (6) Every effort should be made to recruit and train permanent Liberian faculty members.  (7) In 1983, a major evaluation should be made of the RDI curriculum and the preparedness of RDI graduates for field work.  (8) Procedures should be developed to enroll Ministry of Agriculture employees in RDI and to place them after graduation. (9) Observational and practical fieldwork in villages should be included in the training design.  (10) Use of RDI facilities for in-service training for special project and government employees should be expanded.  (11) RDI should attempt to cut the cost of CUC services and locate a recurrent basis for paying these costs other than A.I.D. funds.  (12) An outside audit of the farm operations should be made before the end of 1981.","Attached to PD-AAJ-288|Evaluation period: Aug 1977-Mar 1981","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","3/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Institution building|Agricultural education|Private voluntary organizations|Indigenous education|Curriculum|Agricultural schools|Agricultural training|Agricultural technicians|Undergraduate education|Continuing education","Liberia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAJ288A.pdf","751 KB","008570 - USAID.

TCC, contracted to recruit OPEXers and to oversee project implementation, has effectively recruited 40 high-quality OPEXers.  PSF, subcontracted to place recruits in African and U.S. schools, has been slow to place the 73 trainees and per pupil costs are high. It is recommended that TCC: more actively oversee the PSF subcontract; keep prospective trainees informed of the recruitment process; provide alternates to pre-selected candidates only when asked; negotiate lower salaries when possible; streamline orientation; give all OPEXers a 2-month salary advance; appoint a welcomer in each participating country; and follow up on OPEXer reports in Swaziland and Botswana. USAID's should determine the best means of authorizing use of rented vehicles.

"Evaluates project to upgrade 3,300 km of secondary rural roads in Kenya to all-weather status (AWS) through a program of gravelling, bridging, and culverting (GBC).  Special evaluation covers the period 8/79-6/81 and is based on site visits, interviews with USAID/K and Government of Kenya (GOK) personnel, and a review of project documents and reports. GOK units have built or repaired only 6-9 of a targeted 30-35 km/unit/month.  This shortfall has been attributed to high equipment deadline rates, poorer than expected road conditions, unexpectedly high reconstruction standards imposed by the Provincial Engineer, and suboptimal equipment mix. Key recommendations among the 26 provided are as follows: (1) GOK and USAID/K should reaffirm the project's unique (for Kenya) cost-benefit perspective, according to which only roads with an average daily traffic over 70 warrant more than spot construction (which should thus outnumber full construction three to one) and should test the project as originally conceived for one year, protecting workers from the expected backlash of local officials.  (2) Studies should be conducted to determine each road's needs in reaching AWS and a work program should be prepared based on the studies' results.  (3) Supervisors should receive monthly work schedules and keep daily records of their units' output, reviewing them each month to identify areas of project weakness or unreasonable programming.  (4) A senior civil servant should be assigned to each GBC unit to free engineers and consultants from all administrative duties.  (5) A project manager should have overall responsibility for GBC units.  (6) The road inventory should be updated and include a definition of the roads not currently in AWS.  (7) A.I.D. should perform a routine audit of this project as soon as possible. (8) More attention must be given to the sizing and installation of culverts which must be installed in the dry.  (9) Ministry of Works construction should be limited to a road at a time; extra personnel should build drainage facilities for spot improvements.  (10) Because the project is still training personnel and testing methods, production goals should be modest while training and testing should be emphasized. (11) A.I.D. and the GOK should hold quarterly evaluation meetings.","Evaluation period: Aug 1979-Jun 1981","Special Evaluation","Documents","AFR-0168-S-00-1050-00","","6/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Bridge construction|Road maintenance|Vehicles|Roads|Cost studies|Rural areas|Gravel|Road construction|Participants|Indigenous education|Transportation planning|Transportation policy|Farm to market roads","Kenya","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAG872.pdf","1,737 KB","","","008565 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to establish a blindness prevention program in Kenya's Central and Rift Valley Provinces.  Evaluation covers the period 6/77-7/79 and is based on site visits and interviews with project personnel and trainees, and is attached to a PES facesheet (PD-AAJ-354). Due to the excellent work of the International Eye Foundation (IEF) and Kenya's Ministry of Heath (MOH), the project has been a success and prompted the MOH to extend eye services to peripheral areas. All five planned rural blindness prevention units (BPU) -- manned by a trained clinical officer (CO) and a driver -- have been established to screen for eye diseases and provide public health education in schools and pre-natal and under-five clinics. Because the CO's are uniquely competent, they have the people's confidence, thus stimulating use of eye services.  Also, an additional BPU was established in Mombasa; health education and disease prevention capabilities were added to seven existing mobile BPU's; a general screening and referral service was implemented; high-quality information and teaching charts are ready for distribution to health centers, schools, and the public; and collection of baseline data on eye diseases will be completed by 12/79. Because the three trained Kenyan ophthalmologists have not taken charge of the program, indigenization is not yet feasible and continued IEF support is imperative.  Other problems include inadequate transportation for CO's; an underpaid, overworked staff; non-continuous supply of necessary medicines; lack of appreciation of eye diseases among clinicians; lessened service coverage due to inadequate surveys and analyses; and inadequate diagnostic laboratory procedures. It is recommended that: (1) the project be expanded to include community health care workers and other African countries; (2) nutritional and biochemical data be subjected to epidemiological analysis; (3) drug and staffing needs be prioritized according to eye survey data; (4) surveys of endemic eye diseases be expanded; (5) a surveillance system be created; (6) eye services be integrated into the general health system; (7) ongoing education be provided to CO's; and (8) district and provincial BPU's be established.","Attached to PD-AAJ-354|Evaluation period: Jun 1977-Jul 1979","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","7/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","eye care|Mobile health services|Information dissemination|Educational materials|Ophthalmology|Paramedical education|Ophthalmologists|Physician education|Blindness|Preventive health care|Health outreach services|Medical education|Health delivery|Transportation|Disease prevention and control|Health education|Health surveys|Beneficiary interviews","Kenya","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAJ354A.pdf","2,002 KB","000627 - International Eye Foundation (IEF)|008565 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to establish a rural primary eye care program in Kenya.  Special evaluation covers the period 4/80-5/81 and is based on site visits, interviews with project personnel, and a review of the attached annual report (XD-AAJ-210-B). Project progress has been mixed.  Although 1,748 people have received eye examinations, and the one community-based primary eye care program established to date (in Saradidi) is serving 15,000 people, only one of 17 planned Mobile Eye Units is in operation.  In addition, lack of coordination in planning, execution, and funding of field operations and in assigning staff has led to uneven delivery of services and excess dependence on the International Eye Foundation (IEF), the contractor, as a source of eyeglasses and drugs. IEF has provided primary eye care and blindness prevention (BP) instruction to 40 clinic officer students, 60 nursing students, 15 ophthalmology students, 54 village health workers, 44 rural health trainees, and 25 teachers of the blind; training of medical students has been minimal. In addition, curricula on the anatomy and physiology of the eye and on diagnosing and treating common eye disorders were developed; at least seven seminars have been conducted; educational booklets were written and presented at regional African meetings; and a BP film is being prepared. Data collection, analysis, and dissemination are not centralized, but the IEF plans to extend to remote areas a regional eye disease survey used for planning and is developing a computerized surveillance system for eye disease data (using coded forms considered inadequate by the evaluators). It is recommended that the IEF: (1) purchase a two-way radio for rapid communication; (2) continue the eye disease survey and share the survey methodology with other countries; (3) evaluate curricula, teaching programs, and training materials and develop an instructional slide program; (4) establish links with a U.S. laboratory to diagnose trachoma; (5) allow ophthalmologists to attend U.S. professional meetings; (6) improve supervision of opthalmologists; and (7) establish a stronger advisory committee including representatives of all participating groups.","Attached to PD-AAJ-210|Attachments: XD-AAJ-210-B, XD-AAJ-210-C|Evaluation period: Apr 1980-May 1981","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","5/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","eye care|Blindness|Preventive health care|Community health workers|Ophthalmologists|Physician education|Health education|Educational materials|Epidemiology|Health research|Data collection|Health professional education|Curriculum|Ophthalmology|Paramedical education|Seminars","Kenya","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAJ210A.pdf","1,054 KB","000294 - Baylor University.

"Evaluates four of five projects (excluding Sinai Feeding) in the P.L. 480, Title II food distribution program in Egypt.  Evaluation covers the period 11/76-6/81 and is based on document review, site visits, and meetings with staffs of Catholic Relief Service (CRS), CARE, and Egyptian public and private agencies. The CRS School Lunch project serves 1.2 million children in over 3,000 schools in Lower Egypt.  Although evaluation data are lacking, the goals of increased enrollment and class attentiveness and reduced drop-out and absentee rates have been achieved. Major issues include the continued use of costly and poor-tasting wheat soy blend; commodity shifts proposed for FY 82 to cut costs; and the continued feeding of children in canal cities in this ""rural"" project.  The CRS Maternal Child Health project provides food supplements and nutrition education to 500,000 children aged 3-36 months and to their mothers. Problems include the continued lack of a uniform children's growth chart and difficulties in instituting growth monitoring in clinics; doubt about the program's suitability given the high rates of diarrhea and infection; design deficiencies in the nutrition education component; and the need to select an optimal commodity mix within cost constraints. The CRS Other Child Feeding project serves 45,000 children under age l4 in 940 public and private institutions (orphanages, day care centers, hospitals). Outstanding issues are the possible need for other inputs and whether the program's size, commodity choice, and logistics enable it to reach needy children.  The CARE Family Planning (FP) project, operated by the Egyptian FP Association (EFPA), uses food to increase acceptance of FP and provides soy oil and soy fortified flour to 40,000 FP acceptors.  Key issues are how to limit the project to new, younger acceptors (women participants average 35 years of age and half to two-thirds of them accepted prior to the program); the capacity of local EFPA centers to operate the project; and whether to extend the project beyond its 1/82 expiration date. Evaluators recommend postponing until 1983 the external evaluation proposed for fall 1982, because it is not well-timed for gathering information and because other types of assistance would be more beneficial.","Evaluation period: Nov 1976-Jun 1981","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-0262-I-00-1012-00","","6/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","School feeding programs|child nutrition|Children|Physiological growth|Maternal child health care|Infant nutrition|Maternal nutrition|Nutrition education|soy flour|Wheat|Fortified foods|Orphanages|Day care services|Hospitals|Contraceptive acceptor characteristics|Food for Peace|Food aid programs|Beneficiary count","Egypt","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAJ083.pdf","3,041 KB","000894 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to establish an extension program for rural small businesses (SB) in Botswana.  Evaluation covers the period l0/80-9/8l and is based on a review of project files, discussions with USAID/B and Partnership for Productivity (PFP) contractor staff, and interviews with trainees and Government of Botswana (GOB) and private individuals. A high-quality SB skills extension service using local staff with an efficient reporting and monitoring system is in place, and PFP has developed an excellent SB skills curriculum package.  Training has been provided to 26 local advisors to the PFP and Ministry of Industry and Commerce (MCI) Business Advisory Service (BAS) programs and to 288 (181 in FY81 alone) of 975 targeted clients, who have included school-leavers. However, 63 FY81 trainees were dropped for lack of interest, business closure, and the like, thus showing the invalidity of two project assumptions -- that businessmen in Botswana are ambitious and that an indigenous environment favorable to SB's exists.  Trainees have testified that the training has benfitted enterprise management. MCI and PFP must resolve the differences in their systems, i.e., the PFP program is relatively input-intensive in regard to training, supervision, and reporting while MCI's is not, prior to 4/82 merger of their BAS programs. MCI should relieve its current BAS Program Senior of all duties other than direction and planning of an SB skills expension service, if necessary providing an interim program director and training a MCI-designated counterpart.  The field supervisor, the key link between MCI headquarters and field operations, should be experienced in BAS operations.  Staff duties and program objectives should be clearly defined and pertain only to the extension service; a project memorandum should assure access to funds needed to support the BAS staff after the merger; a training unit within the MCI, catering to educational needs of all MCI departments, could use the standard PFP curriculum to support ongoing BAS staff development. The project has taught that a localized extension service, despite its high cost, is one of the few effective ways to encourage SB development in Botswana; and, above all, that the project's long-term success depends on effective functioning of the GOB.","Evaluation period: Oct 1980-Sep 1981|Presented in format of an evaluation summary","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","11/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Curriculum|Management education|Business enterprises|Management|Management training|Small scale enterprises|Indigenous education|Rural areas|Partnerships|Beneficiary count|Beneficiary interviews","Botswana","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAJ464.pdf","1,007 KB","008516 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to develop an institutional base for future production of horticultural crops (i.e., fruits and nuts) in Yemen. Special evaluation covers the period 7/77-7/81 and is based on site visits, document review, and interviews with project personnel. The project has been a disappointment and has lost its credibility in the view of the Yemen Arab Republic Government (YARG).  A.I.D., having received no bids for implementation, sought out a contractor, Tuskeegee University (TU), which had limited qualifications and did not begin field activities until early 1979. Moreover, A.I.D. fostered discontinuity in project management.  USAID/Y, for its part, authorized expenditures in a manner which inhibited planning, did not mobilize or coordinate YARG contributions, was slow and inefficient in completing the research stations, and did not work well with TU. As a result, few project outputs were achieved.  Although nurseries were assisted and growing sites and research stations were established in Bir al Shaif and Jarouba, the first station will likely be abandoned and relocated and the other has inadequate facilities.  Further, no YARG Ministry of Agriculture personnel were trained; no imported varieties of trees have fruited; no yield data on local varieties have been obtained; no research was initiated on improved cultural practices; and baseline and projection analyses of promising horticultural crops were indefinitely postponed. To redesign the project for a proposed follow-on phase, it is recommended to: (1) build on project achievements, however limited; (2) adapt to the fact that top TU faculty are unlikely to accept 2-year assignments in Yemen; (3) upgrade TU staffing; (4) develop a balanced research/dissemination program with improved research techniques and development of propagation nurseries; (5) promote greater YARG involvement; (6) transfer project management to TU; (7) coordinate research with horticultural research elsewhere; and (8) renew efforts to initiate in-country and overseas training.","Attached to PD-AAJ-497|Evaluation period: Jul 1977-Jul 1981","Special Evaluation","Documents","NEB-0024-C-00-1038-00","","7/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","horticulture|fruit|Laboratories|Agricultural research|Agricultural extension|Varietal research|Agricultural diversification|Institution building|Agricultural training","Yemen","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAJ497A.pdf","3,393 KB","003002 - Ronco Consulting Corp.","","008624 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to establish a health services training program at Suez Canal University (SCU) in Egypt.  Special evaluation covers the period 5/80-6/81 and is based on site document review and interviews with contractor, Boston University (BU), and A.I.D. personnel. The project's major commitment of resources to train a handful of physicians may be extravagant given the depth of health care needs in Egypt. Moreover, the project faces a host of problems.  SCU's capacity to develop curriculum is growing, but only the first year curriculum is nearing completion.  BU personnel have not yet inspected the six clinical training sites identified in Ismailia; construction is unlikely to be completed by 9/81.  No sites have been found in Suez or Port Said. The proposed primary care group practice  -- to supplement the incomes of the underpaid SCU medical faculty -- is of doubtful viability.  Good progress has been made in refurbishing teaching, laboratory, and administrative facilities.  Although staff development and continuing education are proceeding, short-term U.S. training has been of little value; non-faculty and junior faculty education has lagged; and initiation of long-term U.S. training appears unwise.  BU has failed to strengthen SCU's management ability (e.g., developing lines of authority and budget and records systems), and SCU's need for centralization is antithetical to a decentralized project.  Finally, the proposed Phase II is too vaguely conceived and will conclude 3 years before SCU's first medical class is graduated. It is recommended that A.I.D and/or USAID/E: (1) condition continued support on enrollment of a class in 9/81; (2) complete Phase I, request from BU a proposal for Phase II, and consider a possible Phase III (lasting until 6/30/87); (3) continue funding curriculum design, continuing education, primary care, and health center development; (4) support training for non-physician health center personnel and in general health care; (5) not support group practices until the prototype has been tested; (6) strengthen BU's management advisory capability; (7) demonstrate the effectiveness of existing clinical teaching sites before funding new sites; and (8) require submission of curricula prior to Phase II.","Attached to PD-AAJ-499","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","6/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Medical schools|Physician education|Faculty|Medical sciences|Health professional education|Curriculum|Curriculum design|Medical education|Health facilities|Building construction|Building renovation|Incentives|Health occupations|Training centers|Educational administration|Project change","Egypt","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAJ499A.pdf","1,451 KB","000133 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to upgrade low-income, urban housing in Togo. Annual evaluation covers the period 4/80-4/81; no methodology is given. While lacking a comprehensive shelter policy, the Government of Togo (GOT) has shown a commitment to improving shelter conditions.  To date, AGETU has completed engineering plans for sub-projects in Lama-Kara and Be; hired additional staff, including a second economist; and is actively recruiting an engineer and a draftsman in order to strengthen its design capability. Nonetheless, without an updated project schedule, the average number of families annually served will drop below the targeted 2,500, and if further delays in contracting technical studies and construction are encountered, it is likely that the project will require a 1-2 year extension past 1984. In 2/81, the Development Bank of Togo (BTD), the official borrower, agreed to discuss loan terms with potential U.S. investors.  However, high U.S., long-term interest rates have been a major obstacle.  Two local loan programs -- a pilot home-improvement loan program with Caisse d'Epargne for the Be area and a small enterprise loan with the BTD -- have been initiated.  In addition, a GOT delegation attended A.I.D.'s Conference on Housing in Africa in 3/81 and returned with a clearer understanding of how to implement projects for low-income groups.  To test the demand for and the applicability of minimum standard techniques and practices to shelter delivery, a demonstration house and service site will be prepared at Baguida. As plan approval and consultant firm selection procedures are often long and involved, it is recommended that the capacity of AGETU's Direction Technique to conduct technical studies be upgraded.  In the short term, however, continued USAID/T technical assistance will be required to execute forthcoming studies and supervise construction.","Attached to PD-AAJ-494|Evaluation period: Apr 1980-Apr 1981|Bibcode changed from 32 to 22, 2008-05-19","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","4/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Poverty|Urban renewal|Low cost housing|Housing investment guaranty|Housing planning|Housing policy|Housing prototypes|Urban areas|Minimum shelter housing|Investment promotion|Investment|Economic planning|Housing|Building design","Togo","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAJ494A.pdf","234 KB","008614 - USAID.

"Evaluates IIPUP (Integrated Improvement Program for the Urban Poor) component of the Togo Low-Income Shelter Project.  Evaluation covers the period 1/80-4/81; methodology is given. To design socioeconomic activities which complement and reinforce low-income shelter development, four sector studies (health services delivery, social services delivery, employment and small enterprises, informal credit and savings mechanisms) and three surveys (Be area physical and socioeconomic survey, Lama-Kara housing needs survey, Be area informal sector building trades survey) were conducted.  Based on the resulting data, a two-phase IIPUP Proposal was developed and submitted to A.I.D.'s Office of Housing.  Phase I, a septic tank loan fund, was designed to improve project zone sanitary facilities.  Under Phase II, a loan fund for working capital and/or expansion of small-scale, informal building enterprises was proposed, but because as IIPUP funds were not provided, the proposal was modified and incorporated into the Housing Guaranty (HG) project paper. Despite rejection of the IIPUP proposal and delays in HG project start-up, the technical assistance team has continued to explore other means of launching an IIPUP program in Togo (e.g., a pilot home improvement loan fund and a program in the Be area have been initiated with the Caisse d'Epargne).  Also, implementation procedures are being developed for a small enterprise loan fund and assistance project with the Togolese Development Bank (BTD) which will begin when HG funds become available. Negative reactions and resistance of Agvenyive residents to land acquisition plans prompted AGETU to form an assistance-information committee to develop an information program to encourage popular participation in community development activities in the Be area. Similar programs are anticipated for the Lome and Lama-Kara sites. To assure the success of future similar projects, the evaluators conclude that adequate planning is by itself insuffient.  Firm efforts must be made to follow through on plans with firm action, necessary corrective measures, monitoring of activities, and periodic evaluation of methods and results.","Attached to PD-AAJ-494|Evaluation period: May 1980-Apr 1981","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","4/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Sociology research|Economic research|social services|Poverty|Urban renewal|Urban development|Sector planning|Land use|Community development|Housing investment guaranty|Low cost housing|Urban areas|Housing|Investment promotion|Septic tanks|Small scale enterprises|credit|Limited data","Togo","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAJ494B.pdf","239 KB","008614 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to strengthen the Ivorian Center for Economic and Social Research (CIRES).  Evaluation covers the period 1/76-1/81; no methodology is specified. (1) Agro-economics research has proceeded in the specific areas of export agriculture (coffee and cacao); commercial livestock production and commercialization; savannah rice and cotton farming; banana, manioc, and palm farming; and agricultural development strategies.  CIRES programs are coordinated with those of other Ivorian institutions. Research results have indicted that intra- regional environmental and demographic differences must be taken into account in developing local agricultural intensification and mechanization strategies. (2) Human resources research has four foci -- demography and education, health, and employment economics. Demographic researchers are studying natural population growth, immigration, and internal migrations, although financial and personnel constrictions have limited these efforts. Another study on the relevance of educational content to employment needs and salaries is under way.  (3) In the area of industrial economics, an investigation of alternative methods of financing industrial manufacturing has been completed and published.  (4) Research in the fields of international commerce and economic integration has emphasized the importance and stability of various Ivorian exports (e.g.; palm oil, soy, and sugar) in the international market, and the positive and negative effects of existing institutions and agreements affecting the Ivory Coast's role in international commerce. (5) Lastly, in the area of development financing, CIRES has recently initiated studies on monetary issues in African countries to highlight the problems of international financing in these developing economies.","Attached to PD-AAJ-507","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","6/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Sociology research|Research organizations|Educational research|Agricultural economics|Economic research|Economic integration|Demography|Employment|Labor research|Labor market|Exports|Agricultural production|Livestock|Animal husbandry|Population growth|Limited data","Africa south of Sahara","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAJ507B.pdf","2,702 KB","000013 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to support research into the factors limiting biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) in plants.  Special evaluation covers the period l977-8l and is based on document review, oral presentations by the program director and project manager, and assessment of sub-grantees' progress. The project has awarded 4l sub-grants for 3-year projects to 21 U.S. universities, including l6 projects promoting collaboration between the U.S. scientists and 23 LDC counterparts.  Research topics include factors limiting quality of inoculant and inoculation success; soil factors which limit BNF; plant factors limiting nodulation and BNF; and Rhizobium/host interaction.  Research has improved several BNF techniques, identified and improved substitute inoculant carriers and inoculation techniques, and identified breeding lines of legumes for increased BNF efficiency and tolerances to soil and environmental stresses. Research results have been documented in 21 journals, presented at 32 workshops, and been the subject of eight theses or dissertations.  In addition, a workshop attended by 190 scientists was held at the International Center for Tropical Agriculture. It is recommended that: (1) the project be continued for 5 years; (2) the peer review process, periodic meetings of sub-grantees, and current administrative procedures be continued; (3) the planned 1982 workshop focus on identifying Rhizobium strains to enhance all major edible, forage, and tree legumes and which are suited to specific soils and climates; (4) sites visits be conducted to all sub-grantee institutions; (5) an A.I.D. project (Tropical Legume Inoculant Service) to apply research results be activated; (6) research be expanded on forage legumes, non-leguminous trees, and Azolla blue-green algae; (7) research on associative BNF by grasses be dropped from the project; and (8) efforts be made to train scientists from LDC's not presently represented in the project.","Attached to PD-AAJ-512|Evaluation period: 1977-1981","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","6/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Nitrogen fixing bacteria|Rhizobium|Legumes|Agricultural research|Research collaboration|Technical assistance|Limited data","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAJ512A.pdf","747 KB","000180 - USAID.

"Reports on contractor activities during the period 4/79-4/81 in a project to increase cereal production in Gao, Mali. While yields for both local and selected varieties of rice and sorghum have risen, the acreage devoted to different varieties has varied with the availability of seed.  Recuperation of the 15% interest rate on seeds has been very poor. Dike and canal construction is 2 years behind schedule; since 4/79 17 km of dikes have been constructed and are protecting 1,300 ha in Tacharane and 678 ha in Gargouna, a total 40% of the targeted 5,000 ha. The field research station was installed in 1980, 4 years late. Problems have been due to insufficient and delayed funding; poor coordination between the project and Genie Rural; the limited availability of extensionists; and the very poor quality of the technical package provided. It is thus recommended that farmers be included in decisionmaking, a more suitable technical package be developed, and that plow farming be encouraged.  Also, activities should be concentrated in the southern zone and managed on the model of a program in Niger (herein described).","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","2/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Irrigated farming|Rice|Sorghum","Mali","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAJ517.pdf","464 KB","008575 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to strengthen the capability of Panama's National Directorate of Natural and Renewable Resources (RENARE) to manage conservation programs.  Evaluation covers the period 4/79-6/81 and is based on document review, interviews with RENARE and project personnel, and onsite inspections. Progress in watershed management -- especially in soil conservation, less so in pasture improvement and reforestation -- has been slow with only 26% of loaned funds expended halfway through the project. Nonetheless, implementation has recently been better, and remarkable progress has been made transforming RENARE, through training and reorganization, into a capable conservation institution.  For more detailed analysis of current project status, see the attached PES (PD-AAI-626). It is recommended that RENARE: (1) review reforestation plans for 1982-83 to ensure that only areas in need of stabilization are planted; (2) develop more realistic strategies for managing parks and forest preserves; (3) reduce the cost of establishing and managing plantations; (4) improve weed control; (5) prepare written reforestation agreements to be signed by RENARE and cooperating landowners; (6) conduct analyses to determine optimal planting times; (7) seek to develop improved administrative procedures with the Ministry of Agriculture in order to allow RENARE to contract labor directly; (8) obtain technical assistance (TA) in financial management; (9) ensure timely processing of reimbursement vouchers; (10) establish adequate petty cash funds, reduce administrative burdens and personnel costs, and increase labor efficiency--possibly through private sector involvement in reforestation--at regional offices; (11) utilize avaliable TA to address problems in applied research and evaluation, nursery/plantation management, and road construction techniques; (12) evaluate the cost-benefit relationships of major project activities to determine those most worthy of continued support; (13) study the project's impacts. Finally, it is recommended that A.I.D. determine appropriate and adequate funding levels for RENARE and adjust its advances accordingly.","Attached to PD-AAI-626|Evaluation period: Apr 1979-Jun 1981","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","8/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Institution building|Reforestation|Forest resources|Sector planning|Agricultural policy|Forests|Plantations|Forestry|Agricultural training|Natural resource conservation|Water management|Watersheds|Forage crops|Soil conservation|Soil management|Natural resource management|Government departments|National level","Panama","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAI626A.pdf","1,531 KB","008589 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to promote awareness among decisionmakers in ten LDC's of population planning issues.  Evaluation covers the period 7/80-9/81 and is based on document review, visits to four countries, and interviews with knowledgeable A.I.D. and LDC personnel. The project's strategy - linking population research to policy development - is extremely promising, and many recommendations made during the Phase I evaluation have been adopted by Battelle Memorial Institute, the implementor.  Battelle staffing has improved significantly.  However, Phase II performance has lagged. Only one country-specific core project agreement (with Jordan) and eight subcontracts in other countries have been signed.  Also, preparation of vitally important country strategy papers is behind schedule; only one such paper, for Sudan, can be considered complete. This evaluation includes indepth reports on activities in Brazil, Honduras, Peru, and Sudan.  In Brazil, where the project is in early planning stages, political uncertainty and lack of contact with the social science research community has hindered selection of a subcontractor.  A decision must be made whether to support family planning activists, or rely on other, more established, institutions. In Honduras, the economic-demographic planning model (SERES) used during Phase I is more valuable for detailed planning than is the RAPID model.  Battelle's assistance is no longer needed, however, and a lack of adequate demographic data and research make a Phase II project inappropriate. In Peru, where several institutions received Phase I support, only one, AMIDEP, a multidisciplinary association for research and training in population, is currently receiving funds; other reputable organizations have submitted proposals.  However, as the relevant institutions are already involved, and the need for Battelle has lessened, A.I.D. is planning a shift to direct bilateral support. The strategy paper for Sudan, where activities are just beginning, offers a perceptive evaluation of demographic issues.  Battelle is meeting objectives here, and problems can be avoided by appropriate planning. It is recommended that A.I.D. and Battelle redefine expected outputs and adjust budgeting and staffing, so that activities already begun can be completed.","Evaluation period: 26 May 1981-2 Sep 1981","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/dspe-C-0053","","9/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Population programs|Population growth|Population policy|Population planning|Family planning|Demographic research","Brazil|Honduras|Peru|Sudan","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/GetDoc.axd?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTUzNTgy&pID=NTYw&attchmnt=VHJ1ZQ==&uSesDM=False&rIdx=Mzg3NjY4","","000262 - American Public Health Association","","","English","application/pdf","Indepth evaluation|Evaluation team|Onsite evaluation|Pre evaluation data|Multi country evaluation|Social science evaluation","","Baker, Raymond|Baron, Barnett|et al.","","Sep 1981","","","","Evaluation of the population and development project of Battelle Memorial Institute","","PD-AAJ-547","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTUzNTgy","Population and Humanitarian Assistance","9320635"

"Evaluates project to produce a food supplement, CEREX, to combat malnutrition in children under age 2 (secondarily, under age 5) in Guyana.  Special evaluation, attached to a PES facesheet and another special evaluation (PD-AAJ0-601 and XD-AAJ-601-B), covers the period 10/79-10/81 and is based on document review and interviews with project staff during site visits. Preliminary pilot attempts in 6/81 at free distribution in mother/child health (MCH) clinics failed due to financial constraints and underdeveloped infrastructure.  A revised system to control and report on product distribution, storage, and service delivery is as yet untested. CEREX sales are currently keeping pace with rising production levels, now at 820 MT/year, almost meeting project goals.  CEREX seems to be reaching a high percentage of Guyana's 700 retailers, although some interior areas are being served inadequately or not at all. Preliminary data from a 6/81 survey indicate that of children under age 5 (47.8% of all CEREX consumers), 66.1% consume CEREX, and that of children under age 2 (18.7% of CEREX consumers), 70% have three servings a day, 18% two servings, and 12% one serving.  Of the households surveyed, 74.3% had tried CEREX and 45.9% are current users. Non-use is attributed to other product preference or age.  All income groups use CEREX to some extent due to its low price and the lack of alternatives, although based on food habits, more users tend to be Africans than East Indians.  The current consumer price of G$0.38 per half pound provides a satisfactory retailer profit margin of up to 15%, but bears an unknown relationship to actual production costs.  Current expenditures at 2 oz./child/day amount to G$45.50/child/year, or 3% of food expenditures for lowest income families. The priority recommendation is to determine CEREX's production cost - future planning strategy and the decision whether to continue on to phase II depend on these cost data.  It is also recommended to: analyze separately CEREX's contribution to other, economic objectives; explore alternatives to a phase II of the project; have USAID/G, if requested, assist the Government of Guyana in testing future promotional work and the adequacy of the current mode of CEREX preparation and feeding, and design and evaluate an MCH distribution system.","Attached to PD-AAJ-601","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","10/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Weaning foods|Deficiency diseases|Infant nutrition|Fortified foods|Beneficiary count|Beneficiary interviews","Guyana","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAJ601A.pdf","7,077 KB","000885 - New TransCentury Foundation","","","English","application/pdf","Indepth evaluation|Onsite evaluation","","Callier, Sandra S.","","9 Oct 1981","","","","Weaning food development : an assessment of progress to date","","XD-AAJ-601-A","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTUzNjM1","Guyana","5040073"
"Evaluates project to produce a food supplement, CEREX, to combat malnutrition in children under age 2 (secondarily, under age 5) in Guyana.  Special evaluation, attached to a PES facesheet and another special evaluation (PD-AAJ-601 and XD-AAJ-601-A), covers the period 10/79-10/81 and is based on document review and interviews with project staff during site visits. During the project's first phase, the CEREX processing plant was operationalized.  Retail distribution during the period 1/80-8/81 was on target (379 of a proposed 430 tons); no further promotional activities are needed.  However, 150 mother/child health (MCH) clinics did not receive free distribution of 15%-20% of the product as planned. Implementation of this project component is urged. The quality of CEREX, consisting of corn, white rice, and soy oil, was found to be adequate and quality control effective although there is a need to maintain cooking temperature. CEREX is the lowest cost, highest nutritional quality food supplement on the market.  To maintain product cleanliness, however, especially during Phase II phase outs of P.L. 480 Title II food assistance, it is recommended that either new raw corn cleaning equipment be installed or that indigenous raw food-stuffs arrive pre-cleaned.  Indigenous products to be used in the new formula should be chosen by 9/82.  Screens for the feed-in hoppers are recommended.  Plant sanitation should be assured through appropriate cleaning equipment. Other key recommendations are to:  (1) examine packaging alternatives to assure economy and product protection during shipping and storage; (2) maintain bag weights through checks on processing and bagging procedures and through vigilance for in-plant theft; (3) assure the availability of warehouse storage facilties and inventory retail levels in order to prevent lost consumption due to shelf unavailability; (4) survey the 700 retailers so as to assure profitability to merchants, availability to consumers, and a reduction in street black marketing; (5) raise the price of CEREX gradually to G$1.20/bag; and (6) have a certified public accountant evaluate actual program costs to provide a basis for further recommendations.","Attached to PD-AAJ-601","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","10/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Weaning foods|Infant nutrition|Fortified foods|Deficiency diseases|Food processing|Food for Peace|Food aid programs","Guyana","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAJ601B.pdf","2,738 KB","","","","English","application/pdf","Evaluation team|Onsite evaluation|Indepth evaluation","","Ackels, Alden A.","","8 Oct 1981","","","","Assessment of the current status of weaning food development - Guyana","","XD-AAJ-601-B","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTUzNjM2","Guyana","5040073"
"Evaluates project to provide basic health services, potable water, sanitary latrines, and health education in rural areas of the Dominican Republic.  Special evaluation covers the period 11/78-12/80 is based on a review of project documents and interviews with national and local health officials. The three project villages visited were found to have drilled wells and hand pumps installed.  Palmarejo had 11 wells with hand pumps; those inspected were well constructed and maintained.  One was reportedly not used due to the water's high silt content.  Although the sanitation component has not yet begun, the State Public Health and Social Assistance (SESPAS) was stockpiling equipment for pit latrines. In Los Tramojos, poor drainage and large muddy areas around the pumps were blamed on a design change in the hand pump base by the contractor. Most houses had new latrines provided by SESPAS, but built according to design specifications from the project. In Las Yayitas, a SESPAS crew installing a hand pump complained of insufficient supplies and tools. An already installed hand pump lacked grease on moving parts and had a water leak; the water at another pump was silty and reportedly not used by the community for drinking purposes.  All of the above technical problems were not unexpected and were routinely dealt with by the water and sanitation program, UAPODAN. The health education component, not yet begun, will require three levels of training, for the cadre of Promoter Supervisors and personnel immediately above and below them. It is recommended that two experienced advisors be sent to assist in designing evaluation plans for periodic program monitoring and for a comprehensive impact assessment.  A 2-month pilot program should test the suitability and use of various household water containers.  A similar program should assess any flush toilet model provided by the two interested ceramic firms; detailed specifications for the Colombian pour-flush latrine and a model of the unit should be provided to USAID/DR.  One individual experienced in non-formal health education training for water and sanitation programs should be sent to develop training materials.","Order of technical direction no. 21","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","2/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Water supply|Health|Water supply structures|Rural areas|Sanitation|Technical assistance","Dominican Republic","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAJ608.pdf","494 KB","000333 - Camp Dresser and McKee, Inc.

"Evaluates area development subproject of the Central Tunisia Development Project.  Evaluation covers the period through 7/81 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with project, USAID/T, AID/W, and Government of Tunisia (GOT) personnel. The project has not been a success.  None of its objectives will be fulfilled on schedule; most are hardly past the planning stage.  Neither the project-created Central Tunisia Development Authority (CDTA) nor the CDTA Planning and Evaluation Unit (EPU) have proven effective forces for regional development.  Training of CDTA and governorate staff in regional planning and evaluation has proven a complete failure and training in macro-social data management has been only minimally effective.  None of the 15 planned Experimental Fund projects have been initiated; the planned information system exists in only a rudimentary form; only two of four planned subproject designs are even at the planning stage; and project evaluation standards and indicators have not yet been formulated. The major obstacles to project success have been poor management within CDTA and especially EPU, and difficult relationships among and between CDTA, EPU, other GOT agencies, USAID/T, and the American universities providing technical assistance (TA). Other factors include lack of experienced personnel, lack of understanding of the value of a planning unit, the poor quality of the training and TA provided, and the heavy influence of American ideas concerning decentralized authority, with which GOT agencies are not sympathetic. Various scenarios for change are suggested:  (1) eliminating the CTDA and transferring its functions to other GOT agencies; (2) terminating the subproject; (3) narrowing EPU authority; (4) limiting CTDA activities to the Governorate of Kasserine; (5) focusing CDTA efforts on nonagricultural development; and (6) transferring the CDTA from the Ministry of Agriculture to a more powerful agency.  Particular attention is given to scenario 3, which would entail reducing the project's scope and allowing the EPU to evolve into a Bureau of Plans and Budgets responsible for regional project selection, design, budget preparation, and monitoring.","Related French document: PD-HAB-922","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/DSAN-CA-0180","","7/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Development planning|Development organizations|Institution building|Technical assistance","Tunisia","","","000878 - National Association of Schools of Public Affairs and Administration","","000220 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to assist the Government of Botswana (GOB) to raise rural employment, production, and incomes and to improve rural land use. Special evaluation covers the period 6/80-10/81 and is based on site visits. While still in the early stages of implementation, the project is beginning to influence GOB planning, promote valuable high-risk endeavors, and develop institutions which will favorably affect rural employment.  Further, the project has contributed somewhat to administrative decentralization and has successfully melded several separate activities. In the area of local land use planning and management, some headway has been made in training, especially for Land Board Technical Assistants.  However, the GOB Ministry of Local Government and Lands (MLGL) has had difficulty identifying trainees.  Two key MLGL personnel should be returning with U.S. M.S. degrees soon.  The MLGL applied research unit is fully functional and should begin to analyze land tenure issues in the third year.  Four districts are in the process of developing communal area land use plans, and the results of Cornell University's water points survey have been distributed and are expected to be incorporated into water use planning. In terms of raising farm production and income, pilot subprojects have included:  improved, mechanized, technical crop production packages; construction of water catchment tanks; purchasing of draft animals; and erection of fences to protect cultivated land. Most subprojects have been successful and have spurred interest in adjacent villages.  Also, the ability of Ministry of Agriculture staff to work with projects has been strengthened. Regarding generation of non-farm employment, the establishment and performance of a cadre of rural industrial officers (RIO's) consisting of Peace Corps and other foreign volunteers has been timely and efficient. Setting up small project funds at the local level has been a quick and efficient means of providing concrete assistance (e.g., training, tools, surveys), thus lending credibility to the RIO's. However, lack of understanding of the local resource base has been a constraint. Numerous recommendations are provided inter alia.","Attached to PD-AAJ-617","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","11/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Land use|Environmental planning|Agricultural production|Employment|Rural areas","Botswana","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAJ617A.pdf","3,907 KB","008516 - USAID.

"Evaluates P.L. 480 Title II food distribution program in Lesotho, implemented by Catholic Relief Services (CRS) and other PVO's. Special evaluation covers the period 1/78-11/80; no methodology is noted. Results have been mixed.  CRS's pre-school health program has developed into a network of 69 clinics, reaching 75,000 pre-school children and 60,000 mothers, but the method of nutrition assessment employed, the Growth Surveillance System, has come under criticism from the World Health Organization. Under its Food for Work Program (FFW), CRS annually provides food for 8,775 workers and for four dependents per worker.  Some program regulations (e.g., retention of work tickets by workers, the ineligibility of those receiving other supplemental food, limitations in worker attendance) have not been adequately enforced, and more attention has been paid to managing food sources than to whether FFW projects are productive and completed om time. The number of workers in the FFW Program run by the World Food Program (WFP) has steadily increased to 7,786 in l980, 2,000 above target.  The resultant shortage of commodities, worsened by the late arrival of shipments, necessitated the transfer of commodities from CRS. WFP has paid close attention to the substance of FFW projects, programming a large portion of its commodities to support development projects by other donors. WFP's second major program, primary school feeding, is generally on target, although fewer children than planned (144,500 versus 175,000-l80,000) were served in l979; a survey is being conducted to evaluate the program's nutritional effects.  Food assistance to post primary educational/training institutions and hospitals has served a larger number of beneficiaries than planned, leading to lower daily rations. Programs to establish a grain reserve in mountain areas and a national strategic wheat reserve, as well as the European Economic Community's Food Program, are described but not evaluated. Recommendations are made to reduce the number of WFP employees to planned levels; develop a framework to monitor and evaluate FFW projects; and establish an in-house capacity in CRS's FFW program to increase the staff time available for project monitoring.","Attached to PD-AAJ-683","Special Evaluation","Documents","632-0135-C-00-1000100","","1/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Food aid programs|Food for Peace|Food for work","Lesotho","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAJ683A.pdf","6,440 KB","","","","English","application/pdf","Indepth evaluation","","Bryson, Judy C.","","3 Jan 1981","","","","Evaluation of food aid programs in lesotho with emphasis on the CRS program","","XD-AAJ-683-A","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTUzNzMx","Lesotho","632PL02|6320135"
"Evaluates Brazilian core project activities under Phase II of the Population and Development Policy Project (PDP II).  Evaluation covers the period ending 9/8l, is based on site interviews with project staff and potential subcontractors, and is attached to a special evaluation (PD-AAJ-063) and three other trip reports. Although the Brazilian core project is still in the early planning stages, its slow progress suggests the target completion date of early 1983 is unrealistic.  Lack of a formal country strategy paper has made it difficult to judge the relevancy of suggested research topics (e.g., trends in the relationship between population and education, sanitation, mortality, and income distribution, respectively) and has forced the contractor, Battelle Memorial Institute (BMI), to rely on past contacts and A.I.D. intermediaries to identify potential subcontractors.  Thus, BMI and A.I.D. have made few contacts with Brazil's research community, except for the director of the Special Projects Division of the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics who has proposed forming a new association to serve as the institutional base for the core project. In addition, BMI must still resolve whether to provide project funds to strengthen the work of family planning (FP) activists (given the considerable friction that exists between FP activists and the Brazilian social science research community). BMI must be prepared to defend whatever decision it makes on this sensitive issue. Finally, it is recommended that a country strategy paper identifying institutional alternatives and describing the complex Brazilian political situation be prepared as soon as possible.","Attached to PD-AAJ-063|Evaluation period: Through Sep 1981|In: Evaluation of the population and development project of|Battelle Memorial Institute/Baker, Raymond : Baron, Barnett : et al.","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","7/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Fertility|Demographic research|Population and demography|Sociology research|Population economics|Economic research|Family planning promotion programs|Change agents|Population policy|Population planning|Technical assistance|Limited data plus","Brazil","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAJ063A.pdf","115 KB","000262 - American Public Health Association","","","English","application/pdf","Evaluation team|Onsite evaluation","","Presser, Harriet B.","","Jul 1981","","","","Battelle project in Brazil","","XD-AAJ-063-A","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTUzNzc2","Brazil","9365900"
"Evaluates Honduran core project activities under the Population and Development Policy (PDP) project.  Evaluation covers the period ending 9/81, is based on site interviews with project staff, and is attached to a special evaluation (PD-AAJ-063) and three other trip reports. After considerable delay, Phase I activities are nearly complete in Honduras.  The Central Regional Center for Population in Bogota, Colombia has assisted the Honduran Government's National Planning Council (CONSUPLANE) to develop and apply the SERES (System for the Study of Social Relations, Economics, and Demographics) model.  Although the model has been used to assess the impact of public expenditures and demographic growth on socioeconomic development and the demand for social services, its utility has been impeded by staff turnovers, poor demographic data, and lack of easily accessible technical assistance. Moreover, because SERES did not become operational until 1979 and because CONSUPLANE has had little influence since the military government was installed, there have been few opportunities to demonstrate the model's usefulness in policymaking or budgeting. Nonetheless, most A.I.D. and CONSUPLANE staff agree that the model can be of great use, depending on the effectiveness of CONSUPLANE's presentation of SERES to other ministries.  As yet, no formal presentations have been made, but there are plans to give several informed presentations in the short time remaining in Phase I of the PDP project, with a national seminar planned for 7/81 receiving high priority. The evaluators conclude that because the RAPID model -- which uses gross relationships to show that rapid population growth is detrimental to economic development -- is less analytical than SERES, presentations of RAPID are not warranted.  Further, given the lack of demographers, the poor quality of demographic data, and the limited amount of ongoing population research, it is recommended that the contractor, Battelle Memorial Institute, not implement any core project activities in Honduras under Phase II of the PDP project.","Attached to PD-AAJ-063|Evaluation period: Through Sep 1981|In: Evaluation of the population and development project of|Battelle Memorial Institute/Baker, Raymond : Baron, Barnett : et al.","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","7/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Demographic research|Population and demography|Sociology research|Population economics|Economic research|Population policy|Population planning|demography|Development planning|National level|Technical assistance|Limited data","Honduras","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAJ063B.pdf","78 KB","000262 - American Public Health Association","","","English","application/pdf","Evaluation team|Onsite evaluation","","Presser, Harriet B.","","Jul 1981","","","","Battelle project in Honduras","","XD-AAJ-063-B","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTUzNzc3","Development Support","9365900"
"Evaluates feasibility of Peruvian core project activities under Phase II of the Population and Development Policy (PDP II) project. Evaluation covers the period ending 9/8l, is based on site visits and interviews with project staff and potential subcontractors, and is attached to a special evaluation (PD-AAJ-063) and three other trip reports. Project efforts have and will likely continue to improve the quality and dissemination of policy-relevant research.  Moreover, the 1980 transition from a military to a democratic government has increased acceptance of population and family planning (FP) programs, as evidenced by inclusion of FP services in a proposed national primary health program, creation of the National Council of Population, and shifting of the National Institute of Statistics from the Ministry of Planning to a separate autonomous organization dealing directly with the more powerful Ministry of Economics and Finance. Nonetheless, PDP II activities will not necessarily change the Peruvian Government's current population policy. Many of the population-oriented research institutions developed or strengthened under Phase I of the PDP project are now being considered for PDP II funding (e.g., the Andean Institute for Studies in Population and Development, the Institute of Peruvian Studies, the National Institute of Statistics, the National Council on Population, and the Peruvian Association of Medical Schools).  The contractor, Battelle Memorial Institute (BMI) has already approved funds to assist the Multidisciplinary Association for Research and Training in Population (AMIDEP) to publish a bimonthly newsletter, conduct conferences and forums on Peruvian population issues, and critically review research on biomedical aspects of population.  To date, AMIDEP has published two high quality newsletters. Relations between USAID/P and BMI have improved under PDP II, but since BMI's key role in developing a workable institutional infrastructure is complete, the evaluators support A.I.D.'s plan to phase out BMI involvement in favor of direct bilateral support.","Attached to PD-AAJ-063|Evaluation period: Through Sep 1981|In: Evaluation of the population and development project of|Battelle Memorial Institute/Baker, Raymond : Baron, Barnett : et al.","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","7/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Demographic research|Population and demography|Sociology research|Family planning research|family planning|Population policy|Population planning|Technical assistance|Limited data plus","Peru","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAJ063C.pdf","538 KB","000262 - American Public Health Association","","","English","application/pdf","Evaluation team|Onsite evaluation","","Presser, Harriet B.","","Jul 1981","","","","Battelle project in Peru","","XD-AAJ-063-C","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTUzNzc4","Development Support","9365900"
"Evaluates Sudanese core project activities under Phase II of the Population and Development Policy Project (PDP II).  Evaluation is based on site visits and interviews with project staff and subcontractors and is attached to a special evaluation (PD-AAJ-063) and three other trip reports; no evaluation period is given. Although the contractor, Battelle Memorial Institute (BMI), has coordinated its activities well with USAID/S and has spent sufficient time in Sudan to ensure productive programming, it has not developed the administrative and promotional procedures needed to create a lasting and positive image of PDP II.  Nonetheless, BMI has written and AID/W has approved a thorough country strategy paper which calls for an integrated, gradual approach to developing a Sudanese Government (SG) population policy -- i.e., achieving fertility control indirectly by improving the quality of life.  A more direct and aggressive fertility reduction program would likely be rejected by the SG and would damage efforts to develop a coordinated population/family planning policy. Despite delays and unnecessary complications, BMI has selected the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) as the sponsoring organization, and both authors and research topics appears well chosen. The research is not likely to result in a notable addition to present knowledge but will, nevertheless, increase the visibility of population research.  In addition, both ESRC and BMI are expected to receive the support of the National Population Committee, a newly formed group of Sudanese leaders concerned with population issues. Finally, it is recommended that BMI adopt procedures that facilitate organization-building and anticipate interorganizational and interpersonal problems which might arise among participating groups and individuals.","Attached to PD-AAJ-063|Evaluation period: Through Sep 1981|In: Evaluation of the population and development project of|Battelle Memorial Institute/Baker, Raymond : Baron, Barnett : et al.","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","7/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Demographic research|Population and demography|Sociology research|Population economics|Economic research|Population policy|Population planning|Family planning research|family planning|Technical assistance|Limited data plus","Sudan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAJ063D.pdf","730 KB","000262 - American Public Health Association","","","English","application/pdf","Evaluation team|Onsite evaluation","","Kelly, Allen","","Jul 1981","","","","Battelle project in Sudan","","XD-AAJ-063-D","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTUzNzc5","Development Support","9365900"
"Evaluates project to establish a multidisciplinary on-farm research capability in the National Agricultural Research Program (PNIA) in Honduras.  Special evaluation covers the period 9/78-4/81 and is based on team review of project documents, interviews, and site visits. On-farm research is becoming more accepted and has proven more responsive to actual conditions than have traditional methods, as progress has been made in introducing and distributing new, high-yield varieties of maize, beans, rice, and sorghum and in developing localized recommendations for planting dates, fertilization, and pest control.  In addition, PNIA has proven responsive to crop epidemics by developing chemical controls for Babosa in beans and Downy Mildew in maize and is stressing alternatives to expensive fertilizers and a technology transfer process involving both farmers and extensionists in research. Improved communications between the National Director of Research and regional directors and between regional research coordinators and their respective regional directors are needed to ensure that both national and regional research needs are addressed. A no less serious problem is the small Government of Honduras (GOH) research budget; outside funding to renew the contracts of researchers already hired and to contract current training graduates is needed, but should be seen only as a short-term solution.  Project experience has shown the need not for several multidisciplinary teams conducting research (as envisioned in the project design), but rather individual researchers supported by a multidisciplinary team. The evaluators recommend efforts to consolidate PNIA's progress toward multidisciplinary on-farm research capability by: providing logistic support for on-farm researchers; helping to reorganize the National Technical Support Unit; enhancing researchers' responsiveness to farmers by purchasing (upon consultation with other donors to PNIA) laboratory equipment for plant breeders; helping researchers develop new ADP programs and acquire appropriate computer accessories; and developing PNIA's long- and short-range planning capacity. Fourteen secondary recommendations are provided.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","5/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural research|Institution building|Crop yield|Beneficiary interviews","Honduras","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAJ769.pdf","1,746 KB","008555 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to develop rural technologies in Honduras. Evaluation, attached to a PES (PD-AAJ-773), covers the period 1/80-1/81 and consists of a Government of Honduras (GOH) committee report. Project activities planned for the first year were not completed, due to overly optimistic program design; insufficient time allowed for organization, startup, and personnel recruitment; complicated and time-consuming financial and operational arrangments by GOH and A.I.D.; and personnel transfer after the 6/80 change of government.  People involved in the project failed to understand its nature and potential benefits and failed to assign it high priority at the administrative level.  Lack of GOH counterpart funds resulted in shortage of extensionists for demonstration, testing, and distribution of appropriate technologies for almost a year.  Not all the appropriated funds were utilized.  About 60% of the goals were reached, although only two executive units were functioning. In order to implement project emphasis on increased small farmer income, it is recommended that:  contracts be completed for qualified personnel in the Development and Adaptation Unit (UDA); a direct administrative link be created between UDA and the Ministry of Natural Resources (MNR); and further support be provided by A.I.D. for key personnel until GOH counterpart funds are forthcoming.  Also recommended are immediate integration of advisory committees, estimates of the comparative benefits of different technologies, and accelerated technical assistance, especially ""turnkey"" assistance (assistance continued until an industry is operational) to small industry. Other recommendations include revising project goals for 1981-1982 to adjust for overly optimistic first year goals; seeking A.I.D. and GOF support to integrate project management by 6/30/81; and emphasizing involvement by potential beneficiaries.","Attached to PD-AAJ-773","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","3/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Appropriate technology|Rural areas|Small farms|Farmers|Technology transfer|Small scale enterprises|Business enterprises|Limited data","Honduras","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAJ773A.pdf","1,378 KB","008555 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to develop rural technologies in Honduras. Evaluation covers the period 10/1/79-12/31/80 and consists of a Government of Honduras (GOH) committee report. First year accomplishments included fabrication of nine prototype farm implements, of which the waterwheel was considered most important for Honduran rural development (183 users in 21 communities, and 105 waterwheels contracted for or under construction, with six of them already installed).  Field studies were completed on 584 profiles of small industries and economic analyses made of 142 enterprises.  A strategy was devised for testing and distributing household technologies by private volunteer agencies (PVO's), and criteria were developed for selecting communities to demonstrate multiple-use stoves. Courses in waterwheel construction, soldering, and dressmaking were given with the cooperation of the Instituto de Formacion Profesional (INFOP). Study of a wood drier was begun and a proposal made for testing prototype grain driers and hydraulic rams.  The grain drier was tested with positive results but another design with reduced cost and capacity is being sought. Shortfalls occurred in key personnel contracts, logistical support (e.g., machinery, vehicles), international communication, and decisionmaking. Recommendations include closer cooperation among high level officials in order to provide political and economic support to achieve project purposes; simplifying personnel and PVO contracts; and decentralizing the administration of the Ministry of Natural Resources (MNR) and augmenting auditing and administrative personnel in the Centro de Desarrollo Industrial (CDI) in order to simplify procedures.  New efforts to obtain a contract with the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Honduras (UNAH), or a search for other institutions or mechanisms to accomplish the task of technology testing, are recommended.  It is also suggested that state or private institutions be invited to design a plan for practical instruction in pottery in the Goascoran region to resolve community problems.","Attached to PD-AAJ-773","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","2/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Appropriate technology|Rural areas|Small farms|Farmers|Technology transfer|Small scale enterprises|Business enterprises|Limited data","Honduras","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAJ773B.pdf","2,007 KB","","","","Spanish","application/pdf","Evaluation team","","Montes, Oscar|Freije, Ricardo|et al.","","Feb 1981","","","","Evaluacion del programa de tecnologias rurales","Evaluation of the rural technology program","XD-AAJ-773-B","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTUzODQ3","Honduras","5220157"
"Evaluates follow-on integrated rural development project in two Jamaican watersheds.  This first part of a special evaluation covers the period 1/79-4/81 and is based on a survey of 58 farmers and on field tests during site visits. The impact on farmers of two key project components - soil conservation (SC) and adoption of an agricultural production model - was found to be wanting (for reasons given in the report's second part).  In regard to SC, it was found that although construction of the treatments was generally good, farmers have not properly maintained them and so have reduced their effectiveness.  It was also found that a number of planned waterways have not been built due to implementation problems, and that completed waterways suffer from construction and maintenance difficulties.  To improve project performance, it is recommended to: conduct run-off studies; lay greater stress on agronomic SC treatments and maintenance of SC treatments; educate farmers in SC treatments; revise the subsidy system to provide maintenance incentives; refine staff replacement procedures to ensure continuity; have field officers test treatment strength before paying construction bills; improve the training of field assistants and senior laborers; and make more frequent use of mini-convertible terraces and intermittent branch terraces. It was also found that the practices recommended by the project to improve agricultural production have not been widely adopted.  Only 23% of fields were properly intercropped; incorrect fertilizer had been used in 66% of the cases; spray materials were used infrequently; and few farmers used continuous mounds in yam cultivation. A seedling mortality rate of 35% also reflected poor farming practices. These findings demonstrate a need for standard specifications for agronomic practices; more vigorous extension efforts; improved coordination between agronomy and extension efforts; agronomic research performed under actual farm conditions; the establishment of subcenter research stations; more farmer training sessions; and the establishment of a private sector supply store in the Pindars River area.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","6/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Integrated rural development|Soil conservation|Agricultural production|Beneficiary interviews","Jamaica","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAJ835.pdf","2,683 KB","000403 - Cornell University.

"Evaluates project to control soil erosion and increase agricultural production in two watersheds in Jamaica.  Special evaluation covers the period 1/79-4/81; no methodology is indicated. After two years of participation by farmers in the project, soil conservation treatments have not been maintained and improved cropping practices have not been adopted.  This lack of success stems from a project paper which set unrealistic, undesirable, or contradictory goals; proposed inappropriate technology; and made invalid assumptions about the agricultural sector. Project soil conservation techniques are inappropriate for small farmers because they are costly, complicated, and unsuitable for lands held under insecure tenure, and because they create a dependence upon skilled workers. The achievement of a 250% increase in agricultural production, a goal set in the mid-1970's, has been thwarted by high labor costs and low demand for locally-produced food.  The goal of providing long-term employment opportunities is unattainable because farmers lack incentives for intensifying cropping patterns.  Without such employment opportunities, there is little hope for stemming rural-to-urban migration. Farmer participation in the project is short-term, requires no input of resources from farmers, and does not include farmers in planning and decisionmaking, thus precluding sustained progress and community development. To increase project performance, it is recommended that:  agronomic soil conservation techniques be stressed to enhance the probability of both reducing soil erosion and replicating the project; the project get a clear and immediate signal from the government specifying the types of crops for which there is a market; decisions regarding soil conservation or crops be made with farmer input; and allocation and distribution of benefits be tied to resource commitments by farmers.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","6/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural production|Soil conservation|Food production|Watersheds","Jamaica|Caribbean","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAJ836.pdf","745 KB","008563 - USAID.

"Evaluates grant to strengthen the capability of the African Medical and Research Foundation (AMREF) to provide rural health care services and training programs in Kenya.  Special evaluation covers the period 7/79-11/81 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with AMREF, Ministry of Health (MOH), and community officials. AMREF has dramatically expanded its staff and has increased the number of projects conducted from 11 to 22.  The Kibwezi Health Center, although 8 months delayed in construction, now serves some 3,000 outpatients and 40 inpatients per month; 19 (vs. 20 targeted) staff are deployed at the Health Center.  The mobile outreach program is operational, covering 6 widely dispersed service points, 80 Community Health Workers have been trained, and 6 one-day seminars were held for health staff.  AMREF plans to initiate several new activities in Kibwezi, including programs in nutrition, water and sanitation, and midwife training. With regard to learning resources, only 3 of 8 planned manuals (on epidemiology, therapeutic guidelines, and community health) have been printed and distributed; the rest are expected to be distributed during 1982.  AMREF's health publication, Afya, has increased its circulation by one-third to 6,000 per issue, while its health education magazine, Defender, increased its readership to 9,000.  AMREF has conducted a socio-anthropological study of health attitudes and beliefs in the Kibwezi area, focusing on birth attendants, as well as evaluations of its Medical Radio Communications Network and Flying Doctor Services. AMREF's most serious shortcoming is its failure to systematically collect data on all its activities.  As a result, some valuable experiences have not been documented.  More analysis of project information and additional data collection are needed, as well as an accounting system more useful in project planning and evaluation.  Other recommendations are to:  make mid-level staff responsible for day-to-day project implementation and concentrate senior staff efforts on project evaluation, review, and development; increase interdepartmental coordination (especially between AMREF's Medical Director and its finance department); and strengthen ties with the MOH.","Attached to PD-AAL-160","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/afr-G-1560","","12/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Rural areas|Health care|Community health workers|Medical education|Clinics","Kenya","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAL160A.pdf","6,512 KB","008565 - USAID.

"Appropriate agricultural technologies (AAT) could greatly improve Egypt's agricultural production.  This paper compares successful AAT projects in Turkey and Pakistan with ongoing efforts in Egypt, particularly the AID-funded Small Scale Agricultural Activities Project (SSAA), identifying points of commonality and developing a generalized approach to AAT. Successful projects had six points in common: (1) an agricultural need was identified; (2) an AAT was developed to meet that need; (3) a prototype was developed/adapted to the technical capabilities of local manufacturers; (4) the product was field tested; (5) the prototype was modified after trials; and (6) the product was extended to manufacturers and end-users. The main agricultural needs in Egypt were identified as: (1) mechanization with tractors, appropriate tractor attachments, and farm implements; (2) cottage and agro-industries (e.g., food processing); and (3) alternative energy technologies using solar, wind, and biogas power. AAT can only be implemented if the Government of Egypt, Western donors, and recipient farmers have a positive attitude towards new technologies and are given adequate research and development (R&D) assistance, suitable manufacturing conditions, and extension links between the manufacturers and the final users.  Egyptian R&D institutions and manufacturing workshops can, with additional funding, be developed through training programs, better equipment, and technical assistance.  However, Egyptian extension links are almost non-existent and will require coordination between banks, the Ministry of Agriculture, donors, R&D institutes, and local areas. The SSAA, designed to introduce AAT in Egypt, utilizes small shops and intensive on-site testing.  To date, no SSAA technologies are in use in rural areas nor are training programs geared toward manufacturers and end-users. However, the SSAA, through the provision of grants and technical assistance, could be used for extension activities and to establish needed links between the development and implementation of AAT in Egypt.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","NEB-0096-C-00-1063-00","","1/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural technology|Appropriate technology","Egypt|Turkey|Pakistan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAJ891.pdf","631 KB","008539 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to establish a combined agricultural training center/production farm to train farmers and school-leavers and introduce improved farming techniques in Togo's Notse region.  Special evaluation covers the period FY77-81 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with project personnel and trainees. Opportunities Industrialization Centers/Togo (OIC) performed poorly in implementing the project in the first 3 years but has since shown limited improvement.  OIC is especially faulted for the weak caliber of its project personnel and for its inability to interface with the Togolese Government.  While OIC headquarters offered frequent and substantive support to OIC/Togo, it grossly miscalculated in thinking that the project's farm production component would support and sustain the training component. For its part, A.I.D. changed the way it oversees PVO's (feeling compelled to keep very close tabs on PVO activity) and provided little technical guidance; A.I.D. was also slow in authorizing FY81 funding. Attainment of outputs is as follows:  42 of 120 ha (later revised to 50 ha) of land being used for agricultural production; crop rotation practices not in use and yields low considering the level of technology being applied; 59 of a projected 140 young farmers (revised to 70) trained as of 10/80 and only 35 of them resettled; the planned organization of 90 farmers into credit unions to buy farm machinery not achieved, although 10 farmers received a loan from the national credit agency; an off-site training program - not part of the original project design - reaching 114 farmers; 4 of 60 extension agents trained due to emphasis on farmer training; 24 of 28 planned Togolese counterpart staff trained, although 13 of them are no longer with the project; impressive core and basic skills curricula developed and in use; and most planned facilities and some which were not originally planned (extra dormitory, workshop, and kitchen) built. Specific recommendation are provided and various options for the project's future - ranging from phasing out A.I.D. support to to extending support for 2 years to direct A.I.D. implementation of the project - are offered.","Evaluation period: FY 1977-1981","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","12/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Farmer training|Agricultural extension training|Educational facilities","Togo","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAL226.pdf","4,214 KB","000027 - USAID.

"Honduras has the lowest ratio of roads to area and population in all of Central America. To assist Honduran road construction, A.I.D. developed two roads approaches differing in inputs and impacts. In 1965, A.I.D. approved a project to build feeder roads in areas isolated from marketplaces on the ""trickle-down"" theory that the roads would benefit rich and poor alike, lead to cash crop production, and reduce subsistence farming and cattle ranching. The project called for road construction with no complementary credit, extension, or marketing services. Case studies of two of the feeder roads showed that the roads stimulated the cultivation of additional land, the production of cash crops, and also improved local access to medical and educational services. Project benefits varied, however, depending on external factors. In one case, sugar cane production increased due to a sugar mill built after road completion, while in the other, an agrarian reform program initiated by the National Agrarian Institute promoted production of palm oil and citrus by small farmer cooperatives. In 1974, A.I.D approved a project to assist agrarian reform by providing credit and technical assistance to model rural cooperatives and by constructing roads to connect cooperative fields to all-weather highways. Project delays prevented the planned use of local construction crews, education regarding the roads' benefits, and the establishment of an ongoing local road maintenance unit. These roads encouraged cash cropping, the availability of credit and extension services, and the cooperatives' development of schools. The evaluation team concluded the following: roads are needed for development, but do not guarantee it; corollary policies greatly affect the roads' distribution of socioeconomic benefits; access roads are more consistent with A.I.D.'s new policy than are feeder roads, since the former allows specific selection of beneficiaries; and, a road's long-term impact makes it difficult to render a final project assessment. Appended are descriptions of evaluation methodology, a technical analysis of the roads, and an aerial study of the first project's impact in one area.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Roads|Rural areas|Access roads|FARM TO MARKET ROADS","Honduras","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAH971.pdf","2,315 KB","000156 - USAID.

"The socioeconomic and institutional impacts of the A.I.D. Rural Roads I and II projects in the Philippines are herein assessed. Of 69 completed or nearly completed road construction projects, 8 were selected to be analyzed as a representative cross-section. Overall, road construction proceeded well, but maintenance was inadequate.  Socioeconomic impacts ranged from nil to dramatic, but the institutional impact was disappointing as provincial planning and engineering offices failed to reach desirable levels of professional competence or to achieve staff continuity.  The provinces did not conduct high-quality feasibility studies or keep up to date on evaluation schedules.  Road selection was based primarily on political rather than equity considerations. Nevertheless, project-constructed roads allowed more people to market their produce directly and significantly improved rural access to doctors, clinics, and hospitals in adjoining areas. Other infrastructure (e.g., power systems) was expanded in some areas, but generally not as a result of the project.  Social benefits were modest and educational and recreational benefits very minor.  However, the great majority of residents interviewed said they had benefited from project activities. Lessons learned are:  site selection criteria need to be more precise if benefits are to be focused on the rural poor; institution-building might have been more cost-effective if focused on regional rather than provincial offices, although this might have compromised decentralization goals; design was strongly biased in favor of capital-intensive methods and community involvement was limited; feasibility studies had little effect in determining construction priorities; design standards were too high for prevailing conditions; impacts would have been greater had construction/improvement of provincial roads and barangay township roads been linked and had there been better coordination with other rural development programs; the construction of penetration (as opposed to feeder) roads and of bridges has had the greatest impacts; and the Fixed Amount Reimbursement scheme was, on balance, a positive aspect and merits consideration in other A.I.D. projects.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Rural development|Institution building|Road construction|Road maintenance|Beneficiary interviews","Philippines","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAH973.pdf","2,586 KB","000156 - USAID.

"The direct and indirect benefits of rural electrification in Ecuador warrant A.I.D.'s continued sponsorship of such programs. This assessment of A.I.D.'s 1964-75 sponsorship of four electrification projects in Ecuador concludes that, although implemented along with other development projects such as road construction, the program was a key factor in upgrading the towns of Santa Elena, Santo Domingo de los Colorados, Daule, and Ambato into regional market and service centers. The main benefits of this program, which was not originally designed to benefit the poor, were job creation, access to agricultural product processing facilities, and increased opportunities for small commercial enterprises. The growth of Santa Elena into a successful summer resort, with tourism and its related services the major economic activities, was made possible by electricity. Santo Domingo now features small industries of metal mechanics and automotive repair, as well as 67 crop processing plants for coffee, hemp, and milk. Electricity in Daule also led to local processing plants, as it led to the growth of small industry/artisanry activities in Ambato. Residential electricity has been mainly used for appliances of convenience and recreation, which is not to diminish its importance to those who made sacrifices for this luxury. The direct impact of electricity upon agricultural production has been nil, however, as has been its effect upon delivery of social services to rural areas. Since, in the absence of the development potential provided by a market town or service center, rural electrification has a low cost-benefit ratio, it should be designed as part of an integrated development process. The issue for A.I.D. is not whether electrification is worthwhile, but whether A.I.D. should alter its role from funding the purchase of equipment to providing technical assistance and training. In addition, A.I.D.'s marginally successful use of cooperatives did not correspond to local conditions and improperly employed a top-to-bottom approach. In future impact evaluations, local scientists should conduct advance field surveys. Appendices include a description of the evaluation's methodology and a 24-item bibliography (1972-80).","Loans 518-L-023, 518-L-024, 518-L-035|Project numbers 5180069, -0071, and -0072 are also given on|document transmittal form.

"Primary education is alive, if struggling, in Nepal. This report measures the impact of A.I.D.'s educational projects in Nepal over a 20-year period (1954-75). After briefly describing the genesis of Nepal's education modernization program, to which A.I.D. has been the only major donor, the authors evaluate the program's successes and shortfalls. Successes include dramatic increases in the numbers of primary schools (PS) (from 321 to 8,708), PS students (0.9-59% of that age group), PS teachers (640-17,728), secondary schools (11-2,809), secondary school enrollment (0.15-24%), an increased literacy rate (2%-17%), and development of a cadre of 310 trained educational administrators (a key area of A.I.D. assistance), a totally Nepali curriculum, and a superior textbook production and distribution system. Nevertheless, severe problems remain. Stressing quantitative expansion has led to low quality and levels of learning (especially in writing and mathematics), a 50% rate of student dropout before functional literacy is attained, and schools that are isolated (in rural areas), overcrowded (in urban areas), and unhealthy. Due to advancement opportunities for trained teachers -- the largest area of A.I.D. assistance -- and increases in the number of PS's, qualified teachers are still in short supply. The vocational training (VT) system has failed due to insufficient training levels, lack of employment incentives, and student use of the system as a springboard to college. At the same time, as in other countries, the development of basic education in Nepal has impacted positively on economic and agricultural development, fertility rates, health, and women's role and societal status and has generated attitudes conducive to overall development. The success of A.I.D.'s assistance, which should motivate further A.I.D. education assistance efforts, demonstrates that significant impact is possible when consistent support is given over a sufficient period of time and when local as well as U.S. costs are financed. Other lessons learned include the need to develop innovative educational approaches and to improve VT programs by correcting the above deficiencies. Appendices include a 61-item bibliography (1954-80).","Attachment: XN-AAJ-168-A","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","EDUCATION|Vocational training|TEACHER TRAINING|Development program evaluation|Primary education|Secondary education|Educational materials","Nepal","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAJ168.pdf","2,048 KB","000156 - USAID.

"Although the value of Instructional Systems Design (ISD) had been proven, ISD had never been applied on a large-scale in a developing country until A.I.D. funded such an effort in the Republic of Korea (ROK) from 1972-77. This report draws several conclusions based on this success. Although converging factors -- deep cultural respect for education, a growing cadre of trained educators, an urgent need for educational reform, and a motivated government -- made the setting ideal, the project clearly proved the value of ISD to a developing country's educational system. In seeking to provide cost-effective education to prepare Korea's youth to enter the working world, the project, implemented by Florida State University, established the Korean Educational Development Institute (KEDI) to orchestrate reforms, including a modernized curriculum reflecting Korean culture and the technical needs of a growing economy; development of guides to upgrade instructors' capabilities; the introduction of Instructional Radio, Educational Television, and correspondence high schools; a rapid increase in higher education enrollment; abolition of private tutoring which had favored the wealthy; and creation of an Educational Research Information Clearinghouse and a 14-year Educational Development Plan. The report concludes that: (1) many countries need institutions such as KEDI, staffed by committed and purposeful people, to invent functionally useful educational practices; (2) flexible project execution is essential to meet changing circumstances and maintain host country support; (3) A.I.D. programs should give priority to proven technologies in which the United States leads; (4) continuity of technical assistance from a qualified source strengthens a donor's contribution; (5) in any potentially controversial project, selling the project concept is as important as good implementation; and (6) donors often attempt too much without providing adequate time and money.

"Each year Thailand's Mobile Trade Training Schools (MTTS's) teach employable skills to 30,000 rural men and women who might otherwise move to the cities and join the ranks of the urban unemployed. This report traces the history and analyzes the impact of MTTS's. In 1960, despite a 30% literacy rate among the 87% of Thailand's population which was rural, educational change came slowly and favored the cities. Based on the belief that peasants valued education, the MTTS's were designed in the early 1960's to operate from provincial polytechnic schools, using portable tools and travelling instructors, to teach employable skills to drop outs. Under USAID assistance (1966-72), the 45 MTTS's became more permanent and expanded their courses to include skills upgrading and skills for personal use in traditional subjects (e.g., auto mechanics, dressmaking) and newer fields (air conditioning, radio repair). Of the 80,000 students enrolled, 56,000 graduated, and many non-graduates acquired employable skills. Since 1972, MTTS's have had a lasting impact on the Thai educational system and on the lives of the rural poor, supporting and diversifying rural values and offering a local alternative to the traditional apprentice system. About one-half of the MTTS's are still operating, but many others have been absorbed by a broader nonformal education system of Lifelong Education Centers which are modelled on the MTTS's, employ many MTTS teachers, and, together with the MTTS's, annually enroll 40-45,000 students. The success, popularity, and endurance of MTTS's has shown that: (1) Providing short-term vocational training to a large number of marginally educated people can positively effect rural development. (2) Nonformal education can integrate the rural poor into the mainstream of national life and thus aid national unity. (3) Projects conceived to serve a limited purpose can sometimes become a catalyst to broader development efforts. (4) Projects which appeal to the perceived needs of beneficiaries can succeed -- contrary to conventional wisdom -- even without beneficiaries participating at the design stage. MTTS enrollment and staffing data, a course listing, and profiles of six graduates are appended.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Educational methods|Education|Rural areas|School buildings|Nonformal education|Mobile units|Continuing education|Vocational training","Thailand","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAJ171.pdf","957 KB","000156 - USAID.

"ALCOSA, a large agribusiness in Guatemala was evaluated favorably by A.I.D. in 1977, but subsequently criticized by others as having unexpected negative social impacts.  This review attempts to resolve this ambiguity.  ALCOSA's growth, operations, and its impacts - at the company processing plant and in three cauliflower-producing highland towns - are discussed. By 1980, due to organizational and technical problems, ALCOSA was facing an operating crisis.  Vegetable purchasing had outstripped the company's capacity to control and administer it, leading to a breakdown in field organization, temporary suspension of purchases, and losses for 300 to 400 of the 2,000 small farmers involved.  In addition, field employees had defrauded farmers, sometimes for long periods before being detected and dismissed by management.  In one town, ALCOSA's close relationship with its Ladino subcontractor worsened already strong Ladino-Cakchiquel (Indian) tensions.  The company is taking steps to resolve these problems. There have, however, been several positive effects, including at the village level:  increased use of credit and investment in farm equipment; much new agricultural know-how; improved living standards; and a shift from cultivating a variety of vegetables to concentration on cauliflower and broccoli and a related appreciation of the efficiency of marketing large quantities of produce to a commercial purchaser as opposed to small time-consuming local sales.  In many cases, participation in the ALCOSA program has enabled the poorest farmers to increase their incomes and to remain independent family farmers. In one village, Santiago, women participate more fully in agricultural production, almost as equal partners with their husbands. Here, ALCOSA's impact has been most positive, perhaps because the residents have used the company as a resource for planned community development, and because ALCOSA works through a cooperative, avoiding the tensions existing elsewhere. At the ALCOSA plant, where almost all employees are women, wages are high, permitting workers either a new economic freedom or a great increase in family standard of living; 95% of employees report high satisfaction with their jobs, pay, and lives as workers.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/LAC-C-1399","","1/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Agribusiness|Food industry|Agricultural economics|Women in development|Agricultural production|Agricultural laborers|Small farms|Farmers|Employment","Guatemala","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAJ172.pdf","3,081 KB","000156 - USAID.

"Although the design and perspective of the Northern Nigeria Teacher Education Project (NNTEP: 1965-69) were deficient, and little progress was made toward end-of-project objectives, NNTEP was nonetheless a success. This document describes the lessons provided by NNTEP for the design and implementation of future participant training programs, especially those in the education sector.  The authors' major conclusion is that NNTEP's unanticipated effects had a more important and longstanding impact on the leadership and institutional development of the Nigerian education system than did the negligible progress made in improving the quality and efficiency of primary teacher training. After describing the project's history and original objectives, the paper discusses several impediments to the achievement of A.I.D. expectations. For example, the University of Wisconsin (UW), which implemented the project, had insufficient experience and time to devote to curriculum development, despite A.I.D.'s emphasis on this particular component. Nevertheless, the collaborative work on curriculum development between UW and the Ahmadu Bello University Institute of Education (IE) contributed substantially to IE's growth as a major educational resource and influence in the region. Another of NNTEP's major achievements was the development of a regional consensus on examinations and curriculum. A key lesson taught by NNTEP is that the training program's success was largely due to highly motivated trainees, committed mid-career professionals, and host country recognition of the contracted U.S. university as a superior institution. NNTEP also demonstrated, however, that curriculum reform cannot be achieved overnight and, more generally, that technical assistance projects must be designed with realistic implementation schedules and carefully delineated supervisory responsibilities. A.I.D. should show host governments alternative, least-cost solutions to stated policy goals, including one of the most effective of such strategies, participant training. Appendices on evaluation methodology, NNTEP curriculum development, and the expansion and financing of the Nigerian educational system are included.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Curriculum design|Rural areas|Educational development|Universities and colleges|Teacher education","Nigeria","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAJ173.pdf","861 KB","000156 - USAID.

"Because Costa Rica had abundant hydroelectric potential and a government which was strongly committed to equitable growth, a considerable return was reaped from a relatively small investment in rural electrification (RE). This report details this success and A.I.D.'s contribution (1965-69). Aiming to diversify agriculture, increase income, expand agroindustry, and develop replicable RE cooperatives (REC's), the project produced positive but not wholly anticipated results -- small sugar and rice processers benefitted more than larger enterprises in Guanacaste; San Carlos' dairy industry grew markedly but at the expense of agricultural diversification; and coffee production quadrupled and in-migration increased in San Marcos. In general, RE had the greatest impact on agricultural processing and less impact on farm-level production, partly due to the absence of outreach programs to enlist farmer participation. RE had a clearer impact on expanding health care and educational opportunity -- the availability of electric lighting led to creation of an extensive night school system. In terms of quality, quantity, and cost of service (fees are based on the size of customers' property), REC's were rated highly by users. The project's success has shown that: (1) income and ability to utilize electricity are interrelated; (2) accurate forecasting in RE projects is difficult; (3) RE can be financially risky until a certain degree of growth occurs in a project area; (4) supportive government policies and funding of educational programs to motivate participation contribute to REC success; (5) RE's impact on agroindustry can be partially predicted based on existing patterns of productive activities; (6) where RE costs can be minimized and the rural poor are concentrated, electricity can become the favored type of household energy, although firewood stoves may still be preferred for cooking; (7) RE alone does not affect rural-urban migration, but combined with other interventions it enhances rural life and stems migration. Descriptions of the REC's, RE clients, RE's value and use, the role of RE in migration, household survey methodology, and a 65-item English and Spanish bibliography (1965-80) are appended.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","ELECTRIFICATION|RURAL DEVELOPMENT|ELECTRIC POWER|HOUSEHOLD SURVEYS","Costa Rica","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAJ175.pdf","2,786 KB","000156 - USAID.

"Where piped water is a local priority, A.I.D. should be willing to authorize projects aimed solely at improving the accessibility, quantity, and quality of water to the exclusion of other health interventions. This and other lessons found in this report were learned in an AID-funded CARE project to provide piped water, vaccinations, health education, and sewers in Peru's Ancash Department. For a $20 fee and less than 15 cents per month, 2,600 households in the smallest villages received piped water from 29 gravity-fed water systems which supplied 60 liters of potable water per day. The impact was pronounced. Not only did use of piped water for drinking, cooking, and bathing increase, women were relieved of the burden of spending 3 hours each day collecting water and so had more time for productive activities such as weaving. Unexpectedly, women also made inroads into the male-dominated social structure by participating in the village juntas which conducted many project activities. Because the project produced lasting tangible benefits, villagers' predisposition to community action was stimulated. On the other hand, the vaccination program was cancelled; there was no indication that health education improved health, and, because of higher installation costs and fewer perceived benefits, only five sewer systems were built. The project also showed that: (1) development projects often upset the status quo and cause conflict among implementers; (2) private voluntary organizations can be a valuable resource in specialized projects; (3) when a project's purpose is to provide drinking water, perfunctory evaluations attempting to attribute health impacts to the project should not be conducted; (4) since imported materials often become a limiting factor, use of local construction materials, even when more expensive, should be encouraged to enhance a project's sustainability and to support local industry; and (5) where voluntary participation in community projects is traditional, food for work can be counterproductive. The evaluation methodology and persons contacted; the project budget, design, and chronology; water system diagrams and statistics; and recommendations for the Government of Peru are appended.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","SANITATION|Health care|WATER SUPPLY|Rural areas","Peru","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAJ176.pdf","1,352 KB","000156 - USAID.

"To address the potable water needs of semiurban communities (population 5,000-10,000) overlooked by rural and urban development projects, A.I.D. joined CARE in l977 to sponsor a piped water system (PWS) project for 6 South Korean communities. This report, based on interviews with PWS operators and users, evaluates the project's impact and lessons for the future.  The project was generally unsuccessful, failing to achieve any of its objectives completely. Only four of six targeted PWS's were fully operational by the project completion date (1979) and two of these were technically deficient, failing to treat water sufficiently or to locate adequate water sources.  In addition, only one village committee had been formed to operate their PWS system; the public education program was poorly conceived and managed; a lack of baseline data made it impossible to measure the project's impact on community health; and a user requirement to pay for connections and meters put the system beyond the reach of many poor households. There was also an indirect negative effect: runoff from flush toilets (the installation of which the project facilitated) created a potential for transmitting waterborne diseases.  The project's major shortcoming, however, was that its design lacked any features allowing it to be replicated nationally or even regionally.  On the positive side, the project did save time and make life easier for users, especially women. Chief lessons learned and accepted by the Government of Korea were that PWS project priority need not necessarily go to the poorest towns since these often experience shrinking populations and prefer traditional water sources; PWS's should be accessible to the poor but without subsidization; project design should entail a regional or national focus to serve as a model; and evironmental assessments should accompany all PWS's.  Using identical data but focusing on the piped-water supply throughout all of Korea, an attached second evaluation recommends, among other things, servicing urban industrial and polluted rural areas before those with traditional, but sanitary water supplies.  Other recommendations are included in the appendices.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","EVALUATION|USAID|POTABLE WATER|VILLAGES|Water use|RURAL AREAS|Water supply|Health","Korea R","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAJ170.pdf","1,605 KB","000156 - USAID.

"Despite agreement that evaluation is integral to development programs, substantial diversity exists on the best methods of evaluating nutri- tion interventions.  This report, based on the present practices of several multilateral, bilateral, and private donors, reviews these methods. The authors propose standardized evaluation terms and concepts for examining nutrition education, supplementary feeding, food fortification, multisectoral, and planning programs.  Presented are two models of nutrition programming -- A.I.D.'s logframe, outlining a causal progression of events at the input, output, purpose, and goal levels; and the Nutrient Flow Model, depicting nutrition as a function of activities such as food production, trade, loss, and distribution. Linked to each of these models, respectively, are process and impact evaluations.  For process evaluations (often conducted along with impact evaluations), information is collected on pre-existing indi- cators, project components, and intervening events in order to reveal nutritional improvements attributable to a program.  Impact evalua- tions seek to determine improvements in overall nutritional status. Various impact evaluation designs (e.g., situation assessment, before/ after, recurrent institution cycle, comparison groups) and threats to their internal and external validity are reviewed.  The authors also discuss alternative evaluation methodologies which combine aspects of both evaluation types to assess such program aspects as effort, adequacy, appropriateness, etc.  They also differentiate operational program evaluation (analysis of a program's specific impact and performance), the subject of this report, from basic research (knowledge gained using scientific methods and controlled experi- mentation) and evaluative research (field testing applications of existing knowledge). Anthropometric, biochemical, clinical, and dietary nutritional measures are examined in terms of objectivity, coverage, directness, completeness, and precision.  Also presented are 70 abstracts of published evaluations, emphasizing methodology over outcomes, and brief descriptions of the programs and approaches of several donors involved in nutrition programs. A 171-item bib- liography (1955-80) is appended.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/otr-147-80-91","","1/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","NUTRITION|Evaluation methodology|DEVELOPMENT ORGANIZATIONS|Scientific information|VOLUNTARY ORGANIZATIONS|Development program evaluation|Development program planning","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAJ174.pdf","8,419 KB","000385 - Community Systems Foundation","","","English","application/pdf","","","Sahn, David E.|Pestronk, Robert M.","Human nutrition","1981","","","AID program evaluation discussion paper, no. 10","Review of issues in nutrition program evaluation","","PN-AAJ-174","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTY0NzI5","",""

"Although Somalia is developing a national population and family planning (FP) program, prospects for its success are mixed according to this report on the country's current and planned FP activities. Negative factors include lack of a national FP policy, tradition, a low population density, and a pronatalist mentality stemming from a high infant mortality rate (150/1000) and the needs of the military.  On the other hand, most women interviewed expressed a desire for childspacing, a measure which Parliament has approved for maternal/child health (MCH) purposes; the 10 doctors trained by The Johns Hopkins Program for International Education in Gynecology and Obstetrics (JHPIEGO) are eager to increase the currently meager supply of contraceptives; and the politically powerful Somali Women's Democratic Organization (SWDO) is a potential force for spreading FP. General recommendations are that A.I.D.:  support the provision of primary health care, including FP, in an extended health delivery system in Somalia; procure, through an intermediary donor, an adequate supply of contraceptives; assess JHPIEGO's effects on the availability of FP services; expedite implementation of the delayed Primary Health Care Project to extend MCH and FP services to rural areas and define the roles of project participants; contract a U.S. institution to provide technical assistance for the proposed Knowledge, Attitude, and Practice studies; explore the possibility of establishing a Contraceptive Retail Sales Program in Somalia; help the Ministry of Health (MOH) develop an FP information management system; and coordinate FP activities with those of the International Planned Parenthood Foundation.  Use of the SWDO health component to communicate FP information and a series of MOH family health and childspacing broadcasts are also recommended.  More specific recommendations focus on integrating demographic factors in economic planning; collecting and analyzing health data; and establishing regional statistical offices. Included are reviews of the social and cultural factors affecting development of a national FP program and of in-country demographic data collection and population research, FP program management, and programs for women; and nine study-related appendices.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/dspe-C-0053","","11/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Women in development|Family planning|Maternal child health care|Cultural environment|Health workers|Medical education|Family planning behavior|Demographic surveys|Data collection|Contraceptive agents and devices|Technical assistance","Somalia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAJ987.pdf","2,005 KB","000262 - American Public Health Association","","000077 - USAID.

"At its current 3% growth rate, Egypt's population will double to over 85 million by the year 2004.  Given these alarming statistics, the Egyptian Ministry of Education (MOE) began yearly workshops in 1977 to provide an orientation in population and environmental education (P&EE) to enable Egyptian teachers to introduce modern methods and materials in these subjects in the school system.  In October 1980 the MOE initiated a year-long correspondence course in population studies to prepare participants for the 1981 workshop, the subject of this report. The workshop's agenda focused on using a large number of nontraditional teaching methods (e.g., brainstorming, problem-solving, role-playing, etc.) to treat the six subject areas (key population concepts, influences on population growth, Egyptian and world population problems and policies, physiology of reproduction, and population planning); and on evaluating participants' performance in the correspondence course and at the workshop, as well as their attitudes (through pre- and post-test surveys) towards P&EE issues and specific teaching methods. Based on their observations, the U.S. consulting team prepared a list of recommendations.  These included that:  the MOE form subject area P&EE teams to identify and develop curricula and teacher guides with emphasis on teaching method rather than population theory; separate trainer-of-trainer workshops for each discipline be held to prepare a number of participants from each geographical district to lead local P&EE workshops funded by MOE; outside lectures on physiology of reproduction and other subjects not directly related to developing local workshops be reduced or omitted; the MOE consider reducing the number of topics into which P&EE is integrated in order to achieve large-scale training more quickly in a few disciplines; the high priority of P&EE be reflected in national student examinations; and that special attention be given to attitudinal reorientation toward population-related issues such as women's rights, male involvement in and religious or traditional barriers to family planning, sex education, contraception, and Egypt's population policy. Appendixes detail the workshop's agenda and materials and include an 18-item list of references (1975-80).","Evaluation period: 27 Jul-31 Aug 1981","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/dspe-C-0053","","11/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Environmental education|Population policy|Teacher training|Educational planning|Meetings|Population growth|Technical assistance","Egypt","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAJ989.pdf","964 KB","000262 - American Public Health Association","","000077 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to strengthen Egypt's public sector agricultural institutions.  Evaluation covers the period 1977-1/81 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with USAID/E and project personnel. Although the project has suffered from a seriously delayed and sometimes confused implementation, it now has the potential to make useful contributions to Egyptian agriculture, especially in the areas of horticulture and agricultural economics research. Early implementation problems resulted from delayed contract negotiation, and the choice of an inexperienced institution - the University of California at Davis (UC) - to undertake an unrealistically broad project, and strained relations between UC and USAID/E personnel. However, a major reorganization in mid-1980 has resulted in substantial progress. Collaborative research, involving Ministry of Agriculture personnel and Eygptian academic scientists, has been conducted in horticulture (12 studies), economics (15), and other areas (4); a study on Agricultural Statistics and Policy became the basis of a new A.I.D. project. Progress has been made toward establishing a central horticultural laboratory. In contrast, due to an inadequate feasibility study and disagreement over personnel needs, the project never initiated any of its planned extension activities.  Nor has it defined an institution building strategy.  Training has been minimal; long-term U.S. training was provided to 2 scientists and short study trips to 12, and a few in-country workshops were held. Project experience shows that broad programs with many purposes and activities are difficult to squeeze into a project format.  Key recommendations are to:  (1) revise the project paper to more realistically define objectives and strategies and then extend the project 2 years; (2) limit extension activities to a horticultural information service; (3) improve communication between UC and USAID/E; (4) define a clear institutional development strategy; (5) appoint separate A.I.D. officers to monitor the horticultural and agricultural economics subprojects; and (6) enlist more scientists from other U.S. institutions and extend the length of both long- and short-term tours. Finally, A.I.D. should take more care in selecting contracting entities and invest more effort in the substantive implementation of projects.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural development|Development strategies|Agricultural economics|Economic research|Agricultural policy|Agricultural planning|Horticulture|Project change","Egypt","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAL420.pdf","2,813 KB","008539 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to upgrade the national system of rural development planning in Bolivia.  Special evaluation covers the period 8/78-11/81 and is based on site visits and interviews with USAID/B and Bolivian officials and project consultants. Contractor activities focused one-sidedly in the last 2 years on developing five project planning and identification methodologies - urban functions in rural development (Potosi), the most successful of the five; statistical profiles (Oruro); lines of intervention (Chuquisaca); sector analysis (Tarija); and ex post facto evaluation (La Paz).  As a result, only a few Department Development Corporations (DDC's) were helped in preparing annual operating plans, and work with the Ministry of Planning and Coordination (MPC) to develop planning system guidelines never got underway.  Shortfalls were due to the contractor's internal disagreement on the focus of project activities and its lack of integration with DDC staffs, the latter's misconception that the methodologies were to be combined, and - in reference to the MPC - to the 6/80 suspension of U.S.-Bolivian relations and the fact that there were 4 governments and 5 MPC heads during the evaluation period.  A victim of the MPC's low commitment to the project was the Public Administration Institute's proposed public planning/management training program for the MPC and the DDC's.  On the positive side, a project management methodology (the SMP) using the contractor's Marco Logico approach was introduced to the DDC's, significantly increasing their planning capacities and providing a common development language for MPC-DDC cooperation. To redirect the project towards its original objectives, it is recommended that:  the project's entire focus be operational; the MPC become the main implementor and define planning guidelines for the DDC's; the five methodologies be summarized in a manual and given to the DDC's along with follow-up technical assistance as needed; the SMP be fully institutionalized in the DDC's; and, for the next 6 months, only short-term technical assistance be provided to the DDC's.  Also, contractor scopes of work should be approved by the respective DDC's and the MPC should develop a capcity to service DDC's by training its own and DDC staff members in the use of the SMP.","Attached to PD-AAJ-458","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","11/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Development project planning|Institution building|Methodology development|Rural development|Decentralization","Bolivia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAJ458A.pdf","713 KB","000114 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to improve, through overseas university-level training, the planning, management, and technical capabilities of key Government of Morocco (GOM) development personnel. Special evaluation covers the period 9/78-1/82 and was performed by USAID/M personnel. As of 1/82, 98 participants had been selected for U.S. training; of these 16 never began training or were discharged before completion of training, due to insufficient English skills or inadequate academic background; two had not yet left Morocco; three had completed their studies and returned to Morocco; and 77 are currently enrolled in U.S. academic programs.  Of the 25 positions reserved for women, only 10 long-term and 6 short-term have been filled due to family and cultural restrictions on women's mobility.  The delay in ongoing training programs caused by poor English capability, inadequate academic backgrounds, and the unexpected addition of Ph.D. students means that few if any new participants can be selected and funded. With only three trainees returned to date, the project's impact, as measured by increased GOM capacity to plan and manage development projects, is difficult to assess.  Moreover, the project's success in meeting GOM training needs cannot be determined since no GOM annual training plans have been developed.  The English-language training provided by four American Language Centers has been acceptable; the main fault is that management responsibility and functions which rest with USAID/M have not been fixed. The project has shown that training takes longer than planned - a delay that must be taken into account - and that host governments must participate in implementation (i.e., in developing training plans) if the project is to be fully successful. It is recommended that:  an indepth evaluation be made in early FY 82; no new long-term participants be brought into training to permit all current participants to complete their studies by 12/83; participants' academic and language training be reviewed and the training canceled where work is unacceptable; and that the university placement procedures be reviewed for cost-effectiveness.","Attached to PD-AAL-555","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","8/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Education for development|Participants|Beneficiary count|Project change","Morocco","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAL555A.pdf","1,841 KB","008579 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to establish at the University of Nairobi in Kenya a Population Studies and Research Institue (PSRI).  Special evaluation covers the period 9/78-6/81 and is based on interviews with PSRI/University of Nairobi students, faculty, and staff. Although many of the recommendations of the 1978 evaluation have not been implemented, the project and the contract with the Population Council (PC) should be extended for 3 years so that key staff may be replaced and trained and so that the PC can continue its valuable contributions to research problem-solving and complete its definitive picture of Kenyan demography. While the recruitment of expatriates and relations with host government ministries have improved, organizational changes are needed to remedy problems related to local and external training and the PSRI research awards program.  Although the PC team should be retained to advise the PSRI and help the Kenyan Government design and analyze the 1983 demographic survey and the 1989 census, a Kenyan Deputy Director should be retained to free PC administrative staff from project management.  The PSRI Governing Board should take a more active role in developing training and research programs; PSRI's relations with the University and the Government should be strengthened; PSRI internal administration should be reorganized so as to be more responsive to the professional staff; and research proposal review procedures should be changed. Steps should be taken to assure Kenyans studying abroad of the PSRI's continued interest and to absorb some of them into the University and/or the PSRI upon their return.  Other recommendations are to:  upgrade the physical plant (an acute need); revise the curriculum so that less attention is given to formal mathematical approaches and more to research methodology, statistical analysis, and data processing; have the PSRI stress sustantive topics such as mortality, population policy, and the interrelationship between population and development as the number of PSRI-based required courses is reduced and courses in the rest of the university are available.","Attached to PD-AAL-596","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/dspe-C-0053","","6/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Demographic research|Population and demography|Research centers|Beneficiary interviews","Kenya","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAL596A.pdf","2,942 KB","000262 - American Public Health Association","","000077 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to improve range and livestock management by herders in Niger. Joint USAID/N-Government of Niger (GON) special evaluation, attached to a PES facesheet (PD-AAL-688), covers the period 9/77-9/81 and is based on site visits and interviews with project staff. Despite the difficulty of securing well-trained and experienced project staff (a difficulty overcome in part by using dedicated and often experienced and linguistically capable young people as Technical Staff Assistants) and the consequent 2-year delay in project start-up, the project is progressing well. Project strategy has shifted from livestock control to livestock development to address herders' crucial need to produce milk and obtain sufficient cash to purchase grain. Most of the mapping and subsidiary studies have been completed; range, livestock, and socioeconomic studies are well underway; and in-country and long-term U.S. training is on schedule. Four targets remain unachieved: testing of improved inputs packages and the formation of ""herder aides"" networks, pilot herder associations, and pilot range management experiments. Highest priority program recommendations are to: achieve the missed outputs; conduct the collaborative field study of livestock production; organize data processing routines; conduct agrostological/vegetation mapping; define cartographic requirements; and implement ""pastoral relays"". The second tier of priority recommendations are to: complete the epidemiological study of herds; extend range research to actual rangelands; reconsider the decisions to omit waterpoint construction and reseeding experiments; and conduct the study of recurrent costs of government livestock interventions. At the project management level, deemed crucial to the project's effectiveness are intensified collaboration among the senior consultants and between the Project Manager and Project Director; consolidation of the voluminous studies and interviews completed or underway; and increased communications between the project and its two sponsors, USAID/N and the GON. Specific technical recommendations are included.","Attached to PD-AAL-688","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Livestock|Animal husbandry|Agricultural development|Systems approach|Range management|Project change","Niger","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAL688A.pdf","1,809 KB","008585 - USAID.

"Evaluates rural sector grant (RSG) to finance Government of Botswana (GOB) projects to improve land use planning, increase agricultural production, and promote off-farm employment. Special evaluation covers the period 10/80-10/81 and is based on document review and interviews with project officials. Good progress is being made, despite delays due to A.I.D.'s late obligation of funds.  Two land use planning projects, four agricultural projects, and a rural industrial development project have been implemented.  With regard to land use, four land board buildings were constructed, commodities were supplied to land board staff, and a detailed water points study was completed in Eastern Botswana.  Under agricultural production, the Arable Lands Development Program (ALDEP) has instituted a credit scheme to test an improved technical package. Other ALDEP activities, including donkey draft, water tank, fencing, and extension schemes, have not progressed as quickly but lessons are being learned from the problems encountered.  Less successful than ALDEP have been agricultural diversification, horticulture, and forestry projects. The rural industry project provided logistic support for a newly created cadre of rural industrial officers. The most serious long-term problem facing the project is a critical shortage of local manpower.  This factor, along with institutional bottlenecks and problems in recruiting technical advisors, has delayed several land use activities, prevented implementation of a wildlife development project, and constrained the ALDEP, horticulture, and forestry projects.  In addition, while the project has strengthened decentralized planning and villager participation, it has not noticeably raised district-level capabilities to implement, monitor, or redesign projects, and only rarely were projects proposed which attempted to use the RSG in fresh or different ways. It is recommended that:  dialogue with district and local officials be expanded to better identify local needs and local constraints; technical assistance budgeted for district officials be doubled; creative projects that capitalize on the RSG's flexibility be developed; and future needs be carefully analyzed to determine if increased funding is needed.","Bibliography: p. 39","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/DSAN-C-0065","","11/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Rural development|Decentralization|Integrated rural development|Technical assistance","Botswana","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAL355.pdf","787 KB","006727 - Development Alternatives, Inc.

"Evaluates project to develop a replicable integrated rural development (IRD) model in Abyei, Sudan.  Special evaluation, focusing on lessons generalizable to other IRD projects, covers the period 7/77-2/81 and summarizes and updates a 2/81 special evaluation (PD-AAH-698). This overambitious and ill-defined project, which largely failed in its effort to use action research to identify appropriate responses to development needs, offers several lessons for IRD management, design, implementation, and strategy.  The failure of the project's management system to function well showed that:  experimental projects require key operational decisions to be made by field staff; OPG's do not provide sufficient contractor accountability for experimental projects; and remotely located projects need extensive USAID field monitoring. Secondly, even project designs with flexible implementation plans must have specified structures and timetables; this project emphasized process at the expense of structure.  The project also failed to reconnoiter the area thoroughly and it was inadequately funded.  When addressing complex socio-technical problems, care must be taken to match financial and human resources to the scope of work.  Project designers must also carefully weigh the timing and sequence of multiple components in IRD projects. Because the project included both research and benefit delivery functions, implementation was more complex than usual.  The key problem is to find an appropriate balance between action and research. Contractors on action research projects must take full responsibility for providing implementation support and must include beneficiaries in the learning process from the outset.  The project was signficantly weakened by its failure to foster participatory learning. The project's development strategy was atypical in that it targeted an area with high political visibility and complex socio-ethnic conflicts, it proposed (unsuccessfully) a local development organization with a degree of autonomy hitherto unknown in Sudan, and it was assigned national priority by the Sudanese Government.  These elements suggest that:  IRD projects should target politically unstable areas on a needs basis only; special status can make a project dependent on continuation of that status; and appropriate local organizations evolve, they are not prescribed.","Bibliography: p. 35-37","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/DSAN-C-0065","","5/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Integrated rural development|Pilot projects|Development project planning|Development project design","Sudan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAL363.pdf","657 KB","006727 - Development Alternatives, Inc.

"Evaluates project to improve shelter delivery for lower-income families in Panama through housing cooperatives (HC).  Final evaluation covers the period 9/78-8/81; no methodology is given. An office in the Ministry of Housing (MIVI) was made responsible for HC development.  Ten MIVI staff were trained in cooperative housing and existing HC's were reviewed.  MIVI was instrumental in establishing a Consultative Committee for HC's (CCHC), which includes MIVI, the National Mortgage Bank (BHN), the Panamanian Foundation for Cooperative Housing (FUNDAVICO), and the Panamanian Federation of Credit Unions (FEDPA), the Panamanian Cooperative Institute, the Ministry of Planning and Economic Policy, and a representative from the cooperative housing movement.  Unfortunately, a change in ministers caused MIVI to lose interest in using HC's to provide housing for the poor. CCHC development and the formation of an HC policy and program have been suspended. FUNDAVICO has tentatively developed a prototype for its proposed pipeline of HC programs in urban and rural areas, for which FUNDAVICO will guaranty the construction financing and BHN provide the long-term mortgage money.  FUNDAVICO could not, however, locate donors to finance either of the two targeted rural projects.  It did guaranty construction of an urban cooperative, but the latter's members were not those of the target group. The plan for FUNDAVICO to undertake a $500,000 capital investment program is still pending.  FUNDAVICO markets educational and technical services to HC's and provides some services gratis to groups organizing HC's. FEDPA's committed $100,000 for 250 home improvement (HI) loans to credit union members; prepared a manual to train its staff and field agents in the HI program; and was able to adapt the existing credit union loan system for use in the HI program.  FEDPA is now able to serve as a channel for other institutional sources of shelter finance.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","AID/otr-G-1583","","8/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Institution building|Low cost housing|Housing cooperatives|Cooperatives|Financing|Housing|Limited data","Panama","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAL726.pdf","178 KB","000393 - Cooperative Housing Foundation (CHF International)","","008589 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to establish an effective primary health care delivery system in Panay, Phillipines, particularly in depressed barangays unreached by conventional health delivery.  Special evaluation covers the period 7/78-6/80 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with barangay, municipal, provincial, and regional-level personnel. Results have been mixed.  Municipal and provincial-level support for Barangay Health Workers (BHW's) and their operations has been weak and participation by the Ministry of Health (MOH) has not been as strong as envisaged.  Coordination of inter-agency activities at the regional, provincial, and municipal levels needs to be strengthened. The degree of participation by barangay residents in implementation has also fallen short.  Most emphasis has been placed on implementing the project's environmental sanitation infrastructure (ESI) component, at the expense of its health, nutrition, and family planning components.  Proper sanitary practices have been promoted by the BHW's in their respective barangays and wells and toilets constructed, with varying degrees of success. The 6-week training course provided to BHW's has focused inordinately on ESI, giving the BHW's little knowledge or skills in the other three areas.  In addition, no retraining has been provided, despite strong demand, and no provincial training centers opened.  Nevertheless, the basic training curriculum for BHW's has been successfully completed and has substantially prepared them to carry out their functions.  BHW trainers also have received orientation training in curriculum use and in training strategies.  BHW accomplishments in conducting family planning and medical care activities have been minimal, although child weighing, communicable disease control, vital statistics, recordkeeping, and community mobilization activities have, for the most part, been successfully carried out. Major recommendations are to:  implement a BHW retraining course; work to increase understanding of project concepts and goals by provincial and municipal-level implementers; explore mechanisms to facilitate payment of BHW salaries and delivery of ESI commodities; and take steps to increase participation by barangay residents and MOH personnel in project operations.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Community health workers|Community health care|Primary health care|Sanitation","Philippines","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAL761.pdf","1,133 KB","008558 - USAID.

"Evaluates Catholic Relief Services (CRS) project to rehabilitate social service institutions damaged in the Lebanese civil war. Special evaluation covers the period 8/79-10/81 and was prepared by CRS/Beirut, USAID/L, and Lebanon's Council for Development and Reconstruction (CDR) on the basis of beneficiary questionnaires. To date, LBP 16.5 million has been allocated for 20 mostly large and operational sub-projects chosen out of 86 candidates by the CRS/CDR Selection Committee; of this amount, LBP 15.6 million has been committed to 19 institutions and LL 9.9 million disbursed to 14. Overall, funds were allocated equitably among Lebanon's religious and ethnic groups on the basis of their proportion of the total population, although need remained the supreme criterion.  Allocation was higher than numerical representation in the case of Roman and Greek Catholics, but these groups are minorities who tend to serve majority sects, a fact which also helps explain why individual beneficiaries at the 15 institutions sampled were 65.4% non-Christian. Allocation was also equitable geographically, although the Beka'a Valley may have been neglected.  The evaluators did not raise the question of political balance among beneficiaries. Allocation of funds to 17% of the LBP 90 million in requests generated by the nationwide publicizing of the project seems to reveal identifiable progress in restoring private institutional services, but this inference is weakened by the lack of accurate data on damage, the damage caused by ongoing strife, and the high recurrent costs of institutions which have large debts to service.  The list of institutions, the accuracy of which was an important project assumption, proved inaccurate. CRS has mobilized LBP 11.8 million (U.S. $2.9 million) in non-AID funds for the 12 subprojects already completed (a figure expected to increase to LBP 22.2 million for the project as a whole) and has provided other important inputs such as bringing similar institutions together. Security and the depreciation of the U.S. dollar have been the main factors impeding the project. Most funds (61%) have been allocated for schools, but little has been done in the areas of mental health and physical rehabilitation. The Selection Committe should discuss the issue, untouched in the grant criteria, of allocation by sector.","Attached to PD-AAL-805|Evaluation period: Aug 1979-Oct 1981","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/ne-G-1651","","12/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Disaster relief|Social services|Beneficiary interviews|Limited data","Lebanon","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAL805A.pdf","874 KB","007337 - Catholic Relief Services (CRS)|000494 - Lebanon.

"Evaluates project to help Coordination in Development, Inc. (CODEL) promote collaboration among its member agencies and support development projects worldwide.  Special evaluation covers the period 1978-81 and is based on document review, discussions with A.I.D. and CODEL headquarter personnel, and visits to project sites. CODEL has made notable preliminary advances in promoting collaboration across national and religious lines among member and colleague agencies while at the same time directly providing information and technical assistance in development activities. Projects provide the disadvantaged with previously unavailable health and medical services and agricultural inputs, as well as vocational and other skills. Despite some outstanding bright spots, however, most of CODEL's 136 current projects do not seem to live up to CODEL's own development criteria. Particular problems include inadequate stress on self-reliant development (there is some evidence of overstress on social welfare projects) and inadequate learning from project experience in dialogue with other organizations (for the latter, additional staff would be required).  Further, CODEL does not provide project-holders with adequate assistance in project planning, selection, monitoring, and evaluation.  Reasons for this include a lack of basic planning and evaluation requirements, the fact that CODEL area coordinators are overworked (the implementing agencies visited complained that not enough time was spent with them), and an insufficiently critical project review process. CODEL spends the greater part of its budget in direct support of overseas projects, for the most part partially funding projects in collaboration with other donors.  It often happens, however, that other donors pass clients along to CODEL without regard to CODEL's own criteria.  CODEL-A.I.D. relationships are generally positive, although CODEL at times feels constrained by Mission attitudes. To help CODEL achieve the high goals it has set for itself and towards which it has made commendable progress, 21 recommendations are made regarding CODEL goals and corresponding activities, internal and program financial management, data collection needs, collaboration, project planning, evaluation of impact, and relationships with A.I.D.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-0100-S-00-1038-00","","10/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Private voluntary organizations|Institution building|Development project design|Development project implementation","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAM175.pdf","7,775 KB","","","000088 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to strengthen the capability of the Overseas Education Fund (OEF) to design and implement projects to increase women's participation in social, economic, and political life.  Special evaluation covers the period 3/79-8/81 and is based on interviews, document review, and site visits to two OEF-assisted local projects. Virtually every person involved directly or indirectly with both projects is a woman.  The projects, both of which are implemented by local organizations with OEF's technical and financial assistance, have succeeded in enabling women to design, implement, and adminster projects, giving them the chance to develop their abilities and to increase their credibility within political power structures.  The first project provides job skills, on-the-job, and English-language training to increase the employability of low-income, female, liberal arts graduates in Sri Lanka.  OEF has provided the local implementor, the Sri Lanka Federation of University Women, with critical planning assistance. A total of 186 women have been trained.  The project's overly ambitious targets will not be met, but its general objectives are being fulfilled and the project is now serving as a model for a program being implemented by the Sri Lanka Ministry of Youth Affairs and Employment. The second project, a regional effort to provide legal services for women in Central America, is being implemented in Honduras, Costa Rica, and Nicaragua.  The Honduras project has provided land titles to 150 women and unionized nurses.  The Nicaragua and Costa Rica projects have educated hundreds of women on their rights in such areas as child custody, adoption, and alimony; outputs have been limited in Costa Rica, due to conflict among the three implementing organizations, but the potential for success is present. The OEF approach, which encourages local ""ownership"" of projects, has worked superbly in Sri Lanka, less well in Costa Rica.  Closer study should be given to the selection of local implementors.  Both projects have had problems receiving funding advances, perhaps because funding for ""women's projects"" is generally inadequate, and both have suffered from inadequate facilities.  A lack of cohesiveness in the OEF/Washington staff and with field projects may be the result of recent staff reductions.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","9/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Education|Women|Associations|Legal systems|Consumer education|Employment|Private voluntary organizations","Sri Lanka|Costa Rica|Honduras|Nicaragua","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAM183.pdf","4,138 KB","","","","English","application/pdf","Indepth evaluation|Onsite evaluation","","Rose-Avila, Carolyn A.","","30 Sep 1981","","","","Field evaluation of the Overseas Education Fund","","PD-AAM-183","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTY3MTU4","","9380145"
"Evaluates project to strengthen the nonformal education (NFE) activities of the Lesotho Distance Teaching Centre (LDTC). Special evaluation covers the period 10/80-9/81 and is based on document review and interviews with key LDTC and Ministry of Education officials and with LDTC clients. Excellent progress has been made in some areas.  Procurement of materials and equipment, and construction of a new LDTC office wing have been performed efficiently; these inputs are being fully utilized. Three short-term consultancies. providing training and technical assistance (TA), were well received, and three senior LDTC staff members received long-term training (two have returned).  However, much remains to be done, as LDTC continues to be plagued by problems (e.g., insufficient staff, inadequate financial management, low staff efficiency, poor organization) which limit its capacity to provide varied NFE services. Problems have occurred with long-term TA, and it is recommended that the position of project advisor/service agency consultant be continued and that an NFE evaluation specialist and an instructional materials developer/trainer be provided.  In addition, LDTC needs to better utilize short-term TA in management systems, financial controls and accounting, production and graphics, literacy and numeracy program development, and radio education.  Training needs to be improved so as to emphasize:  suitability for LDTC needs, availability of positions for trained personnel, backstopping of personnel being trained, and a governmental commitment to retain personnel in their positions. The Assistance Fund program has proceeded slowly and carefully and, although it is conceptually sound, some issues require field study.  A mechanism for project selection is now in place and several groups have been chosen to be candidates for assistance during an experimental phase; a staff training program has been planned.  It is recommended that the first tranche of funding be made available immediately, further funds be provided quarterly, alternative funding approaches be considered, and progress and staff work loads be carefully monitored. Finally, a follow-up study should be done in 6 months to review overall progress.","Attached to PD-AAM-188","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","11/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Nonformal education|Institution building|Educational centers|Technical assistance|Beneficiary interviews","Lesotho","","","000070 - USAID.

"Evaluates P.L. 480 Title II food distribution program in Panama. Special evaluation covers the period 1-12/81 and is based on review of the literature and project documents, site visits, field collection of weight/height data, and interviews with feeding site personnel, adult beneficiaries, health experts, and officials of the Ministries of Health (MOH) and Education (MOE), CARE, CARITAS, and USAID/P. The program on the whole has been a success.  CARE distributes food at 209 MOH maternal/child health (MCH) facilities and at 2,211 schools and 210 day care centers and preschool feeding sites.  Distribution levels are rising in the MCH program and phased-in MOE support for the school feeding program began in FY 1981.  CARITAS distibutes food in homes for the aged and minors and through Indian service programs. Both PVO's (which received Title II shipments in FY 1981 above the authorized levels of 3,242,800 lbs. and 103 MT, respectively), try to monitor operations closely, but recordkeeping and storage facilities at some local distribution centers are inadequate. Distribution was reduced in some cases because food had arrived damaged or contaminated.  Transportation shortages hampered distribution to MOH sites, causing program interruptions of 1-9 weeks; food transport was otherwise adequate.  Also at MOH sites, nutrition education was minimal, food was provided to normal weight as well as malnourished recipients, and family sharing of food was not uncommon.  Many school feeding centers had five times as many beneficiaries as authorized and were forced to reduce rations.  At preschool and day care sites, community participation was increasing, but the nutritional knowledge of some personnel was deficient.  CARITAS's residential and Indian feeding sites successfully combined food aid with self-help activities. Most distribution center personnel felt that the food aid had improved beneficiaries' health, but as growth monitoring was incomplete and/or nonexistent, it is difficult to assess actual nutritional impacts. Recommendations are made regarding food transport and packaging, monitoring and reporting, nutritional education, impact assessment, fostering food production and development activities, and targetting food to those most in need.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","12/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Food for Peace|Food aid programs|Child feeding programs|Maternal child health care|Beneficiary interviews","Panama","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAM263.pdf","31,886 KB","000436 - Development Associates, Inc.","","000086 - USAID.

"Evaluates the socioeconomic impact of the Bone-Bone Irrigation subproject in Indonesia, part of the Luwu Area Development and Transmigration project.  Special evaluation covers the period 1980-81 and is based on comparisons of pre- and postproject conditions of irrigated and unirrigated areas. of irrigated and unirrigated areas. The Bone-Bone irrigation system has significantly increased rice production, land productivity, farm and household income, employment, level of consumption, and marketable rice surpluses.  Rice yield has increased by 121%-212% due to double cropping, and net farm income in irrigated areas is almost twice that of unirrigated areas.  In some irrigated areas, household income has increased even faster than net farm income.  Total costs have tended to rise faster than gross farm income due to higher applications of chemicals, more use of animal labor, more hired labor, and higher land taxes.  There is a substantial difference in income distribution before and after irrigation, with 54% of farmers having achieved higher income status.  Labor utilization has also increased significantly (37-42%), although the increase is not proportional to the crop yield, due to increased animal labor. Marketable surpluses have increased by 32%-100%. On the other hand, irrigation did not significantly increase labor or capital productivity or farm size distribution (although, apropos to the latter, future farm consolidation is likely). It is recommended to:  (1) extend the irrigation system to Sidomukti; (2) establish a uniform planting time for rice varieties with different maturation dates; (3) adopt mechanization or increase use of draft animals to overcome labor shortages during land preparation; (4) form a water user organization for effective water management during fluctuations in supply; and (5) provide facilities for reducing postharvest losses and providing postharvest training.","Indonesian ed.: PN-AAM-197","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","3/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Irrigated land|Irrigation|Rice|Farm income|Labor productivity|Crop yield|Cropping patterns|Sampling method","Indonesia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAM196.pdf","2,018 KB","002582 - Hasanuddin University","","008558 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to improve the Caribbean Development Bank's (CDB) ability to provide technical assistance (TA) to member nations. This special evaluation, attached to PES (PD-AAG-336-B1), covers the period 4/1/78-8/31/80 and is based on interviews with CDB staff and document reviews. The Technical Assistance Fund (TAF) was created primarily to aid the less developed Caribbean nations (e.g., Antigua and Belize) by providing advisory and managerial services in development, project preparation, and implementation.  TAF also funds upgrading and expansion of CDB's staff.  TAF has had a slow start; as of 9/31/80, only $687,000 was approved for TAF projects, and only $247,000 had actually been disbursed, out of contributions totalling $3.5 million. The highly centralized procedural and administrative system for funding approval is a primary cause of the delay.  Another is the relative lack of effort to market the resources available through TAF, whose potential has barely been tapped.  TAF has, however, succeeded in allocating 70% of the approved funds to the poorer nations and has achieved a broad sectoral mix among the approved projects, most of which have been quite small. Assistance has been provided in agriculture, industry, infrastructure, finance, and transportation/communication.  Funding constraints have not limited TAF's use to date but could become a serious problem as demand continues to grow. CDB should take a more active role in marketing TAF, especially in the poorer nations.  The funds approval process should be formalized and streamlined and a sound data base should be developed to improve reporting. Equally important is the need to decentralize management in terms of both responsibility and accountability. A TA unit, with technical, marketing, and administrative roles, should be established to coordinate all of CDB's TA activities.  Other recommendations are to carry out a comprehensive revision of administrative practices.  The process for selecting consultants should be shortened and simplified; and a system established to spot potential implementation constraints and recommend alternative action.","Evaluation period: 1 Apr 1978-31 Aug 1980","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Financial resources|Economic planning|Fiscal policy|Financial institutions|Financial management|Credit|Management training|Banks|Development project design|Development project implementation|Development project evaluation|Institution building|Technical assistance|Development strategies|Management operations","Eastern Caribbean","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAG336C1.pdf","2,070 KB","002263 - Touche Ross and Co.","","","English","application/pdf","Indepth evaluation|Onsite evaluation","","","","20 Jan 1981","","","","FIRST EVALUATION OF TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FUND","","PD-AAG-336-C1","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc3MTY1","Caribbean Regional","5380016"
"Evaluates project to uprade the planning and management capabilities of Liberia's Ministry of Agriculture (MOA).  Evaluation covers the period 1/72-12/76 and is based on document reviews and interviews with key informants. The project failed to have a substantial impact on the MOA's planning capability, primarily due to the unfavorable political and organizational climate in the MOA.  The project design, though generally well-conceived, overestimated Liberian resources, thus overloading the outputs and cutting the project's time frame too short.  A planning unit was established, but was influenced by outside events to switch from a sectoral to a project planning approach.  The planning unit is too weak and theoretical to have much effect on the direction of national planning. Because each project is implemented by a semi-autonomous agency and is planned without regard to sector needs, the project failure rate is very high.  This approach is basically opposed to the coordinated effort which is necessary if food production on subsistence farms is to increase.  Moreover, the project approach is protected by vested interests and any attempts to reorganize are met with strong resistance.  The MOA was unable to take necessary research and extension actions because it lacked clear policy definitions. Training was the one aspect of the project which made a positive impact.  A total of 32 MOA personnel were trained at the professional and technical levels.  Unfortunately, almost all the trainees subsequently left the MOA due to underutilization of their skills.  A competent statistical bureau was created within MOA, but its contributions have been ignored by the Minister.  The soils technicians at the central agricultural experimental station were ordered to do studies of their supervisors' private farms rather than conduct a nation-wide soil survey. The marketing component was a failure due to the incompetency of the staff assigned, while the technology transfer function never developed at all.  It is clear that this project, like several others in Liberia, suffered from U.S. unwillingness to allow adequate time for development.","Evaluation period: 1 Jan1972-31 Dec1976","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","3/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Government departments|Agricultural management|Geological surveys|Agriculture|Sector evaluation|Agricultural policy|Agricultural planning|Professionals|Institution building|Agricultural product marketing|Technology transfer|Statistical data|Management training|Indigenous education|Participants|Development project design|Development project implementation|Development project evaluation|Agricultural research|Agricultural extension|Food production","Liberia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAG344A1.pdf","682 KB","008570 - USAID.

"Evaluates multi-donor project to pave Botzam road (300 km from Nata to Kazungula) in Botswana.  This special contracted evaluation (which is attached to a PES facesheet, PD-AAG-340-B1) covers the period 8/77-10/80 and is based on an onsite review.  A.I.D. provided financing for engineering and construction supervison services, the contract for which was awarded to Tippetts-Abbett-McCarthy-Stratton (TAMS). The project is now two and one-half years behind schedule. The major cause of delay was the dilatory and confused tactics of the EEC (European Economic Community) in reviewing and approving the engineering design.  As a result of the delays, engineering costs have risen from $1,497,571 to an estimated $2,360,000, and paving costs rose from an estimated $13,000,000 to a low bid price of $23,048,177. However, the Government of Botswana (GOB), A.I.D., and TAMS are not entirely blameless -- none recognized the inevitable pitfalls which would result from the failure to clearly delineate the authority and responsibilities of each donor.  Furthermore, unrealistic time schedules and budgeting were imposed. The GOB Road Department performed as well as could be expected, considering its small size. The Department should not have been burdened with the task of collecting comments from the donors, reconciling differences, and issuing instructions to TAMS. A.I.D.'s decision to finance the engineering services contract for a project whose construction would be totally financed by the EEC was unfortunate.  Co-financing by A.I.D. should be limited to those circumstances in which:  (1) A.I.D. can provide expertise, materials, or equipment not readily available from other donors; (2) A.I.D. financing is large enough to permit it to influence the direction of the project; and (3) there is some technical, financial, or management advantage to the host country from U.S. participation. The evaluators stress the importance of reaching a prior understanding (in writing) with regard to the financing responsiblities of each donor.  The host country should take a more active role in the negotiating process.","Evaluation period: 1 Aug 1977-31 Oct 1980","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID-80-15","","2/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Roads|Road construction|Transportation system design|Project change","Botswana","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAG340C1.pdf","2,435 KB","","","","English","application/pdf","Indepth evaluation|Onsite evaluation","","LUBIN, SAMUEL","","1 Feb 1981","","","","EVALUATION OF THE BOTZAM ROAD PAVING PROJECT","","PD-AAG-340-C1","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc3MTkw","Botswana","6330072"
"Evaluates project to provide primary health care in rural Ecuador. This special evaluation, attached to a PES (PD-AAG-332-A1), covers the period 10/79-2/80 and is based on an onsite review. Medical Assistance Programs, Inc. (MAP) and Vozandes Hospital are managing the project, which is operating in four provinces -- Bolivar, Chimborazo, Pastaza, and Morona Santiago. Activities in Loja province were cancelled because of a lack of personnel to train health promoters. The MAP staff participated in health worker training and program design.  The Vozandes staff were responsible for training placement, supply, and supervision.  The project's focus was altered from providing personal health services to community health education. Several new health committees were formed, and promoter training programs were instituted in all provinces. While statistics do not show a dramatic change, the target communities are better informed and more interested in sanitation and health care for their children. The following recommendations are made:  (1) Progress reports should focus on problems, experiences, and system needs and changes. (2) Selection of health workers and the relationship between project personnel and the communities should be studied.  (3) Project personnel should try to understand local beliefs and, when beneficial, incorporate them into training.  (4) When it became apparent that local promoters needed more training, project personnel adopted more flexible procedures.  Because that proved expensive, project personnel should carefully document their experiences.  In addition, the assistance of Ecuadorean personnel should be sought.  (6) Project personnel should try to determine the amount of time health promoters devote to their various duties--and if that time is adequate.  (7) Because transportation is difficult (some communities are accessible only by small plane), different patterns of supervision should be tested.  (8) Workshops should be held to bring together provincial and national-level health officials.  (9) MOH personnel should observe the project.  (10) A.I.D. funding should be continued.","Evaluation period: 1 Oct 1979-28 Feb 1980","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","3/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Community development|Community participation|Health research|Data collection|Health delivery|Health education|Health outreach services|Medical education|Paramedical education|Change agents|Rural development|Health care|Sanitation|Water supply|Private voluntary organizations|Beneficiary count|Project change","Ecuador","","","000262 - American Public Health Association","","","English","","Indepth evaluation","","MARNAME, PATRICK H.","","1 Mar 1981","","","","EVALUATION REPORT - OPG-518-022 RURAL COMMUNITY HEALTH PROJECT","","PD-AAG-332-B1","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc3MjA5","Ecuador","5180002"
"Evaluates project implemented by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to test and demonstrate photovoltaic (PV) power systems for meeting the energy requirements of basic rural health systems in Africa and Central America. This special AID/W evaluation, attached to a PES facesheet (PD-AAG-354-B1), covers the period 7/79-12/80; no methodology is specified. Overall project design and usefulness are adequate and the organizational structure involving A.I.D.'s Office of Energy (DS/EY), NASA, and the Department of Energy is compatible and has led to sound project management.  It is suggested, however, that direct management of individual subprojects be under the A.I.D. officer responsible for the development program in which the PV technology will be used. Country agreements for subprojects were developed for Kenya, Guyana, Ecuador, and Zimbabwe, and signed by Kenya and Guyana.  PV and related equipment and the training of host country personnel are provided by contractors. Other program activities underway include cataloging medical equipment for PV-powered rural clinics; surveying health delivery organizations to determine equipment and electrical power needs and costs; and reviewing educational and communications programs in LDC's to assess their adaptability to PV power.  PV-powered refrigerators for storing medicines and vaccines in rural clinics are also being studied to determine which best meets performance specifications (as defined by the World Health Organization). It is recommended that the project be continued with emphasis on the communication needs of rural health programs; PV power be applied to communication and education programs; subprojects be implemented in regions other than Africa and Central America; project implementation be on a 2-year basis subject to annual funding authorization; PV technology be increased in rural areas; specific PV technologies be field-tested to determine their cost-effectiveness; and energy alternatives be compared according to their total cost over the life of the technology.

"Evaluates project to extend non-formal education (NFE) activities to Guatemala's remote Western Highlands communities. This final report's time frame and methodology are not specified.  The project, implemented by the Academy for Educational Development (AED), supports the Government of Guatemala's (GOG's) Basic Rural Education (BRE) Program. After a description of the aims, administration, and educational methodology of the BRE Program, AED's achievements of its contractual responsibilities are noted.  In the area of planning and programming, a baseline survey of rural needs and existing NFE services was conducted, and a BRE Draft Implementation Plan was prepared.  A feedback/programming system is also being developed.  A Technical Advisory Council was formed and plans drawn up to train field personnel in NFE systems.  In addition, strategies were developed by which institutional linkages (e.g., with UNESCO and UNICEF) can be established. Accomplishments under the instructional materials production component include training zonal coordinators in using audiovisual (AV) aids for NFE; conducting two workshops on the NFE learning process; and developing AV aids for use by field staff in such areas as pest control and health. In the area of applied communications, two manuals were produced and training was administered in communication methods and radio production techniques. NFE radio messages were broadcast over two stations. AED advised BRE staff in basic management techniques. They also prepared management reference materials such as maps to identify field personnel and activity locations and short technical notes on supervision and problem solving.  BRE staff received on-the-job training in community-level planning and evaluation.  As a result, community planning shifted from individual activities to small, integrated projects implemented by communities.  AED also helped BRE staff to train paraprofessional community volunteers to lead village NFE programs. Appendices include a list of administrative personnel and a bibliography (XD-AAH-579-1).","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","AID/LA-C-1118","","4/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Institution building|Management training|On the job training|Audiovisual educational materials|Radio|Community participation|Community leadership|Rural areas|Educational materials|Communities|Nonformal education|Education|Change agents|Training|Evaluation|Educational delivery|Regional development|Educational planning|Local level|Educational research|Educational methods","Guatemala","","","000223 - Academy for Educational Development, Inc.

"Evaluates project to strengthen the capacity of the Botswana Agricultural College (BAC) to train personnel for agricultural service in rural Botswana. This special evaluation, attached to a PES (PD-AAI-400-A1), covers the period 4/1/79-4/30/81 and is based on a review of project documents and interviews with project personnel. Overall project progress has been significant.  BAC facilities construction is 1 year behind schedule, due to heavy rains and problems in hiring an architect. However, the delay has not harmed the project, as priority buildings are finished or nearly so. Construction cost overruns were covered by USAID; the Government of Botswana (GOB) will cover additional overruns.  The overruns were due to inflation, devaluation of the dollar, and construction delays. Moreover, USAID's poor management of the construction program resulted in project confusion. Curriculum development has progressed, especially in Agriculture courses and courses common to Agriculture and Animal Health students. The contractor, South Dakota State University (SDSU), also has amassed significant amounts of texts and other teaching materials.  However, a lack of educational psychology courses was noted, along with a general need for more work in this area. BAC staff training is proceeding apace.  All U.S. degree training candidates have been identified -- 10 of which are studying successfully at SDSU.  Despite the benefits of having all training at SDSU, some trainees should study at other institutions. Most likely only one of the four potential veterinary students will receive training, causing BAC's continued reliance upon expatriate personnel. There are several BAC administrative areas needing attention: current and potential staffing shortfalls; poor communications within the BAC and with GOB; an uneven distribution of the teaching load; a need for frequent and more qualitative methods of evaluating students and staff; and a fluctuating commitment (apparently according to dormitory space) to women's admissions. Other recommendations include adding Agricultural Education and Home Economics courses to the BAC curriculum.","Attached to PD-AAI-400|Evaluation period: 1 Apr 1979-30 Apr 1981","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","6/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Curriculum|Agricultural education|Universities and colleges|Agricultural management|Agricultural training|Curriculum design|Agricultural schools|Agricultural technicians|Teacher training|ANIMAL HEALTH|Higher education|Veterinary medicine|Institution building|Personnel development|Participants|Indigenization|Educational occupations|Educational development|Educational facilities|Building construction|Beneficiary count","Botswana","","","008516 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to provide basic health services in rural Pakistan. This final evaluation, attached to a PES (PD-AAI-218-A1), covers the period 4/77-2/81 and is based on discussions with project personnel, site visits, and document review. A medical technician training program was developed, and schools were constructed in all provinces.  More than 200 persons have completed training.  The University of Hawaii provided technical assistance. Production of a set of six training manuals was one of the project's most notable achievements.  Over 400 basic health units and 225 rural health centers were constructed.  Six integrated rural health complexes were constructed, but are not operational.  Although community health workers were to have been the foundation of the project, only a few have actually been trained.  Other shortfalls included the failure to provide management training for project personnel, to prepare field operation manuals, and to institute operational research and communications support programs.  Soon after the project began, the Bhutto government was replaced and the project was delayed by the need to orient new officials to the project.  Much of the delay could have been circumvented by having given a greater role to provincial officials. Also, the scope of the project was reduced in 1977 when Section 669 of the Foreign Assistance Act was invoked. Project taught the need for overall cooperation and for having modest expectations; modifying basic health services plans to local economic, social, and cultural conditions; and improving communication among provincial health departments. It is recommended that a follow-on project (employing expatriate advisors) be implemented, emphasizing completion of the integrated rural health complexes and deployment of community health workers.  Although training female medical technicians would be desirable, this should not be mandatory.  Other recommendations include holding workshops for staff members from the various provinces and making available short-term, third-country training for Pakistani project personnel.","Evaluation period: 1 Apr 1977-28 Feb 1931","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","2/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Clinics|Building construction|Medical education|Curriculum|Health delivery|Health education|Educational materials|Paramedical education|Rural areas|Health care|Health outreach services|Health facilities|Health care administration|Management training|Community health workers|Beneficiary count","Pakistan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAI218C1.pdf","1,346 KB","008588 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to establish a medical educational facility at the Mahatma Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (MGIMS) in Sevagrum, India with the capacity to deliver health services to the surrounding villages.  This final evaluation covers the period 1/71-12/77. No methodology is specified. Funds were provided to the Kasturba Health Society (KHS) to finance the construction of eight major buildings and several minor buildings and related facilities, medical college and hospital equipment and furniture, and architectural and engineering services. Construction was begun in early 1971, but was delayed due to acute shortages of steel and cement; changes in the requirements of certain buildings and subsequent design modifications; slow progress by contractors and poor construction supervision; and initial poor architectural services and supervision. Despite these delays and cost-overruns (which were met by KHS), the project was successfully completed.  A medical college,  500-bed hospital, staff quarters, and hostels, and other related buildings were completed and are functioning satisfactorily.  MGIMS is admitting 60 students for the medical graduate course and about 19 students for the medical postgraduate course each year. Twenty nurses, technicians, community health workers, auxiliary nurses and midwives are also being trained annually. Standards of this medical training program are comparable with any other medical school in India.  Most of the hospital equipment has been procured and commissioned.  Occupancy of the hospital beds is 90 percent, and some 300 patients visit the out-patient department daily, while 1,000 patients use the in-patient facilities each month.  The medical college is being utilized as a health delivery base, economically meeting the medical education and health needs of the rural communities surrounding the campus.  Recurring expenditures for operating the hospital and medical college are shared by the Governments of India and Maharashtra and KHS.","Evaluation period: 1 Jan1971-31 Dec1977","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","4/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Nurse midwives|Paramedical education|Clinics|Building construction|Health delivery|Health education|Health facilities|Health outreach services|Building renovation|Health professional education|Medical education|Medical schools|Hospitals|Hospital equipment|Community health workers|Graduate education|Nursing education|Beneficiary count|Limited data","India","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAI216A1.pdf","209 KB","000040 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to reduce the incidence of malaria in Pakistan to 0.05% of the population.  This external, terminal evaluation, conducted by a joint Government of Pakistan (GOP)/World Health Organization/A.I.D. team, is based on site visits and indepth review of various project aspects; evaluation covers the period 10/76-12/80.  Because this evaluation details information provided in the attached PES (PD-AAH-613-A1), only the team's recommendations are presented here. Due to the fragile nature of the project's success, the evaluation team recommends, in general, continuation of the surveillance and insecticidal spraying activities that have significantly reduced malaria incidence.  To this end, GOP funding of the proposed New Extension Plan of the Malaria Control Program (MCP) for 1980-83 is recommended.  Its main objectives will be to maintain or reduce the incidence of malaria and to complete the integration of the MCP with the Basic Health Service (BHS) project.  Seventeen specific recommendations are made for the continued success of the MCP.  Some of these include the following:  The Ministers of Health, Education, and Public Information should work closely to propagate health education material through public schools and mass and printed media. Plans should be made for entomological monitoring and malaria case detection as well as for the training of municipal squad leaders in geographic reconnaisance, larviciding, adulticiding, equipment maintenance, and pesticide safety measures.  The Annual Parasite Incidence statistic should be used instead of the Slide Positivity Rate (SPR) to assess malaria endemicity; and improved methods of data analysis should be designed for implementation at the district level in order to provide SPR data on males and females separately and by age group. Other recommendations pertain to integration of MCP into BHS; coordination among Ministries of plans for improved sanitation and elimination of mosquito breeding sites; and expert staff composition and training considerations.","Evaluation period: 1 Oct 1976-31 Dec 1980","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","MALARIA|Disease detection|Technical training|Training centers|Disease research|Epidemiology|Parasitic diseases|Blood|Immunizations|Disease prevention and control|Insects|Biology research|Pesticide application|Insecticides|Pesticide resistance","Pakistan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAI301A1.pdf","1,462 KB","008588 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to assess nutrition levels in Panama, particularly among children and pregnant and lactating women. Evaluation covers the period 1/80-12/80 and consists of an annual report by the contractor. Statistical data over the past 15 years indicate that Panama, nutritionally speaking, is relatively well off.  The daily per capita consumption of calories is estimated to be in excess of 2,500 calories. It is important to note, however, that this figure reflects national averages and that some portions of the population receive significantly less.  A national nutrition survey is being carried out by the Government of Panama (GOP) to obtain more accurate data.  The project staff has devoted considerable time to the survey.  This report discusses a variety of measures commonly used to evaluate nutritional status, including direct measurements such as anthropometry, clinical signs, and biochemical tests and indirect measurements such as food intake or disappearance, food balance sheets, and vital statistics. Anthropometry is considered the most useful.  The ""expected height for age"" method of classification (which presumes that socioeconomic and environmental factors have greater impact on an individual's height than genetic factors) is discussed in detail. Quasi-experimental models, with particular attention to the cohort method of analysis (comparative analysis of different characteristics of program participants at various stages of the program), are also discussed.  Among the economic models presented is the consumer-household production model, which explains the lack of nutritional impact of government feeding programs by analyzing the effect on child nutrition of the allocative abilities of household members, especially mothers and their allocation of household time. Preliminary findings correlating health care, breastfeeding, and education and housing conditions to child nutrition are also presented. The following year will be devoted to analyzing the survey data and testing the various models. A bibliography (XD-AAK-006-1) is included.","Evaluation period: 1 JAN 1980-30 JAN 1981|Bibcode changed from 32 to 22, 2008-05-19","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Nutritional analysis|Nutrition research|Research design|Nutrition surveillance|Health surveys|Survey methodology|Nutritional status|Technical assistance","Panama","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAK006A1.pdf","5,028 KB","001036 - Research Triangle Institute (RTI)","","","English","application/pdf","Sector level evaluation|Indepth evaluation","","WADMAN, WILLIAM M.|FRAZAO, BETSY|et al.","","16 Jan 1981","","AID/DSAN-C-0202","","ANNUAL REPORT OF THE NUTRITION EVALUATION PROJECT FOR PANAMA","","PD-AAK-006-A1","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc3NDkz","Technical Assistance","931127614"
"Evaluates project to strengthen rural health delivery in Egypt.  This special evaluation attached to a PES facesheet (PD-AAC-020-A1) covers the period 9/76-2/81. In the project's first 34 months, vehicles were deployed in the targetted 10 districts and commodities were supplied to four districts, one in each of four governorates.  Project personnel worked with district, governorate, and rural health personnel to improve health record systems; revise job descriptions; provide pre-service and in-service training; institute regular home visits; and improve supervision.  Also, the project demonstrated the effectiveness (40%) of oral rehydration in reducing mortality among infants and children with diarrhea.  Nevertheless, the testing of interventions has not progressed as planned and data collected on these interventions are nowhere near analyzable form.  Though funds were saved by reducing technical assistance and project staffing, these reductions will likely result in higher costs and lower quality when the government attempts to expand the program.  Vehicles provided by the project have not been used to the extent expected, and they should no longer be provided. Testing of medical interventions should be reduced; those which have proven successful (oral rehydration and home visits) should be implemented nationwide.  Project data should be processed in the United States on a priority basis.  Project staffing at the central Ministry of Health (MOH) office should be increased, and three long-term advisors should be added to the Westinghouse contract.  The project should be expanded to 10 districts as originally called for in the Project Paper and should be extended for 2 years to complete the testing of interventions, develop an applied research/demonstration capability within the MOH, and develop plans to expand the project nationally.  Other recommendations include emphasizing in-country training, revising project manuals, and giving higher priority to water supply and sanitation (with no financing for actual upgrading of physical facilities).","Duplicate fiche: PD-AAL-831|Evaluation period: 1 Sep 1976-28 Feb 1981","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","2/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Statistical data|Data analysis|Clinics|Health outreach services|Health research|Data collection|Transportation|Health education|Teacher training|Health facilities|Information storage and retrieval systems|Health care planning|Health delivery|Logistics|Operations research|Medical education|Educational materials|Manuals and handbooks|DIARRHEA|Oral rehydration therapy|Home health visits|Project change","Egypt","","","008539 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to support research and information dissemination efforts of the International Fertility Research Program (IFRP). This special contracted evaluation, conducted by a team from the American Public Health Association (APHA), covers the period 9/77-9/80 and is based on document review, a site visit to IFRP, and interviews with IFRP and AID/W staff. IFRP is making progress in dealing with the recommendations made by AID/W at the time the grant was provided, especially with regard to research.  For example, IFRP has reduced the number of clinical centers reporting data, as well as the amount of data reported, and has upgraded both the quality of the data and its own statistical evaluation methods. Increased emphasis has been placed on social science research.  The APHA team recommends that IFRP de-emphasize programmatic activities such as maternity care records and prevalence studies and give greater attention to the long-term effects of fertility regulation methods used in LDC's, particularly vasectomy and the relation of hormonal contraceptives to cancer.  Further refinement of IFRP's reproductive age mortality survey (RAMOS) is particularly recommended.  Also recommended is early clinical evaluation of IFRP's commendable new osmotic cervical dilator, further testing of IUD's, and studies on female sterilization.  The APHA team commends IFRP's plans to develop new data processing systems and appropriate software for use in LDC's and encourages greater in-country, short-term training in system design and use. IFRP improvements in organization and staffing since the A.I.D. grant have been less impressive.  Of particular concern to the APHA team is the recent high turnover rate (25% from 9/79 to 7/80), with many departures being from high-level positions. Major recommendations in these areas include making a clear administrative division between the biomedical and social sciences and developing an autonomous international coordinating unit; establishing a permanent scientist leader; and contracting local universities and institutions to alleviate personnel shortages.","Evaluation period: 1 Sep 1977-30 Sep 1980","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Information dissemination|Contraceptive research|Oral contraceptives|Sterilization (birth control)|Intrauterine devices|Institution building|Management operations|Professionals|Data collection|Data analysis|Indigenous education|Statistical data|Information storage and retrieval systems|Sociology research|Beneficiary interviews","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAH891A1.pdf","1,376 KB","000262 - American Public Health Association","","","English","application/pdf","Evaluation team|Indepth evaluation|Onsite evaluation","","CONNELL, ELIZABETH B.|LAURO, DONALD|WRIGHT, NICHOLAS","","22 Jan 1981","","","","APHA EVALUATION TEAM REPORT, INTERNATIONAL FERTILITY RESEARCH PROGRAM","","PD-AAH-891-A1","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc3NTMw","Population and Humanitarian Assistance","9320537"
"Evaluates a partially AID-funded conference of the International Congress on New Enterprises (ICONE) held at Manila 6/24-6/29/79.  This special evaluation is based on interviews with conference participants. ICONE is phase two of an international effort to establish small/medium scale enterprises (SME) in LDC's by identifying promising joint LDC/developed country business ventures.  To its credit are 19 ventures (possibly including significant participation by two U.S. firms) with capitalization of $27-31 million and creating 750-1,150 jobs, and initiation of an informal global network to address common joint venture problems.  Despite this success and ICONE's strong conceptualization of its purpose, problems arose in organizing and executing the conference. Objectives were unclear; entrance fees were too high; there was neither prior information on participants' business interests nor a post-conference follow-up; the conference was too short to develop meaningful contacts; and participants included too many facilitator organizations and too few businesses.  Thus, most participants were undecided or negative as to attending future conferences. It is recommended that:  (1) the U.S. Government (USG) consult with the Government of the Philippines to develop a follow-up to ICONE/Manila; (2) the USG fund up to 10 feasibility studies over 3 years to identify specific opportunities in targeted sectors of LDC economies; (3) the USG fund a pre-conference phase to disseminate feasibility study results, orient participants, and facilitate specific joint venture negotiations during ICONE conferences; (4) businessmen be given co-venture materials at U.S. forums; (5) special U.S. training programs be developed to deal with the problems facing SME's in LDC's; (6) international donor agencies assume a leading role in SME joint ventures; and (7) co-venture partners be aware of the longer start-up time (2-3 years) and various definitions of ""small business"" in different parts of the world. Evaluator also notes that many of the problems of ICONE/Manila are apparently being rectified in preparations for ICONE/Panama City to be held in 1982.","Evaluation period: 24 Jun 1979-29 Jun 1979","Special Evaluation","Documents","LAC-0044-C-00-1021-00","","6/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Technical assistance|Beneficiary interviews","Latin America","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAI465A1.pdf","1,217 KB","002264 - Transtech Services USA","","","English","application/pdf","Indepth evaluation|Final EOPS","","MILLER, WILLIAM B.","","8 Jun 1981","","","","PROJECT ICONE/MANILA : AN EVALUATION","","PD-AAI-465-A1","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc3NTUx","Development Support","5980044|9361406"
"Evaluates project to establish independent cooperatives (co-ops) in Bolivia. Final evaluation covers the period 1975-4/81 and is based on site visits, document review, and interviews with project participants. The project has largely failed, serious deficiencies in implementation jeopardize progress made to date, and neither the Oficina Nacional/Fomento de Cooperativas Integrales (ONCICOOP) nor Robert R. Nathan Associates, the contractor, seems able to address these weaknesses.  Only three co-ops (Gran Chaco -- GC, Santa Cruz del Norte -- SCN, and Cochabamba -- CB) are participating -- Tahuantinsuyo was suspended for not repaying a loan to the Credito Rotativo de Fomento/Organizaciones Campesinas (CROFOC).  No co-op is financially self-sufficient or, except for SCN, is expected to be in the near future. Delinquency on loans, especially medium-term loans, is high. Co-op memberships have all fallen below the target of 1,500 -- GC has 234 members, SCN has 584, and CB has probably one-half the 1,750 members it claims. Functioning of co-op participatory structures, the Groupos Associados de Base (GAB), is fair in CB and SCN and is poor in GC. These problems are partly due to the co-ops having operated only 15 months under the current, improved institutional structure following 4 years under the previous deficient system.  In addition, ONCICOOP's resources are insufficient and have been poorly applied.  Planning, management, technical assistance (TA), and the design and implementation of the credit system were all inadequate. Bolivia's political and economic turmoil have impeded accurate forecasting and fostered disunity within the co-ops. It is recommended that USAID extend the project, continue co-op subsidies and TA, and retain the relationship with ONCICOOP and CROFOC. ONCICOOP should redesign and better implement the credit system, revise co-op financial projections, organize co-op federations within 2 years, improve administration of TA and management of the input suppl system, upgrade accounting practices, promote decentralized co-op member participation, and analyze women's role in the project.","Loan no. 511-T-055","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","AID/SOD/PDC-C-0223","","4/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural inputs|Supply management|Cooperatives|Financing|Agricultural development banks|Financial institutions|Institution building|Small farms|Farmers|Agricultural credit|Agricultural cooperatives|CREDIT|Credit cooperatives|Financial management","Bolivia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAH481.pdf","4,856 KB","006434 - Devres, Inc.","","","English","application/pdf","Evaluation team|Indepth evaluation|Final EOPS|Onsite evaluation","","EDING, DAVID F.|OBERG, KEITH L.","","17 Apr 1981","","","","FINAL EVALUATION OF THE BOLIVIA SMALL FARMER ORGANIZATIONS I PROJECT","","PD-AAH-481","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc3Njcz","Bolivia","5110452"
"Evaluates project to assist UNICEF in establishing nine community basic services units (BSU) in Lebanon.  Special evaluation is attached to a PES facesheet (PD-AAH-415-A1), covers the period 9/79-3/81, and is based on site visits. Progress has varied widely. All nine BSU's have rented facilities, hired various personnel, and received equipment.  However, no single BSU is completely staffed; trained personnel are scarce, especially in rural areas; and the units are too dependent on central administrators. Ordering appropriate equipment and ensuring its proper delivery, storage, and use have been problematic.  Only the model unit established in Bourj-al-Brajneh in 1971 is delivering a full range of services. Seven BSU's are delivering some services -- six provide health care, two have day care, and five offer community extension services (mainly literacy classes and sewing programs).  There is a dearth of information at all levels.  The Government of Lebanon is unclear as to UNICEF's role as equipment agent, program planner, and decisionmaker.  BSU's lack adequate knowledge of the communities they serve and are hesitant to initiate programs or tailor services to local needs.  Finally, the communities in which the units are located are often unaware of the services available. Included in the recommendations are:  (1) upgrade existing BSU's and establish no new units in 1981; (2) each unit survey local needs and resources and prepare short- and long-term programs; (3) deliver no more equipment until after the community is surveyed, delivered equipment is accounted for, and more BSU's are established; (4) explicitly define UNICEF's role and improve communication between all levels; (5) promote BSU's in the mass media; (6) foster initiative at the unit level; (7) gear the program to better serve rural needs, including recruitment of more personnel from rurla areas; (8) survey available Lebanese training resources; (9) give priority to hiring unit supervisors; (10) improve the curriculum and curtail pre-service training for auxiliary personnel; and (11) improve the operation and monitoring of in-service training.","Evaluation period: 1 Sep 1979-1 Mar 1981","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","3/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Primary health care|Health facilities|Educational facilities|Community development|Community participation|Government policy|Management research|Sociology research|Economic research|Rural areas|Health care|Urban areas|Districts|Educational development|Educational centers|Nonformal education|Day care services|Handicrafts|Literacy instruction|Limited data plus","Lebanon","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAH415B1.pdf","2,878 KB","002326 - U.N.

"Evaluates the operation of a project (Population Planning II -- PPII) to reduce population growth in the Philippines. Evaluation covers the period 7/77-2/81 and is based document review, site visits, and interviews with PPII officials.  A companion impact evaluation (PD-AAH-403) provides information on the project's effect on contraception and demography. Contraceptive use has risen from 25% to 40%, but the most effective methods are not being chosen due to delays in paying sterilization subsidies and fear of the pill and IUD.  The reimbursement system for A.I.D. funds, restrictive accounting rules, poor communication and transport, and local governments' (LG) limited contributions (averaging only 30% of project cost) have all lessened project liquidity. The PPII outreach program, operated through Barangay Service Points (BSP), is sound. The full-time outreach workers (FTOW) manage the BSP's and motivate the barangay service point officers (BSPO) through such means as nonmonetary incentives.  BSPO's are very effective as active house-to-house motivators, but need more training in contraception and counselling.  Although the FTWO's also promote Satisfied Acceptor and User Clubs, many users continue to rely on clinical sources for contraceptive supplies. Information, education, and communication (IEC) radio is nation-wide but appears to have a neglible impact.  Difficulty in locating researchers has slowed POPCOM's research efforts.  Research results have been used through workshops and other means. Greater emphasis is being given the management information system (MIS) to ovecome previous deficiencies. It is recommended that: (1) the Commission on Population (POPCOM) develop a cost-effective model and financial plan to sustain outreach efforts past l985, study the funding situation to improve liquidity, upgrade the status and training of BSPO's, provide BSPO's with greater incentives, upgrade the population MIS, and improve distribution of IEC materials; (2) LG's shoulder all outreach personnel salaries by 1985; and (3) A.I.D review its use of a cash advance rather than reimbursement system.","Evaluation period: 1 Jul 1977-13 Feb 1981","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","3/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Family planning|Development program evaluation|Contraceptive distribution|Family planning clinics|Family planning services|Delivery systems|Intrauterine devices|Family planning education|Sterilization (birth control)|Family planning research|Population programs|Family planning occupations|Medical education|Population and demography|Information storage and retrieval systems|Family planning promotion programs|Limited data plus","Philippines","","","008592 - USAID.

"Provides final Mission report (4/76-6/80) on a project to provide equipment and materials to help reconstruct power distribution systems in Port Said, Ismailia, and Suez, Egypt, which had been devastated by the 1973 war and subsequent lack of maintenance. The equipment and materials arrived according to plan and have provided the infrastructure necessary to rehabilitate the electrical distribution systems in the Suez Canal area.  Several field inspections by USAID/E have verified that the commodities were properly used.  The project could have been handled as a Commodity Import Activity (a lesson applicable to future projects of this kind). Unless coinciding with community development, planning the rehabilitation and expansion of distribution systems is a difficult process, since requirements change over the 2-3 year period between design and completion of procurement. Monitoring was difficult because construction work took place some distance from Cairo and without the in-country presence of the U.S. engineering consultant.  The lessons learned are that active monitoring of construction and installation work requires frequent visitation to job sites and a planned inspection program.  Project experience also taught that without the active involvement of the U.S. consultant working closely with the implementing agency, technical assistance is minimized and the opportunity to develop effective contracting and management procedures lost. Residual end-of-project funds were used to purchase additional equipment.  Since the commodities often arrive after project completion and the urgency to use them is greatly diminished, this practice should be carefully evaluated to determine if a true need exists or if equipment is being procured only to use remaining funds.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","AID/otr-C-1305","","10/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Electrical system maintenance|Supply management|Disaster relief|Limited data","Egypt","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAM412.pdf","1,122 KB","008539 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to strengthen the Government of Egypt's (GOE's) research and extension capabilities in the production of cereal crops. Special evaluation, focusing on project management, covers the period 7/79-6/81 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with GOE, USAID/E, and contractor personnel. The project, which originally focused on wheat, maize, sorghum, and barley, has been expanded to include grain legume and forage crops, farming systems research, and seed processing plants.  A system of competitive university grants will also be established. The project is behind schedule in all major inputs - provision of technicians, assignment of land, construction, procurement, and external training - and will almost certainly not achieve its goals by 9/30/84 as planned.  Nonetheless, real progress has been made in cereals research (particularly large-scale wheat demonstrations), although not in supporting fields, such as entomology and pathology. Integration of research and extension activities, however, has been minimal and no village extension agents (160 targeted) have been appointed yet.  There has been a good, but limited, start in the production and distribution of foundation seed and four scientists have been chosen for U.S. seed training.  Forage and grain legume research is behind schedule.  Lack of a comprehensive plan has hampered training activities. Conflicting perceptions of the project's collaborative assistance methodology and failures in communication among the contractor (the Consortium for International Development), USAID/E, and the GOE are responsible for many of the project's problems. Moreover, lack of an active Executive Committee has deprived the project of essential guidance.  Delays in procurement of equipment and supplies have been caused by complex purchasing and shipment procedures.  Low incentive payments have caused a large turnover in the Egyptian extension staff. Numerous recommendations are made for improving communication and developing jointly arrived at project workplans.  Other recommendations focus on management needs in the areas of budgeting, reporting, project evaluation, staffing, construction activities, training, research, extension, procurement, and, specifically, agricultural machinery procurement.","Project title: Egyptian major cereals improvement project (EMCIP)","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","7/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural research|Cereal crops|Forage crops|Farming systems|Seed production","Egypt","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAM661.pdf","1,500 KB","","","008539 - USAID.

"Evaluates project, implemented by Partnership for Productivity (PfP), to demonstrate a replicable extension service to provide managerial and technical assistance to small rural enterprises in Kenya.  Final evaluation covers the period 4/77-6/80 and is based on document review and interviews with USAID/K officials and PfP staff and clients. As a prototype of assistance to small rural businesses, the project deserves special consideration, even though not all targets were met. A total of 1,019 clients (about 25.8% of the business sector pool) were assisted vs. a planned 1,840; the average client improvement ratio was 1.3 (2.0 targeted).  Client monthly sales reached $2,162, short of the $3,000 planned and client monthly profits reached $285 ($500 planned). Many more than the 20 planned Kenyan business consultants were trained, employment was generated for 379 persons (vs. a planned 300), and collaboration with the Government of Kenya (GOK) in small business initiatives was increased.  The extension service was expanded from Kenya's Western region to the Central region, indicating replicability. PfP consultants are reaching out to women, groups, and productive enterprises, and other clients beyond the petty traders traditionally served.  Project services continue to be in great demand and clients attest to improvement in their managerial and technical skills. Progress was adversely affected by administrative problems attendant on the Kenyanization of PfP/Kenya's staff, which resulted in weak leadership, poor organizational structure, and unclear policies and terms of service for personnel.  Nonetheless, PfP/K is evolving into a sound organization, with a dedicated and high-quality staff, and is fully committed to seeking a strong relationship with the GOK. Although PfP consultants attempted to help clients to obtain loans, the extension service created an expectation of credit assistance which it was unable to satisfy. It is recommended that the project be continued to allow PfP to continue its extension service, that PfP be restructured to indicate clearly terms of service and lines of communication, and that highest priority be placed on seeking support from the GOK. The project taught the need for extension services to assure credit availability and the value of using extension agents who are familiar with clients' environments.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","AID/afr-G-1328","","4/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Rural development|Private sector|Management training|Extension services|Small scale enterprises|Business enterprises|Beneficiary interviews","Kenya","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAM705.pdf","1,288 KB","002121 - Partnership for Productivity Foundation, Kenya","","008565 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to expand and improve rural health care coverage in Lampang Province, Thailand, by establishing a cost-effective, integrated health system, replicable nationwide.  Special evaluation (comprised of five monographs numbered 7-11) covers the period 1974-81 and is based on document review, interviews with key personnel, and site visits. Monograph 7 summarizes the lessons learned in evaluating a large, integrated rural health services project, recommending:  early agreement on evaluation scope, design, and objectives; restricting use of control areas to small, short-term projects where contamination by project interventions is less likely; promoting helpful collaboration with other institutions while retaining control by project personnel; imposing data quality control at all steps; and ensuring continuity in the monitoring and evaluation system. Monograph 8 assesses the changes in the population's access to and utilization of health services during the project, while monograph 9 deals with changes in the performance of the health delivery system and its personnel, and the resulting changes in cost of service delivery. Total service output of the health delivery system increased greatly, due to increased health personnel and facilities and major contributions by health post volunteers.  Provision of illness care and family planning services were much improved; preventative services received less emphasis. Monograph 10 assesses the changes in health status indicators that have occurred.  Specific project-related improvements are difficult to identify as such factors as income, education, and environmental conditions also affect health status.  Although child nutritional status and sanitation improved in project areas, much remains to be done. Finally, monograph 11 synthesizes all findings and considers the possibility of replicating key project features elsewhere in Thailand, concluding that more support should be provided to volunteer health workers and that priority village-level health programs should be identified in each province.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/csd-3423|AID/ca-C-1320|AID/493-9025-T","","1/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Primary health care|Rural areas|Medical education|Health delivery|Health care|Technical assistance","Thailand","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAM728.pdf","26,346 KB","002287 - Thailand.

"Evaluates P.L. 480 Title II program in Bolivia.  Special evaluation covers the period 12/80-9/81 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with project personnel. Implementation of Food for Work (FFW) projects by National Community Development Services (NCDS) has been largely successful, although FFW has been mostly limited to the La Paz area, where the only central warehouse in Bolivia is located.  In 1981 NCDS clearly defined its emphases to coincide with USAID/B priorities.  NCDS regional offices almost always adhere to Title II regulations, and warehousing, food delivery, training, accounting, and project selection have been adequate; supervision and inspections by zonal offices have contributed to successful implementation.  Loss of food (mostly vegetable oil) during inland shipping has remained a serious problem for NCDS (and other participating PVO's); NCDS has greatly resolved this problem by deducting losses from payments to transport companies.  In 9/82 NCDS requested approval to expand warehouse and distribution services in 1983-84, so as to eliminate overconcentration in La Paz, facilitate expansion to Santa Cruz, and improve regional control. Regarding the Catholic Relief Service (CRS)/Caritas Title II program, only 30% of recommendations in the 12/80 evaluation have been implemented; USAID/B is working with the PVO's on the others, particularly regarding the Mother/Child Health Program, serving 1400 Mother's Clubs.  (A consultant was contracted in 9/82 to develop guidelines for this program.)  Compliance with reporting requirements has deteriorated significantly since 1976, when CRS decided to delegate more administrative responsibilities to CARITAS (an action resented by the latter); USAID/B has had to prepare some CRS/CARITAS reports. The CARE/Junta Nacional de Accion Social (JNAS) Title II program was terminated 12/30/80 due to:  lack of cooperation between CARE and JNAS, of trained JNAS staff, and of host government funds for warehousing and transportation, the latter often causing program delays; failure to report or claim losses; and especially, the fact that distribution was 30% less than planned, due mainly to poor supervision.  Seventh Day Adventist World Service will replace CARE as the PVO in this program. Numerous recommendations are made.","Attached to PD-AAM-670","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","11/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Food for work|Food for Peace|Food aid programs|Limited data plus","Bolivia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAM670A.pdf","4,402 KB","","","008515 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to improve the capacity of the Instituto de Recursos Hidraulicos (IHRE) to develop alternative energy sources in Panama. Special evaluation covers the period 1979-80 and is based on document review and interviews with USAID/P and IHRE personnel. Due first to too little organization and training during project start up, and second to understaffing of IHRE's crucial Office of Alternative Energy (OAE), the project is not meeting its objectives. Six new staff members were not recruited as planned and although current staff (5) were trained, earlier attrition rendered staff weaker than before project initiation.  Hence, OAE has been unable to organize technical literature acquisitions into a lending library as part of the creation of a proposed center of technical information.  However, qualified IHRE and A.I.D. personnel are available to conduct courses for government and private sector representatives on biomass energy, solar heating, wind power, and micro-hydraulic systems. Progress on subprojects has been variable.  Regarding biomass, the agricultural waste project has been suspended; reallocation of funds is pending.  Economic feasibility studies, conducted in Yaviza, indicate potential for a 300 KV demonstration wood biomass-fueled electrical plant, but no definitive final study has been done.  Among the solar energy activities, photovoltaic and water heater subprojects are in preparation, with equipment installation predicted for 1981; air conditioning acquisitions are being arranged.  The biogas demonstration project has proceeded with slow regularity; although more funding may be required, staff hiring and training is being improved and installation is expected in 1981.  IHRE, independently of the OAE, has selected sites for mini- and micro-hydroelectric plants.  Equipment is expected by 4/81; 40 feasibility studies are planned. An OAE master plan to identify Panamanian alternative energy needs and solutions needs to be refined and incorporated into the national energy plan.  Project funding is sufficient for the present, but probably not for the long run.  Areas with potential but as yet overlooked include ethyl alcohol production and energy conservation. In spite of the dedication of IHRE staff, the project is in jeopardy. Recommendations emphasize needs for staff augmentation, training, and better planning and technical documentation for subprojects.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","2/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Alternative energy resources|Pilot projects|Development project design|Development project implementation|Development project evaluation|Renewable energy resources|Energy resource development|Energy policy|Energy planning|Institution building","Panama","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAM781.pdf","1,777 KB","002621 - Rural Development Systems","","008589 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to help the Tanzanian Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) develop a system to produce and distribute food crop seeds to small farmers.  Special evaluation covers the period 1970-81 and was prepared by the Assistant Agricultural Development Officer. The project's purpose and goal have been achieved.  Three foundation seed farms capable of meeting Tanzania's maize, sorghum, and millet seed demands for the next 10 years have been established (a fourth site, Kibaha farm, proved unproductive and was dropped from the project as of 7/81), together with a unified seed production and distribution system that begins with research and culminates in the distribution of certified seed to Tanzanian farmers; the system includes a Spare Parts Center to support the seed farms and a National Seed Testing Laboratory. Two of the farms, Msimba and Arusha, are now able to operate successfully without U.S. assistance and are ready to be separated from the MOA and organized as a parastatal.  The Dabaga farm requires another year of MOA support until issues of misuse of labor and equipment for off-farm activities, equipment abuse, procurement confusions, and personnel conflicts are resolved and buildings are renovated. There have been some problems.  Although 50 Tanzanians received participant training - 47 of them in the United States - in agronomy and related areas, only 43% of the 21 degree (19 B.A. and 2 M.S.) and 41% of the nondegree participants returned to work on the farms under the direction of U.S. advisors; the rest were siphoned off by the Government of Tanzania.  As a result, the project has not reaped even half the benefit of its substantial training investment and the loss of on-the-job training is an irretrievable loss for this resource-poor country as a whole.  Resistance by the director of the spare parts center to on-the-job inventory control training from an onsite specialist also posed a problem. The major recommendation is to extend the project through 9/82 and provide U.S. technicians to ensure viability of the Dabaga farm. Recommendations for further USAID/T support to the Tanzanian seed industry (given the availability of additional funds) are also provided, with the development of hypbrid seed a priority item.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","11/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Seed production|Seeds|Distribution|Institution building|Participants|Limited data","Tanzania","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAN086.pdf","676 KB","008612 - USAID.

"Evaluates a village development project (VDP) to raise the standard of living of the rural poor by creating infrastructure, providing local services and trained personnel, encouraging local industries, and promoting participatory institutions. Evaluation covers the period 1954-1962 and is based on interviews with 260 villagers and 20 VDP workers. The multi-faceted project included programs in construction (roads, schools, potable water and waste facilities), irrigation (wells, pumps, canals), agriculture (seeds, fertilizer, tools, demonstration farms, animal husbandry), health (dispensaries, immunization, sanitation), education (school buildings, libraries), training (for village workers and technical staff, home economics for women), and institutional development (co-ops, village committees, youth groups). The project was constrained by traditional villager apathy, difficult access to rural areas, lack of transportation and village leadership, the introduction of the Indian Aid Mission (which diverted the project focus), and lack of skilled manpower. The project lacked emphasis on helping the most disadvantaged and there was poor coordination between departments and agencies, as well as a lack of consistent monitoring and evaluation. The VDP nevertheless motivated the villagers to mobilize local resources, and inspired traditional village leaders to support the VDP. Channels of communication were opened among villagers and between villagers and government, giving the people a heightened sense of identity and social consciousness.  Trained and dedicated administrative and technical staff smoothed the transition in 1962 from the VDP to the Panchayat Development Program.  Tangible benefits included trails and bridges, vegetable farms, wells, canals, and potable water supplies. The VDP's greatest successes occurred in agriculture, mass education, and health services.  The VDP had a greater impact in the hilly regions and in eastern Nepal.  Overall, the VDP represented a turning point in the relationship of the government to the rural people, where the government was seen as a provider as well as a taxation instrument.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Villages|Community development|Development administration|Integrated rural development|Community self help","Nepal","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAN450.pdf","5,292 KB","003392 - Himalayan Studies Centre","","","English","application/pdf","Country program evaluation|Onsite evaluation|Indepth evaluation|Final EOPS","","","Agricultural development","Jan 1981","","","","Evaluation of USAID village development project in Nepal (1954-1962)","","PN-AAN-450","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc5Nzc2","Nepal",""
"Evaluates project to help the Government of Senegal (GOS) establish a village reforestation program.  Final evaluation covers the period 5/80-12/81 and is based on discussions with project participants and site visits. Achievement of project objectives has exceeded expectations.  A total of 190 ha of communal forests - 90% more than planned - have been planted and the tree survival rate is 90%.  Some trees are already over 2 m tall and could yield valuable wood for construction in a year or two.  Cost per ha was approximately $770, well below that of large-scale plantations, which can reach $1,000.  Possibilities for replicating the project's successful small-scale approach to reforestation, which may turn out to have a far greater income-generating potential than expected, are good. A model collaborative approach to project implementation was established between the GOS Forest Service and local villagers, who performed more than half of the planting work on an unpaid, self-help basis; the GOS provided equipment support at critical points.  Trees were obtained from regional GOS, rather than village, nurseries; the latter were not established due to the unavailability of sufficient water and/or Forest Service field agents.  Maintenance during the first year dry period was excellent; the Forest Service helped in some areas with tractors and disks where villagers could not keep up with weeds and a risk of fire was present.  Maintenance of some tree plots is currently lagging, and tall grass which has grown up is a fire hazard. Options for ensuring continued maintenance have been discussed and specific, locally-funded activities planned. While the grant agreement envisioned using harvested trees for firewood, current plans are to sell the wood for use in construction. Unequal inputs by participating villagers may give rise to difficulties in distributing project benefits.  A second evaluation should be undertaken at cutting time to determine this question.  Such an evaluation should include the work of a sociologist familiar with communal forestry in Senegal, preferably, in light of the the traditional link between women and firewood, a woman.  The question of tenure of land used for tree plots must also be addressed.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","AID/afr-G-1655","","12/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Reforestation|Forest products|Forestry|Community self help|Beneficiary interviews|Limited data","Senegal","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAN118.pdf","494 KB","","","008600 - USAID.

Some progress has been achieved in mass rearing of insects, but completion of the new insectary at Mbita Point is essential. Research on new insect biotypes has not begun.  Identification of genetic and physiological determinants of plant resistance mechanisms has been slow due to emphasis on screening work (recently assumed by ICIPE's Crop Borer Program) and understaffing; hypotheses drawn from trials need further testing. Intercropping with resistant varieties of maize, sorghum, and cowpeas is being evaluated in the field by cooperating farmers. Project scientists have prepared 7 papers for publication, but have collected few data on the economics of pest management. Overall progress has been constrained partly due to staff limitations:  (1) the two entomologists and one agronomist cannot adequately monitor the nine technicians; (2) the target of one scientist per major pest type is far from realized; (3) there is high scientist turnover at Mbita Point due to lack of facilities. Project scientists feel that the strong role played by ICIPE administration in decisions that should be based on technical considerations have hampered progress. Recommendations regard research priorities, organization, staffing, reporting, project design, and administration.

"Evaluates project to strengthen LDC standards institutions. Special evaluation covers the period 8/76-9/80 and is based on document review, visits to three LDC's, and a survey of LDC participants. The project provided valuable assistance to LDC's, but not all targets were achieved, due partly to a poorly written and inconsistent project paper and partly to the low priority given to standards institutions by most LDC's.  A total of 42 countries and 2 regional organizations participated in project activities and survey respondents overwhelming indicated they had benefited from the project. Standardization seminars (3) and workshops (3) were held in the U.S. and South Korea for 59 (vs. 50 targeted) leaders from LDC institutions; although twice the targeted number of LDC's were represented, nearly 25% of participants were from 4 LDC's - Korea, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Thailand. National standardization surveys were conducted as planned in 3 countries (Indonesia, Sudan, and Pakistan), and a limited survey was conducted in Guyana.  However, only 3 of 6 planned U.S. standards and measurement courses were held, with 32 (vs. 60 targeted) trainees. The contractor, the National Bureau of Standards (NBS), performed well under minimal A.I.D. supervision.  TA was provided in more than 10 countries - which were chosen, contrary to the project paper, on the basis of political rather than equity considerations.  In fact, the project gave little specific attention to the needs of the poor, even though the example of Ecuador - where the standards institute is promoting equity in the marketplace and quality control for foods and drugs - shows the importance of standardization to the poor.  NBS activities were most valuable where consistent, ongoing assistance was provided. It is in the United States's interest - for political, economic, and scientific reasons - as well as in the interest of international development to continue to support standardization in LDC's. Suggestions are made for a follow-on project to focus on improving the quality of LDC products consumed domestically and exported to the United States, while tailoring activities to the level of technological advancement in particular LDC's. Recommendations are also made for improving the effectiveness of country surveys.","Attached to PD-AAJ-596","Special Evaluation","Documents","DAN-1406-O-00-1016-00","","1/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Measurement and detection|Institution building|Surveys|Participants|Technical assistance","","","","","","","English","","","","Roush, James L.","","1981","","","","Standardization in LDC's : an evaluation of AID project no. 931-0243 and suggestions regarding follow-on project activity","","XD-AAJ-596-A","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc5ODcy","Technical Assistance","9310243"
"Evaluates project to strengthen the Government of Malawi's (GOM) Department of Agricultural Research (DAR).  Special evaluation covers the period 8/79-12/81 and is based on talks with GOM, contractor, and USAID/M personnel and field trips. Generally satisfactory progress has been made, but implementation is behind schedule due to delays in executing the technical assistance contract with the University of Florida (UF), constructing project facilities, and procuring research equipment, and to the GOM's slowness in filling research positions. Field experiments on peanut growth and production have been conducted, and handheld computers provided to assist in analysis of research findings; training in computer use and programming was provided to some DAR staff.  Programs in farming systems research and research/extension liaison, including on-station and on-farm trials of fertilizer on local maizes, have also begun. Another program, focusing on pasture and forage improvement, is testing both indigenous and introduced grasses.  Studies of farmer innovation and decisionmaking are underway.  A new grazing trial emphasizing maximum beef production has been proposed as have research programs in vegetables and fruits, calf mortality, maize breeding, and the possible causes of low smallholder productivity. Inservice training has been excellent and 12 DAR staff are receiving U.S. advanced (Ph.D. and M.S.) training in such fields as plant breeding, farming systems reseach, agricultural economics, applied anthropology, forage production, ruminant nutrition, and soil science. In addition, the UF team has helped to restructure the DAR, thus improving linkages between research and extension, and is participating on a newly formed Agricultural Research Committee. Among the recommendations are to:  (1) explore participation or collaboration in international research programs and organizations; (2) expand inservice training for research personnel and extension workers, and support appropriate farmer training (meetings, publications, radio programs); (3) increase GOM financial support of research, which has been lacking; and (4) provide critically needed library facilities and services.","Attached to PD-AAN-267","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","12/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Institution building|Agricultural training|Agricultural research","Malawi","","","002664 - U.S. Dept. of Agriculture.

"Evaluates project to identify and test cost-effective ways to expand and improve social services in Egypt.  Special evaluation covers the period 9/77-11/80 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with GOE and other participants. Progress has been uneven.  After 3 years of confusion over implementing entities' responsibilities (a problem exacerbated by GOE participants' expectations of high salaries and lavish benefits), authority has been clearly defined and a process to improve social services begun.  A demonstration training center for social workers has been established in Gharbeya Province, but lacks full-time residential trainers; 35 trainers are on call, however, with training of 75 trainers expected within a year.  To date, training has been provided to 52 staff of experimental social units in Gharbeya and Assiut and to the staff and supervisors of day care centers.  Case management training is in progress, and a plan for 1981 training (including community development training) is complete.  Social service guidelines have been written and tested; social units in Gharbeya now have authority to decide on social security grants without referral to the Governorate. Provision of social services, however, has been limited, due in part to funding delays.  Furniture for day care centers has been designed but not built, teaching materials have not been obtained, sewing classes have been poorly organized and utilized, and family planning activities remain in the discussion stage. More positively, a manual for planning and designing social services was developed. In other areas, community development associations were reactivated but are still in the organizational stage.  A planned community needs assessment was not completed; a social unit area profile, developed in its place, has been completed for Gharbeya units.  Little has been done towards developing a management information system. Despite the project's mixed success, the project director has decided to replicate the project in four other governorates.  It is recommended that the project be extended and flexibility in management ensured; activities be kept in line with resources; and expansion to Qena be considered.","Attached to PD-AAN-331","Special Evaluation","Documents","263-0263-S-00-1006-00","","1/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Social services|Social workers","Egypt","","","","","008539 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to increase the number of trained Government of the Philippines (GOP) management personnel.  Special evaluation covers the period 2/78-6/81 and is based on participant questionnaire review and interviews with project personnel. Targets were not fully met.  Although 38 participants received training in priority development sectors such as development administration, economic development and planning, environmental aspects of development, and women in development, only 39% of academic and 56% of non-academic training targets were accomplished due to an increase in U.S. training costs.  The project provided 5.79 person-years of academic and 49.13 person-months of non-academic management training, 53% of the targeted amount. Most trained participants came from GOP agencies not called for in the project and none of the acquired knowledge appears to have been institutionalized through formal or informal training courses. Few participants have given special lectures or written articles on their particular areas of training; most transfered their knowledge through staff meetings, on-the-job instruction, and recommendations to superiors.  In addition, limited regional participation in the project prevented the project's potential impact on the programs and operations of targeted regional organizations. By contrast, program concentrations were adequate and the rate of retention of returned participants was 100%.  All of the returned participants were assigned to the same agencies and positions that they came from.  In accordance with the project's aim of enhancing the role of women in Philippine economic development, 18 of 38 (47%) participants were women.  Reflecting an emphasis on targeting government officials who possessed leadership and authority, 71% of participants came from junior, mid-career, and supervisory levels and 24% came from senior GOP levels. Eleven recommendations address:  participant selection criteria; types of training; participating agencies; and the purposes, goals, and funding of future projects.","Evaluation period: 1978-1980","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","6/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Education for development|Participants|Management training|Personnel development|Beneficiary interviews|Project change","Philippines","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDCAF200.pdf","361 KB","008592 - USAID.

"Evaluates MEDEX project, implemented by the University of Hawaii's Health Manpower Development Staff (HMDS), to develop three-tiered Primary Health Care (PHC) programs for LDC's. Special evaluation covers the period 7/78-2/81 and is based on document review, interviews with project and LDC personnel, and visits to three countries. HMDS's approach to designing PHC management and training systems is logical, sensible, and understandable, and is in fact the most complete and systematic prototypical approach known.  The approach is not perfect, however.  Potential problem areas include the relationship of mid-level health workers (MLHW's) to physicians, community health workers (CHW's), and other paramedical personnel; the quality of MLHW preventive care; and a lack of adequate data to assess cost-effectiveness.  HMDS has developed high-quality prototype competency-based modules for training and continuing education of CHW's and MLHW's.  Prototype management materials are still in preliminary draft form, but are well regarded by LDC health officials.  Materials for doctors who will direct the PHC programs and supervise MLHW's have not yet been developed. HMDS has performed less well in planning and executing field systems. HMDS is now implementing PHC projects in three LDC's (Guyana, Lesotho, Pakistan), but these are still in early stages - MLHW's have been or are being trained in all three, but are deployed only in Guyana.  The MLHW training modules were successfully adapted to these countries through seminars and workshops. HMDS has been criticized by A.I.D. and LDC personnel for its reluctance to circulate its materials while still incomplete, out of concern that other institutions might adapt them for commercial use.  A more open and flexible approach is recommended. There is also a feeling, particularly at some Missions, that HMDS is inflexible in adapting materials to local needs, but this is not the case in the above-mentioned countries. A.I.D. should increase understanding among Bureau and Mission staff of the MEDEX project. While HMDS has formed a network with two other U.S. universities to increase its response capability in developing PHC systems, thus far the costs of the network have probably outweighed its benefits.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/dspe-C-0053","","2/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Primary health care|Community health care|Health care planning|Extension services|Health workers|Paramedical education|Educational materials|Health care administration","Guyana|Lesotho|Pakistan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAN600.pdf","2,362 KB","000179 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to help the Office of Rural Development and Development Administration (RAD) improve A.I.D.'s integrated rural development (IRD) projects.  Special mid-term evaluation is based on document review, interviews, and a site visit. Because RAD lacks sufficient control over the project agenda, research and TA have been well below target and are likely to remain so. Missions' veto power over who visits their projects has forced RAD and the contractor to act like a trouble shooting, indefinite quantity contractor rather than as A.I.D.'s agent for learning.  RAD cannot even choose A.I.D.'s most interesting or needy IRD projects and plan for a cumulative effort.  Further, all RAD project personnel are temporary, non-AID employees. This situation needs to be reversed.  Most of the project's weaknesses came together in Jamaica, the site visited by the evaluation team.  TA there failed to follow up a relevant A.I.D. evaluation, missed the key issues, and proved irrelevant to management. Nonetheless, RAD and DAI performed well in several areas.  RAD took the initiative on work important to A.I.D. and created an excellent and useful training framework.  Both RAD and the contractor effectively marketed the project and consolidated the project agenda.  In-country performance by the contractor was professional and resulted in the targeted 10 country reports and in insightful reports and research notes.  The state-of-the-art paper, however, was uneven; the planned IRD design manual should shift focus from identifying to solving problems. Future field work should focus on follow-up visits to 4-5 countries. This project shows that while certain kinds of research, e.g., in chemistry, can be conducted by a consultant, research on a ""soft"" subject such as IRD requires creative interaction between A.I.D. Bureau and Mission field personnel.  While RAD and the contractor need to radically improve dissemination within A.I.D., the real problem is the structural separation between learning and doing within A.I.D. itself - resulting in a juxtaposition of out-of-date and overburdened field personnel and a continual flurry of policy and procedural changes and ending in Mission antagonism to AID/W, cynicism, and lowered performance.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","DSAN-C-0065","","2/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Integrated rural development|Development administration|Development research|Institution building","Jamaica","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAN642.pdf","1,314 KB","006727 - Development Alternatives, Inc.

"Evaluates 20 (18 completed, 2 ongoing) Food for Work (FFW) projects implemented by the Catholic Relief Services (CRS) and the Cooperative for American Relief Everywhere (CARE) on Luzon Island in the Philippines.  Special evaluation covers the period 1978-80 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with project recipients. FFW projects were beneficial to poor families and communities as a whole.  Agricultural and economic development led to self-sufficiency in food production, an increase in income and better transport of products and people due to construction and repair of roads.  Community development prevented floods and erosion and enhanced land improvement, community organization, education, health, and nutrition by construction and repair of many community facilities.  Improvements in the material and social well-being of poor families included food assistance, cash compensation, an increase in rice harvest, as well as social, educational, health, and recreational benefits. Of the 20 projects surveyed, only three had not accomplished their objectives due to technical deficiencies.  All the FFW projects promoted community development, i.e., community consciousness and cooperation by project recipients.  Few recipients cited lack of work as a reason for participating. Only one project did not generate other food production and community development efforts. Sample FFW projects which contribute to food production and economic development are communal vegetable gardens, irrigation systems, feeder roads, drainage canals, and dike and ditch filling projects.  However, technical difficulties did constrain two projects and purposes were not achieved. Survey findings show a strong sense of cooperation among recipients, with the majority joining FFW projects primarily to help in community development.  This accounts for their pledge of continued project support even without food payments.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","6/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Food for work|Agricultural development|Economic development|Community development|Self sufficiency|Beneficiary count","Philippines","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAP056.pdf","5,680 KB","007320 - SGV & Co.","","","English","application/pdf","Indepth evaluation|Onsite evaluation","","","Agricultural research","Jun 1981","","","","Evaluation of PL-480 Title II funded CRS and CARE Food for Work program in selected Luzon provinces","","PN-AAP-056","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTgwOTIz","Philippines",""
"Evaluates project to conduct agronomic and economic research on tropical soils in Peru.  Final evaluation, prepared by an outside team, covers the period 1972-81 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with project staff and concerned officials. The project has produced a number of outstanding results. Continuous annual cropping has been demonstrated to be feasible on infertile acid soils (Ultisols) in the humid tropics, with adequate lime and fertilizer inputs and climatically adapted crop varieties.  Soil chemical and some soil physical properties have been monitored for 9 years to determine the effects of land clearing and cropping systems, providing baseline information of value throughout the humid tropics.  Subsoil acidity and low fertility have been ameliorated by downward movement of calcium and magnesium under continuous high input cropping systems, permitting deeper rooting of crops.  Kudzu as a managed fallow has been found effective in recycling nutrients and increasing nitrogen fertility for subsequent crops.  Small farm extrapolation and validation trials are helping develop a methodology potentially important to the whole Peruvian Selva. Besides the above areas (especially continuous cropping), the proposed Collaborative Research Support Program (CRSP) should place high priority on minimum or zero tillage cropping systems, chemical weed control, and legume-based pastures.  Areas better left to other institutions are multiple cropping, nitrogen in multiple cropping, magnesium/potassium ratios, lime placement studies, and composting.  The Amazon Agricultural Research Network (REDINAA) should be used to extend project results within the Amazon Basin and to develop the project's soil management research activities in the CRSP.  Care should be taken not to overload the CRSP with complementary research requirements, e.g., the need for work in pest and disease control. The effort to develop economically effective soil-crop management systems employed a sound methodology, but was hampered by a severe lack of data; a strong effort should be made to develop data sets of reliable quality.  National and international priorities for future economic research are provided.","Evaluation period: 13-21 Sep 1981","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","AID/ta-C-1236","","9/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Tropical soils|Soil research|Soil management|Agricultural research|Cropping patterns|Acid soils|Technical assistance","Peru","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAN736.pdf","690 KB","000890 - North Carolina State University|008591 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to help the Royal Thai Government (RTG) to control malaria.  Special evaluation covers the period 8/79-7/81 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with RTG and project officials. Although the project has wrought considerable improvement in Thailand's anti-malaria activities, there is little chance that its overambitious goals for reducing mortality and morbidity will be achieved.  Reported malaria cases have increased from 303,173 in 1979 to 397,491 in 1980 and P. falciparum cases from 58.16% to 68.5%.  Major problems include:  budgetary and time limitations; high inflation; uncontrolled migration within and among Thailand and neighboring countries; the practice of rubber tappers working at night (increasing their exposure); and conflicting RTG-AID bureaucratic systems.  The latter problem is now generally resolved. A total of 15,000 (vs. 20,000 targeted) village volunteer malaria collaborators (VVMC's) have been trained.  Training of VVMC's was preceded by training of instructors who then trained 552 RTG zone and sector personnel who in turn trained VVMC's in 2-day sessions.  VVMC training was delayed in some zones because complete malaria kits were not available.  Only 2 of 7 U.S. Master's fellowships have been filled and due to lack of qualified candidates it is unlikely the remaining 5 will be filled; 4 (of 7) in-country Master's slots are filled, and U.S. and third-country observation tours have been conducted for officials. High-quality health education materials (posters, leaflets, etc.), have been produced, some in Thai and some in the Yawi (Malay) language. Health education equipment has just begun to arrive.  No personnel have yet been trained in health education methodology; courses are planned for 1982. Joint WHO/AID research findings on treatment regimens are being incorporated into the malaria program's operations and research on biological control measures is underway.  The headquarters research facility has been built; construction of additional training facilities, not yet begun, should be finished early in 1983; and 150 new malaria clinics will open by the end of 1981 and the remaining 100 planned by the end of 1982.  Cooperation between the health services and the malaria program is generallly good.  Several recommendations are made.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","7/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Malaria|Disease prevention and control|Health education|Technical training","Thailand","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAN797.pdf","2,087 KB","008613 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to support efforts of the Centre for Population Activities (CEFPA) to provide in-country management training for LDC women in family planning and related development areas. Mid-term special evaluation covers a period through 3/81 and is based on document review and visits to 5 countries. CEFPA's extension to LDC's of its Washington, D.C.-based Women-in-Management (WIM) training program for public and private sector women professionals has had good results to date.  WIM workshops have been held in Egypt, India, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Kenya, and Peru.  One workshop was held in Malaysia, but the full program will not be implemented there under this grant.  The workshops are planned in collaboration with in-country public, private, and quasi-governmental institutions and are preceded by establishment and training of a training team, which usually contains alumnae of the Washington, D.C. program.  The training itself, which is participative, practical, and generally adapted to in-country needs and thus has been well-received, takes place through 2-week and 3-day workshops which cover, in varying mixes, skills in five major areas:  general and specific project design and management, self-actualization, and human and community organization.  Follow-up activities include helping trainees and their organizations develop proposals, locate funding, and implement action programs; these are behind schedule, however, and CEFPA now realizes that in-country organizational units are needed for such work.  CEFPA has also collected data to study the impact of the WIM program, although monitoring projects developed by WIM trainees will not begin for some time. In fine, CEFPA has begun to provide a unique activity for which there is a clear demand from both public and private LDC institutions. Although not enough time has elapsed for many women to have projects funded and underway, the training programs have already had a beneficial impact on trainees (which in turn has a ripple effect) and have generated widespread local support and a desire to institutionalize the training/follow-up approach. Four in-country reports are appended.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/OTR-C-1571","","9/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Women in development|Education|Education for development|Management training|Development project design|Development project implementation|Development project evaluation|Family planning","Egypt|India|Bangladesh|Peru|Indonesia|Kenya","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAP321.pdf","1,479 KB","004649 - Centre for Population Activities","","000153 - USAID.

"Mid-term evaluation of a project in Burkina Faso to develop the capacity of the Institut Superieur Polytechnique (ISP) in Ouagadougou and the Matourkou/Centre Agricole Polyvalent (CAP) near Bobo Dioulasso to provide university and high school training, respectively, to top- and mid-level agricultural extension leaders.  Special evaluation covers the period 10/77-4/81 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with staff. Despite certain shortcomings, the ISP is a fair success as a college. The quality of training has been admirably high; although only 12 of an expected 25 students graduated this year and there is little hope that the number will increase.  The five-year program has had an 80% failure rate.  There are no textbooks and the library contains few materials. Similarly, the CAP has its strengths and weaknesses.  The training program is well designed, there is an adequate physical plant, practical experiences (excepting cereal crops) are well organized and productive; and the staff is competent.  Among the weaknesses:  academic staff is limited to part-time instructors; with the result that 25% of the classes cannot be taught; management and maintenance are very poor; there are no textbooks or lesson plans; wells run dry in the growing season making field crops unproductive; and less than 50% of the expected number of participants receive training. Recommendations are:  (1) to separately treat opportunities at ISP and CAP, when ISP has openings they should not be jeopardized by limited CAP graduates; (2) TA and participant training should consolidate gains in curriculum development before entering new areas; (3) all participants should aim at delivering specific agricultural extension instruction that is necessary for improved training; (4) the Government of Burkina Faso (GOBF) should extend full civil service pay to the CAP and improve management; (5) to concentrate on institutional development, placing secondary importance on the quantity of graduates; (6) a larger number of trainees must be found; and (7) communication between USAID/BF, the GOBF, and TA staff must be improved.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","7/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural extension|Agricultural colleges|Agricultural extension training|Agricultural schools|Agricultural education|Participant preparation|Institution building","Burkina Faso","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAP235.pdf","3,455 KB","003002 - Ronco Consulting Corp.","","008620 - USAID.

"Presents final report (1976-1/81) on a project to assist the Government of the United Republic of Cameroon (GURC) to develop the institutional capacity to carry out sites and services programs for the country's low income families. Most targets have been met.  The development of GURC institutions responsible for planning, administering, financing, and executing shelter projects has proceeded on schedule, as new governmental bodies such as the Urban and Rural Lands Development Authority (MAETUR) have been created to administer the project and existing bodies reorganized. To implement sites and services programs, MAETUR conducted topographic surveys for pilot sites to be developed at Youande and Douala, constructed site models, and carried out soil studies, using standardized terms of reference written by the Sites and Services Unit. For each project several preliminary site plans were drawn up, compared, and evaluated with the best plan submitted.  Some 50 model house plans were prepared using the results of socioeconomic and cost-of-housing construction surveys of selected households carried out in Yaounde and Garoua (both surveys) and Douala (the socioceconomic survey only). Surveys also investigated: infrastructure costs; existing and proposed planning norms, codes, and regulations; and sanitation and water treatment systems.  MAETUR carried out onsite manufacture of local building materials (e.g., mud blocks) for use in construction. Preliminary cost plans were then drawn up for each of the model house plans prepared based on updated costs.  From preliminary plans, 16 houses were selected to be constructed by MAETUR at the Yaounde pilot site.  A final selection of the best of the house plans was arranged to provide options for beneficiaries and a self-help housing guide was distributed to them for this purpose. At Yaounde construction began one month after the contract was signed; the other projects have not reached the construction stage but are in the final stages of physical planning. The rainy season has hampered progress in construction at Yaounde, however, and significantly increased the project's eventual cost. Recommendations for future projects are included.","Companion project evaluation summary: PD-AAX-787","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","AID/otr-C-1545","","1/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Public housing assistance|Housing sites|Low cost housing|Building construction|Building design|Institution building|Housing planning","Cameroon","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAP339.pdf","2,223 KB","000968 - Planning and Development Collaborative International, Inc.

"Evaluates Heifer Project International (HPI) livestock development program for young farmers in Belize.  Special evaluation covers the period 1974-3/81 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with Government of Belize (GOB) and project personnel. Despite rapid gains in the number of persons trained at the Belize National 4-H Center (the primary focus of HPI activity), the Center's technical capability to serve as an effective demonstration, reproduction, and distribution center has remained limited.  From 1976-80, 91 youths in 16 groups (including, in 1980, 17 girls) received 3 months of Center training. Although production levels among trainees have generally been high, productivity of the livestock held at the center itself has declined over the period 1978-81.  Poor livestock growth rates indicate the need for improved management practices and extensive training of 4-H Center personnel. HPI has also contributed to the Rural Education and Agriculture Program (REAP).  From 1976-80 HPI funded the purchases of 5,651 broiler chicks for the 17 upper primary schools participating in REAP and one-day REAP training courses were held at the 4-H Center during 1979-80.  HPI has also provided funding and livestock to the Belize Youth Development Center (a vocational training center); provided swine to the Belize Central Farm, which distributes the offspring to small farmers at subsidized prices; and provided livestock in support of two goat production projects of the Caribbean Agricultural Research and Development Institute (CARDI). As of 1/83, HPI will no longer have a full-time resident representative in Belize.  Therefore a system must be developed to ensure the continuity and continued improvement of HPI-related livestock work there.  Also, intensive preparation for transfer of the 4-H Center to the Ministry of Labour in 6/82 is imperative.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","7/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Private voluntary organizations|Livestock|Agricultural training|Animal husbandry|Youth|Four-H clubs|Limited data plus","Belize","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAP424.pdf","1,513 KB","002496 - Heifer Project International, Inc.","","","English","application/pdf","Onsite evaluation","","","","30 Jul 1981","","","","Evaluation of the H.P.I. program in Belize","","PD-AAP-424","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTgyOTY3","Belize","9380151"
"Evaluates International Voluntary Service (IVS), a private voluntary organization specializing in skills transfer to indigenous institutions. Special evaluation covers the period to 12/81 and is based on document review, site visits to two IVS projects (one in Honduras, the other in Bangladesh), and interviews with U.S. and overseas IVS personnel. The IVS projects are very well managed, the IVS has developed strong managerial and administrative skills, and IVS's foreign staff is well qualified and dedicated.  During the last evaluation, IVS had a large deficit; now that deficit has vanished.  Both the Washington and the field staffs said that IVS-Washington has greatly improved its management; all the reports and correspondence between IVS-Honduras and IVS-Washington showed each kept the other well informed.  The Village Development and Training Project (VDTP) in Bangladesh has been a success.  In Honduras, the IVS's soybean development project has not yet achieved its full potential; however, the volunteers were highly praised. The IVS Latin American officer was well informed, supportive, and generally aware of all that was being done in Honduras.  IVS is in an excellent position to expand its operations; a 50% increase in field staff could easily be handled by the management team. There is room for improvement in impact analysis:  IVS should be much more hard-nosed in assessing the cost-benefit ratio.  In Bangladesh, they succeeded in transferring both skills and a sense of mission to Bangladeshi co-workers.  Both countries receive mixed ratings on the scope of choosing an in-country counterpart who would carry on the work after departure of the IVS specialist.  Even though volunteers receive a comfortable income, all respondents to a survey said the term ""voluntary"" reflected the spirit and dedication of IVS workers' deeper commitment to the community.  When offering specific skills or knowledge, IVS's style is quiet, modest, and unpretentious. Because of this submerged organizational ego, the indigenous institutions are more likely to take control of the project allowing IVS to quietly leave after their contribution is made.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-0100-S-00-1148-00","","12/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Private voluntary organizations|Institution building|Technology transfer","Honduras|Bangladesh","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAP425.pdf","15,512 KB","000145 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to support activities of the International Executive Service Corps (IESC).  Special evaluation covers the period through 12/80 and is based on document review; visits to Ecuador, Peru, Thailand, and Indonesia; and interviews with IESC staff, volunteers, and clients, with A.I.D. and LDC officials, and with others. The IESC program continues to provide valuable services to client firms, while also making secondary contributions such as increased employment and expanded domestic and external trade. IESC's programming process, especially project selection and preparation, has become more formal and more reflective of government and private sector priorities than in the past, and a new evaluation process - the Client Assistance Review (CAR) - has been established and is eliciting information on IESC impacts at both client and broader levels.  Over 235 CAR's have been completed, with another 260 in process. The percentage of IESC projects in the small business category (firms with fewer than 150 employees and gross sales of $50,000-$3,000,000) has grown significantly.  Additional funds are being made available for businesses at the lower end of the scale, since greater emphasis is now placed on gearing client contributions to ability to pay, but projects with firms over the $3 million level will still be needed to subsidize services to small firms.  Pilot projects with promising smaller (below $50,000) firms are recommended to provide experience on which to base future decisions vis-a-vis serving smaller businesses. Some 20% of IESC projects are in the government sector (public administration, health and education, and public corporations). Such projects assume considerable importance in countries such as Indonesia, where public corporations play a dominant role, but their overall impact - as compared to that of private sector projects - is not known. It is recommended, inter alia, that IESC:  continue to refine its programming process, especially with regard to developing coherent programs at the country-level; evaluate a series of public sector projects to get some measure of their relative effectiveness; conduct case studies to measure overall IESC impacts in individual countries; reduce turnover among country program directors; and seek increased contributions from U.S. businesses.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","2/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Private voluntary organizations|Small scale enterprises|Business enterprises|Economic development|Management development|Public enterprises|Private enterprises|Beneficiary interviews","Thailand|Indonesia|Ecuador|Peru|Asia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAP427.pdf","859 KB","000145 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to develop Senegal's Lower Casamance Region by upgrading agricultural research and extension services and regional planning capabilities and by improving health and adult literacy in the area.  Special evaluation covers the period 8/78-6/81 and is based on document review and interviews with farmers, GOS officials, and staff of SOMIVAC, the implementing agency. A 1-year delay in start-up and climatic factors, particularly a 1980/81 drought, have kept the project from making measurable progress toward its goal of increasing crop production.  At the output level, the project has fielded 49 of the 70 extension agents planned for 1981, begun construction of 2 small salt intrusion dams, and sent 11 of 12 participants for long-term U.S. training and 5 for short-term courses. Twenty ha of improved rice and corn seed varieties will be planted in 1981, and a provisional location has been selected for a 100-ha seed farm. Long-term TA has been provided for the agricultural research station and SOMIVAC, English-language training for SOMIVAC and research staff has begun, and 2 of the 3 planned long-term studies (a resource inventory and an anti-salt barrage related health survey) are underway. However, a restructured credit program has not been introduced: although credit for fertilizer and seed is available from the Government, medium-term credit has been suspended for 5 years.  The health program is still in the planning stage, and the literacy program - the main vehicle for moving authority for agricultural development to the village level - is just beginning. The Project Paper underestimated the environmental constraints to the area's development potential and overestimated SOMIVAC capabilities.  To overcome constraints to agriculture, the project has adopted a farming systems research approach, crop diversification, and increased varietal R&D.  However, unbalanced progress among project components has inhibited overall achievement, and while the project should be able to achieve planned outputs, given a 2-year extension, a conscious effort must be made to emphasize decentralization and focus resources on village services rather than administration.","Attached to PD-BAE-793-A","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","7/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Regional development|Agricultural extension|Agricultural research|Crop yield|Beneficiary interviews|Project change","Senegal","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDBAE793A.pdf","4,601 KB","008600 - USAID.

"Evaluates irrigation and integrated rural development project in Lam Nam Oon in northeast Thailand.  Special joint evaluation covers the period 1/78-8/81 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with staff, beneficiaries, and Royal Thai Government (RTG) officials. The project is beset by serious economic, physical, and management problems.  It will not produce sufficient return on investment to cover costs; even if the $50 million ""sunk cost"" is excluded from calculations, returns will be inadequate unless lower-cost methods of on-farm water development are used in the future.  The project's physical problems, such as deteriorated canal linings and eroded side slopes, are the result of poor design, inadequate construction, and lack of resources for proper maintenance or failure to use these resources effectively.  If the system is not improved, it will not be able to deliver a sufficient water supply to an expanded number of farmers.  In addition, a large-scale, extremely costly land clearing and leveling technique which is detrimental to the area's thin topsoil is in use, although alternative techniques are available. Managerial deficiencies - e.g., poor intra- and interagency coordination, failure to help project staff to enlist farmer participation in irrigation system construction and maintenance - appear to result primarily from inadequate management information systems and ineffective organizational arrangements. Nonetheless, it should be noted that the project's integrated approach has engendered an unprecedented level of cooperation among RTG agencies. The project has had some positive results.  A groundnut price support program has led to production of the crop by 2,000 farmers.  Also, the majority of farmers with access to reliable irrigation did cultivate at least part of their land during the past dry season. Although RTG officials are aware of the project's problems - many are shared with other irrigation sites in the northeast - no systematic approach to dealing with them has been taken. Included are several recommendations, six of which are considered essential to project continuation.","Loan no. 493-T-020","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","8/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Integrated rural development|Irrigated farming|On farm water management|Water supply structure maintenance|Irrigation system construction|Beneficiary interviews","Thailand","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDCAD653.pdf","3,808 KB","008613 - USAID.

"This report evaluates the performance of three organizations (the Southeast Consortium for International Development, Roy Littlejohn, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture) contracted to provide programming services for A.I.D. participants. This study evaluates their working relations with the Office of International Training (OIT) in addition to their administrative procedures and management practices.  The contractor undertook a document review, interviewed AID/OIT and contractor staff, made site visits to 24 training institutions, and interviewed 183 participants and 70 university staff members.  This is a very thorough evaluation, containing many concrete recommendations in the areas of training design, selection and placement, pre-departure preparation, English language training, orientation, and support services.  This evaluation also recommended that OIT contract one organization to manage the training program to facilitate monitoring and management.

"PACR of a program grant (6/78-1981) to help the Government of Botswana cover foreign exchange shortfalls and carry forward planned or ongoing economic development projects.  The grant was provided at a time when Botswana was experiencing border incursions from Rhodesia, forcing the reallocation of funds from development purposes to security. The grant generated local currency to partially fund 10 development projects in the education, health, agriculture, transport, and rural development sectors.  It is likely that these projects would have been cancelled or postponed without the grant funding, which was provided quickly and used with great flexibility.  Although the grant seems justified from a financial perspective, some activities did not closely conform to A.I.D.'s long-term country assistance plan for Botswana. Contributions may have been more effective if A.I.D. had been more involved in activity selection as was done in the Zimbabwe program grants of FY80 and FY81.  As it was, USAID/B has not encouraged publicity concerning A.I.D.'s role in financing certain activities under the program grant.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Nonproject assistance|Foreign exchange","Botswana","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAY937.pdf","844 KB","008516 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to improve sericulture techniques and raise farmer income in northeast Thailand.  Special evaluation covers the period 9/8/76-2/24/81 and is based on site interviews with USAID/I and Royal Thai Government (RTG) personnel and project beneficiaries. Although the project has improved basic infrastructure and exposed farmersto modern sericulture techniques, it is 3 years behind schedule and no output targets are expected to be fully achieved.  Stagnant or falling incomes in some settlements have offset the large increases in other areas for an average far short of the goal of a 50% income increase.  Only 542 of 1,500 targetted families are participating and silk cocoon production is 21.8% below target. Poor project design and lack of cooperation among the Public Welfare Department (PWD), the Bank of Agricultural Cooperatives (BAC), and the Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives (MAC) have been the chief problems.  Farm cooperatives to provide short-term credit, equipment rental, staff, and markets have not been established.  Poorly trained supervisors and extensionists have been unable to recruit a sufficient number of capable farmers or communicate new techniques.  Mulberry leaf and hybrid silkworm supplies have been unreliable and credit recovery has progressively worsened. It is recommended that:  (1) the project be extended 3 years to compensate for past delays and that the number of targetted beneficiaries be reduced from 1,500 to 1,000; (2) new supervisors and extensionists be trained to offset the current 20% turnover rate and that the current group receive refresher training; (3) only families with two surplus laborers be recruited and that comprehensive training be given during the dry season but only to responsible family members -- not children; (4) a permanent sericulture officer be assigned and regular demonstrations be held in each settlement; (5) PWD, BAC, and MAC form project implementation review and inspection teams to conduct monthly tours of all settlements; (6) PWD establish a revolving credit fund and assist farmers to borrow from BAC to assure timely availability of short-term credit; and (7) indepth studies be conducted on silkworm egg supplies and sericulture marketing and management.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","4/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Sericulture|Farm income|Agricultural land settlement","Thailand","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABN504.pdf","6,456 KB","","","002985 - Thailand.

"Evaluates Kenyan subproject (SP) of a project to provide managerial and technical training crucial to African socioeconomic development. Evaluation covers the period 10/76-9/81 and is based on document review and interviews with trainees and supervisors by an A.I.D./Government of Kenya (GOK) team. Strengths in the SP have outweighed weaknesses and helped to improve GOK operations.  Although the absence of a trainee roster impeded SP review, 52 trainees (including only five women) were identified -- 22 long-term, degree trainees (e.g., in agronomy and computer science) and 30 short-term trainees (e.g., in labor statistics and shelter). Despite good USAID/GOK collaboration, a systematic trainee selection system was not developed.  As a result, demand for the relatively few openings was excessive and not matched to the GOK's (poorly defined) manpower needs. Participants and supervisors felt the training was consonant with trainees' backgrounds; high quality; and, especially for short-term training, had a positive impact on job performance and procedures. The team commended the cross-national makeup of classes and the organization, planning, and presentation of the programs, but felt that short courses were too intensive, that professors emphasized theory and were unfamiliar with LDC problems, that in-country orientation was inadequate, and that allowances were insufficient. Almost all trainees returned to their former jobs, but only half expected to remain in the same organization more than 3 years, loss of computer specialists being especially problematic. Although favoring continuation of the SP, the team recommends that: (1) a detailed trainee roster be kept; (2) women's limited participation and the loss of computer specialists be studied; (3) the GOK develop a reporting process to better indicate its manpower needs; (4) A.I.D. reassess the adequacy of trainee allowances and reorient computer training to better suit GOK needs; (5) greater attention be given to pre-departure orientation and post-training follow-up; (6) training costs be analyzed in detail; and (7) potential Kenyan trainee counterparts/replacements be identified to increase the multiplier effect of the SP.","'DPM/USAID'|Evaluation period: Oct 1976-Sep 1981|Attached to: PD-AAJ-341","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","6/1/1981 12:00:00 AM","","Graduate education|Participants|Management training|Technicians|Mid level managers|Education for development|Labor policy|Labor planning|Labor surveys|Development project management|Public administration|Computers|Technical training|Civil service|Vocational training|Institution building|Personnel development|Beneficiary count|Beneficiary interviews","Kenya","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAJ341A.pdf","2,624 KB","012873 - Kenya.
