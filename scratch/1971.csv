"ALTHOUGH TITLE II AID IS LARGE, IT ONLY TEMPORARILY RELIEVES A SMALL FRACTION OF THE MALNUTRITION PROBLEM. CURRENT EFFORTS TOUCH NO MORE THAN A THIRD TO A FIFTH OF THE MOTHERS AND CHILDREN IN NEED OF DIETARY IMPROVEMENT. EVEN THESE FEEDING EFFORTS ARE NOT ALWAYS CONTINUOUS FOR THE INDIVIDUALS CONCERNED. ONLY LIMITED GAINS ARE BEING REALIZED IN TEACHING ABOUT FOODS AND NUTRITION. THE MALNUTRITION PROBLEM JUSTIFIES A PROGRAM LARGER THAN THE PRESENT ONE. HOWEVER, US DONATIONS HAVE BEEN CHECKED BY THE FAILURE OF THE GOVERNMENT AND PRIVATE GROUPS IN EL SALVADOR TO PROVIDE THE FINANCIAL AND HUMAN RESOURCES NEEDED TO DISTRIBUTE MORE COMMODITIES. THE PHYSICAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE PIPELINE NOW FUNCTIONS WELL. PROCEDURES FOR THE CONTINUOUS MEASUREMENT OF PROGRESS IN OVERCOMING MALNUTRITION -- THE RELATING OF INPUTS TO OUTPUTS -- ARE LACKING AND ARE RECOMMENDED. TO DATE, US GOVERNMENT EFFORTS TO ASSIST ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN EL SALVADOR DO NOT SEEM TO HAVE STRESSED SUFFICIENTLY THE NEED FOR A STRONG COMMITMENT TO OVERCOMING MALNUTRITION. THE EVALUATORS RECOMMEND CHANGES IN PROGRAM EMPHASIS AND DESIGN, IMPROVED PROGRAM COORDINATION AND CONTROL, AND COMMODITY STORAGE.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/LA-650","","7/1/1971 12:00:00 AM","","Food for Peace|FOOD FOR WORK|NUTRITION|Maternal child health care|School feeding programs|Community development|Nutrition education|FOOD STORAGE","El Salvador","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAR996.pdf","10,054 KB","000833 - Robert R.

"THE EVALUATION, WHICH IS BASED ON ESMAN'S ""INSTITUTION BUILDING FRAMEWORK,"" DISCUSSED THE UNIVERSIDAD NACIONAL AGRARIA (UNA), THE DIRECCION GENERAL DE INVESTIGACIONES AGRO-PECUARIAS (DGIA), THE DIRECCION GENERAL DE PROMOCION AGROPECUARIA (DGPA), AND PROJECTS RELATED TO THE NATIONAL FOOD COMMODITY PROGRAMS. OF THE THREE INSTITUTIONS, UNA HAS ADVANCED FURTHEST TOWARD THE INSTITUTIONAL GOALS IT SET FOR ITSELF. THIS IS BECAUSE IT IS AUTONOMOUS, ITS LEADERS AND STAFF HAVE HAD A CLEAR IDEA OF THE DEVELOPMENT GOALS THEY WISHED TO REACH, AND DURING THE FORMATIVE YEARS THEY WERE ABLE TO ASSEMBLE THE RESOURCES TO DO THE JOB. THE DGIA IS LESS ADVANCED IN INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT THAN THE UNA. THE BASIC PROBLEM IS THAT THE DGIA HAS TECHNICAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR A LARGE DECENTRALIZED NATIONAL AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH PROGRAM. THE DGPA IS THE LARGEST OF THE THREE INSTITUTIONS AND HAS DIVERSE RESPONSIBILITIES. ITS INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT HAS BEEN SOMEWHAT LESS THAN IN THE DGIA AND UNA. THE EVALUATORS MADE RECOMMENDATIONS THROUGHOUT THE TEXT INCLUDING: (1)THE PRESENT COLLABORATION IN NATIONAL FOOD COMMODITY PROGRAMS OF THE MINISTRY OF AGRICULTURE AS A MEDIUM FOR INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT SHOULD BE CARRIED FORWARD IN A WAY THAT FULLY RECOGNIZES THE STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT OF EACH PROJECT; AND (2)LINKAGES BETWEEN REGIONAL INSTITUTIONS AND THE DGIA, DGPA, AND UNA SHOULD BE FOSTERED.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","7/1/1971 12:00:00 AM","","Institution building|Agricultural research|Agricultural extension|Agricultural education|Potatoes|BEANS|RICE|Forage crops|Animal nutrition","Peru","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAB373A1.pdf","3,698 KB","000890 - North Carolina State University","","","English","application/pdf","","","","","1 Jul 1971","","","","PRELIMINARY REPORT OF THE SELF-EVALUATION BY THE NORTH CAROLINA STATE UNIVERSITY AID MISSION TO PERU","","PD-AAB-373-A1","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc0MDY0","Peru","5270060"
"AT A MEETING OF GROUPS INVOLVED WITH THE PROJECT, THE 1971 PACKAGE FOR RICE WAS CONFIRMED BUT SUBSTANTIAL CHANGES IN THE MAIZE PACKAGE WERE RECOMMENDED. MOST COOPERATING RICE FARMERS HAVE SUCCEEDED IN DOUBLING OR TRIPLING YIELDS; THERE IS NO COMPARABLE DATA FOR MAIZE FARMERS. RECOMMENDED RICE PRACTICES SHOULD BE DISSEMINATED AS WIDELY AS POSSIBLE; HOWEVER, LARGE-SCALE DISSEMINATION OF THE MAIZE PACKAGE IS NOT RECOMMENDED. DISCUSSION OF THE PROJECT IMPACT, WHICH FOLLOWS, IS TENTATIVE, PENDING THE UNIVERSITY OF IFE SURVEY RESULTS. (1)EXTENSION EFFORT AND SUCCESS WERE STRONGER WITH RICE THAN WITH MAIZE. (2)THE AGRICULTURAL AND INDUSTRIAL INVESTMENT CORPORATION WANTS TO LAUNCH A RICE-MAIZE CREDIT PROGRAM. (3)MOST RICE FARMERS USED FERTILIZER WHERE IT WAS RECOMMENDED; FERTILIZER WAS NOT WIDELY AVAILABLE TO MAIZE COOPERATORS. THE SUPPLY FOR THE 1972 GROWING SEASON WILL BE ADEQUATE IF DISTRIBUTION PROBLEMS CAN BE SOLVED. (4)IMPROVED SEED WAS IN SHORT SUPPLY FOR THE 1971 GROWING SEASON. ADEQUATE IMPROVED SEED WILL BE AVAILABLE TO MEET ANTICIPATED 1972 DEMAND. (5) MECHANIZED SERVICES WERE NOT DELIVERED ON SCHEDULE. (6)THE PROJECT HAS DEALT ONLY INDIRECTLY WITH STORAGE AND MARKETING PROBLEMS.

THE PROGRAMS' ORGANIZATION AND STRUCTURE; RELATIONS WITH COMMUNITY, INDUSTRY, AND GOVERNMENT; QUALITY OF INSTRUCTION; PROJECTIONS; AND OTHER MATTERS ARE DISCUSSED. THE LAGOS OIC BOARD HAS MADE MUCH PROGRESS IN SECURING THE SUPPORT OF COMMUNITY, INDUSTRY AND GOVERNMENT. THE BOARD NEEDS ADDITIONAL HELP TO EXTEND ITS ACTIVITIES, PRIMARILY WITH INDUSTRY AND GOVERNMENT, IN ORDER TO ESTABLISH A BROADER BASE FOR CONTINUING SUPPORT FROM THESE SOURCES. GHANA GOVERNMENT ECONOMIC POLICIES HAVE CREATED A FIXED LABOR MARKET IN THE ACCRA-TEMA AREA WITH LITTLE JOB TURNOVER AND THUS, LIMITED HIRING. THESE POLICIES LIMIT THE NUMBER OF SKILLED TRAINEES WHO CAN BE PLACED IN ENTRY LEVEL JOBS IN THE ACCRA-TEMA AREA. THERE IS, HOWEVER, GOVERNMENT AND BUSINESS INTEREST AND SUPPORT IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF SMALL SERVICE AND MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY OUTSIDE THE MAJOR METROPOLITAN AREAS.

"THE EVALUATOR RATED THIS PROJECT IN THE TOP 10% OF SIMILAR PROJECTS WITH WHICH HE IS FAMILIAR. THE VETERINARY CURRICULUM SHOULD BE MODIFIED TO MAXIMIZE RELEVANCY. TEACHING TIME IN THE FOLLOWING SUBJECTS SHOULD BE INCREASED: ANIMAL HUSBANDRY, PREVENTIVE VETERINARY MEDICINE, EPIDEMIOLOGY, SOCIOLOGY, AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS, STATISTICS, AND GRASSLAND FARMING. THERE IS A NEED FOR A CLOSER LIAISON BETWEEN THE VETERINARY ACADEMIC COMMUNITY AND OFF-CAMPUS ANIMAL AGRICULTURE PROFESSIONALS. THIS COULD BEST BE ACHIEVED BY SELECTING A VETERINARY FACULTY LIAISON OFFICER. THE DEVELOPMENT OF CLOSER ACADEMIC TIES WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF VETERINARY SCIENCE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF IBADAN IS RECOMMENDED. SUCH THINGS AS STUDENT AND FACULTY EXCHANGE PROGRAMS, MEETINGS BETWEEN ADMINISTRATIVE STAFFS IN VETERINARY EDUCATION AND INTRAFACULTY SEMINARS ARE SUGGESTED. THE EVALUATOR SUPPORTS CONTINUATION OF THE PROJECT AND ADHERENCE TO THE PROGRAMMED PHASE III BUILDING PROJECT TO EXPAND VETERINARY PHYSICAL PLANT FACILITIES AND SUPPLY EQUIPMENT. THERE IS A NEED TO STRENGTHEN NATIONAL COORDIANTION OF ANIMAL PRODUCTION AND HEALTH ACTIVITIES. DUPLICATION AND REPETITION OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH IS EVIDENT IN SOME PROJECTS.

"THIS EVALUATION CONSISTED OF THREE PARTS: (1)INTERVIEWS; (2)A MAIL QUESTIONNAIRE; AND (3)VISITS TO SEVEN COUNTRIES. RESPONSES FROM THE MAIL SURVEY AND INTERVIEWS YIELD THE CONCLUSION THAT ATTITUDINAL AND COGNITIVE IMPACTS WERE ACHIEVED FOR APPROXIMATELY 75% OF THE PARTICIPANTS. MAIL RETURNS INDICATED THAT 67% OF THE PARTICIPANTS ACTED ON THE INFORMATION AND INSIGHTS THEY RECEIVED. WRITTEN AND INTERVIEW DATA SHOW THAT THE ACTIONS RANGED FROM SIMPLY ADVOCATING NUTRITION CONCEPTS AMONG COLLEAGUES THROUGH TEACHING COURSES AND CHANGING PERSONAL PRACTICES TO PREPARING NATIONAL PLANS AND NEW PROGRAMS. ALTHOUGH IT IS RARELY POSSIBLE TO ATTRIBUTE ORGANIZATIONAL AND NATIONAL IMPACT TO AN INDIVIDUAL OR TO A BRIEF FACET OF THEIR EXPERIENCE, IT WAS CLEAR THAT IN SOME CASES THE WORKSHOPS MADE A SUBSTANTIAL DIFFERENCE TO CRITICAL INDIVIDUALS AND IN OTHER CASES THEY REINFORCED OTHER EXPERIENCES AND PRESSURES TO WHICH PARTICIPANTS HAD BEEN EXPOSED. IN SPITE OF THE INDICATIONS OF IMPACT, MOST PARTICIPANTS FELT THAT EVEN MORE COULD HAVE BEEN GAINED. THEY FELT THAT THE HIGHLY STRUCTURED AND LARGELY THEORETICAL NATURE OF THE WORKSHOP SHOULD BE CHANGED AND THEY INDICATED THAT MORE BENEFIT WOULD HAVE BEEN DERIVED IF A VARIETY OF LEARNING TECHNIQUES HAD BEEN USED. IN SUMARRY, WHAT EMERGED FROM THE MAIL SURVEY AND COUNTRY VISITS IS A SENSE THAT THE TIME HAS COME FOR A COMPREHENSIVE, SYSTEMS-ORIENTED APPROACH TO THE PLANNING OF NUTRITION TRAINING.

"Evaluates the Graduate Economics Training Program (PGTE) at the Federal University of Pernambuco as of 8/71.  PGTE was created to meet the demand for trained economists in northeast Brazil.  The study evaluates the present stage of PGTE's development based on a one-day visit to PGTE and discussions with Ford Foundation and USAID personnel. 24 students are presently enrolled in PGTE.  PGTE's master degree program began in l967. Only within FY 70, however, has the program developed to a level at which it can justifiably grant MA degrees to a regular graduation class (only one MA has been awarded to date).  PGTE is in a position today to issue a quality master degree primarily due to the efforts of Fuenzalida, the Vanderbilt professor financed by USAID. The rest of the faculty is capable and dedicated, but still young and inexperienced, both academically and administratively. The quality of the courses appears to be high and comparable to graduate courses in the US.  The curriculum could, however, be improved by adding at least one more required course in basic theory to the core curriculum, and by expanding the variety and number of optional courses. A strong curriculum in agricultural economics also needs to be developed. This can be accomplished through the proposed consortium with the Universidade Rural in Pernambuco, and with an additional visiting professor in agricultural economics. The most important barrier to continued improvement in PGTE is the absence of qualified leadership within the Brazilian faculty to replace Fuenzalida.  USAID should support Fuenzalida and 2 additional professors for another 2 years in hopes that, by that time, one of the Brazilians could take over. The PGTE faculty is now conducting contract research for such institutions as IPEA, CONDEPE, and SUDENE.  The quality of the research is good and additional contracts are contemplated.  PGTE is also interested in conducting research for USAID in the future in the the areas of income distribution and employment.  Overhead income for the research provides an important source of revenue for PGTE.","Evaluation period: Through 31 Aug 1971","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","8/1/1971 12:00:00 AM","","Universities and colleges|Economics education|Limited data","Brazil","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAA290A1.pdf","1,466 KB","008517 - USAID.

"Evaluates usefulness of the Workshop on Agricultural College & Univ Development that was held from July 27 to Aug 8, 1969, based on a 13 question questionnaire that dealt with participants' impressions, workshop approach, presentatn of mtrls, usefulness to participants & suggestns for the future. Workshop gave good exposure to theoretical concepts & practical aspects of instit bldg.  Six approaches to presenting subject matter were used, of which presentatn of instit bldg models & concepts, case studies of instit bldg projects, and formal discussion of issues related to instit devel were most effective.  According to participants, the hyptothetical country problem, ""Escondido,"" was useful, but case studies of actual countries would be more useful.  Teaching methods received varied responses.  Panel presentatn was judged the most effective. Foreign participants thought group discussns were more effective than did US participants. Knowledge gained was useful in participants' professionl work, especially for foreigners, because they could apply their knowledge to their own countries.  Participants identified ways in which rsrch coordination, linkages, leadership & internal structure concepts have been used in their work.  55% of the participants liked the ""mix"" of theoretical with applied subject matter.  Any future change should be in the direction of applied materials.  Adequate time to discuss the range of instit devel problems was provided.  A list of ""areas believed inadequately approached"" includes Sociological & Psychological aspects of modernization, Financing & efficient allocation of limited resources, continuity from one political generation to another, internal structure change in established institutions, and campus planning. Additional workshops recommended be held abroad as well as in US. University administrators from US and abroad, USAID officers and other technical assistance personnel, LDC government leaders, representatives from foundations, and bilateral and multilateral development assistance orgs would benefit from such a workshop.

"Evaluates project to improve industrial management and marketing practices in Uruguay.  No evaluation methodology is specified. Four subprojects involving the Faculty of Economics, the Interministerial Commission for Economic Development (CIDE), the Institute for the Development of Business Management (IDDE), and the Coordinating Commission for Economic Development (COMCORDE) were implemented under this project.  As part of the Faculty of Economics subproject, nine students were granted scholarships for academic degree training in public/business administration at the University of Chile. In addition, three professors from the University of Chile were recruited to conduct management courses at the Faculty of Economics. Also, grants were given to Uruguayan professors at the Faculty of Economics to attend a management development course in Pittsburgh and a management program in Lima.  CIDE personnel received grants to attend the International Marketing Institute and a course on management of industrial enterprises at Syracuse University.  USAID also financed a CIDE feasibility study concerning the establishment of a private development bank. The purpose of the IDDE subproject was to assist in developing modern administration and management techniques.  Numerous activities were carried out under this subproject. Examples include a two-day seminar on modern marketing principles and practices; courses on production planning and control, market research, and financial administration and analysis; and 700 hours of courses in management and administration by 60 experts from the Institute of Businesss Management of Argentina.  Under the COMCORDE subproject, a total of 15 studies were conducted on problems and special interests relating to the national economy.  USAID financial contribution to the overall project totalled $181,000.  All the planned projects have been completed, with the exception of some minor activities by COMCORDE.

"Evaluates project to upgrade the quality of agriculture and trade and industry vocational education in Thailand through an IBRD Loan for Improvement of Vocational Education (LIVE).  Evaluation, an incoming airgram dated 3/10/71, reports USOM/T's reply to a request by the Ministry of Education (MOE) to provide three consultants to evaluate LIVE's effectiveness and to design management data for forward planning. USOM felt that the study must be done by Thai's to be effective and agreed to provide one highly qualified consultant to work with a group of Thai specialists for up to 90 days.  The study will assess the relevance of existing LIVE objectives and goals, staff and participant selection, the adequacy of Royal Thai Government (RTG) financial support, school construction, equipment, record keeping and reporting procedures, adherence to IBRD administrative requirements, cost/benefit analysis, manpower demands, and the project plan. The study will be published as a report in both Thai and English.  An evaluation system will also be designed whereby the MOE can continually monitor the program's effectiveness. The U.S. consultant must be a person of maturity and status, with a strong background in vocational education and survey-research system design.  MOE educators should have expertise in educational planning, educational finance, vocational education curriculum development, economics of education, vocational education and administration, school architecture and construction, and manpower planning data analysis. Adequate secretarial/clerical help and a full-time Thai coordinator should be available to work with the U.S. consultant.  The RTG will provide office space, equipment, and supplies, while the Trust Fund account will pay for local transportation and per diem for the U.S. consultant.  Funds will be made available for printing and distributing the final report. USOM/T recommends that AID/W begin recruiting consultants, for either a personal services contract or on a short-term direct hire consultant basis, as soon as possible.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","3/1/1971 12:00:00 AM","","Curriculum design|Vocational training|Evaluation|Educational delivery|Institution building|Agricultural education|Indigenous education|Educational planning|Educational policy|National level|Limited data","Thailand","","","008613 - USAID.
