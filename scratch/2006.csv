"In support of its strategic objective of a quality basic education provided to a larger percentage of Guinean children with an emphasis on girls and rural children, the United States Agency for International Development established the following intermediate results: (1) improved sectoral strategic planning, management, and decision-making in basic education; (2) improved instruction in basic education; (3) improved community participation in basic education; and (4) improved gender and rural/urban equity in basic education. USAID/Guinea has invested 57 million dollars for the implementation of its strategy for the current planning cycle (1997-2006). At the beginning of this period, access to primary education had already begun to rapidly increase, but instruction was marked by low quality levels and a weak capacity for system-wide planning. USAID's interventions since 1997 have been of two major types. The first involved collaboration with ministry counterparts for improving planning and instruction. The second has been the reinforcement of communities' capacity to participate in the life of the school. These interventions have all had a positive and promising impact, albeit a fragile one. Detailed evaluations of the interventions and the lessons learned from them are presented.

"Project implementation at mid-term is generally on-track, with the most important targets being met. However, results have varied among components, with cluster activities generally making good progress, but with general business support activities falling behind some targets, particularly for business associations. The project is ahead of target on five overall indicators including: (1) total sales among targeted enterprises; (2) increased capital investment among targeted firms (from end 2004 through March 2006); (3) labor productivity among targeted firms; (4) the number of registered firms; (5) and the number of associations employing volunteer staff. However, the project is behind target on other indicators: (1) the number of full-time jobs created in targeted clusters (close to meeting target); (2) the increased financing among targeted enterprises; (3) exports as a percentage of imports; (4) the number of business associations with strategic plans; and (5) percentage of non-donor revenue generated by associations.
