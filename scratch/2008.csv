"The Global Development Alliance (GDA) office of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) commissioned DAI to undertake this evaluation design work to: (1) suggest a framework for the future evaluation of the GDA model and the diverse alliances it has produced; (2) inform GDA strategy and workplans; (3) develop new tools and improved training for more effective alliance building and implementation; and (4) identify ways to help Missions build more and better alliances with improved scale and impact.  Findings are organized into sections on the GDA model itself, current practice on evaluation and metrics, roles and responsibilities in alliance implementation, learning and knowledge development, and communication.  Each topic is discussed and then accompanied by specific recommendations about how findings might be translated into policy and practice.  (Author abstract, modified)","Task order no.

"This report summarizes the results of a one-year evaluation of the impact on job creation of United States Government (USG) economic growth programs from 1991 to 2006 in countries that received assistance through Support for East European Democracy (SEED) and the Freedom Support Act (FSA).  This investigation was sponsored by USAID and conducted by the Melikian Center for Russian, Eurasian, and East European Studies at Arizona State University (ASU), in cooperation with Higher Education for Development (HED). The report has two halves, one theoretical and one applied.  The theoretical half includes a sketch of USG economic growth efforts in the region (Section I), a discussion of the definition and measurement of job creation (Section II), and an overview of the literature on economic assistance and employment growth in transitioning economies (Section III). The applied half of the report describes attempts to quantify the impact of USG assistance using macroeconomic data, project reports, and field surveys.  Section IV presents a method for producing baseline estimates of the impact of USG assistance using macroeconomic data and USG expenditure data.  Section V discusses the difficulty of attempting to derive quantitative estimates of job creation from project reports, outlines an alternative methodology based on field studies, and summarizes the results of implementing that methodology in three test countries: Bulgaria, Macedonia, and Kyrgyzstan. Following the body of the report are appendices containing expanded, stand-alone discussions of the development of labor markets in transition economies (Appendix A), job creation and its measurement (Appendix B), and the role of microfinance in the development of transition-economy labor markets (Appendix F).  Appendices C, D, and E provide background material and details on techniques and analyses discussed in the report.

"The goal of this mid-term evaluation is to identify strengths and weaknesses to inform the future direction of services provided by the Partnership Project (see Appendix A: Scope of Work).  USAID/Zimbabwe asked the evaluation team to assess emerging impact, review the continuing relevance of project objectives, and if necessary suggest amendments to the program.  It will be used by USAID, DFID, and the project to determine the course of the project through 2010 in terms of: (1) whether or not the project is on target to achieve its goals as stated in the contract; (2) strengths and weaknesses within the project portfolio; (3) areas and activities that warrant continued investment, and untried initiatives and approaches that would likely improve access to and use and quality of HIV/AIDS products and services; (4) recommendations for mitigating weaknesses; and (5) recommendations for improving administration, coordination, and implementation of the project.

"This report is an external evaluation of the Poverty Reduction Alleviation (PRA) Activity that was established under USAID/Peru Strategic Objective Number II, Increased Incomes of the Poor, as an outgrowth of the 1994 USAID/Peru Food Security Strategy.  The Strategic Objective determined that food insecurity is principally a question of poverty, that poverty is concentrated in corridors where people have limited access to markets, and that low-labor productivity reflects inadequate investment in human and material capital as well as poorly developed public policies and institutions. Consequently, USAID/Peru adopted an approach to link poverty-stricken rural areas (economic corridors) to markets in cities in Peru and abroad.  PRA began in September 1998 with an agreement between USAID and the Confederaci�n Nacional de Instituciones Empresariales (CONFIEP), an institution representing private sector companies.  CONFIEP was to apply a private business focus to optimize resource use in the economic corridors to reduce poverty through employment generation.  The design expected that private businesses would implement creative market mechanisms to purchase inputs from the economic corridors.  They would be supported by project established Economic Service Centers that were located in the economic corridors.  It was expected that the business associates of CONFIEP would become the buyers. Implementation of PRA by CONFIEP did not meet expectations.  In April 2002 USAID asked Chemonics to become the full implementing institution. Chemonics was already providing technical advice, international consultants and monitoring and evaluation services to this project. This evaluation provides quantitative and qualitative analysis of the direct and indirect impact, cost effectiveness, and strengths and weaknesses of PRA-supported activities and operations.  Five key areas were evaluated: (1) Direct and indirect impacts; (2) the role of Economic Service Centers (ESC); (3) the relationship between PRA and Alternative Development (AD, implemented by a project known as PDA); (4) the level of assistance to agriculture versus manufacturing and services sectors; and (5) operational issues.

"The purpose of the USAID CAFTA-DR Environmental Cooperation Program is to build the capacity of the six CAFTA-DR countries (Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua) to comply with the environmental provisions of the ECA and to promote cooperation in environmental matters.  USAID is carrying out activities in four areas: institutional strengthening for implementation and enforcement of environmental laws, biodiversity conservation, market-based conservation, and private sector environmental performance. This report assesses the design and implementation of ongoing and planned activities managed by USAID to build the capacity of institutions in signatory countries of the CAFTA-DR to comply with environmental provisions of the agreement and strengthen environmental protection as it relates to trade.  The purpose of the assessment is to provide constructive guidance on implementing existing activities and provide information to inform the programming of FY 08 and FY 09 resources.  The assessment presents what CAFTA-DR countries need to build their institutional capacity in order to comply with environmental provisions; identifies opportunities to complement the work of other donors; and recommends ways to improve the program.

"The USAID Anosy Alliance played a coordination role for USAID financed programs in order to ensure their synergy and alignment and contribution to the implementation of the Anosy Regional Madagascar Action Plan.  The Alliance worked closely with the Anosy Region and three of its Technical Government Services (Regional Direction for Rural Development, Regional Direction for Health, Family Planning and Social Protection, and the Regional Direction for Environment, Water and Forests and Tourism) in order to reach the objectives for Commitments 4, 5, and 7 of the MAP.  The USAID Alliance used annual planning, regular meetings and results monitoring by Commitment to facilitate the coordination, implementation, and dissemination of results among USAID programs and the Government.  After serving as an example of regional coordination for several years the USAID Alliance will now need to adapt its role as the Anosy Region takes on the regional coordination of development actions.  The USAID Anosy Alliance should adapt its role to one of coordination support to the Region as well as internal coordination of USAID implementing partners programs.  In order to truly achieve USAID's NHWP strategy in the Region and improve the efficiency of regional coordination, USAID should carry out preliminary spatial and programmatic planning at the regional level with all the USAID partners, other key regional actors and the Government to ensure the coordination of objectives, methodologies and intervention zones before the finalization of the contracts for the USAID programs.
