"Final external evaluation of a project (12/88-10/92) to strengthen the capacity of the Government of Bangladesh to implement a food management system and to formulate food policies.  The project was implemented by the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI). Despite implementation inadequacies on IFPRI's part during the first 2 years, the project appears to be worthwhile and will in the long term benefit the people of Bangladesh.  IFPRI is now doing commendable work. It has published a number of field research studies.  Two in particular, ""Rice Price Stabilization"" and ""Optimal Public Food-Grain Stocks,"" are examples of valuable research for policymakers.  Most project research has been fairly extensive and has been carried out with professional vigor.  The data accumulated are more credible than comparable data generated by government agencies.  Research findings have affected important government policies concerning rural rationing, statutory rationing, stock policy, and procurement pricing and methods.  The project has both produced its own findings and reinforced previous findings of other organizations. However, the project has not been very effective in developing food targeting programs or in institution building (although Bangladesh's Food Planning and Monitoring Unit (FPMU) has been strengthened to some degree).  A number of courses on basic analysis and computer use were organized for staff and officials of various ministries and agencies, primarily FPMU.  This training was useful, but should have been continued.  Also, because of interventions of the various ministries, there were problems with the training selected.  The FPMU still lacks sufficient staff to analyze and interpret technical research reports or independently undertake policy studies.  Commodity support was limited to one personal computer supplied by IFPRI, as separate funds were allocated to FPMU for commodity support. Coordination between training and commodity support was lacking. It is recommended the project be extended, at least to 6/93, since it is now producing useful results.  Also, either the status of the FPMU should be upgraded (by the Bangladesh Government) or consultants should be hired to reinforce its policy analysis capacity.

"Evaluates cooperative agreement with the East-West Center on Population (EWCPOP) to increase the capacity of Asian countries to use demographic data in family planning (FP) policy development and program implementation.  The project involved four major types of activities (research, TA, training, and information dissemination) focusing on five programmatic themes: (1) FP program evaluation; (2) the unmet need for FP in Asia; (3) birth spacing and child survival; (4) contraceptive method choice and accessibility; and (5) population and the environment. Evaluation covers the period 8/88-2/93 vs. a PACD of 8/93. EWCPOP has substantially achieved the objectives of the cooperative agreement.  It has produced a significant volume of useful research studies which have had a policy/program impact in the Asia region. These studies met or exceeded the number of deliverables called for and addressed appropriate themes.  The research has been collaborative in nature and has been linked to effective TA and training/workshops, resulting in an increase in the capacity for such activity in the countries concerned. Dissemination activities, while generally good, have focused too much on activities in Hawaii and not sufficiently on field activities.  Also, evaluation activities have been rather sporadic and not always helpful. The original workplan and budget distribution could have been improved.  Planning, coordination, and implementation have all fallen on the same few staff persons, frequently subjecting them to nearly unmanageable workloads.  More input from technical staff would have made for an even more successful project.  A better workplan, integrating objectives, modalities, and resources would have been equally helpful. Given the success of the present agreement, A.I.D. should give serious thought to a new, revised, agreement with EWCPOP.  Such an agreement would have to clearly define strategic goals and present a detailed research agenda and an integrated workplan linking research, TA, training, and dissemination activities to the achievement of specific objectives.  These objectives should reflect EWCPOP's comparative advantage and should relate to the work of other A.I.D. contractors and grantees in the context of A.I.D.'s global mission.  The agreement must stress activities planned and conducted in the field; include a built-in evaluation plan; and devote greater attention to dissemination in the field using computer-based communication techniques as well as better targeted traditional print media.

"Evaluates the Maternal and Child Health-Family Planning (MCH-FP) Extension subproject (SP) of the Bangladesh FP Health Services project. Interim evaluation covers the period 1989-1992 and includes recommendations for the SP's third and final 5-year funding phase (1992-97). The SP, which is being implemented by the International Center for Diarrheal Disease Research, Bangladesh (ICDDR,B) and the Population Council, has had a major impact in testing and introducing programmatic interventions for improving the national FP program.  These interventions, conducted in collaboration with the Government of Bangladesh (GOB) have included:  recruitment of additional community-based field workers, improved implementation of satellite clinics, an improved client-based service statistics system, and home delivery of injectable contraceptives.  The SP has also drawn considerable attention to the success of the national FP program through extensive publication of scientific articles and through foreign visitors.  The SP's future potential is unquestioned and continued funding is highly recommended. Specific findings on SP research, intervention, and dissemination activities include the following.  (1) Though SP research designs are sound and findings have been useful, the research agenda has been heavily biased in favor of data from ICDDR,B's Matlab site, rather than the SP's own two field sites, and the research has been largely quantitative in nature.  (2) While many SP interventions that have been tested and replicated have significant implications for increased program costs, few have focused on, or directly tested, possible cost-saving activities such as the use of volunteers, depot holders, and improved method mix.  In the next phase, cost aspects should be a major factor in selecting and prioritizing proposed interventions.  Also, activities have been focused at the thana level or below, and as a result, cost-effectiveness and replicability remain to be demonstrated, More attention should be given to developing support among higher levels of the GOB and to coordination with other GOB and NGO activities.  (3) In-country dissemination of information about SP activities has been less than ideal and will require more attention; proposed activities include the exploration of alternative means of communication such as briefing meetings, workshops, and translation of SP information into Bangla. Some shortcomings are also evident with respect to the SP's structure and management.  The SP has not been guided by a strategic plan, and research and intervention agendas have often been based on the interests of individual staff.  The SP's management structure has fluctuated to fit these agendas, creating confusion among staff.  Also, while the SP has funded considerable long- and short-term training, staff who have been trained have not been moved into higher positions; the rationale for long-term training during the next phase is questionable. Finally, the proposed merger of the MCH-FP Extension and Urban Volunteers projects under a single cooperative agreement with ICDDR,B needs further consideration and planning before implementation.","Project title: Population technical assistance (POPTECH)","Special Evaluation","Documents","DPE-3024-Z-00-8078-00","","2/1/1993 12:00:00 AM","","Health outreach services|Family planning services|Maternal child health care|Family planning research","Bangladesh","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABF395.pdf","3,296 KB","006243 - Dual & Associates, Inc.|000673 - International Science and Technology Institute, Inc.

"The Africa Operations Research and Technical Assistance (OR/TA) Project, implemented by the Population Council (PC), continues A.I.D.'s two-decade commitment to OR in the field of family planning (FP) services.  Since its inception in 1988, the project has carried out more than 60 subprojects (SP's) in 16 countries, exceeding contract stipulations.  Overall, implementation has been of high quality.  SP's have had significant policy relevance for both national and international audiences. PC staff were resourceful in identifying SP opportunities and in responding to host country and USAID Mission interests and concerns.  In carrying out SP's, PC collaborated with public and private national and regional institutions, frequently including other A.I.D. cooperating agencies; collaboration with International Planned Parenthood Federation affiliates was particularly notable.  According to both USAID Missions and host country institutions, the TA provided by both core staff and resident advisors was timely, fully collaborative, and generally of high quality.  There were several SP's, however, that would have benefitted from more frequent and more intensive TA and supervision by PC staff. The project has successfully built on prior OR activities funded by A.I.D.'s Bureau for Research and Development, notably in adapting the PRICOR Thesaurus approach for service diagnostics in developing the situation analysis, and in capitalizing on groundwork laid in host countries by Columbia and Tulane Universities in previous OR contracts. The standardization of the situation analysis methodology is a significant contribution to helping program managers improve service delivery and the quality of care offered to clients.  SP results indicate that OR remains an important way to introduce and test the feasibility of various approaches to service delivery in new contexts, particularly with respect to integrated health programs and workplace-based programs. Overall, with about half the SP's completed, the project appears to be having a fairly impressive impact.  It has already begun to leave a legacy of qualitative change, documented in revised procedures, upgraded training, and different supervision strategies, in several countries. It is also likely that services will expand in several countries as a result of SP activities.  Finally, as a result primarily of training and TA, the project has begun to institutionalize OR capabilities in several countries.  The project has also had a broader impact on the field of family planning OR, mainly through the development or revision of materials and methodologies. This project has provided a number of insights on OR.  It has shown that situation analyses, which provide a comprehensive assessment of the functioning of FP subsystems, can help program managers improve service delivery and the quality of care.  It has also shown that OR is most successful when carried out as an iterative process of problem identification, solution testing, results assessment, modification, and retesting.  The project has also demonstrated that, while OR is extremely important in introducing new FP services in the face of opposition, it can be a more effective refining tool under conditions favorable to change.  Such conditions exist when:  (1) national programs are established with a comprehensive strategy, implementation plan, and institutional structure; (2) FP programs are dynamic and growing and actively looking for ways to expand and improve; (3) the institutional structure of the FP program permits effective utilization of results; and (4) donor financing and interest actively support implementation of alternative delivery approaches and improvements in established service delivery systems.

"PACR of a rural water and sanitation project (8/80-12/87) in Togo. The project's final evaluation, conducted in February 2/88, concluded that in terms of accomplishments the project was highly successful.  The 7-year project provided potable water to 864 villages with a total population of about 600,000.  The construction component completed 1,048 boreholes, capped 3 springs, and constructed 256 cisterns and 473 latrines.  This met or exceeded targets, except for latrines.  In each village that received a well, a Village Development Committee (VDC) was established and its members trained.  A slower than expected supply of some pumps resulted in some of the boreholes not being functional at the time of final evaluation. Training achievements are as follows:  8,400 health and community development agents trained; 2,000 government agents and 1,800 local workers trained in construction techniques; 10,000 VDC members trained; and 6,000 villagers trained in pump maintenance. A two-tiered system was used to recruit and train pump maintenance teams.  Two people were trained in each village to handle basic pump repairs, while regional technicians were responsible for major problems and periodic visits to each village.  At the time of final evaluation, the village maintenance teams were operating well, but there were not enough regional technicians to respond to problems with the pumps. The project placed considerable emphasis on the institutional development of Government of Togo's (GOT's) social affairs agencies and on VDC's to address the issue of sustainability. Sustainability was further emphasized through the project's commitment to working through existing government agencies and structures instead of creating separate project structures.  This emphasis was the key to the overall project success. On average, each field agent spent the equivalent of one year's time per village in establishing committees, supervising activities, and assuring follow-up activities over the life of the project.  Such a large commitment of time allocated to village contacts is necessary to ensure effective community development. About one-fourth of the total financial resources expended during this project were devoted to community development activities. This figure exceeded the commitment to health education and community development being made in comparable projects in other countries. However, the evaluation team concluded that this proportion was close to a desirable norm for rural water projects in general, given recent knowledge of the importance of community participation in water and sanitation projects.  Without such commitment to popular participation, both short-term and long-term goals will be threatened. Women are a key component of any rural water and health project and should be involved in all phases of the project activities. The concept of village responsibility for pump maintenance is viable and should be continued.  Villagers have demonstrated a willingness to pay for maintenance costs within reason; however they need to have all of the necessary tools and spare parts easily accessible.  There was insufficient support to the pump maintenance effort beyond the village level.  This support, in terms of more in-depth expertise and supply systems for spare parts, is essential for long-term viability. The sanitation component, consisting of latrine construction, is important to the total package, but project resources were insufficient to achieve desired results.  Unfortunately, the type of latrine promoted by the project, while hygienic and effective, was beyond the financial means of most villagers.

"PACR of a project (9/77-12/85) to construct a Family Health Center in Togo. Construction of the Center was delayed more than 2 years due to several factors including difficulties in finding an appropriate contractor, the decision to build the Center in the World Health Organization Regional Training Center compound (a different location than was originally planned), and the long negotiations with the Ministry of Health over the structure and function of the project. Construction was finally completed in 7/82.  Minor changes were made and construction deficiencies were corrected during the next 2 years.  Final payment was made to the construction contractors in 3/84. The Center was fully staffed with qualified training and administrative personnel, including three educational facilitators, (a nutritionist, a midwife, and a nurse), an administrative coordinator, and a technical coordinator.  By 7/83 the Center was fully equipped, and training courses began in 10/83.  Funding for training courses at the Center was provided through a separate grant, awarded to Family Planning International Assistance. In sum, the project successfully achieved its primary purpose of building the Togo Family Health Center, albeit 2 years later than planned.  In his final inspection of the Center, the REDSO/WA chief engineer described the Center as ""attractive, well coordinated to the existing buildings, and entirely appropriate in design.  It will serve the purpose for which it was intended."" The following lessons have been learned.  The project design and proposed inputs were not clearly understood by both parties to the agreement at the beginning of the project.  Issues pertaining to the use of the new facility were not clearly resolved before the project began, resulting in some confusion surrounding the Center's purpose. Construction plans were drafted before the facility's activities were theoretically designed.  Agreements on the use of the physical facilities among USAID, the GOT, and WHO should have been more clearly shared between all parties. Disagreements on use and design factors significantly delayed construction. Inadequate time was allowed for discussion between USAID and the host country on the project purpose and goals.  A substantial length of time was necessary even after the project agreement had been signed to reach consensus on a number of important issues, resulting in prolonged delays in project start-up.

"PACR of a project (8/83-8/88) to promote animal traction among small farmers. The project was highly successful.  Over 1,700 farmers were trained in the Kara and Savanes regions and 16 of 17 planned technical centers (CATs) have been established and are functional.  Project-trained ox-drawn units numbered over 800 and the goal of 806 farmers adopting plow and weed technologies was surpassed.  However, the number of farmers receiving credit for the purchase of draft animals through the national system only reached about half the goal of 800 recipients. Animal health services were provided through two annual programs to over 4,000 cattle; a structure has been put in place to continue these services after the PACD. Farmland under cultivation with animal traction increased by approximately 30%.  Returns based on net income from crop production rose by almost 40%, although the addition of animal traction costs reduces the number to 13%. The project fell short of its goals to establish adequate animal traction equipment parts supply and repair facilities on the local level. The following lessons were learned.  (1) Sufficient attention to the issue of collection procedures is important in the design of credit programs.  The credit component initially suffered due to an inadequate system resulting in low repayment rates.  (2) Extension activities performed on ""model farms"" were generally better attended than those held at the CATs.  Farmers related better to conditions found in fields similar to their own, rather than the demonstration fields at the centers.  (3) Private sector suppliers of animals and equipment should be brought into a project of this nature early on to ensure adequate development of the sector.  (4) Efficient procedures for the timely disbursement of project funds are essential to success.  (5) The add-on projects were difficult to manage and were unrelated to the project purpose. Upon completion of the project, a 2-year support grant was made to two host government agencies:  Project de la Promotion de la Traction Animale (PROPTA) and Projet Culture Attelee (PCA), based in Kara, upon completion of TAT.  Evaluation of this support found that PROPTA-supplied animals were far more expensive than those provided by the private sector and that PROPTA had not sold a team in over 3 years due to poor return on the investment; it was recommended therefore that no further support be given to this sector. The MAPS and Agribusiness assessments noted that Togo's agriculture sector is totally bogged down due to highly unfavorable policies and conditions (i.e., mismanaged government input and marketing monopolies, and poor communication and transportation links).

"PACR of a project (8/83-8/88) to strengthen the Togo National Credit Union Federation (FUCEC). The project was largely successful in supporting the development of the Togolese credit union movement.  Although it currently can be considered to be at a ""take-off"" point, it has been more successful in some areas than in others. Development of FUCEC's administrative and financial management systems may be the project's largest success.  Vast improvements have been made since project start-up -- currently, all active member credit unions produce monthly financial statements, including loan delinquency schedules.  In addition, internal manuals have been developed and all accounting systems are now computerized.  Some training still needs to occur in order for the office staff to become fully conversant with the new systems. The Central Liquidity Facility (CLF) achieved a rate of deposit significantly lower than projected, but now constitutes FUCEC's main financial system. Training of FUCEC field staff was conducted, with an emphasis on training of trainers. Representatives from individual credit unions received training in accounting, cooperative organization, office management, planning, and institutional analysis. Although training was relevant to FUCEC's work, more emphasis should have been placed on transfer of technical knowledge. Due to unforeseen legal and technical delays, the risk management program developed by the project was never instituted.  The director of the risk management section is fully trained and could implement the program if approved by the Government of Togo (GOT). Many of the project output targets were met or surpassed.  The number of active credit unions has increased from 72 to 119; credit union membership has grown from 6,214 to 15,137; credit union deposits have grown to $2,482,777; and outstanding loans have been valued at $2,054,670, 60% over the original target. FUCEC failed to achieve the projected self-sufficiency rate of 50% (only a 15-20% self-sufficiency rate was achieved). Two major recommendations which resulted from the final evaluation were not achieved by the project, but became CPs to the follow-on TRIPS project.  The first was for the GOT to formally issue a letter to FUCEC indicating approval of its risk management program.  The second was for the GOT to designate FUCEC as its agent in matters which concern financial and technical control of all the savings and loan cooperatives operating in Togolese territory. The following lessons were learned.  (1) Operational and management systems should be introduced in accordance with the personnel's ability to operate them.  Where possible, technical systems should be instituted in a step-by-step manner introducing the next step only when the previous has been mastered.  (2) Integrating grant resources received simultaneously from several donor organizations requires skillful, managerial attention. Objectives must be clearly stated to avoid the risk of having different approaches taken by the donors jeopardize project success.  (3) The willingness of management and supporting structures to take the necessary measures to progress at the programmed pace is vital to the success of a project.

"PACR of a project (1984-88) to increase agricultural production in Togo's Zio River region.  Specific objectives were to:  (1) develop and strengthen local farmer-producer organizations; (2) improve production and marketing techniques; (3) strengthen local agricultural institutions; (4) institutionalize credit education; (5) create or reinforce rural support infrastructure; and (6) improve productivity of the Zio River irrigated perimeter through collaboration with the Regional Office of Rural Development (DRDR). Most of the stated objectives were achieved.  Farmer-producer organizations were developed and strengthened through technical, credit, and training support via the project extension service. Production techniques were improved through the introduction and application of specific agricultural technical packages.  The rural support infrastructure was strengthened through training local extension agents and through the creation and training of farmer groups. The objective to strengthen local agricultural institutions' capacity to provide agricultural extension services was not met, however, largely because of Government of Togo (GOT) policies. Instead the project created its own multi-purpose extension operation providing services directly to farmers and rural entrepreneurs.  Also, collaboration with DRDR aimed at group promotion in the Zio River perimeter was never fully developed because of pronounced differences between the project's and DRDR's approach. The project surpassed four out of five planned outputs.  The project significantly exceeded the first target of providing credit and technical assistance to 2,000 individuals.  The Zio project assisted 887 individual clients and 1,854 non-clients who attended on-farm demonstrations.  Approximately 100 non-clients participated in rural enterprise development training sessions. Management and technical training was conducted with 793 farmers, surpassing the second target of 500 farmers. The project also exceeded the target of 20 producer groups with increased group management skills whose member incomes have been raised because of the organization.  Forty-six groups, including a marketing association of rice farmers, were assisted by the end of the project. Training and management assistance far surpassed the target level of 75 clients a year.  Approximately 930 agricultural clients, 50 rural enterprise clients, and some 300 non-clients in both sectors received training.  The final, unachieved target was a loan recovery rate of 90%. The following lessons were learned:  (1) The project design was overly ambitious.  The project was to work in three different sectors (rainfed, irrigated agriculture, and rural enterprises), introduce new technologies, provide skills training, and change attitudes and behaviors of rural farmers and entrepreneurs.  A more focused, less ambitious design may have been more effective at limiting project interventions and achieving measurable results in the targeted sectors. (2) The type of ""cradle to grave"" activities performed by the PVOs (Partnership for Productivity and CARE) in this project ultimately served to discourage the GOT from providing assistance to the region. (3) Language used in project design documents to define project objectives and purposes should remain consistent so that the end goals of the project are clear to the implementing agency. A 1992 project update notes the findings of the MAPS and Agribusiness assessments which indicate that Togo's agricultural sector is completely bogged down due to highly unfavorable policies and conditions (i.e., mismanaged government input and marketing monopolies and poor communication and transportation links). Another government policy almost ensures these types of projects never attain sustainability.  The GOT no longer provides extension/encadrement services in an area that is ""taken over"" by a donor or PVO, thereby committing them to remain in perpetuity if the project is to survive. For agriculture to graduate beyond the subsistence level in food crops and break-even level in cash crops, major policy reforms must be achieved.  The government must either provide affordable services from the profits it derives from the monopolies or end all interventions and encourage the private sector to take over these functions.  In order for the latter to happen major fiscal reforms must also be initiated.

"PACR of the African Economic Policy Reform Program/Cereals Export Liberalization Program (CELT) in Togo.  Report covers the period 1986-1990. CELT sought to achieve liberalization of the cereals market by encouraging the Government of Togo (GOT) to allow the private sector to export surplus produce.  To this end an export licensing system was established by a presidential decree on November 25, 1986.  By the end of the project, however, virtually no licenses had been issued to private traders for cereal exports.  The reasons for this include poor production of cereals, the licensing bodies' distrust of statistics predicting exportable surpluses, and the view held by some political leaders that the CELT program constituted a threat to food self sufficiency. A second objective of the CELT program was the use of local currency counterpart funds to alleviate some of the constraints to efficient marketing of cereals.  These funds were to be used to provide credit to cereal traders and producers to finance their activities, build storage facilities, and to improve roads to facilitate transportation of food crops to markets.  Release of each of the two tranches of $3.5 million to the GOT was dependent upon fulfillment of specific conditions precedent (CP). Presidential decree (86-21) was issued to meet the CPs to the disbursement of the first tranche of funds.  This decree liberalized and privatized food crop exports subject to the preservation of national food security.  The funds were transferred to the GOT on February 7, 1987, one week after the decree became effective.  Release of the second tranche of funds was delayed until November of 1989 when USAID was satisfied that the second set of CPs had been met.  The second set of CPs were established to ensure that the liberalizations that were decreed, in fact took place. Very little of the local currency funds were used for their intended purposes.  Most of the first tranche was lost in an embezzlement scandal involving CNCA, the financial intermediary where the funds were deposited.  By the end of the project, only about 7% of the second tranche had been used.  No credit was extended to traders and only 12 farmer groups received assistance in marketing and storing maize.  None of the funds were used to improve road conditions. A third objective was to provide technical support to the Bureau of Agricultural Statistics Services (DESA).  Specifically, the TA team improved the capacity of DESA to provide accurate forecasts of food production and consumption.  The purchase of several computer systems, and training provided to key DESA employees enabled a crop price and production forecasting model to be developed and refined during the course of the project.  Weekly crop price data was published in national newspapers beginning in March 1988.  In addition, the DESA published a review of 1989-90 food crop statistics, and 1989 food crop prices. Lessons learned include the following:  (1) sufficient dialogue with the host government should occur before programs are developed to ensure a unity of purpose and expected achievements; (2) before designing programs, a thorough socioeconomic analysis needs to be conducted in order to identify constraints to program success; (3) the imposition of a licensing system ultimately served to contradict the objective of reducing legal restrictions to export trade by creating another bureaucratic layer; (4) local currency funds should not be essential to program success.  Requiring counterpart funds greatly diminished the value of balance of payments support. An addendum to the PACR states that, as of 12/92, the GOT was persisting in its policy to control every aspect of the economy that it could in order to sustain the high civil service employment rate and pay operating costs.  In hindsight it is clear the GOT never really intended to fully comply with the project goal to allow the private sector to drive and be responsible for increased agricultural production.  The government still maintains a monopoly on inputs and discourages ""speculation,"" a term used by the GOT to refer to the private sector. TOGOGRAIN still functions and sells cereals for profit. It was recently involved in a trilateral food relief operation with France and Cape Verde despite the government's insistence that the private sector was free to operate.  France bought from TOGOGRAIN 4,000 tons of cereals which it in turn donated to Cape Verde for relief operations.  France defended this procurement method saying that there were no businesses or established networks able to provide the required quantity.  A major lesson learned is that only by attacking fundamental macroeconomic and social policies, i.e., fiscal reform, privatization, and budgetary responsibility, will agricultural projects and agricultural policy reform programs bear fruit.

"Evaluates assistance to the South Pacific Alliance for Family Health (SPAFH).  SPAFH is an NGO established in Tonga in 1986 as a regional resource for family planning (FP).  It has received A.I.D. funding since 1987, initially through the Foundation for the Peoples of the South Pacific.  In 1990, USAID signed a 3-year Cooperative Agreement with Pathfinder Fund to serve as a conduit for A.I.D. funds and to provide TA to SPAFH in institutional development and programming. Phase I, covering the first 3 years, calls for emphasis on institutional development. Phase II will emphasize FP programming.  This evaluation addresses Phase I.  It was conducted from 11/14-12/10/92 and involved visits to Tonga, Western Samoa, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, and Fiji. SPAFH has demonstrated its potential to help meet critical FP challenges in the region.  Its major strengths are an increasingly active and committed Board comprising prestigious officials of ten member countries, installation of viable management and operational systems, growing recognition as a major player in the FP field, an impressive amount of programming given the emphasis of Phase I on institutional development, the ability to respond rapidly to regional needs, adherence to its implementation objectives as expressed by the benchmarks, and significant contributions to FP expertise in the region. SPAFH's achievements are remarkable in light of significant constraints, including institutional inexperience; major turnover in senior staff midway through Phase I; the challenges associated with defining the organization's role; diverse demands for service; the complexity of the region, and the reduced level of inputs provided by the project as finally approved. SPAFH's performance with regard to the benchmarks is mixed.  Some have been exceeded, some met, and some not achieved, though additional progress is expected by the end of Phase I in 9/93. Two of the benchmarks which have not been achieved involve the acquisition of demographic analysis capability and the establishment of current contraceptive usage and inventory information for countries in which SPAFH supports strategic development and population policy activities. These activities are inappropriate for SPAFH and should not be pursued further. Through no fault of its own, SPAFH is not yet registered as a NGO in Tonga; the location of SPAFH in Tonga needs reconsideration in the light of the registration problems and other factors. Overall, the benchmarks are a useful mechanism for measuring certain aspects of both programmatic and institutional progress, and SPAFH and Pathfinder deserve full credit for strict adherence to them.  These benchmarks, however, effectively ignore some of the basic institutional development that must take place if SPAFH is to be a viable, long-term regional FP resource. SPAFH needs a strategic plan of its own.  This may not have been necessary during SPAFH's early years, but it is the number one priority at the moment. SPAFH has accomplished a great deal though its programming and its grant program, but more needs to be done and the focus redefined. Information, education, and communication (IEC) activities have received little attention, though this is a priority need and the demand is high. Project Excel, funded by Australian International Development and Assistance Bureau (AIDAB) with components funded through A.I.D.'s FP Services Expansion and Technical Support (SEATS) and Social Marketing for Change (SOMARC) projects, challenges SPAFH to integrate this large program into its overall spectrum. Subgrants to date have been extremely small; it is up to SPAFH to stimulate an increase in grant applications and encourage applicants to consider larger, multi-phase, comprehensive programs.  Also, programming in the smaller countries needs more attention.  SPAFH's involvement in helping countries develop standards for service delivery is appropriate, given the expertise of its staff. Its involvement in developing standards for social marketing, as reflected in one of the benchmarks, is not appropriate. Pathfinder has excelled in providing a smooth flow of operational funding to SPAFH and has been instrumental in arranging appropriate foreign training.  Its inputs to developing financial management systems, representing over one-third of its TA, have paid off.  It has also helped SPAFH to develop other internal management systems, such as project monitoring and tracking.  In addition, it has recruited experts from both its own staff and the outside to help SPAFH in various institutional development and programming activities.  Its assistance in management information system (MIS) development was unsatisfactory and wasted valuable resources. Although Pathfinder was constrained by a reduced level of effort in the project paper as finally approved, it failed to recognize the basic needs of a new NGO for an organizational strategic plan and to provide the necessary assistance in this area.  Its allocation of resources responded to the benchmarks, but not to the basic needs of an NGO slated to be an independent, A.I.D.- registered PVO by the end of Phase I. SPAFH still needs institutional development support, but Phase II should reflect an increasing emphasis on programming and on country-based rather than regional services.  SPAFH will not be eligible for direct Phase II funding, so a conduit will be required.

"The major focus of this final evaluation of the Save the Children Federation/Bolivia Child Survival Project (SCF) was placed on recommendations for follow-up since SCF has obtained funding to continue project activities for an additional 3-5 years -- a step necessary to consolidate gains in improved health practices with a focus on long-term sustainability. The project covered 11,000 Aymara-speaking persons dispersed over 58 communities located in the high plains (3600 to 4000 meters above sea-level) in the Department of LaPaz, Inquisivi Province, areas of Quime, Ichoca, and Luruta/Siguas.  Primary health care services as well as other basic services did not exist in the majority of these communities prior to the project. The majority of the project objectives were met despite difficult circumstances.  The project was strongest in reaching its Expanded Program of Immunization (EPI) objectives, administering DPT, oral polio, and measles vaccines to 52% of 12-23 month-olds, and administering two tetanus toxoid (TT) doses to 46% of eligible women. Thirty-one percent of mothers used oral rehydration therapy, and over 80% of mothers properly nourished their children during a diarrhea episode.  At least 50% of children were involved in a growth monitoring program, 39% of mothers breastfed within the first 8 hours, 43% of children were exclusively breastfed for the first 4-6 months, and 70% of mothers breastfed for two years.  The project did not fully meet targets for Vitamin A capsule administration, knowledge of safe birthing practices, or acute respiratory infection management. The project used a two-tiered strategy to achieve sustainability -- strengthening of Ministry of Health (MOH) services and the training of mothers in child protective behaviors.  SCF has established a good foundation, especially in EPI, for continuing to coordinate and work with the MOH.  The team suggests that SCF use a more systematic planning process with the MOH which would include an action plan consisting of objectives, activities, and indicators to further strengthen this link. SCF trained village health workers (VHWs) to train mothers in protective health behaviors.  The selection process to recruit VHWs through the agrarian union meetings favored men.  Women were not included sufficiently in the decision making process and support for the primarily male VHWs was found to be low.  SCF has begun to address this issue by planning to work more closely with women's groups in the community.  A Health Information System was used effectively by SCF to plan and supervise activities.  This information needs to be shared with the community so they can analyze their preventive health priorities. It is recommended that SCF establish objectives and indicators around community level sustainability.

"PACR of the non-traditional agriculture export (NTAE) support project (9/86-9/91) in Central America.  During the first months of the project the name PROEXAG was created to represent the contract team.  From 10/86-9/91, PROEXAG provided TA to the Central American NTAE industry, and assisted in the expansion of Central America's foreign exchange earning capacity, a critical element in the region's long-term economic growth prospects.  Through a skillful, energetic, and well-targeted campaign of promotion and TA, PROEXAG introduced new crops, new methods, new growers, new exporters, and new markets.  The general consensus is that PROEXAG provided substantial impetus to the impressive growth in non-traditional exports over this period. Despite the chaotic condition of economies throughout Central America and the political buffeting all regional efforts have taken, production and export of non-traditional crops rose in PROEXAG's original four participating countries (Guatemala, Honduras, Costa Rica, and El Salvador).  After the first four years, production and export sales were steadily higher in these countries.  Today the trends and prospects appear promising. Panama, Nicaragua, and to some extent, Belize were incorporated into the project in the latter years.  The longer PROEXAG runs the greater seem its benefits. From the beginning TA was targeted at members of the export federations and export-oriented development foundations that were designated as formal counterparts to PROEXAG.  These included the following:  (1) in Guatemala, the Guild of Nontraditional Products Exporters (GEXPRONT); (2) in El Salvador, the Salvadoran Association of Nontraditional Producers and Exporters (ASPENT), which was later transformed into the Agricultural Diversification Division (DIVAGRO) of the Salvadoran Foundation for Economic and Social Development (FUSADES); (3) in Costa Rica, the Private Agricultural and Agroindustrial Council (CAAP), which was later changed to the Agricultural Division (DIVAGRI) of the Coalition of National Development Initiatives (CINDE); (4) in Honduras, the Federation of Agricultural and Agroindustrial Producer and Exporter Associations (FEPROEXAAH), subsequently ""FPX;"" (5) in Panama, first the National Council for Productivity (CONDEPRO), which never really got started and eventually folded once A.I.D. withdrew from Panama, and from 1990 onward, the Guild of Nontraditional Exporters of Panama (GREXPAN); (6) in Belize, Belize Agribusiness Company (BABCO); and (7) in Nicaragua from 1990 onward, the Nicaraguan Association of Producers and Exporters on Nontraditional Products (APENN). During the first year of PROEXAG short-term TA was also provided in support of mariculture (e.g., shrimp farming) and aquaculture (e.g., tilapia, catfish, and trout farming) activities in several countries. However, it was soon decided that further requests for assistance in these areas would not be accepted, the main reasons being that the core team was not familiar with these businesses, more specialized sources of TA were available, and separate bilateral projects were being developed within or for several counterpart entities to address these areas. By the end of the first year, PROEXAG's product focus had narrowed to horticulture.  Within horticulture, however, there are many segments, numerous crops, and various product forms for each crop, so further prioritization was necessary. The major segments of horticulture are: (1) fruits, vegetables, and their derivative products; (2) ornamental crops and their derivative products; (3) specialty crops and their derivative products; and (4) propagative materials.  The latter segment was immediately discarded (except as an adjunct to other export businesses--a pineapple nursery, for example) because such businesses are very specialized and do not usually generate large export volumes.  The specialty crop segment was also discarded because the industrial crops within it each have unique marketing systems and because specialty edible crops such as herbs and spices typically generate only small volumes. One of the important notions to come from the project was the ""deal making"" concept, which was the cornerstone of the project even though the players varied as products, shippers, and markets changed.  The contract provided the know-how through direct TA, training, and market information.  The delivery methods for providing this know-how and the recipients were the focus of this project; they provided the foundation for the philosophy behind the follow-on EXITOS project. Lessons learned indicate that desirable characteristics in NTAE projects include:  (1) commitment to achieving a self-sustaining increase in export volume; (2) a project built around the needs of enterprises, but with complementary efforts at improving the macroeconomic environment  and strengthening producer/exporter and crop associations; (3) a budget with the resources and flexibility to hire the best possible staff and consultants; and (4) a positive approach that encourages experimentation, experiential learning, and on-going design.

"Evaluates project to support the Philippine Department of Health's (DOH) Philippine Family Planning Program (PFPP). Midterm evaluation covers 5/90-10/92. PFPP is seriously flawed, the result of nearly 10 years of disarray and lack of consistent support.  During the 1970s and early 1980s, the Philippines had one of Asia's most successful FP programs, but then difficulties arose due to a decline in political support, economic stagnation, and increasingly strong opposition from the Catholic Church. Between 1987-89, PFPP's very existence was questioned.  The Population Commission (POPCOM) was stripped of its responsibilities for FP, and the Department of Health (DOH), which took over the provision of services, totally ignored the NGO sector, which had provided 35% of services and a large share of IECM (information, education, communication, and motivation) and training.  Without POPCOM and a strong NGO sector, PFPP was unable to meet demand, and currently the contraceptive prevalence rate (modern methods) in the Philippines is only 22%, well behind Thailand, Indonesia, and even Bangladesh. Efforts to find administrative solutions through the creation of a DOH Technical Secretariat (TS) backfired:  the result has been that PFPP now speaks with two voices, that of TS and that of DOH's FP Services. This lack of direction will become even more critical with the recent decision to decentralize many government activities. More positively however, the USAID project has made an important contribution toward moving the DOH to reorganize and to recommit to FP. PFPP has ambitious plans for increasing contraceptive use, although due to the poor DOH management information system, actual service statistics are not known.  The number is believed to be rising, but growth is deterred by limited contraceptives choice (Depo-Provera, Norplant, and progestin-only orals are virtually unavailable), poor service quality, and lack of coordination with basic health services. NGOs manage only about 17% of FP clinics now, the major constraint being a 1990 TS requirement that all NGOs be reaccredited; 3 years later, the status of many of the largest and best-established NGOs remains in limbo.  Other constraints on NGOs are lack of training, funding delays, poor logistics support, and TS's failure to include NGOs in FP policymaking. Of two private sector efforts, an employer-based project shows promise, while a condom social marketing program is too new to assess. PFPP's plan to train 50,000 clinical personnel is progressing acceptably in the DOH but not at all in the NGOs, even though 60% of the training was to be directed to this sector.  Other areas of concern include lack of a coherent training strategy, poor coordination among public and private providers, incomplete course guidelines, and overly restrictive clinical standards. IECM efforts are marked by the lack of a targeting strategy, Also, despite the importance of interpersonal communication in the Philippines, little progress has been made in incorporating outreach workers into IECM or in training clinical staff, especially midwives, to provide personal FP counseling.  POPCOM has carried out successful advocacy efforts at the regional level, but these will have to be extended to local officials. The dearth of good service delivery data is a serious problem; the DOH MIS still remains largely on the drawing board, and the TS has made no effort to incorporate NGO data.  In other areas, PFPP conducted no operational research, and its logistic system, though improved under the project, still needs work.  Detailed recommendations are presented for restructuring and strengthening DOH management, reactivating the NGO sector, and energizing service delivery, training, and IECM.","Companion Evaluation Summary: PD-ABJ-866|Project title: Population technical assistance (POPTECH)","Special Evaluation","Documents","DPE-3024-Z-00-8078-00","","4/1/1993 12:00:00 AM","","Family planning promotion programs|Domestic government programs|Family planning services|Private voluntary organizations|IEC|Medical education","Philippines","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABF691.pdf","7,028 KB","006243 - Dual & Associates, Inc.|000673 - International Science and Technology Institute, Inc.

"In 1992 A.I.D. provided emergency assistance to the child immunization services of Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan.  Assistance included the supply of sufficient vaccines to allow each country to complete primary immunization of over 500,000 children; initiation of the upgrade of cold chains in each country to ensure the safe storage and transport of vaccines; and a technical exchange process that supports revitalization of present policy and practice. While the 1992 program assisted countries to maintain immunization services and began the process of change, further assistance will be needed in 1993 to consolidate and expand on the gains made.  Such support should include:  (1) ensurance that each of the countries have sufficient vaccine for primary immunization of all their children in 1993; (2) development of a ""vaccine safety net"" to provide timely warning to the international community of pending shortages; (3) assistance in the development of a cold chain between vaccine producers in the former Soviet Union and each of the countries; (4) further strengthening of cold chain practices, repair, and maintenance within each country, and additional commodity support; and (5) the provision of TA for addressing such issues as international vaccine procurement, immunization policy formulation, program planning, program monitoring, and disease surveillance. The needs within the Central Asian Republics are great.  The coordinated assistance of all donors will be needed to ensure that the total needs are met.  The requirements outlined in this report are directed at the wider donor community.

"Mid-term evaluation of a grant to Operation Independence (OI) to promote liberalization of Israeli economic policies. OI is believed to be most effective at networking and the holding of conferences and seminars.  It has conducted successful major conferences in the areas of capital markets, budgetary reform, and reform of business management schools.  Research papers are generally of high quality, although questions have been raised as to their relevance. There is some feeling that more attention should be paid to the translation of existing documents and their distribution to a wider audience than to the production of new ones. OI's contribution to economic reform has been notable in the areas of the business schools, which have adopted more practically oriented curricula, and taxation, where OI assistance has led to the introduction of reform legislation.  Some progress has also been made in housing, despite a major setback to reform caused by the upsurge in immigration from the former Soviet Union, and ensuing reversion to a control-oriented policy course by the government.  Knesset education appears to be going well. However, the team could identify little else as having occurred in the general area of ""changing economic perceptions.""  For the most part, economic education has been confined to opinion leaders. Problems with OI follow-up were noted in two of the above areas. The problems had to do with a long overdue paper (housing); a committee formed but not activated (business schools); and a long delayed start on the production of case studies at the business schools. In the important area of privatization, OI influence has been confined to informal approaches and sponsorship of a major conference dealing with the subject.  Otherwise, although OI workplans have contained numerous proposals for undertakings in the area, and at least some work has been started (i.e., a paper more than two years in the making), nothing in this category has actually been produced.  Israelis with whom the team talked generally felt that it would require the full weight of public opinion to move the government on privatization.  A few felt that privatization could not properly be considered apart from the broader problem of cartelization of the Israeli economy. Two other OI activities, with which A.I.D. expressed disapproval, were shifted from A.I.D. to non-A.I.D. funding; namely, business networking in the U.S. and a study of the Israeli software industry. The latter became a particular point of contention in the wake of the Lautenberg Amendment (Section 599 of the FY 1993 Foreign Appropriations Act), which prohibits the obligation of funding approved in 1993 for activities that could result in the loss of U.S. jobs.  A.I.D. counsel expressed the view that the software study could be construed as being in conflict with at least the spirit of Section 599.  A.I.D. also felt that the recommendation embodied in the software paper for formation of an advisory board with government representation to promote the industry, ran counter to the free market philosophy underlying OI. The team was impressed with the quality of the principal OI subgrantees - the Israeli Democracy Institute (IDI), the Israeli Center For Social and Economic Progress (ICSEP), and Dr. Steven Plaut of the University of Haifa.

"Evaluates project to create an enabling environment for private sector development in Nicaragua.  Interim evaluation covers the period 4/92-3/93. Despite important contributions towards the project purpose -- notably regarding the divestiture of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and the establishment of viable financial institutions -- private sector initiatives generally are not supported by macroeconomic conditions and cannot be sustained in the long run. For example, a concerted effort must be made to incorporate linkages between the project components and Government of Nicaragua macroeconomic policies to ensure that real exchange rate policies, as well as monetary and fiscal policies are conducive to expansion of trade and investment. The Center for Exports and Investment (CEI), which is responsible for export and investment promotion, lacks a clear mandate, and as a result, support for investors and exports remains unfocused.  Its effectiveness would be enhanced by gradually establishing its independence from the Consejo Superior de la Empresa Privada (COSEP) and by expanding public and private representation on its Board. In the privatization component, Price Waterhouse is well on its way to meeting contract obligations and has received favorable reviews by the Corporaciones Nacionales del Sector Publico (CORNAP) and other involved parties; more funding is needed, however.  Additional assistance is sorely needed to transfer skills to new owners of privatized properties, primarily in agriculture.  There is also considerable concern that the numerous failures of enterprises owned by workers and ex-combatants could derail privatization and unbalance the present delicate political stability.  For its part, CORNAP, which has focused on privatizing the easiest SOEs in order to generate transactions and reach the most beneficiaries quickly, requires additional personnel to maintain the pace of the program; it also needs a source of cash to pay worker indemnities. In the financial services component, private banks, the Superintendency of Banks, and the Bankers' Association are all new entities and are variously in need of training, TA, and other support. In addition, Nicaragua needs enabling legislation and investors to form private insurance companies and private pension plans before they can play an active part in capital markets. Only two of six planned studies are underway, and much effort will be needed for their timely completion.  More funding of studies in all three project components -- trade and investment, privatization, and financial services -- is needed. Given the conflict of opinions regarding the status of women in the private sector, USAID urgently needs statistical information on which it can base its assistance, particularly regarding mechanisms to encourage women to seek higher levels of education, flexible work schedules which permit women to attend to family obligations, and the extent to which sexual harassment exists.","Delivery order no. 2|Evaluation summary: PD-ABH-408","Special Evaluation","Documents","PCE-0001-I-00-2051-00","","4/1/1993 12:00:00 AM","","Privatization|Financial institutions|Institution building|Investment promotion|Trade|Economic conditions|Export promotion|Private sector","Nicaragua","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABG424.pdf","4,910 KB","001335 - Chemonics International Consulting Div.","","008584 - USAID.

"PACR of a grant (3/85-12/92) to CARE to improve health conditions for rural populations in Guatemala through the construction and maintenance of water systems (the project targeted women, the primary caretakers of water systems). The project was successful and encouraging.  It met its targets in terms of community organization, water supply construction, provision of latrines, establishment of functional community water committees, and to some extent the improvement of family health status through education. In all, 59 communities received water systems and 32,104 persons were directly served through 5,883 water connections.  Each household that received a water connection also had project help in building a pit latrine. The quality of the water systems was found to be very good. All the systems were organized to operate under a local committee, and a manual for these committees was produced.  The satisfaction of users was reflected in their willingness to pay the monthly fee; arrears were uncommon.  The health education component, which started late, reached 560 women in 10 villages. The methodology of strong community participation in all phases of developing rural water systems and latrines proved successful. Likewise, the community contribution (female volunteers) in the education process was an important tool for improving knowledge and practices concerning sanitation. The type of water system adopted, provision of water in the home, provided a greater opportunity for family health than the lower cost system of public standpipes.  In-home water systems have provided women with a sense of ownership which in turn has led to improved maintenance of the systems, and ultimately improved health conditions.  Construction of water systems was found to be a key to promoting community acceptance of latrines.  The importance of health education in improving community health status was highlighted by the project, especially during the last years when the health education methodology was improved. As CARE was an efficient administrator, it was not necessary to develop an administrative unit within the government which could continue this methodology after the CARE intervention ended.  Another bilateral donor provided CARE with funds to develop a similar project in another geographical area of the country. The health education actions were developed mostly by CARE personnel. However, activities ended when the construction phase was completed. The advantages of latrines had to be explained before they were available for use.  Appropriate use of water could not be practiced and, therefore, the adoption of these practices could not be observed by the project personnel.  These considerations were taken into account when AID authorized a new project with CARE in 1991.  The new Rural Water and Health Project builds on the experience and administrative structure of the project and extended for a period of 18 months the support of community volunteers by CARE extensionists in 12 project sites.

"Midterm evaluation of a project to improve natural resources management in Rwanda.  The evaluation covers the period 6/89-12/92. Progress has been slow due to poor performance by the project Coordination Unit (CU), which has yet to set up an effective management system.  Other delaying factors have included the inherent difficulty of managing a project with five such disparate components, confusing inconsistencies in the component agreements with USAID, and several changes in Rwandan and USAID project personnel.  The CU has spent less than 50% of its annual budget allocations over the last 2 years. The absence of overall management by the CU has detracted from the performance of the individual components, and has forced USAID/R to assume many of the CU's responsibilities, such as assisting components with accounting and reporting procedures; this has created a situation in which component personnel feel that USAID is micromanaging the project, while USAID is concerned about the unanticipated workload for Mission staff. Individual components have managed to achieve varying degrees of success.  (1) The marais lands (bottomlands) research and management component has completed the basic research needed for development of the Nyamigogo marais, and 21 of 30 targeted rural engineering technicians are being trained.  Another 30 are needed.  (2) While less successful, the marais fish culture component has made significant progress toward targets, suggesting this may be a viable smallholder activity.  A national aquaculture plan should be completed as soon as possible.  (3) The soil conservation and agroforestry component will probably not attain its targets and should be scaled back.  (4) The natural forest management component has succeeded in encouraging the participation of Rwandan professionals.  Given the economic importance of ecotourism for Rwanda, expansion of this component to Akagera National Park should be considered.  (5) The environmental planning component has assisted Rwanda's new Ministry of Environment and Tourism (MINETO) in implementing the National Environmental Strategy and the Environmental Action plan, and has provided other support as well.  However, MINETO is a small ministry with very limited capacity and an ill-defined mandate vis-a-vis other ministries with environmental concerns. The project should encourage the development of a national environmental council that can identify intra-ministerial and sectoral responsibilities in environmental management.  MINETO should be given training support in addition to TA.","Delivery order no. 18","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-5517-I-00-0105-00","","4/1/1993 12:00:00 AM","","Natural resource management|Agricultural production|Wetlands|Swamps|Fish culture|Aquaculture|Agroforestry|Protected environmental areas|Ecotourism|Tropical rain forests|Beneficiary count","Rwanda","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABF786.pdf","2,367 KB","005072 - Tropical Research and Development, Inc.","","008598 - USAID.

"During Korea's early export expansion period (1961-73), the Government of Korea (GOK) undertook a program to provide export services to manufacturers.  To this end, the GOK created several joint public-private commodity-specific task forces to assist export businesses with production and marketing, as well as the Korean Trade Promotion Agency, a public sector agency to market exports, and the Korean Institute of Science and Technology, which was responsible for developing new industrial technologies. A.I.D. directly assisted these agencies and supplemented this support with highly targeted production assistance to firms and industries.  This case study assesses the impact of these publicly provided export services on Korea's export performance. Individual sections of the report:  outline the program's political and economic context; examine the market for export services; and review the use and impact of GOK export services. The study shows that the GOK's export services institutions had minimal impact on export expansion.  It appears that foreign sources provided most of the production and marketing assistance to exporters, with lucrative export incentives facilitating cooperation between Korean exporters and aggressive foreign buyers.  Four major lessons were learned from this experience. (1) Donors must carefully identify the rationale for intervening in export service markets.  In the Korean case, no sound rationale existed.  (2) The effectiveness of public sector provision of export services is open to question.  (3) The importance of the export services provided by the international sector suggests that the proper role of the public sector may lie in facilitating long-term contacts between exporters and developed country importers and suppliers.  (4) Even if there is a rationale for subsidizing export services, public sector institutions should not be created to provide export services. Each of Korea's institutions experienced significant problems.","Summary highlights: PN-ABG-010","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","4/1/1993 12:00:00 AM","","Exports|Export promotion|Subsidies|International trade promotion organizations|Government departments|Business support services|Private sector","Korea R","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAX264.pdf","50 KB","007222 - USAID.

"Mid-term evaluation of a grant to the International Eye Foundation to prevent blindness and improve public eye care services in Bulgaria. Evaluation covers the period 1/91-6/92. This innovative and important project was undertaken in a former communist nation to establish a comprehensive outpatient and surgical eye care facility using a U.S. model; to obtain baseline data on the prevalence of ocular disease and blindness; and to prepare a strategy for reducing blindness in Bulgaria. The project has achieved its goal -- the Center for Sight has been established and the survey has been completed.  It is imperative at this time to concentrate on further development of the public health aspect of the program. The project has been hampered by the political climate in Bulgaria -- the country has been described as being in a state of quasi-anarchy in its efforts to establish a democratic government and a free market economy -- but also by the opposition of an academic Chair of Ophthalmology in Bulgaria.

"Evaluates A.I.D.'s drug demand reduction program in Latin America and the Caribbean.  The evaluation is based on case studies of bilateral projects in Guatemala, Mexico, Bolivia, Peru, and Brazil. Although cocaine and marijuana use in the five assisted countries tend to be well below U.S. levels, there are some alarming trends, such as high levels of use of gateway drugs such as inhalants; the use of drugs by drug traffickers to pay their collaborators, which increases the user base; high poverty levels and rapid population growth; a growing drugs/AIDS connection, especially in Brazil; and significant increases in use in some countries, again notably Brazil.  Public awareness of the dangers of drug use varies widely, but seems to be growing.  Public awareness of the dangers of drug production and trafficking appears to have increased significantly, particularly in Peru and Bolivia. Host governments generally neither assign a high priority to reducing drug demand and nor contribute significantly to the projects, while the priority assigned by USAID Missions ranges from high in Bolivia, Peru, and Brazil, to medium in Mexico, to low in Guatemala.  The larger projects in Bolivia and Peru have reasonably well defined goals, purposes, and outputs; this is generally not the case with smaller projects.  While not necessarily precluding positive accomplishments, the lack of a precise statement of goal, purpose, and outputs impedes project management and evaluation.  Monitoring systems appear adequate for the projects, but impact assessment has been weak or nonexistent, and there have also been weaknesses in evaluating output and performance. Overall, the projects have generated impressive outputs, and the A.I.D.-supported entities are run by competent and dedicated individuals.  Project resources are generally adequate, though there are exceptions, such as the SUBDESAL Communication Unit in Brazil.  Also, in a number of cases, notably Brazil, extra funding could be put to good use if available.  However, the most promising efforts are now generating or showing promise of generating outside assistance. Creation or strengthening of an institution is the mostly costly intervention and should be undertaken, as with the Center for Information and Drug Abuse Prevention (CEDRO) in Peru, only when less costly means of achieving similar ends have been ruled out. In most cases, sustainability of drug prevention efforts in the absence of continued U.S. funding is unlikely.  This is particularly true because A.I.D. has focused its assistance on PVOs, which face all the difficulties inherent in private sector fundraising in the region. Until demand reduction programs begin to receive full support from national public sources, they will continue to require outside funding. Except for CEDRO, there is little evidence of serious efforts by A.I.D.-supported entities to raise non-U.S. funds. Most persons contacted -- country team officers and host country nationals -- had a high opinion of A.I.D.-funded services and TA; most also expressed satisfaction with the TA provided by Development Associates, Inc. under the Narcotics Awareness and Education contract. Seventeen recommendations are made for modifying A.I.D.'s drug demand reduction strategy in the region; chief among these is that A.I.D. conduct an interagency assessment of U.S. efforts in this area and develop a strategy involving collaboration with other donors, in particular the UN Drug Control Program.","Delivery order no. 1","Special Evaluation","Documents","AEP-0085-I-00-3003-00","","5/1/1993 12:00:00 AM","","Drug abuse education|Drug abuse|Case studies|Attitude change|IEC|Illicit drug trade|Demand|Behavior change","Latin America|Guatemala|Mexico|Bolivia|Peru|Brazil","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABF829.pdf","5,345 KB","000356 - Checchi and Co.

"Recent economic studies suggest that countries with strong trade, investment, and export systems experience greater developmental growth than those with internally focused economies.  This country study (part of a regional study of export and investment promotion in Asia) assesses the effectiveness of export and investment promotion services in Indonesia, and in particular A.I.D.'s $10 million Private Sector Development Project, which struggled over a period of 7 years with various approaches to direct assistance for export and investment promotion.  The report reflects the perspectives of both service providers and firms that benefitted from the services and reaches the following conclusions.  (1) Policy reform was an important precondition to the development of an indigenous export capability; through the 1980's A.I.D. assistance in deregulation effected greater change in Indonesia's economic environment than did direct A.I.D. assistance to individual firms.  (2) Government-subsidized export promotion programs, which included buyer contacts, trade fairs, and the provision of general market information, were most helpful at early stages of firm market entry (later stages required more technical and market sensitive expertise). Government-managed investment promotion had no impact.  (3) For market assistance, the majority of firms rely on internal resources and on highly interrelated seller/buyer relationships, rather than on fee-based advisory services.  The report is presented in three sections which cover the economic context, the export promotion services market, and the effectiveness of export promotion intermediaries.","Attachment: XN-AAX-263-A|Summary highlights: PN-ABG-013","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","4/1/1993 12:00:00 AM","","Export promotion|Investment promotion|Economic development|Business support services","Indonesia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAX263.pdf","55 KB","006917 - USAID.

"Interim evaluation of a project to improve the policy and institutional climate in Jamaica for investment and diversification in export-oriented private enterprises.  The evaluation covers the period 3/90-5/93. Though the project has covered a broad range of activities -- a total of 22 discrete activities -- most of its resources have been focused upon Jamaica Promotions, Ltd. (JAMPRO), and the National Investment Bank of Jamaica (NIBJ).  The best results have been attained when professional TA was provided directly to promising private sector enterprises, as in the International Executive Service Corp's (IESC) volunteer program, JAMPRO's TA to garment manufacturers, and the Peace Corps vendors' program. NIBJ's use of local consultants to prepare companies for privatization has also had excellent effects. Another promising activity has been the provision of TA in preparing draft legislation for the Fair Trade Competition Act of 1993 and the Employee Share Ownership Act.  Also, planned project support for a new Fiscal Monitoring Unit at the Ministry of Finance (MOF) appears to be an excellent idea. On the negative side, the project has supported a number of activities that do not appear promising.  Some of the relatively smaller activities, such as the Tourism Action Plan's (TAP) facade and small projects program, the National Development Foundation (NDF) institutional strengthening activity, and the Small Business Association of Jamaica's (SBAJ) business planning and implementation activity, by diverting USAID resources, have had the effect of diffusing the project's impact.  Also, the management information system originally envisioned for the project has proven overly ambitious; it should be abandoned and replaced by a simpler system that can be accommodated in a LOTUS 1-2-3 program and involves simplified data gathering. The project is under consideration for amendment, and the evaluation makes the following recommendations.  (1) Given the maturation in the Jamaican economy, the amended project should focus on policy implementation, privatization, securities exchange regulation/stock exchange modernization, and business development.  If these activities are approved, USAID should consider changing its counterpart organization from JAMPRO to the MOF, while continuing to provide support to JAMPRO for activities that meet project goals. (2) Activities that do not show promise -- specifically, support to TAP, NDF, and SBAJ -- should be eliminated as soon current obligations are fulfilled.","Delivery order no. 1","Special Evaluation","Documents","PCE-0001-I-00-2051-00","","5/1/1993 12:00:00 AM","","Economic administration|Export diversification|Investment promotion|Economic policy|Policy reform","Jamaica","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABF892.pdf","6,921 KB","001335 - Chemonics International Consulting Div.","","008563 - USAID.

"Evaluates a project to strengthen legislatures in selected Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) countries.  Interim evaluation covers the period 8/90-9/92 and focuses on the core regional project managed by the Consortium for Legislative Development, comprising The Center for Democracy, Florida International University, and State University of New York/Albany. While the project design is valid, implementation has been weak due to severe problems in intra-Consortium management, compounded by communication problems with USAID and lack of an overall strategic plan for the project. Findings concerning the project's five main components are as follows.  (1) The Consortium was to conduct needs assessments of the training, TA, and equipment needs of legislatures in ten countries, but reported activities in only eight.  Of these, three assessments, in Costa Rica, Nicaragua, and Panama, were satisfactory and led to a buy-in or bilateral agreement. However, the other five, in Guatemala, Haiti, Dominican Republic, Bolivia, and Paraguay, were nonsubstantive and provided no basis for developing extensive projects.  According to the Consortium, these assessments were conducted in accordance with A.I.D./W's instructions. (2) The Consortium has conducted two regional seminars, four subregional seminars, and three orientation programs on technical topics and legislative development.  The quality of the seminars varied widely; several were criticized by A.I.D. and participants for lack of preparation, organization, and language capability of the presenters. Most successful were the orientation seminars and a grant writing seminar requested by ATELCA, the Guatemala-based Association of Central American Legislative Technicians. (3) Design of management information systems and short-term TA were also part of the Consortium's contract.  While some management and legislative information systems were assessed (in conjunction with the country needs assessments), none have been designed.  Short-term TA has been provided on request to legislatures in Paraguay, Guatemala, the Dominican Republic, Belize, and Haiti, in several cases on short notice. Most successful was the provision of Spanish-speaking information specialists, who were well received. (4) Graduate education in legislative development was offered through a program at SUNY/A; participants were selected to participate in a Master's program in Legislative Administration or a certificate program. While participants consider the training to be valuable, better procedures for selecting candidates are needed. (5) The Consortium has supported ATELCA, beginning with the Third General Assembly in El Salvador in 11/90.  Although regional legislative personnel feel that the very existence of ATELCA has increased the stature of legislative staff throughout the region, ATELCA suffers from a lack of infrastructure, disagreement on criteria for membership, and financial dependence on A.I.D. Legislative staff and the legislatures they serve have not yet become committed enough to sustain ATELCA absent external funding. Lessons learned include the following.  (1) Projects must maintain a measure of flexibility to accommodate the changing needs of legislatures, which are fluid organizations with frequent, sometimes yearly, changes in leadership.  (2) Regional projects should be implemented through institutions that have sufficient organizational, technical, and programmatic capabilities and familiarity with A.I.D. requirements.  An inventory of such organizations with skills in legislative development should be developed for A.I.D. It is important that A.I.D. not reject the objective of strengthening legislatures because of the performance of the Consortium.  Improving the image, capacity, and efficiency of legislatures requires a long-term commitment.  In addition, A.I.D. should consider the continuation of a small amount of institutional and programmatic support to ATELCA, while requiring measurable progress toward self-sufficiency.","Delivery order no. 20|Project title: Advancing basic education and literacy (ABEL)","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-5832-I-00-0095-00","","4/1/1993 12:00:00 AM","","Regional development|Legislature|Institution building|Democracy","Latin America|Caribbean","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABF904.pdf","4,202 KB","001341 - Creative Associates International, Inc.

"PACR of a project (1985-1991) to strengthen the capacity of the Center for Tropical Agricultural Research and Training (CATIE) and public and private forestry, education, and extension entities to promote market-oriented tree crop (TC) technologies in Central America -- Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Costa Rica, and Panama. As a result of the project, Central America now has basic, reliable silvicultural and socioeconomic information on 14 multipurpose tree species (MPTS), which, moreover, have been accepted in many communities. Spurred by yields in pilot plots, thousands of small farmers have begun cultivating MPTS, and many have begun processing and marketing tree products.  Also, several industries have established large plantations -- primarily of Gmelina, teak, pine, and Acacia magnium -- which can create employment, restore degraded soils, provide new sources of income, and stimulate investment in additional plantations. Central American technicians are now using standardized silvicultural and socioeconomic research methods, facilitating a collaboration which has led to the development of the tropics' first MPTS database (called MIRA).  The project trained many professionals (e.g., university faculty, forestry agents) in aspects of MPTS, and published a wide range of documents.  The project has also made foresters more conscious of the importance of genetic quality in seeds and, though difficult to quantify, has inculcated the importance of MPTS among decisionmakers (resulting in legislation promoting MPTS cultivation), farmers, and technicians. Findings concerning the achievement of purpose-level objectives were as follows.  (1) The establishment of sustainable programs in national forestry services was hampered by severe host country budget crunches; as a result, the project gradually moved to include among its collaborating institutions about 25 private development organizations, cooperatives, and others.  (2) Forest services in all project countries now have programs to encourage TC production; to a lesser but significant extent, ministries of agriculture and livestock have incorporated TCs in some of their extension programs.  Even more encouraging are the many NGO projects that promote TCs and use technical information generated by the project.  Perhaps most significantly, the project successfully demonstrated that trees can be good cash crops -- one of the pillars of the project from the beginning. (3) TCs are now widely covered in regular CATIE graduate courses, including its M.S. program.  However, several of the courses are taught by staff of the follow-on RENARM project, and continuity after that is uncertain. Outside of CATIE, most progress has been made in including TC subjects in forestry schools, with less progress in influencing strictly agricultural or livestock educational centers, which turn out far more students than the forestry schools. Lessons learned include the following.  (1) This project, its predecessor, and the follow-on are evidence that changes in the natural resources area require very long time frames.  (2) The project confirmed the validity of the regional network approach and the value of country coordinators in managing widely dispersed regional projects.  (3) Diversification of collaborating institutions beyond the national forest services was an excellent strategy.  (4) The project was successful in shifting an increasing percentage of costs to the countries, and CATIE greatly improved its capacity to get collaborators to cover part of the costs of joint operations.  Mechanisms to encourage cost sharing should be built into projects from the beginning.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","3/1/1993 12:00:00 AM","","Agroforestry|Agricultural research|Varietal research|Research centers|Institution building|Regional development|National level|Agricultural extension","Central America|Panama","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABF899.pdf","1,149 KB","002290 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of a project to further strengthen the Micro Industries Development Assistance Society (MIDAS), a Bangladeshi organization created under project 3880042.  The evaluation covers the period 9/87-3/93. MIDAS has made significant progress towards sustainability, but its status is still not secure.  On the positive side, MIDAS has grown from a small NGO which made only 4 loans totaling Tk. 6.8 million the year before the project began, to a larger organization with a high of 25 loans totaling Tk. 50 million during the most active loan year under the project.  MIDAS' portfolio has grown from Tk. 10 million in 1986 to Tk. 153 million in 1992.  In addition, MIDAS greatly expanded its nonfinancial services, and was successful in attracting and competing for contracts awarded by a variety of donors and private companies. Perhaps most significantly, MIDAS' level of operating self-sufficiency grew from 51% in 1990 to 88.4% in 1992. However, these accomplishments are at risk.  High delinquency rates and a reduction in nominal interest rates charged to borrowers jeopardize MIDAS' future.  Weaknesses in the quality of nonfinancial services provided to other donor agencies and the lack of a clear market direction could undermine MIDAS' competitiveness in this arena as well. Since project inception, MIDAS' primary client group has shifted from microenterprises and very small firms that lacked access to formal financial services, to a larger, more affluent client group.  Only 7 loans were granted in 1992, for a total of Tk. 14.7 million; most of the recipient businesses could have received funding from other sources but chose to obtain loans from MIDAS because of its simplified loan-granting procedures. MIDAS is increasingly perceived as an institution that gives loans to affluent individuals and persons with connections to board members or staff.  The evaluation team strongly recommends that MIDAS target its loans toward smaller firms -- especially microenterprises that would receive loans of Tk. 50,000 to Tk. 200,000. This market is less interest rate sensitive, has typically better repayment rates than larger firms, and is more consistent with donor priorities in the country. MIDAS has matured and made impressive strides in becoming a more systematized, streamlined institution since the 1990 evaluation, but it continues to be plagued by high staff turnover, an overly centralized structure (wherein financial information is not routinely shared by top management with department managers), and a Board of Directors which is excessively involved in operational management. The survival rate of MIDAS-assisted small and microenterprises is projected to be well below the targeted 80%.  Only 13.8% (9 of 65) of businesses assisted with USAID/B funds and MIDAS reflows during 1988-92 had women listed as general managers, and 7 of the 16 firms visited had no female employees at all.  Employment generated by the project also fell far short of plans.  However, expectations in regard to impact on employment were overly ambitious, given the relatively small size of the project. MIDAS' main shortcomings were:  (1) it simply was not prepared to take on the task of implementing an expanded project; and (2) it failed to grasp the importance of developing effective systems for loan delinquency control and collection.  Ultimately, however, most of the blame for the project's shortcomings lies with USAID, particularly for misjudging MIDAS' capacity to implement the expanded project -- a situation which might have been corrected with more long-term TA.","Companion Evaluation Summary: PD-ABH-319|Project title: Growth and equity through microenterprise investment|(GEMINI)","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","DHR-5448-Q-61-9081-00|DHR-5448-Q-00-9081-00","","4/1/1993 12:00:00 AM","","Business support services|Institution building|Small scale enterprises|Business formation|Commercial credit|Loan administration|Debt repayment|Defaults","Bangladesh","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABF902.pdf","3,515 KB","006727 - Development Alternatives, Inc.

"Evaluates a project to expand the role of the private sector in rural areas of Niger by providing training and credit to cooperatives engaged in productive economic activities.  Midterm evaluation covers the period 8/89-2/93. Key findings and conclusions are as follows.  (1) Existing cooperative law, which still favors government-organized and geographically defined cooperatives, limits the development of flexible and autonomous cooperatives.  However, a new law is now under consideration.  Project staff have found cooperative subdivisions an appropriate size to work with.  (2) Project decisionmaking is not clear and there is no way to evaluate field staff.  (3) While the project has had some success in ensuring active member participation, the training being performed in the field often has limited relevance to economic activity development; the project also lacks a good system for monitoring this training.  On the other hand, training in co-op development, group dynamics, and practical field work has been very successful.  (4) The credit program is effectively providing access to credit to co-op farmers.  However, monitoring and collection of loans are still problematical, and it is doubtful that existing banks will provide loans to co-ops in the absence of the project's guarantee fund and administrative support.  (5) Most co-ops served by the project seem to be engaging in only a few types of economic activities with limited potential for growth.  Those run by local traders seem to be in better financial shape.  (6) The number of women participating in co-op activities is very limited; it appears that cultural biases were underestimated by project planners.  (7) Some effort has been made to develop an indigenous institution to continue the project after PACD, but substantial progress is needed soon for this to materialize. The following lessons have been learned.  (1) The development of profitable co-op activities is a difficult task within the current Nigerien economy.  It is recommended that the project focus on identifying alternative economic activities that offer better comparative advantages and substantially reduce the number of co-ops assisted.  The groupes mutualistes and/or specialized groups should be the key entities for promoting economic activity.  (2) Credit programs require more disciplined design than do training programs, which can often correct problems without major consequences.  It is recommended that the project's training and credit functions be separated both programmatically and physically and that a radical revision of the project such as recently recommended by the credit consultant be implemented on a pilot scale.  (3) The project's potential for addressing the problems of women in development remains limited because most activities occur in rural areas, where resistance to change is high.  Programs that have employed local women at all levels usually produce better results because the women tend to understand Niger's gender-related problems better than men.  (4) It is difficult to measure the impact of training activities; consequently, the project has been measuring inputs and outputs in lieu of impacts.  A well designed monitoring system that looks for proxy indicators of project success can help solve this common problem.","French ed.: PD-ABF-920|Delivery order no. 23|Companion evaluation summary: PD-ABG-406","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-1406-I-00-0033-00","","3/1/1993 12:00:00 AM","","Cooperatives|Rural development|Private sector|Government policy|Credit|Management training|Technical training|Women in development|Project sustainability|Development program evaluation","Niger","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABF590.pdf","2,770 KB","001335 - Chemonics International Consulting Div.","","008585 - USAID.

A well designed monitoring system that looks for proxy indicators of project success can help solve this common problem.","English ed.: PD-ABF-590|Delivery order no. 23|Companion English summary: PD-ABG-406","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-1406-I-00-0033-00","","3/1/1993 12:00:00 AM","","Cooperatives|Rural development|Private sector|Government policy|Credit|Management training|Technical training|Women in development|Project sustainability|Development program evaluation","Niger","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABF920.pdf","3,138 KB","001335 - Chemonics International Consulting Div.","","008585 - USAID.

"Evaluates the effectiveness, efficiency, and potential future role of the information services provided to A.I.D./W and Mission personnel by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Technical Inquiries Group (TIG).  The assessment included a user survey, an examination of both the ""real"" and elapsed time associated with the preparation of nine randomly sampled TIG responses, and interviews with key informants in A.I.D.'s regional bureaus, as well as its central technical and policy offices. Findings indicate that TIG answers inquiries on a much broader range of topics than might be expected.  Inquiries on policy issues and environmental questions are now as routine as questions on agricultural production, processing, and marketing. In regard to productivity, the data suggest that TIG now answers around 1,000 inquiries a year, double the level of 5 years ago. User surveys indicate that 80% of TIG's primary users are A.I.D. staff members, most of whom work in either agricultural or environment-related assignments.  While TIG is not the only information resource upon which these users depend, many are repeat users of the service who characterize it as being very valuable.  Most users point to program design and implementation as the key stages supported by TIG products, and report that the impact of TIG's products tends to be most visible during implementation.  The main secondary users for TIG products are the host country officials with whom A.I.D. users share the answers they receive from the TIG service.  By and large, TIG users give the service high marks for quality and considered its responses to be timely. Examination of TIG's efficiency and the level of demand for its services indicate that TIG is at least as efficient and cost-effective as other similar services, and may be more so than most.  With respect to future demand for TIG's services, interviews with A.I.D. staff and a review of recent Congressional documents and early statements from Clinton administration officials suggest that both agriculture and environment will continue to have an important place in A.I.D.'s portfolio. Based on the findings of this assessment, it is concluded that the TIG program provides A.I.D. with high value products for which there is a continuing demand.  It should, if financially feasible, be continued. In addition to these conclusions, the evaluation makes a series of observations about A.I.D.'s oversight of the many different topical and general information services it funds, and concludes that improvements are warranted.  Absent an appropriate management mechanism, A.I.D. has inadequate documentation concerning, or control over, the full range, depth, cost and quality of such services.  Unnecessary duplication is a possibility under such circumstances.  It is also highly probable that many intended users are unaware of the services.  The evaluation provides both TIG and A.I.D. with suggestions for improvements in oversight of such programs.

"Midterm evaluation of the Cereals Marketing Reform Subproject (CMRP) to assist the Government of Morocco (GOM) in developing a cereals marketing strategy with price, domestic marketing, international trade, and storage policies that maximize marketing efficiency and are consistent with both long-run economic growth and national food security objectives. Evaluation covers the period 7/91-3/93. The CMRP has made excellent progress toward supplying inputs, producing desired outputs, and achieving the project's goal and purpose-level objectives.  This progress is most evident in the commitment to policy reform made by Ministry of Agriculture and Agrarian Reform (MARA) policymakers and in the ongoing lively debates that concern the timing of the reforms and the procedures that must be implemented to achieve the reforms. In less than 20 months, the project has succeeded in moving the policy debate from the level of confidential negotiations between the World Bank and high-level GOM policymakers to a semipublic debate involving a much larger group of actors involved in the cereals market, including millers, domestic cereals traders and importers, representatives of farmers' associations, and other governmental and quasi-governmental groups such as MARA, Office National Interprofessionnel des Cereales et Legumes (ONICL), and Societes Cooperatives Agricoles Marocaines/Cooperatives Marocaines Agricoles (SCAM/CMA). The project has succeeded in furthering cereals policy reform in spite of the absence of strong sponsorship of such reform.  The World Bank concluded the Second Agriculture Sector Adjustment Loan program (ASAL-II) without making substantial progress in the various sectoral loans, and the interest of USAID/Rabat in policy reform has declined in recent years.  It is to the extreme credit of CMRP that the policy reform dialogue has been heightened despite the reduction in pressure from donors.  In this regard, CMRP can perhaps be regarded as a model for the postconditionality structural adjustment project. The project has also done an excellent job of institution building, in improving the capability of both the Division of Economic Affairs and Planning (DPAE) and ONICL to undertake analyses of cereals policy reform, and in using the subsector approach to cereals policy reform analysis. The long- and short-term TA provided have been excellent.  The long-term advisor has done a superb job in coordinating the complex policy studies undertaken in the project and in opening and maintaining the policy dialogue between the many actors involved in cereals market reform, many of whom form opposing constituencies. While the project has achieved a great deal, it was overly ambitious in its scope, given the multitude of issues involved in the complex and strategic cereals subsector.  Cereals production represents approximately 20% of the agricultural gross domestic product; more than 90% of all farms participate in cereals production; and cereals are the primary food in the Moroccan diet, especially in urban areas.  Given the complexity of the subsector, it is to the project's credit to have achieved so much in such a short time.  The third year of the project, which begins in August 1993, will prove crucial as the remaining cereals reforms are expected to be enacted during that time. Many issues concerning policy implementation in which the project can provide much-needed assistance will arise.  It is essential that this level of participation in the final year be increased to cover at least six months.  Increased funding and level of effort for the long-term project advisor is strongly recommended for the third year.  Also, to the extent possible, CMRP should increase the use of Moroccan consultants from the university community and consulting firms to enhance institutional development and the sustainability and domestic proprietorship of the policy reform process.

"PACR of a project (2/84-9/92) to strengthen the capacity of U.S. and indigenous PVO's working in the Philippines to plan and implement development activities benefiting the rural poor. The project demonstrated such significant early success that USAID/P initiated a follow-on midway through the current project. In the end, the present project awarded 64 grants for a wide variety of activities ranging from credit programs to agricultural development, human resources development, health care delivery, prison inmate rehabilitation, and many others. During the project, the number of Philippine PVOs meeting USAID registration requirements and of those actually registered with USAID grew significantly, and the ratio of grants to Philippine PVOs increased substantially as compared to the predecessor project, ultimately numbering 47 of the 64 grants awarded. A household and enterprise survey provided evidence that grant activities were having positive impacts on the economic welfare of beneficiaries. The above indicates that the project met its objectives of stimulating PVOs to attempt diverse development activities, strengthening indigenous PVOs' capacities to design, manage, and evaluate subprojects (SPs), and providing constructive development programs to benefit the rural poor.  On the negative side, most of the income-generating activities involved retail trade, which often does not yield benefits beyond the immediate community.  The retail activities, while popular among beneficiaries, may also hamper community development efforts of the PVOs, as these trade activities compete with each other in relatively tight local economies.  The possibility of challenging PVOs to promote activities with wider linkages should be explored. Also, the country's poorest regions received a disproportionately small share of program assistance, having been reached only through the SPs of intermediary institutions.  USAID should consider encouraging more SP proposals for these regions. The project used three categories of grant arrangements:  direct grants to PVOs to carry out an SP (the majority of grants); grants to an experienced PVO to make subgrants and oversee the activities of one or more smaller, less experienced PVOs; and grants to experienced PVOs to make and manage multiple subgrants, though without getting involved in the actual execution of a SP. Although the usefulness of these arrangements, particularly of the second category of grant, were questioned in a midterm evaluation, it is felt that all three categories had positive aspects. No single formula for determining SP sustainability exists. However, given that sustainability was a major focus in the latter part of the project, there are reasons to be hopeful that the community-level organizations established will survive.  The most difficult SPs to sustain involve basic needs services such as health care, making the institution of fees for services a key aspect.  Also, SPs that focus on credit have good potential for sustainability if the implementing organization sets interest rates high enough to cover costs and provide for future operations.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","3/1/1993 12:00:00 AM","","Private voluntary organizations|Indigenous private voluntary organizations|Development projects|Co-financing|Rural areas","Philippines","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABF976.pdf","2,659 KB","008592 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (4/86-6/92) to increase the potable water supply in Central Tunisia. Designed to address problems that had plagued earlier rural potable water programs in Central Tunisia -- water point selection based on political criteria rather than need, waste of energy and water, a high frequency of water system breakdowns, and a lack of health education -- the project achieved its stated objectives, and its implementation mostly by indigenous personnel provides a model for future development interventions in Tunisia and elsewhere. The project succeeded in establishing a coordinated, decentralized institutional approach to rural water operations; it introduced a multi-disciplinary, equity-based site selection methodology and reduced water system operation inefficiencies by promoting community participation through water user associations (WUAs) and user fees.  The WUAs became the focus for a variety of health education interventions and for increasing the role of women in decisionmaking.  The project successfully completed all of its construction objectives, including the drilling of 30 new boreholes, extension of four existing potable water systems, and a pilot project of house connections in one community. The success of the project's strategy confirms the importance of the social sciences in planning and implementing rural development, and in particular, the effectiveness of and need for community participation and local management of local water resources.  The success of the WUAs in Central Tunisia has sparked interest at the national level, where the political and economic climate has moved toward greater decentralization.  The agency responsible for most water systems in rural Tunisia, Genie Rural, is promoting a national strategy for the creation of WUAs and has instructed its governorate-level offices to organize communities to assume responsibility for water system operation and maintenance.  In addition, another major donor active in Tunisia's rural water sector, the German Kreditanstalt fuer Wiederaufbau (KfW), has adopted the WUA concept, and associations are being formed in communities where KfW-funded water systems are operating.  WUAs now exist in all rural governorates of Tunisia and the Tunisian Government is committed to extending community management of local water resources to the entire country.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1993 12:00:00 AM","","Potable water|Rural areas|Water supply structures|Water management|Water supply structure maintenance|Decentralization|Community participation|Water user associations","Tunisia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABF982.pdf","394 KB","008616 - USAID.

"Despite strong religious and political opposition, A.I.D.'s support for family planning (FP) in Honduras has had significant and measurable impacts.  Early attempts by A.I.D. and aggressive advisors to install visible FP services in the Ministry of Health (MOH) failed, so A.I.D. shifted most of its support to the private sector Honduran Family Planning Association (ASHONPLAFA), beginning in 1981.  It also began portraying FP as a health intervention to reduce the rate of high-risk births that could lead to infant and maternal mortality.  Due in good part to A.I.D.'s assistance, Honduras' total fertility rate has declined from 6.4 children per family in 1981 to about 5.1 in 1992. However, given the country's contraceptive prevalence rate of 46.7%, fertility should be lower than it is.  The extensive use of inefficient methods (rhythm and withdrawal, which are growing faster than modern methods), high discontinuation rates, early onset of childbearing, low levels of exclusive breastfeeding, and the variable quality of FP services (especially in MOH clinics) may be some of the factors to blame. Moreover, there is a general feeling that the A.I.D. program has been overly cautious due to fear of public attacks.  The institutional conditions for a strong program have been created by A.I.D., and now perhaps the greatest need is for improved promotional activities.  In sum, the Honduran program shows that A.I.D.-supported FP can succeed -- if presented as a health program -- even in a potentially hostile political environment; that providing complementary assistance in the public and private sectors is a sound strategy; and that fees high enough to cover most costs are not an obstacle to widespread use of FP services.","Summary highlights: PN-ABG-012","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","6/1/1993 12:00:00 AM","","Family planning promotion programs|Family planning services|Family planning policy|Fertility|Contraceptive prevalence","Honduras","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAX266.pdf","4,358 KB","006917 - USAID.

"This report assesses the sustainability of the African Child Survival Initiative Combating Childhood Communicable Disease (CCCD) project in Guinea.  The project ran from 6/85 to 12/87, and then some 18 months later, in 7/89, was extended to 9/91. Although the project ended on a less than favorable note (USAID/G discontinued bilateral funding after an outside review confirmed Mission concerns about financial and material mismanagement), there are more positive indicators of sustainability than negative ones. Thanks to the national primary health care (PHC) program, the three CCCD interventions -- vaccinations, diarrheal disease control (DDC), and malaria treatment/chemoprophylaxis -- are not only being continued but are being expanded.  Although CCCD was not integrated into the PHC program (to the disappointment of many), it collaborated closely with PHC, and toward the end of the project, about half of the 48 CCCD-assisted health centers in Conakry, Kindia, and Telimele Prefectures were gradually integrated into the national PHC program. The non-integrated health centers are now less used by communities and even the staff are looking for more interesting work.  Some centers have even shut down. The project made several contributions to health service sustainability.  Specifically, it:  provided trainers to launch the PHC training of trainers program; provided senior, mid-level, and peripheral training for more than 600 Ministry of Health and Social Affairs (MOHSA) personnel; helped establish policies and plans for immunization, DDC, and malaria control; provided experienced members of PHC's technical review committee; helped develop a health information system (though a good deal of assistance is still needed); and contributed to the establishment of an integrated and greatly improved (but still struggling) health education service. Overall, the project's core health services of immunization, DDC, and malaria treatment have a relatively high potential for sustainability, but its support strategies did not fare so well. Training, health education, and the health information system will most likely continue to function as long as PHC services are provided.  However, the quality of these activities will surely erode without further expert assistance. Of the three, training is most able to stand on its own.  The fourth planned support strategy, operations research, never really got underway (nonetheless, MOHSA is currently considering initiating operations research). It would be a mistake to interpret the positive findings in this report as a guarantee that PHC services are secure.  Guinea, rebuilding its infrastructure for the past 10 years under the constraints of structural adjustment, remains economically vulnerable and infrastructurally weak.  Should the government be unable to fund or to find external funding for the $10 million needed to maintain and expand PHC services during the next 5 years, the results could be devastating. PHC resources are already being strained with the integration of the former CCCD health centers, especially in Conakry.  Moreover, UNICEF plans to phase out its support for immunization.  Due to the heavy consumption of drugs in Conakry, replacement drugs for the rural areas are in jeopardy.  If the drug system (the pillar of PHC) falters, the whole system could break down. The following lessons have been learned.  (1) Political commitment and leadership emanating from the highest levels of government and made visible to the public are indispensable to the success and continuity of health projects and programs.  (2) Appropriate management skills are crucial.  USAID/G did not have an experienced health project officer to manage the project, and CCCD/G had neither a project coordinator nor a technical officer experienced in USAID administration.  As a result, project management suffered.  (3) Sustainability must be sought by all parties from the very beginning of a project and continuously thereafter.  From the outset, one must ascertain present and future financial and material resource needs, and the durability of those resources.  (4) Development of support structures such as Guinea's Office of Studies, Planning, and Research (OSPR) must keep pace wit the development of health programs.  OSPR, charged with providing training, research, and statistical support to health programs, does not demonstrate the same dynamic force or aggressiveness as do the programs. This may be because of its position within the health hierarchy, or it may be a problem of resources, of mandate, or of leadership.

"Final external evaluation of a subproject (1986-12/91) to establish a private independent export credit insurance company, the Societe Marocaine d'Assurance a l'Exportation (SMAEX).  USAID support consisted of $1.2 million of TA and $8 million loan. SMAEX has been operating since 1/89. SMAEX has been unable to meet the subproject's unrealistic target of insuring 20% of all private exports.  However, SMAEX's record (around 6%) is not bad, and while it has not been possible to quantify SMAEX's impact on Moroccan markets, it is appears that SMAEX has the potential for playing a significant role in making Morocco's exports more competitive not only in the European Community, but in new markets elsewhere. SMAEX has established itself well as an independent organization, and its impact has certainly been greater than would have been the case if export credit insurance had continued to be offered by only one of the banks.  As an independent organization, SMAEX is able to offer its services to any and all exporters.  Perhaps more important is the increased financing available to exporters because now all banks can offer to discount export-related commercial paper covered by SMAEX insurance. Although SMAEX is a private entity, it is also a relative monopoly (Morocco's only supplier of export credit insurance) -- with the result that the usual incentives of competition do not contribute to improving its performance.  There appears to be little room for initiative or independence in the SMAEX organization; decisionmaking is highly centralized. SMAEX coverage is heavily concentrated on textiles (64%), firms in Casablanca (70%), and exports to the European Community (89%). SMAEX has not contributed as much as it might to helping explore markets outside the EC.  Recommendations address these issues.

"Evaluates the Land Use and Productivity Enhancement (LUPE) project to improve the profitability and sustainability of hillside agricultural production in Honduras.  Evaluation covers the period 2/89-5/93. Primary conclusions and recommendations are discussed below. (1) Technologies for soil conservation and production of basic grains are well integrated and adapted to meet project goals. LUPE is currently refining its technologies to increase efficiency and cost effectiveness and should emphasize these efforts with a view to replicability and sustainability. (2) LUPE's extension and training methodology is among the most advanced in Central America for a project of this type.  It could be improved through greater integration of the technology and extension components and more attention to the production system as a whole. (3) LUPE women extensionists are reaching larger numbers of clients at a faster rate than any other LUPE component.  LUPE's approach is gender-segregated, however, with women having access only to ""women's"" activities -- some of questionable appropriateness, cost effectiveness, and impact.  LUPE should strengthen its extension component by engaging extensionists, (women or men) who can deal with both household and field activities on a less segregated basis. (4) LUPE has introduced various basic grain storage techniques for different farm types.  These seem to be well accepted and appropriate. Fruit and vegetable processing (canning and drying) has met with limited success, however, because it is expensive and of little cultural value. Marketing fresh vegetables and fruits is an impressive and successful activity for increasing household incomes and should be emphasized for beneficiaries with production potential and access to markets. (5) LUPE's main problem, which caused delays in project implementation, has been resolved with the appointment of the current directorate.  Some aspects of organization and management could be improved, such as better logistical support (particularly transportation and autonomy over the use of discretionary funds at the regional level), and feedback for management and decision making. (6) LUPE should complete its requirements for collecting baseline data for monitoring and impact evaluation.  Minimum requirements should be determined and the missing information collected and replaced as quickly and efficiently as possible, from the least costly sources.  A geographic information system (GIS) is not needed.  The Planning, Monitoring, and Evaluation Unit (PMEU) should be strengthened and reclassified as a support unit within the organizational structure. (7) LUPE has leadership and a high proportion of dedicated, capable, and motivated staff at all levels.  The technical assistance team is carrying out its assigned role with good backstopping from the home office.  Project management and oversight are unusually good. (8) Original targets for LUPE are being scaled back based on numbers of potential beneficiaries and a better characterization of the project area.  Financial resources are being reshuffled to provide a stronger thrust for training of contact farmers by nongovernmental organizations. LUPE has an excellent chance of meeting its revised targets and attaining its objectives, assuming continued administrative stability and increased, less gender-segregated, technical assistance output.

"The Pakistan Social Marketing of Contraceptives (SMC) Project has made a number of substantial contributions toward furthering family planning objectives in Pakistan:  the condom has been desensitized on a national basis; the name of the project condom, ""Sathi,"" has become a generic term for a condom; there is wide recognition of the Sathi logo and its orange color; Sathi is now distributed nationally in both urban and semiurban areas; and Sathi has reached a significant sales volume -- a total of over 291 million Sathi have been sold since the beginning of the program's sales in 1986. The present organizational structure of the project, however, has inherent management difficulties and excess programmatic and financial oversight by the TA contractor, USAID, and the government of Pakistan. This has led to severe tensions and an overall lack of cooperation among the participants.  As a result, effective marketing, and planning for the future are no longer happening. The program's distributor is exerting minimal effort, and shortages of Sathi condoms have now begun to occur at the local distributor and retailer levels. The contracts for this project end in 9/93.  Given that no other low-priced condom exists in the marketplace in Pakistan, this program needs to continue.  USAID/Islamabad's intent is to incorporate the SMC program under the Private Sector Family Planning (PRIFAM) Project set to begin in late 1993.  Given current management problems, a less complex project structure can be designed, with the distributor having the sole responsibility for the management and marketing of the program.  Now that Sathi is an established product, TA is no longer needed to achieve sales objectives. Lessons learned include the following.  (1) The goal of selling a donated product to lower-end socioeconomic groups is incompatible with the goal of arriving at sustainability, certainly full sustainability. Before designing a project, USAID should give careful consideration to basic policy decisions as to how long and to what extent it is willing to subsidize the program.  (2) Overly complex social marketing programs have a greater chance of encountering programmatic problems and less chance of becoming sustainable.  The design of a social marketing project and its contractual deliverables should be kept as simple as possible (relative to local conditions) and closely in line with local commercial norms.  (3) When designing a social marketing project, it is best to contract only with a major, well-established distributor which already has its own sales force and is not dependent on the social marketing contract for the major portion of its business.  USAID should not have to pay a distributor the salaries to hire additional sales people or staff.  (4) The distributor/marketing firm hired to implement a social marketing program is chosen because of its local commercial experience and expertise and therefore should have control and authority over its own distribution/marketing activities.  The services of an outside TA contractor, if required at the beginning of a program, are intended to provide assistance (both to the distributor and USAID) and to transfer technology; TA should not be used to provide ""oversight."" The oversight of one firm by another actually blurs responsibilities and can create antagonism and distrust.  (5) The approval of a program's marketing plan by all interested parties can lead to long delays and can even cause the plan to become a political document.  Because of this possibility, a marketing plan should not be a contract deliverable; rather, a simple workplan not more than five pages long should be the deliverable.  The marketing plan should be the distributor's internal working document to assist in strategic marketing and in achieving the program's goals.  (6) A social marketing program's research is best used to determine how to market the product more effectively.  The amount of research conducted should be largely dictated by the marketing requirements of the product and initiated by the distributor. The expertise of local research firms should be appropriately utilized to design the research to assist in solving the marketing problems. Although monitoring and evaluation are legitimate needs of USAID, a disproportionate amount of research, time, and expense should not be utilized for this purpose.

"PACR of a project (1985-2/93) to develop integrated coastal resources management (CRM) plans in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) region. The project was a success.  Site-specific CRM plans were developed for each of the six ASEAN countries, 118 ASEAN professionals were trained, and 34 publications, including 281 working papers, were produced.  Increased institutional involvement in and political will toward sustainable coastal development were reflected by the inclusion of CRM plans in national economic development plans and a commitment to implement them.  The ASEAN governments now recognize the severity of resource use conflicts in their coastal zones and are prepared to help find solutions to them.  Each participating national government has implemented some of the project's recommendations. More than 200 national scientists, resource managers, and planners from over 47 institutions actively participated in various project activities, resulting in the development of a core group of professionals in each country equipped with technical knowhow in CRM. Public awareness of the importance of proper management of coastal areas also increased as project activities received both newspaper and television coverage. The project also served to identify economic opportunities that complement CRM, including the development of artificial reefs, tourism enhancement, aquaculture development, and improved waste management. Other successes of the project include: fostering regional collaboration, development of a CRM curriculum, and promotion of linkages among donor agencies, lending institutions, and the public and private sectors with respect to CRM. The project teaches three lessons.  (1) Because CRM is a many-faceted, multidisciplinary activity, it must include two mechanisms:  integration and coordination.  However, political and administrative realities make integrated implementation difficult, and in some cases unfeasible.  Realistically, CRM will have to be implemented by various sectoral agencies. Coordination of these agencies is therefore essential.  (2) The choice of a top-down or a bottom-up approach to planning depends on the political structure of a country. The bottom-up approach is more effective at the micro-level, because of the potential for greater community involvement, but should be done carefully in order to minimize negative effects such as unrealistic expectations by the communities.  (3) Hiring of consultants provided fresh insights in project design and implementation.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","6/1/1993 12:00:00 AM","","Regional development|Natural resource management|Coasts|Littoral zones|Beneficiary count","Southeast Asia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABG112.pdf","163 KB","007540 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to establish the Africa Growth Fund (AGF) as a closed-end U.S. limited partnership, with the mission of providing equity and quasi-equity financing to a small number of private enterprises in sub-Saharan Africa.  Interim evaluation covers the period 1989-12/92. The AGF faces serious cash flow problems, and it is questionable whether it will survive the middle years of its planned 15-year operating life without further financial subsidy.  The problems are attributable mainly to the fact that AGF was able to raise only $5 million of an expected $10 million in venture capital from passive limited partners.  The shortfall was due to, inter alia:  the narrow appeal of AGF's specialized issues; doubts about investing in Africa; and certain structural elements in AGF's prospectus, including a highly leveraged capital structure. This circumstance will profoundly influence strategies for managing the AGF.  The combination of interest due on the $20 million U.S. Government guaranteed credit line, a $625,000 fund management fee, and debt sinking fund (principal) payments will create a cash crunch throughout the mid-1990s which will have to be addressed through less desirable financial options, including, possibly, renegotiation of the terms of the credit line -- an implicit further financial subsidy. On the brighter side, AGF's investments are developing according to or better than planned and some are showing indications of positive economic performance.  AGF has committed approximately $14 million in 7 businesses in Ghana, Cote d'Ivoire, Kenya, and Botswana; AGF is expected to be fully invested by late 1993 or early 1994 with a total portfolio of 11 or 12 companies.  AGF management is to be commended for its careful selection of investments, for creating productive synergies among the ventures, markets, and business relationships represented in the AGF portfolio, and especially, for making the best of a difficult situation -- the financial challenges facing AGF would test the most competent venture capital managers.  Over 40% of AGF invested capital is in debt instruments versus equity positions, in part to generate operating income for the Fund in the years prior to equity positions maturing.  If the AGF can survive its middle years, it may prove profitable in the long run. It is recommended that A.I.D. withhold judgment as to the replicability of the AGF model until a track record of profitable operations has been demonstrated.  There is also a broader lesson to be derived from looking at the business of providing capital to small and medium-sized businesses in Africa.  Even in the United States, where the AGF venture capital model (high returns/high overhead/professional investors) is the most highly developed, it provides only a small proportion of the capital needs of small and medium-sized businesses; it is likely that in African business environment there is an even smaller market for such instruments -- probably only a small fraction of 1% of African business have the size, market potential, sophistication, growth prospects, management, capitalization and risk/reward trade-offs to attract a formal venture capital company.  To reach the heart of African business development needs, a mechanism is needed that can, on a self-sustaining private sector basis, deal with firms that are smaller, less sophisticated, need management and technological assistance, and have little access to formal commercial infrastructure.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-2206-Z-00-8191-00","","4/1/1993 12:00:00 AM","","Foreign investment|Investment promotion|Private enterprises|Finance|Venture capital","Africa south of Sahara","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABG126.pdf","1,792 KB","006499 - Price Waterhouse.

"Evaluates a multi-donor project to establish the African Management Services Company (AMSCO) to provide management training and services to African businesspersons.  Evaluation covers the period 1989-92. AMSCO's first 3 years of operations have failed to fulfill expectations; the erosion of its capital base due to heavy operating losses from $9 million in 12/88 to $3.3 million projected for the end of 1992 reflects this underperformance. The 13 projects contracted by AMSCO by 7/92 were substantially fewer than the 26 targeted for the fiscal year ending 12/91, and while recent efforts to secure additional business seem successful, with up to 20 contracts expected to be signed by the end of the year, the shortfall has reduced and delayed the effectiveness of the project, and contributed to accumulated losses and equity erosion. On the positive side, AMSCO has provided quality management personnel and training programs to 13 private, or to be privatized, enterprises, with generally good results.  While some projects have been discontinued for lack of progress, the cause was not the lack of quality of AMSCO programs, but the unwillingness of the company's directors or host government to fulfill the requirements of the business plan established at the start of each AMSCO project.  AMSCO can take pride in the fact that approximately seven of the companies that have been assisted have considerably improved their operating performance and seem to be achieving their objectives.  This modest success was achieved at a net cost to AMSCO of over $7 million, but the future flow of earnings should restore the equity and reduce average project costs. The principal reason AMSCO has failed to meet planned targets was its significant departure from the strategic plan laid out in its founding documents.  The Project Paper clearly states that AMSCO is a subcontractor to the International Finance Corporation (IFC).  As such, it depends on the ability of institutional investors, led by the IFC, to identify projects for AMSCO.  The institutional investors, however, for the most part, failed to refer projects to AMSCO.  As a consequence, AMSCO experienced great difficulty selling its services to African enterprises, because it was a new institution and lacked credibility and an established reputation in the business of managing African enterprises.  As a result of these problems, the Board of Directors appointed a new Managing Director, whose plan to reverse operating losses and renew AMSCO's relationships with its private and institutional shareholders appears to be working; there is a reasonable prospect that AMSCO can break even during 1993.  The new AMSCO projects seem to be of higher quality and have greater institutional investor support than many of the earlier ones.  Indeed, several give every appearance of being excellent private sector expansions for the countries involved. A key lesson learned is that, as an institution, AMSCO has three critical dependencies:  on institutional investors to refer projects; on private corporate shareholders to provide technology and market expertise for its projects; and on its donors, mainly the UNDP, to provide the concessional resources it can channel to African client firms.  Recognizing these dependencies, the Board of Directors and the IFC should review with AMSCO its fundamental strategy, with emphasis on the following elements. (1) By what criteria will AMSCO focus its resources and efforts? Profitability?  Institutional shareholder priorities?  (2) Is AMSCO to provide its flow of subsidies to any applicant, or only to selected companies?  If the latter, what should be the criterion of selection?  (3) Are the commitments by the institutional investors and the private shareholders sufficient to justify optimism about AMSCO's viability?

"Evaluates project to improve food grain research in semiarid Africa by establishing networks between national agricultural research systems (NARS) and international agricultural research centers (IARCs) (SAFGRAD project).  Impact evaluation, conducted 6 months after the project's 7/92 conclusion, is based on in-depth reviews of 8 of 26 participating countries. SAFGRAD research on maize and cowpea in West Africa has had substantial impact.  In Ghana, for example, the area in improved maize cultivars increased from 20% in 1982 to 55% in 1991.  From 1985-92, the annual social benefits (lower food prices for consumers, lower production costs for farmers) from maize research ranged from $5.5 million to $84 million, with an estimated rate of return of 73%.  The estimated social benefits for maintenance research on cowpea in Mali and Burkina Faso were from $800,000 to $12.3 million during the 1984-91 period.  While farm-level diffusion of new sorghum varieties was substantially less (possibly due to an overemphasis on breeding) than for maize and cowpea, S-35 has been successfully introduced into northern Cameroon -- where, over 7 years, social benefits are estimated to range from $288,000 to $831,000 -- and, more recently, into Chad. Since sorghum and millet productivity is critical to improving nutrition and raising agricultural income in much of sub-Saharan Africa, future research should focus on these two food grains, which are much more important than maize in drier areas such as the Sahel. SAFGRAD regional research networks have been a major mover of new technologies.  In the countries examined, about 50% of the maize and sorghum varieties and almost 75% of the released cowpea varieties had been in SAFGRAD trials.  These results are striking, given that varieties distributed through SAFGRAD cowpea trials represented only 14-54% of the total number of varieties tested in the five study countries.  The same trend exists for maize. The most significant spillover effects among the member countries of SAFGRAD networks occurred in the maize network, where nine varieties were adapted and released in one country and, in turn, tested and released in other countries.  The cowpea network had spillover of four varieties in the countries examined.  The West and Central Africa Sorghum Network had spillover of one variety, the Eastern African Sorghum Network of three. In West and Central Africa, a total of 103 new maize, sorghum, and cowpea cultivars were released, while in East Africa, 26 new sorghum and millet technologies were released in two study countries (Ethiopia and Kenya).  The proportion of germplasm contributed by the NARS to SAFGRAD trials has also increased, accounting at present for about 50% of cowpea germplasm and 60% of sorghum germplasm (maize is not indigenous to Africa).  These results confirm the networks' success in sharing technology between countries and the increasing role of the NARS in the networking process. Significant building of research capacity has occurred.  More than 30 scientists received M.S. or Ph.D. training, and several are now research leaders in their respective countries.  In addition, short-term training was provided to nearly 400 NARS researchers and technicians in more than 22 countries, and 165 individuals participated in scientific monitoring tours to NARS or IARC programs.  SAFGRAD also:  organized biennial conferences and network meetings attended by more than 2,500 researchers and produced about 500 publications -- 52% on technology generation and 48% on technology transfer. Despite this increase in research capacity, the operating funds made available to researchers have declined significantly in the last 10 years; national policymakers need to be made aware of the high social benefits of agricultural research such as are exhibited by SAFGRAD, especially since they will have to bear an increasing share of research costs.  There is also a need to keep NARS (especially the smaller ones) linked to the international scientific network and to keep the work of the NARS free from domestic political pressures.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","5/1/1993 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural research|Varietal research|Technology transfer|Food crops|Semiarid zone|Sorghum|Millet|Maize|Cowpeas|Research organizations|Institutional linkages|Socioeconomic aspects|Economic impact|Beneficiary count","Africa south of Sahara|Burkina Faso|Cameroon|Ethiopia|Ghana|Kenya|Mali|Niger|Nigeria|West Africa|Central Africa|East Africa","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNABP430.pdf","2,526 KB","005019 - Organization of African Unity.

"PACR of a project (1985-7/92) to provide socially and economically disadvantaged Guatemalans with long- and short-term U.S. training in a variety of sectors, along with follow-on in-country training and an experience of U.S. democracy (CAPS project). Thanks to careful monitoring by the Mission, the program successfully recruited a high percentage of disadvantaged persons, including women. Virtually all scholarships targeted rural groups, including teachers, cooperative leaders, community development representatives, health and education promoters, civil servants, small entrepreneurs, and agribusiness representatives and trainers.  A ""groups-in Spanish"" model was effectively used in short-term programs for indigenous participants for whom Spanish is a second or more remote language. All in all, some 5,000 persons received training, of whom 47% were women and 10% attended Historically Black Colleges and Universities. Short-term training included (1) 5 weeks of U.S. technical training for 4,108 participants who represented all of Guatemala's rural areas and who, as part of a follow-on exercise, implemented 45 rural development projects; and (2) four 1-week modules of follow-on training for 2,000 of these participants, of whom 1,800 completed all four modules.  Long-term U.S. training included:  9-month technical training for 450 students; 1-year academic training for 350 university students; 2-year academic training for 50 professionals; and 4-year academic training for 50 university students. The project has created a Student Association (ASOPAZAC) to which the majority of students belong and which is legally recognized. The Association has a Board of Directors in each of the 22 departments of Guatemala; seven Presidents from these Boards have formed a National Coordination Committee, which meets several times a year to solve community problems or implement projects. The departmental affiliate associations are particularly active. A newsletter written by the students and published every 2 months was distributed to all returnees throughout the country. Returned Junior-Year-Abroad Scholars have formed an advisory committee which has provided voluntary technical services to the Boards of Directors of ASOPAZAC and to individual members on request; this committee also assisted in monitoring the 45 rural projects undertaken by short-term participants as part of the follow-on component. ASOPAZAC's Job Support Office has offered voluntary administrative services to its 9-month participant members, and placed more than 100 students with institutions in the private and public sectors. The following lessons were learned.  (1) Informal short-term training of rural dwellers committed to the growth and development of their communities is a wise use of resources; trainees are actively producing the economic and social changes that will contribute to Guatemala's long-term development.  (2) The project was managed by a Guatemalan institution rather than an institutional contractor.  This kept management costs down (2% of project funds) and allowed the project to reach more people. (3) Impact evaluations have proven that the Experience America Component achieved its expected impact.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","4/1/1993 12:00:00 AM","","Rural areas|Disadvantaged groups|Participants|Education for development|Beneficiary count","Guatemala","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABG187.pdf","124 KB","008550 - USAID.

"Final external evaluation of Phase III of a project (10/87-4/93) to develop human resources in the West Bank and Gaza.  The project was implemented by AMIDEAST. The chief obstacle to success continued to be the destabilizing effects of the Israeli occupation.  Specific findings are as follows. (1) Faculty development shows tangible results.  About 65% of M.S. and Ph.D. degree holders in the faculties of local universities received their degrees through the project, which also funded 36 studies by faculty.  However, while the research sponsored had intellectual merit, its application to the practical problems addressed by the AMIDEAST program was not always evident.  Institutional development of the universities is problematic, as they struggle to recover from the extended closures caused by political turmoil (all universities had reopened by 6/92). (2) Health personnel training reportedly had favorable impacts at the individual and institutional levels; site visits confirm its benefits at the service delivery level.  A solid nucleus of medical reference collections has been established, which some assisted institutions are making the effort to maintain.  The objective of improving bed/clinic and patient/staff ratios was beyond the project's scope. (3-4) While interviews and field visits elicited substantial anecdotal evidence of positive change from institutional development efforts, objective assessment was hampered the fact that AMIDEAST maintains neither baseline nor progress indicators on this component. The situation in the professional development component was similar. (5) AMIDEAST has enhanced the ability of several key institutions to deliver training and TA to small businesses; however, the training needs to be more focused and prioritized based on employment effects in productive sectors.  AMIDEAST is instituting measures along these lines, including establishing a monitoring system to track performance indicators for small business training. (6) Except in the case of the Business Development Center at Bethlehem University, efforts to strengthen linkages between universities and the business community were not fruitful. Neither side showed much enthusiasm for the concept, and it proved to be more labor-intensive for AMIDEAST than anticipated. The extended closure of the universities was a serious obstacle. AMIDEAST has redesigned the activity to support new continuing education centers for businesspersons; this new focus holds promise. (7) There were numerous difficulties in implementing the English as a Second Language component, including evacuation of staff during the Gulf War and problems in finding suitable local partner institutions. Nevertheless, the program is the only one of its kind in the area and serves an important need; the search for good local partners should continue.  (8) The basic education program is an innovative effort, and initial results are quite positive (the program is in the start-up phase).  The program should be continued, as it could probably be expanded to include public schools if and when Palestinian autonomy takes hold. Overall, the demnads for implementing the multiple components of the project distracted attention from the project's principal purpose of strengthening institutional capacity.  AMIDEAST needs a formal system for tracking indicators in order to demonstrate the impact of its philosophy of strengthening institutions through individiual skills training and professional development. The project taught the following lessons.  (1) Promoting institutional development under the burden of military occupation poses numerous challenges, some of which are beyond the scope of projects of this type.  (2) Given the number of variables affecting organizational development, even in smaller organizations, it is not always clear to what extent specific changes are due to the project.  (3) Strategic planning is an important tool for managing large and complex projects, especially in unstable environments.  (4) Project managers have ongoing responsibilities for project monitoring and evaluation, and these responsibilities need to be carefully defined, as was not the case in this project.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","PDC-5317-I-19-8122-00","","5/1/1993 12:00:00 AM","","Education for development|Universities and colleges|Teacher education|Faculty|Business support services|Basic education|Institution building","Gaza Strip|West Bank","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABG378.pdf","3,000 KB","003970 - Management Systems International, Inc.

"PACR of a project activity to identify, through a workshop, areas of competition and possible coordination between U.S. and Japanese companies doing environmental and energy (E & E) related business in Asia. Sixteen U.S. and ten Japanese development practitioners participated in the workshop, which was held in 9/92 in Seattle, Washington. Although the Project was initially to generate 12 papers, 6 each from Japanese and U.S. development practitioners, 10 papers were actually presented at the workshop, 5 from each country.  Workshop participants visited the Weyerhaeuser Corporation's Rochester Forest Regeneration project.  No immediate developmental impact was derived from the project. Lessons learned are:  (1) Nongovernmental and noncorporate entities are best suited for environment projects because there are no direct political or economic interests involved. Additionally, NGOs and other nonprofits are more likely to realize the ""plus sum"" outcomes of E & E programs.  (2) Commercial competition between Japan and the U.S. has reduced cooperation for E & E programs in developing countries.  (3) U.S. NGOs should be encouraged by A.I.D. to implement joint energy and environmental studies and activities with counterparts in developing Asian countries.  (4) U.S.-funded NGOs should be encouraged to work with Japanese-funded NGOs to influence Japanese government policy making. (5) E & E projects that are jointly and multilaterally funded should be developed because this will promote international contract completion. (6) Japan budget surpluses and clean air technology expertise should be combined with the positive image the U.S. has earned for delivering technical assistance to implement E & E projects in developing countries.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","7/1/1993 12:00:00 AM","","Private enterprises|Energy resource development|Environmental aspects|Workshops|International cooperation","Japan|USA","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABG231.pdf","66 KB","006974 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (9/85-6/92) to help the Government of Jordan (GOJ) construct and equip compulsory level (Grades 1-10) schools throughout Jordan. The project succeeded in constructing, furnishing, and equipping 48 schools (vs. 40 targeted), including 1,360 classrooms, plus associated libraries, laboratories, meetings halls, laboratories, offices, and playgrounds, to accommodate some 42,000 students (5.8% of the compulsory level population) who had previously been taught in overcrowded rented facilities (usually converted residences).  The new schools have produced desired improvements in space:student ratio (now 2.7 sq.m per student) and the student:teacher ratio (25:1). All the schools follow a standard design, and all services, including design, construction, construction supervision, and supply of equipment and furniture were contracted with Jordanian firms.  Because the previous facilities were rented, the savings in costs from the new schools are significant, and have been used by the GOJ to construct other school facilities. Implementation was delayed somewhat due to devaluation of the Jordanian currency in 1988 and later the Gulf War, causing the PACD to be extended 9 months. There were three principal lessons learned.  First, the Project Agreement included a covenant that all project schools should be used for students at the compulsory level.  Due to lack of secondary schools in rural areas, however, some schools have accommodated students in grades 11 and 12.  The lesson is that, in rural areas, it is not possible to build schools specifically for one level of education or another. Second, the modified fixed amount reimbursement method proved appropriate and efficient for construction financing, but not for procurement of furniture and equipment; cost-reimbursement should be used in future procurements.  Third, if properly selected, Jordanian firms are capable of adequate construction and construction supervision.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1993 12:00:00 AM","","Primary schools|Building construction|Classrooms","Jordan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABG233.pdf","925 KB","008564 - USAID.

"The reorientation and restructuring of the agricultural sectors in Poland, Hungary, Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Bulgaria -- the five Eastern European countries receiving assistance through the A.I.D./U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Restructuring Agriculture and Agribusiness project -- are moving forward at an uneven pace.  The changes occurring in these countries are profound.  In a very short time, the agricultural economies of these countries have been turned upside down.  Some, such as Poland's, are doing well.  Others, such as Bulgaria's, have far to go before the benefits of a market economy can affect most of the population.  In all of the countries there are formidable obstacles to achieving the basic goal -- internationally competitive agricultural sectors that can assure domestic consumers both a dependable supply of basic foodstuffs and a wider assortment of high quality, reasonably priced food products. USDA activities have successfully met the overall objectives of assisting governmental agencies to perform tasks necessary for the efficient and effective functioning of a market economy.  In some cases, such as the extension activity in Poland, the project has met these objectives in an exceptional manner.  The USDA programs are providing essential skills and resources at critical points within governmental structures to support the development of strong private sectors and market-based economies. Overall, the project has been cost-effective and timely in carrying out its operations, although some suggestions to increase cost-effectiveness could be considered. The programs established by USDA have addressed major needs of the countries in important ways.  Assistance activities have been in priority areas and have usually received good government support.  The exceptions are activities in Hungary, where the Economic Research Service (ERS)-supported situation and outlook report activities were canceled because of lack of host country support, and the difficult yet essential task of agricultural research restructuring in Poland. Post-project sustainability of project activities seems assured for all nonpilot activities.  A mutual review of the pilot activities will decide whether they warrant continued support.  It is too early to judge sustainability in the Bulgarian projects as they are just beginning. Further, long-term host country plans for agricultural services in Bulgaria have not been confirmed, leaving decisions on services and funding uncertain. The USDA activities have been well coordinated with host country priorities and  adequately coordinated with assistance provided by other donors, though this coordination is an area of continuing concern.  In a few cases, primarily in Bulgaria, potential conflicts in donor activity were noted.  However, given the early stages of these activities and, most importantly, the desire of field staff to coordinate activities, these potential conflicts may not materialize. Programs in operation for several years (extension in Poland, and ERS in Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Poland) have had measurable impacts. The short-term work on heavy metal contamination in Bulgaria also has had an important impact.  The other activities are either of a pilot nature or, like most activities in Bulgaria, not yet fully underway. While the bulk of the project's resources are directed toward governmental agencies (the agribusiness marketing seminars being the principal exception), many activities have had positive impacts on the private sector.  Examples include a business plan for a new private milk plant set up with extension service assistance, private investment decisions made using situation and outlook reports, and private slaughterhouses working with the Agricultural Marketing Service in setting up grades and standards for pig carcasses.  Private sector spin-offs related to the USDA activities (such as a private sector farmer information system) are being considered by private investors but little has occurred to date.

"Midterm evaluation of a cooperative agreement to help the American Institute for Free Labor Development (AIFLD) expand its activities in El Salvador.  Evaluation covers the period through 4/93. In the past AIFLD has seen both radical antiunionists and radical non-democratic unionists as equal threats to the development of a pluralistic society in which democratic unions played an important role. With the end of the civil war, the leftist threat to democratic trade unionism has diminished. While AIFLD had proposed to establish a centralized training facility, lower level training has been carried out by the individual unions and federations, although training content varied little. Inter-organizational political differences appear to be the principal barrier to centralized union-cooperative training.  AIFLD's cooperative administration courses have played an important role in helping cooperatives become viable agribusiness operations. AIFLD has provided administrative support for client union federations during the project, the first year with few controls over spending, the second based on real budgets, and the third focused on weaning the union federations from this support and/or assisting organizations in setting up programs to make them self- sufficient. Rural sector agribusiness components involving the sale of fertilizer to member cooperatives and the marketing of sesame have been supported by AIFLD through bank-rate loans to cooperative organizations and should lead one federation to self- sufficiency within the year. Union Nacional de Obreros y Campesino's (UNOC) capabilities (regarding its credibility within the democratic labor's positions on national issues) have been unquestionably strengthened through the project.  The key has been the hiring of excellent, dedicated technical people (one economist and two lawyers), who have not only helped to strengthen UNOC as a respected labor organization but who have also played a crucial role in the viability of the Intergremial (under UNOC leadership) and of the Foro (again, under UNOC leadership).  However, this team's important role in assisting UNOC in these roles means they have had less time for other tasks also important to UNOC. AIFLD achieved just four of ten new collective bargaining agreements planned, although the construction union agreement covered the largest union in El Salvador.  The distrust of unions by the private sector coupled with the focus of unions on political questions hindered the achievement of this objective. AIFLD successfully provided small loans to the rural and urban poor through village banks (rural) and microenterprise programs (urban). AIFLD learned this program from other agencies but now requires no further assistance in running the program.  The program is progressing toward self-sufficiency.

"Because Honduras possesses classic political and socioeconomic characteristics of early developing countries, A.I.D.'s experience there with judicial reform through its Administration of Justice (AOJ) program holds particular relevance for replication.  This report reviews the program's origins, impacts to date, management, and overall strategy, and presents the following lessons learned.  (1) Merit-based rather than patronage-based career service is a major tenet of judicial reform in the region.  However, because such reform regularly faces opposition, alternative strategies to ensure professional judicial appointments and performance should be considered in some countries.  (2) The sustainability of judicial reform depends on support from political coalitions, both inside and outside the judicial system.  (3) The creation and maintenance of such coalitions requires a high level of TA best delivered by a staff endowed with the experience, stature, and diplomatic skill needed to work with elite members of the judiciary. (4) Special focus should be given to developing strategies that will spread the benefits of the law to larger segments of the population. (5) Given Honduras' political volatility, diversified investments in both the judiciary and the NGO sector may increase the sustainability of judicial reform.  (6) Because legal development programs are politically sensitive, USAID Missions should exercise tight control over the provision of TA.  (7) The Honduran AOJ program demonstrates the feasibility of donor-host country cooperation in addressing politically sensitive issues. The assessment concludes that the program is reaching a critical threshold at which the good faith and commitment of the Government of Honduras will have to be fully evident if reforms are to proceed.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","7/1/1993 12:00:00 AM","","Judicial reform|Judiciary","Honduras","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAX267.pdf","136 KB","000436 - Development Associates, Inc.","","006917 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of a project (8/84-8/93) to strengthen the Sri Lankan Department of Agriculture's (DOA) capacity to generate and transfer to small farmers technologies and seeds required to improve the production of subsidiary food crops (SFCs -- coarse grains, oilseeds, pulses, etc). The project has been very effective and worthwhile, particularly after its redesign in 1990 in response to the second interim evaluation. The DOA's capacity to develop and transfer useful agricultural technology to farmers has been significantly strengthened through the addition of highly trained personnel, the purchase of construction and technical equipment, the Special Projects Fund, and long- and short-term TA. New varieties of eight different SFCs have been developed and released, and a technical guide for cultivating SFCs and other crops has been produced.  Data on technology adoption by farmers are scarce, but there is clear evidence of field impact, e.g., mungbean and cowpea cultivation under scarce water conditions and use of improved onion storage techniques.  Although full realization of the project's income, employment and nutrition goals will take time, benefits have already begun to accrue. Yields varied little between 1985-92, but area planted to mungbean, big onion, and cowpea increased significantly.  Income and employment increased apace, while nutrition will improve with greater availability of protein-rich mungbeans and cowpea. During the project, the Government of Sri Lanka (GSL) adopted a number of policy shifts relating to SFC promotion, and the use of more market-oriented instruments to do so.  The project responded, particularly since its extension, by emphasizing:  use of private sector seed enterprises to replace DOA seed production; high-value horticultural export crops rather than low-value field crops; market satisfaction rather than import substitution; demand-driven, rather than scientist-set research priorities; farm incomes and employment rather than food production; and use of mass communications for technology transfer.  These strategy shifts produced good results.  Private sector capacity for seed production and marketing; the private sector satisfied 10% of the demand for purchased rice seed in one season and is expected to provide 25% by the end of Yala (the summer rainy seasons), 1993 and 98% by Yala, 1994.  Private enterprises now produce and market twice as much chili seed as the DOA and will produce five times as much next year. The project's main drawback, and the DOA's chief area of weakness, was inadequate attention to farm-level impacts and market concerns in its research planning.  The DOA needs a good system for measuring and reporting field-level impacts; lack of one inhibited project evaluation and prevents the DOA from receiving credit for its work.  The DOA also needs to find new ways to finance the recurrent costs which were picked up by the project.  All in all, however, it appears that the substance of the A.I.D. project will be sustained under the DOA. Lessons learned include the following.  (1) Emphasizing sustainability in rice production does not preclude attention to other crops.  (2) Lack of technology was just one factor limiting production of SFCs; profitability, derived from market demand and organization, was and remains critical.  (3) Use of the World Bank's Training and Visit (T&V) extension system proved costly and unsustainable.  (4) By evolving along with changing GSL policy, the project improved its impact.  (5) An undesirable effect of donor funding is insulation from the domestic funding competition which requires client participation in agency agenda setting.  (6) Baseline surveys seldom fulfill their objectives; periodic monitoring using sampling techniques is preferable.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","5/1/1993 12:00:00 AM","","Crop diversification|Crop production|Food crops|Technology transfer|Agricultural research|Agricultural extension|Research management|Government departments|Institution building","Sri Lanka","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABG391.pdf","3,856 KB","001335 - Chemonics International Consulting Div.","","008606 - USAID.

"Evaluates a project to help India's National Bureau of Plant Genetic Resources (NBPGR) to develop a national plant germplasm resources system.  Mid-term evaluation covers the period 8/88-6/93. Implementation, delayed by technical and bureaucratic problems until 1991, has proceeded apace since the signing of a PASA with the U.S. Department of Agriculture for the participant training component and a contract with Winrock International to manage the construction and equipment procurement components.  The project's goal will, at least in principle, be achieved through the activities of NBPGR and its affiliated regional centers and base stations under the direction of its dynamic leader.  A basic functional system in already in place. A great deal has been achieved since 1991.  Construction of the Gene Bank began in 9/92 and should be completed by 12/94; however, more must be done to ensure that the building will be adequately furnished.  A contract to construct greenhouse, screenhouse, and quarantine facilities at New Delhi, Hyderabad, and Bhowali has been approved, although the Government of India (GOI) is having second thoughts about the proposed fourth site, in the Andaman Islands.  The evaluation team feels that a quarantine facility in this offshore location is critical and should be pursued, possibly in a scaled-down version; it presents a one-time opportunity for the GOI to build good research facilities for the Indian Council for Agricultural Research at Andaman.  Also, if at all possible A.I.D. should agree to the construction of greenhouse-screenhouse facilities in Kanpur. Equipment for new and existing NBPGR facilities has still not been procured, however.  Also, more equipment is needed than has been budgeted for. After overcoming initial problems in obtaining clearances for Indian scientists, the U.S. training program is proceeding successfully and should reach completion as planned; however, more training may be needed after termination of the PASA.  In addition, in-country workshops have been conducted on such topics as germplasm collection, evaluation, and maintenance and computer-based information management, and participants from 10 countries participated in a 1991 regional training program. Training of both Indian and regional personnel will be a significant component of the NBPGR program after facilities are fully functional. The NBPGR's operational program of collection, evaluation, documentation, and storage is difficult and complex.  The team found a high level of ambition, enthusiasm, and progress on the part of staff. Collections of several crops have been rejuvenated, samples sent to long-term storage, and catalogs prepared.  The creation of Crop Advisory Committees to develop protocols and procedures for crop collection, evaluation, and documentation is urged. The NBPGR germplasm system has a good potential for sustainability and, being a center of national importance, should perhaps be elevated to the status of the National Research Institutes.  Also, serious consideration should be given to a successor to the current Director, whose tenure runs out in a few years.  It is also recommended that A.I.D. extend the project for several years, since, due to the initial delays, A.I.D. support is scheduled to terminate at the very beginning of the operational phase.","Delivery order no. 14","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-1406-I-00-0034-00","","6/1/1993 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural research|Genetic resource conservation|Germplasm|Plant resources|Institution building","India","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABG402.pdf","1,507 KB","006958 - International Resources Group (IRG)","","008557 - USAID.

"Evaluates grant to Private Agencies Collaborating Together/South Africa (PACT/SA) to strengthen South Africa's NGO sector. Midterm evaluation covers the period 10/91-3/93. PACT/SA has undertaken more than 40 activities, involving some 300 individuals, with 30 NGOs in three geographical regions.  Of these 300 persons, 54% were women and 79% were Black; of the 30 NGOs, 26 were Black-led organizations. More importantly, PACT/SA has established its credibility by adopting a low profile approach, working systematically with NGOs and respecting their needs, hiring a staff composed of Black African women, and utilizing trainers, facilitators, and advisors from within South Africa -- thereby allaying South African fears of being dictated to by outsiders.  PACT/SA should remain actively involved in South Africa and build on this credibility by adopting a more proactive, catalytic approach. At present, 20,000-40,000 South African organizations claim the title NGO.  Not all of these will survive.  NGOs face tremendous problems in South Africa's transition toward a post-apartheid society, including lack of a facilitative legal framework, of national and regional support structures, and of shared vision of the role they can play in development.  Some NGOs look on PACT as a resource center, thus increasing the burden on its already overtaxed staff.  Additional staff should be hired.  However, PACT/SA should not extend its current mandate, but should extend its services to include more USAID recipients, especially NGOs whose programs focus on community-based development.  Also, because South African NGOs are isolated from their counterparts in other regions of Africa and around the world, PACT/SA should expand support for visits abroad and invite foreign NGOs to South Africa. Other recommendations are that PACT/SA:  (1) help NGOs expand their efforts to address widespread illiteracy among Black South Africans, which poses a major threat to community development; (2) promote NGO institutional development by increasing training of trainer opportunities; and (3) support the emergence of indigenous NGO support structures. Finally, donors, once generous in supporting the struggle against apartheid, are transferring funding elsewhere and implementing new modalities such as African regional funding, which may put Black-led groups at a disadvantage.  USAID should facilitate a donor roundtable to discuss issues relevant to the emerging NGO development sector.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1993 12:00:00 AM","","Indigenous private voluntary organizations|Institution building|Disadvantaged groups|Local groups","South Africa","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABG404.pdf","1,511 KB","","","008605 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to increase family planning (FP) and prevent sexually transmitted diseases (STDs)/AIDS in Guinea.  Mid-term evaluation covers 8/91-4/93. Early informational and promotional activities by Population Services International (PSI), working in collaboration with the public sector National AIDS Committee (NAC) and the private Guinean Association for Family Well Being (AGBEF), have given the project good momentum.  These efforts have been effective in launching Guinea's first major multi-media IEC campaign, which has focused on AIDS education and condom promotion; 14 TV and 32 radio spots have been aired in 5 languages, backed up by other educational materials.  Public awareness of AIDS, STDs, and condoms has increased, at least in coastal areas and cities touched by national media; however, more work is needed to translate this awareness into condom use by the general population, not just high-risk groups.  The project is beginning to move into FP messages, but, again, much more work must be done before promotion of oral contraceptives is begun. The IEC program also has an interpersonal communications component, which includes FP education via AGBEF and AIDS education via NAC.  The latter has trained 593 community leaders who have conducted 1,800 educational sessions, reaching over 66,500 people nationwide.  NAC is also addressing the concerns of conservative religious groups and has taken the lead in reaching young people, the project's main target group, though more is needed in this area. In the social marketing component, PSI, unable to find a local distributor, has recruited its own sales staff and sold some 2.1 million condoms to urban wholesalers and retailers, first to pharmacies, then later to less traditional outlets -- bars, night clubs, hotels, and small shops; it is unknown, however, how many have actually been sold to consumers.  Considerably more effort is needed to convert awareness into actual use, and it is unlikely that targets for couple-years-of-protection will be met. To date, marketing efforts have focused on promoting condoms for AIDS prevention; sale of orals is just beginning. The objective to integrate FP into the Ministry of Health's primary health care (PHC) program is daunting because of the underfunded, overburdened nature of the PHC program.  Efforts were further complicated when the MOH asked PSI to work in outlying regions rather than the more populous and accessible coastal regions or Conakry.  PSI is rising to the challenge by supporting MOH-AGBEF collaboration in training, IEC, and program monitoring.  A major project contribution has been its assistance in the production of MOH-approved national norms, standards, and training modules for integrating FP into PHC.  These have been used in training 100 workers from 50 health centers and 34 supervisors, but it is too early for these efforts to have had much impact at the community level. The project has assisted in developing a national population policy and a family code, the latter with far-reaching implications for reproductive rights and the status of women. (Some women's groups view the project as male-oriented because of its high-profile promotion of condoms, but this perception should change as other aspects of the project become more visible.) PSI's project management has been lacking in some areas, but signs of improvement are becoming evident.  AGBEF, for its part, has made a valuable contribution.  The need for surgical clinical services (IUD and sterilization) presents an opportunity for further work on its part, but its management structure is too sorely stretched to respond.","Evaluation summary: PD-ABH-228|Project title: Population technical assistance (POPTECH)","Special Evaluation","Documents","DPE-3024-Z-00-8078-00","","7/1/1993 12:00:00 AM","","Family planning promotion programs|Family planning services|Public health care|Private health care|IEC|Commercial retail sale of contraceptives|Social marketing|Integrated health care|Sexually transmitted diseases|Condoms|HIV/AIDS|Family planning policy|Family planning education|Health education","Guinea","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABG405.pdf","5,387 KB","006243 - Dual & Associates, Inc.|000673 - International Science and Technology Institute, Inc.

"Evaluates project to increase the capacity of public and private family planning (FP) agencies in developing countries to design and implement FP training programs for paramedical, auxiliary, and community (PAC) personnel.  The project is being implemented by the Program for International Training in Health (INTRAH) and Development Associates, Inc. (DAI).  Interim evaluation covers the period 9/89-2/93. Both contractors have made very good, if not excellent, progress. INTRAH has carried out much of planned work in spite of weak institutional structures in Africa, and DA's work, particularly in India and the Philippines, appears to be on target.  Both have identified strengthening training capability as their top priority; INTRAH is also addressing training needs generated by advances in contraceptive technology.  However, several topics have been insufficiently addressed in project training, including supervision techniques, use of service statistics, client counseling, use of surveys and focus group interviews, and targeting of adolescents and men.  Both contractors have included some training in AIDS and sexually transmitted diseases as a component of clinical training. Both contractors have focused on in-service training and have typically delivered high quality training that utilizes a range of educationally sound training methodologies and relies on competency-based strategies measured against performance standards. Both have also:  (1) been involved in producing, revising, and distributing culturally appropriate field-tested materials, many of which have been translated into major languages; (2) developed extensive strategies and methods for evaluating training; (3) worked successfully to increase the capabilities of client institutions; (4) demonstrated, at the micro level, that their assistance has affected acceptor rates, method mix, numbers of referrals, and provider skills and knowledge; and (5) significantly influenced policies, norms, and regulations regarding the quality and availability of FP services. Both contractors have well-qualified, experienced staff (although the INTRAH regional office in Nairobi is understaffed) and have collaborated effectively with other A.I.D. contractors, USAID Missions, and donor agencies, though to a lesser degree with each other.  Problems of conflicting mandates have been most effectively resolved at the country level. Less positively, both contractors have experienced difficulty working with A.I.D./W.  (1) The Agency's daily participation in management and frequent informational requests have been disruptive.  (2) The new Priority Country Strategy, which focuses on the larger countries in each region and was developed after the project contracts were let, has forced the contractors to reprogram in certain areas.  (3) A.I.D. has separate offices for health and for population and separate cooperative agreements for these areas; this can make it difficult to provide integrated assistance in countries where ""family health"" rather than FP is the priority.  (4) Both contractors have been receiving only 65-70% of planned budgets.  As a result, the project has experienced an endless cycle of replanning and rebudgeting, stretching personnel to the limit and leaving them without a long-term planning horizon. A follow-on is clearly warranted.","Project title: Population technical assistance (POPTECH)","Special Evaluation","Documents","DPE-3024-Z-00-8078-00","","7/1/1993 12:00:00 AM","","Family planning services|Paramedical education|Institution building","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABG407.pdf","1,281 KB","000673 - International Science and Technology Institute, Inc.

"Final evaluation of a subproject (SP) to reduce fertility rates in Egypt.  Evaluation covers the period 1987-1993. As the SP entered its second year, approximately 2.9 million couples were practicing family planning (FP), representing a contraceptive prevalence rate (CPR) of 37.6%; by 1992, CPR had risen to 47.1%. Although the MOH was only one contributor to this progress, its successful achievement of SP outputs made it a principal contributor. With USAID's support, the MOH has established FP clinics in 21 governorates; provided contraceptive technology training to 6,000 doctors and 7,000 nurses; developed and implemented FP management systems for planning, monitoring, supervision, management information, and commodities management at the central, governorate, district, and service provider levels; trained MOH staff at each of those levels in those new systems; developed a motivated, skilled cadre of full-time FP service providers; and improved the quality of FP services. Most importantly, it provided FP services to over 500,000 clients each year from 1988-91; in 1992 over 600,000 clients were served. Government leadership, from the President, to the Minister of Health, and to Undersecretaries of Health, has supported the national population effort and FP. Challenges remain, however.  Fertility in rural Upper Egypt remains much higher than the national rate, and women there are less likely to have prenatal care or be assisted at delivery by a doctor, trained midwife, or nurse.  In 1991, the infant mortality rate in rural Upper Egypt was almost double that of rural Lower Egypt and significantly higher than that in urban Upper Egypt. In addition, the MOH FP program at present is essentially a one method (IUD) program.  The number and variety of long-lasting methods should be expanded to include progestin-only contraceptives in their oral, injectable, and implant forms. Also, gender roles in Egypt constrain service delivery in rural areas.  First, female physicians are led to seek work in urban areas; and, second, due to cultural norms governing privacy, clients (especially in Upper Egypt) seek female providers and/or refuse FP (particularly IUDs) when provided by a male physician. The following lessons were learned.  (1) Although provision of quality FP services requires a great deal of effort, attention, and commitment, it need not be not capital intensive; a clean, one-room clinic equipped with very minimal equipment and staffed with trained and caring professionals who listen to and communicate with their clients, can offer high-quality FP services.  (2) Public sector management can learn from the private sector how to stay competitive in the total FP market. In Egypt, the MOH learned from the quality focus of the Clinical Services Improvement SP (also under the Egypt Population/FP II Project) of the Egyptian FP Association, and has steadily upgraded the quality of MOH services even though quality per se has not been a focus of this SP. (3) Service statistics based on couple years of protection measure distribution of contraceptives rather than clients served or reduced fertility.  A more precise assessment of contribution to reduced fertility can be achieved with client-based service statistics.

"Final evaluation of a subproject (under the Population/Family Planning II project 263-0144) to upgrade the quality and quantity of family planning (FP) services in the Egyptian FP Association (EFPA), the country's foremost FP private voluntary organization (PVO).  The evaluation covers the period 6/87-3/93. Through the end of 1992, the subproject (SP) had established 17 primary centers and 95 subcenters in 17 governorates; served 298,091 new FP clients; and provided another 311,731 related services.  The SP's principal contribution has been the establishment of high-quality centers which have spearheaded a national emphasis on the quality of FP services.  Although the quality of the SP services has been excellent, the cost of such quality has been high, relative to MOH costs.  The SP's establishing, equipping, and furnishing of clinics and offices has been extravagant and has included equipment not essential to FP or other related services.  The SP centers are also very underutilized for FP. It is unclear why the offered high-quality services are so underutilized.  Institutional and management turmoil is one possible explanation; market demand is another. No professional research was undertaken to develop a market profile on proposed FP products, places, prices, or promotion. In its struggle to be successful in an increasingly competitive FP market, the SP has resorted to negative advertising and dissemination of false information which have the potential to create medical barriers to FP rather than promote greater acceptance and use of the program as a whole. USAID should fund market research conducted by an independent, qualified firm to determine if there is a long-term market for the SP. Unless the research shows that there is a clear and sufficient market niche for the SP to be self-financing, USAID should phase out all funding for the SP over the next two years. The SP should immediately cease its negative advertising and false information. Constraints include the fact that the SP evolved in incremental steps rather than being designed as a strategic whole; and that the SP assumed that its principal competitor, the MOH, offered limited FP services and that they were of poor quality.  In fact, the MOH was rapidly expanding and improving its services in the same cities and at the same time the SP was developing. The following lessons were learned.  (1) A single project, although not itself successful, may have a highly positive impact upon the total FP program.  (2) Continual project modifications can gradually shift the purpose of a project such that the assumptions of demand which supported the original project are not valid for the revised project.  In the case of the SP, market research was unnecessary for the original purpose of upgrading the EFPA; however, an analysis of the market, in terms of product, place, price, and promotion, should have preceded the creation of a new FP PVO meant to be self-financing.

"Assessments are made of the sustainability of four projects, implemented under the Africa Child Survival Initiative, to support public primary health care (PHC) in Guinea, Lesotho, Nigeria, and Rwanda.  At the time of assessment, projects in Guinea, Lesotho, and Rwanda had been completed while the project in Nigeria was ongoing. Evaluation covers the period 1992-1993. Despite deteriorating economic and political conditions, activities have been sustained to a surprisingly high level in Guinea, Rwanda, and Nigeria, and to a lesser degree in Lesotho. Direct service components (i.e., control of diarrheal disease (CDD), malaria, and, in Lesotho, acute respiratory infection (ARI), and extended program in immunization (EPI), have been sustained to a greater degree than have support components (i.e., health education, information systems, operations research, and training. EPI and training have been the most sustained in the service and support components respectively.  In Nigeria, health information systems and operations research have been sustained to a high degree. It is uncertain why there are such clear differences in sustainability among project components.  One clue is that perceived effectiveness has been consistently higher for EPI than for most other components, especially CDD.  Differences may be due to a higher level of other-donor support for some components, the fact that the more mature components had more time to build experience in the country, or simply the fact that some components are inherently more effective than others. However, external factors, political and economic, had the most influence on sustainability. In Guinea the following lessons were learned.  (1) An articulated political will and commitment from the highest levels of government are necessary for sustainability.  (2) Inexperienced managers in the project or in the USAID mission can seriously decrease the prospects of sustainability.  (3) Sustainability must be addressed at the conception and throughout the life of a project by all concerned.  (4) Development of support systems must keep pace with development of direct services. (5) Individuals rarely take personal responsibility for project sustainability.  (6) Program managers often see new activities or proposed changes in terms of effect on their power base rather than effect on the public interest.  (7) Regional and global objectives (e.g., vaccination targets) may be unrealistic in some countries. Failure to achieve these objectives is then not a program failure.  (8) Decentralization improves the delivery and efficiency of services.  (9) Failure to involve communities hinders sustainability.  (10) Integration of project components into a national PHC program supports sustainability.  (11) Support services require the same priority, time frame, and dynamism to succeed as direct service components, but generally they do not have these attributes to the same degree.  (12) The phasing out of a project is difficult and important, possibly more important to sustainability than what goes on during the project. The following lessons were learned in Nigeria.  (1) Responsibility for achieving project success must be assigned to particular individuals right from the start.  (2) Projects that depend on one or too few key technical people are less likely to be sustained because these key people often leave.  (3) Projects that depend on a heavy inflow of external capital are unlikely to be sustained.  The rise and then the fall of vaccination coverage in Nigeria as a result of the infusion of short-term donor funding is a case in point.  (4) Donor projects should actively foster and carefully avoid obstructing local initiatives. ""Bottom up"" planning with local communities helps.  (5) In Nigeria, people who do not pay toward something do not feel any ownership for it, even if they have been involved from the start.  Thus, the sense of ownership is intimately linked to financial inputs.  (6) Training programs are an effective way to communicate information that enhances project credibility and sense of ownership.  There is evidence that this has increased budget allocations at the state level.  (7) Unstable project leadership seriously diminishes the chances of sustainability. (8) TA should always have the objective of building local capability in order to achieve sustainability. The following lessons were learned in Rwanda.  (1) The private health sector, which is demanding but well-equipped and rewarding, is attractive to many public sector health professionals.  (2) Extensive cooperation between the private and public sectors has maximized project sustainability.  (3) Top priority programs such as EPI perform better at all levels, but particularly at secondary peripheral levels.  The status associated with high priority from the central level confers priority at the periphery.  (4) Health personnel motivation is essential to project success and sustainability, including motivation due to per diem payments.  Elimination of such incentives can reduce sustainability. (5) Personnel skills are not sufficient to sustain activities.  Support resources are also needed.  Problems in sustaining the malaria control program due to lack of educational materials is a case in point. The following lessons were learned in Lesotho.  (1) User fee schemes can be feasible, if the fee is substantial, and can significantly strengthen sustainability.  (2) Affordability is central to any analysis of health benefits in Lesotho, and therefore to sustainability.  (3) Outflow of skilled workers to other sectors or other countries is a serious impediment to sustainability.  (4) Health education is key to sustainability of PHC projects.  (5) Continuing training of health personnel and their awareness is another key.  (6) Community health worker programs can be the key to delivery of PHC services.

"The United Nations estimates that nine to ten million mines are scattered throughout populated areas of Afghanistan where they endanger lives, threaten injury, and disrupt repatriation and economic development.  Since June 1989, A.I.D has contributed to donor efforts to clear primary transportation routes, agricultural areas, and population centers of mines.  It has done so through support of the Mine Dog Center (MDC), a collective term which refers to facilities that provide administrative, technical, and logistic support for the maintenance, training, and deployment of up to 100 dogs and their handlers. The MDC includes a main facility, located in Pabbi near Peshawar in the Northwest Frontier Province, serving northeastern Afghanistan; and a smaller facility in Quetta, which serves southern Afghanistan.  In Risalpur (for Pabbi) training is provided by the Pakistan Army. Training facilities near Baleli Camp (for Quetta) are leased from a private land owner.  Although funded and managed through an A.I.D. contractor, the Center operates in conjunction with Afghan demining NGOs under the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Assistance to Afghanistan (UNOCHA) Mine Clearance Programme (initiated in 1989). MCD teams of dogs, handlers, and leaders/paravets are deployed on an as needed/as available basis.  The MDC dogs, specially bred German Shepherds and Belgian Malinois with a sense of smell far more sensitive than that of humans, are trained to detect the scent of explosives underneath layers of earth, on roads, in mine fields, and in buildings where there is little ground cover or rubble.  The dogs are capable of detecting anti-personnel, anti-tank, metal, plastic, or rubber mines as well as trip wires and booby traps.  They signal the whereabouts of explosives by assuming a sitting position.  MDC teams spend an average of two months working from regional sites inside Afghanistan and then are brought back to the MDC for one-month refresher training. In spite of apparent religious and cultural biases against dogs, Afghan handlers have formed strong bonds with their animals. Evaluation results are as follows.  (1) Integration of the MDC dogs with Afghan survey and demining teams has proven to be highly successful; they have reduced the risk of death and injury to humans and expedited survey and mine-clearance activities. (2) Funding and logistical support have been sufficient to operate the MDC at full capacity.  (3) Staff are highly trained and have exhibited a high performance level.  Management staff have good relationships with other NGO staff and UNOCHA's regional offices.  (4) Dogs are well cared for and well trained. Deployment, though informal, appears to keep dog teams busy and has satisfied current demining requirements.  (5) Operating procedures and record-keeping have met A.I.D. and UNOCHA requirements. (6) Internal integration of administrative, logistics, and technical operations appears good. Lessons learned include the following.  (1) UNOCHA's Mine Clearance Programme represents an organized effort by the United Nations to address the devastating effect mines have on post-war resumption of social and commercial activity in Afghanistan.  (2) MDC participation in this effort is a meaningful contribution which could not be duplicated if there was no interaction between UNOCHA and the MDC. It is recommended that both organizations maintain, at a minimum, the current level of MDC demining operations.  Although, at this point, neither the MDC nor UNOCHA are fully prepared for transfer of the MDC to UNOCHA's umbrella Programme on June 30, 1993.

"Final evaluation of project (1/90-6/93) to promote the development of university nursing education in Egypt by establishing a consortium of High Institutes of Nursing (HINs). The project was implemented by Project HOPE. Despite the problems noted below, the project made remarkable progress in improving the status and image of nurses in Egypt.  A strong HIN Executive Board has been established, facilitating communication among the Institutes.  The project has also succeeded in establishing Demonstration Clinical Units (DCUs), each linked to either a hospital or primary health care facility; many of the DCUs will be sustained through local efforts beyond the life of the project.  The development of written nursing standards is another significant contribution, and one which required a great deal of effort. Sharing of educational resources and technical expertise help newly established HINs develop their junior faculty; consultants from well-established HINS were hired to assist the faculty of new HINs.  In addition, project workshops helped raise consciousness about nursing issues in Egypt; junior faculty stated that they use workshop information in conducting in-service training for other health care providers.  U.S. training of HIN Directors, DCU Coordinators, and physicians encouraged professional growth, facilitated collegiality between HIN Directors and physicians, and enabled some HIN Directors to network with U.S. nurses. Problem areas included:  (1) lack of clarity regarding the roles of HIN Directors, status of the Executive Board (advisory vs. policymaking), management practices, and rules and regulations; (2) lack of clarity about project inputs among HIN Directors, who expected more up-to-date books, equipment, etc; (3) overly ambitious and unrealistic objectives, which should have been refocused at the time of mid-term evaluation; and (4) problems in overall communication between Project HOPE staff and some HIN directors.  A team-building workshop would have helped clear the air and created a better working environment. The following lessons were learned.  (1) In projects where major institutional changes are desired, a great deal of attention should be given to the formation of Advisory/Executive Boards consisting of representatives from all relevant policymaking organizations.  (2) Project policies, rules, and regulations governing the status and the relationship between cooperating organizations have to be clearly identified, formally articulated, and disseminated among members of participating organizations. (3) The success of a curriculum development initiative depends to a large extent on the amount of human resources, TA, time, and money allocated to the effort.  (4) The development of a set of nursing standards is crucial for the success of a project which aims at improving the image of nursing.  If these standards are significantly to determine the quality of nursing, they should be enforced and updated as needed. Follow-on projects to sustain the project's achievements and extend HIN influence into secondary/technical nursing education are recommended.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","6/1/1993 12:00:00 AM","","Nursing education|Institution building|Universities and colleges|Institutional linkages","Egypt","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABG446.pdf","5,347 KB","006524 - International Health and Development Associates","","008539 - USAID.

"Evaluates the impact of USAID/Tanzania's training initiatives. The evaluation, which employed the Training for Impact methodology, covers the period 1955-1992 and evaluates the Human Resources Development Assistance (HRDA) project as well as training funded under sectoral projects. Since 1955, USAID/T has funded U.S. and third-country training for nearly 4,000 Tanzanians and in-country training for hundreds more.  HRDA alone has trained 257 Tanzanians since it began in 1989.  Currently, training initiatives across sectoral projects and umbrella training projects constitute over 13% of the Mission's portfolio and total $13 million (cumulative since 1980). In reference to mandated targets, the participation of women in training is impressive, accounting for 49% of HRDA training and over 40% of all training.  In-country training accounts for 73% of all training, but only 13% of HRDA training.  The participation of the private sector is 8% Mission-wide and 20% in HRDA.  In 1992, 8.2% of total person-months of U.S. training was at Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), and 11.4% of new start person-months was at these institutions. There is clear evidence that USAID-funded training has had a positive impact on individual trainees, enabling them to take on added responsibilities with greater confidence and initiative, enhanced skills, and a wider perspective.  Participants have been able to multiply the benefits of their training by advising others, providing on-the-job training, and speaking at workshops and conferences.  Women appear to be able to utilize training as much as or more than the men. Although over 130 Tanzanian institutions have sent people for USAID training, it is not clear what the cumulative impact has been on the institutions since specific institutions have not been targeted for training; this is especially so in the case of HRDA, the majority of whose participants come from parastatals and government ministries. Participants from private firms report that they have effected change in the form of increased sales, new jobs, more products, and strengthened business ties with U.S. firms, but no baseline data are available to quantify or verify the impact. USAID/T has targeted three sectors for the period 1992-1997: health, infrastructure support, and the private sector.  Current project training falls into those sectors, and the major fields of study to date under HRDA have closely paralleled these sectors, even though there is no clear mandate for HRDA to focus on the same sectors or to contribute to the achievement of Country Program Strategic Plan (CPSP) objectives. While HRDA participants in the health sector have contributed to specific needs, few have contributed to the CPSP objective of ""health enhancing changes in reproductive behavior.""  In the private sector, participation has been able to contribute, to varying degrees, to ""increased formal private sector employment and income growth.""  HRDA has also funded training in banking, road rehabilitation, and energy which has contributed to better delivery of services. HRDA has enjoyed excellent management, resulting in a project that is successfully meeting most placement targets.  HRDA has also been successful in achieving individual impact, but has not systematically collected or analyzed data to demonstrate institutional or sectoral impact.  Currently, the Participant Training Management System is not fully utilized to track training throughout the Mission or to record impact data for any Mission training. Overall, USAID/T training has been relatively successful, but the measurement of impact is somewhat limited because of the Mission's lack of strategic planning to measure training impacts in the areas detailed above.  Recommendations to help the Mission prepare a new Country Training Strategy are provided.

"PACR of a project (1987-93) to increase the human resource capacity of member countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in targeted development areas.  The project consisted of grants to four regional centers:  (1) the Plant Quarantine Center and Training Institute (PLANTI), Malaysia; (2) the Scholarship Program for Applied Tropical Medicine and Public Health (SEAMEO-TROPMED), Thailand; (3) the Agricultural Development Planning Center (ADPC), Thailand; and (4) the Asian Institute of Technology (AIT), Thailand. The last formal project evaluation, conducted in 7/91, found that the project was leaving in its wake a new cadre of highly trained personnel who were already playing meaningful roles in the ASEAN region.  The regional centers assisted by the project have all expanded their facilities and mandates, and have responded to policy changes introduced in 1990 by the Asia Bureau by accommodating private sector participation in activity planning and benefit distribution.  Achievements and lessons learned under the four project grants are detailed below. (1) PLANTI has strengthened ASEAN's plant quarantine capacities through training and research.  Five diploma, six certificate, and 54 short-term courses were conducted.  Participants totalled 1,125 (vs. a target of 958), of whom 24% were female and 8% from the private sector. Lessons learned:  The establishment of PLANTI as a unifying force for plant quarantine has made agriculture and agribusiness safer in the region.  Also, project experience shows that quarantine research and quarantine training are more effective when they are directly related to problems in the field. (2) TROPMED organized 45 Master's, 13 diploma, and 3 short-term courses, as well as 4 regional seminars.  The number of physicians and scientists trained was 543 (vs. a target of 484); almost half were female. Lessons learned:  Division of responsibilities among institutions in a region can foster the capabilities of national institutions. As a result of the TROPMED component, Indonesia has become specialized in nutrition, the Philippines in public health, Thailand in tropical medicine, and Malaysia in microbiology, parasitology, and entomology. Linking TROPMED with U.S. institutions would have led to even greater benefits. (3) ADPC trained 211 (vs. a target of 172) participants, of whom 40% were women and 9% from the private sector, in Master's and short-term programs.  In addition, 14 planning and policy studies were conducted by ASEAN experts and discussed at regional fora. ADPC's Database and Information System has proven useful in policy and planning for government ministries, private companies, private research foundations, and consultants.  For example, a study on food security resulted in an inter-country agreement to establish an emergency stockpile of rice. Lessons learned:  The exchange of participants' experience in comparative case studies resulted in more effective policy and agricultural planning in member countries.  The long-lasting camaraderie developed among the participants was an added benefit. Additionally, when proposing regional agricultural development programs, it is important to recognize the varying capacity of each country to analyze its own problems. (4) AIT trained 926 participants (vs. a target of 414):  25 in Master's, 108 in certificate, and 793 in short-term programs. Roughly 30% of the participants were female and 13% from the private sector. Participants were trained in environmental engineering, agricultural and food engineering, computer science, water resources engineering, energy technology, geotechnical and transportation engineering, and management. Short-term courses covered a range of fields from management to computer applications and pollution abatement. Lessons learned:  The component demonstrated that the promotion of social and economic development in a region requires a well established regional institution to serve as an effective implementing agent. Development of mutual trust and cooperation with such an institution requires constant and long-term nurturing.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","7/1/1993 12:00:00 AM","","Education for development|Participants|Regional development|Training centers|Institution building|Plant quarantines|Health professional education|Agricultural planning|Technical training|Beneficiary count","Southeast Asia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABG489.pdf","363 KB","007540 - USAID.

"Evaluates Botswana component of a regional project to promote community-based natural resource management and utilization in southern Africa.  Midterm evaluation covers the period 8/89-7/93. The project has had to face serious obstacles, particularly a series of flawed assumptions.  Contrary to these assumptions, (1) there are few, if any, examples of successful community-based natural resource utilization in southern Africa that can be readily demonstrated and replicated in Botswana; (2) the pool of NGOs with the requisite experience in both conservation and community mobilization is extremely limited; and (3) there is considerable dispute as to whether Botswana actually has sufficient numbers of wild animals to permit community utilization through sustainable harvesting.  Perhaps the most glaring flawed assumption was idea that the process could take place within the limited timeframe of a 3-5 year project cycle. Nonetheless, the project is recognized by many both inside and outside the government as an important tool in the Botswana Department of Wildlife and National Parks' (DWNP's) effort to prove itself in the struggle to conserve biodiversity while addressing human needs for economic development.  It is also a project that has learned from its mistakes.  It has had to overcome the problems of an overly optimistic design and reach consensus within its home department as to what the project is really about.  It has operated flexibly and pragmatically, taking advantage of opportunities as they arise, and initiating in different parts of Botswana a variety of activities which have attempted to demonstrate that managing natural resources for sustainable use can be economically valuable to a range of stakeholder groups. Project activities have included:  development proposals for community utilization and controlled hunting efforts in several areas; forming a local conservation trust to manage hunting quotas in Chobe Enclave; preparing management plans for Chobe and Moremi Parks; providing technical support for the Nata Sanctuary; and exploring veld product harvesting and marketing potential in eight communities in four districts.  Further, the project has assisted the DWNP in undertaking a major staff development program including the establishment of a new extension division and the separation of community mobilization functions from project monitoring and evaluation functions.  The project has undertaken a wide range of formal and nonformal education and training initiatives geared toward DWNP staff, schoolchildren, teachers, and the general public. While admirable strides have been made under difficult circumstances, a strengthened and strategic approach is called for; a specific need is to refine the process for assessing the validity of integrated conservation and development models for Botswana. Whether there are two or twenty communities with active management plans by the end of the project is less important than whether the stage has been set for widespread replication in future years.

"Evaluates a PASA with the U.S. Bureau of the Census (BUCEN), acting through its International Statistical Programs Center (ISPC) and Center for International Research (CIR), to provide training and TA to overseas demographic programs. Evaluation covers the period 4/89-8/93 against a PACD of 3/94. Overall, operations under this PASA are very well run and useful. Interviews with USAID staff and many other agencies, as well as questionnaire responses from host country central statistical organizations (CSOs) and USAID Missions, were highly favorable. The few exceptions can be traced to a lack of familiarity with the role of BUCEN.  For example, some of those interviewed had a misperception that the Population Reference Bureau (PRB), rather than BUCEN, maintains the data file that appears in the PRB Data Sheet. Under a relatively small component to train foreign nationals (mostly CSO personnel) at its facilities in Upper Marlboro, Maryland, ISPC has recently revised its curriculum to break longer courses into short, self-contained modules.  It is recommended that this revision be completed, to provide students a menu of short courses that best suit their needs, and that the trend toward short-term training (of a few months duration) be continued.  Costs can be further cut by shifting more training to developing country sites, such as U. N. regional training centers. Under the TA component, ISPC staff make short-term trips to developing countries to work closely with their counterparts on technical issues ranging from management and training to data processing and data analysis and dissemination.  This is the activity in which BUCEN holds its greatest comparative advantage, because of the high standards of the U.S. Census operations and the expertise of its staff. It is recommended that TA be expanded in the area of data analysis and dissemination and that there be some consolidation of the training and TA personnel so that both activities will be strengthened. BUCEN has developed and adapted several computer software packages. The Integrated Microcomputer Processing System (IMPS) will handle all phases of data processing for a census, from data entry and editing through tabulation.  After a planned transition to a lower-level computer language (it is currently written in Cobol), this microcomputer package will not require any special compiler.  Population Analysis Spreadsheets (PAS), with its accompanying manual, ""Population Analysis Using Microcomputers"" (PAM), is a microcomputer package that uses census and survey data to develop indirect estimates of various population rates. The manual represents a laudable collaboration with the United Nations, with whom it will soon be published jointly.  It is recommended that both of these packages be further developed and augmented, particularly to facilitate spatial analysis, subnational estimates and projections, and census management. In the data analysis and dissemination component, most countries had a census in 1990 or 1991 and are now at a critical point for utilizing the data as effectively as possible.  It is recommended that training and TA activities be expanded to promote this activity, with some increase in staff.  CIR's own publication series, ""Population Trends,"" should be expanded.  The possibility of a special publication through the Population Information Program should also be investigated.  Most importantly, steps should be taken to make the international data base more widely accessible on CD-ROM or eventually on-line. Further recommendations are as follows.  (1) BUCEN should coordinate more actively with UN organizations that perform similar functions.  (2) USAID should be responsive to BUCEN initiatives, many of which will be driven by the need to make optimal use of technological advances in the coming years. BUCEN, in turn, should be more aggressive in identifying work that needs to be done and in taking proposals to USAID.  If possible, BUCEN should be exempted from the priority country strategy; all countries need good census data.  (3) Efforts should be continued to obtain core funding for ISPC and CIR from the Bureau of the Census. These units have the potential to provide a technical and database resource that would be helpful for international trade and investment as well as for foreign assistance.

"Evaluates the Asia Democracy Program (ADP) and related activities of USAID Missions in Thailand, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and the Philippines.  The evaluation reviews 43 completed and ongoing projects funded under human rights directives, Mission-funded PVO Co-financing and Democratic Pluralism Initiatives, and more recently the ADP.  Evaluation covers the period through 11/92. Overall, the ADP is well designed and implemented and in the long run is likely to achieve its aim.  Success will depend heavily upon political stability in the four nations in the coming years; most interviewees expressed optimism in this regard.  Most program funds have been channeled to indigenous NGOs, either directly through the Missions or through U.S. PVOs, primarily the Asia Foundation, the Asian-American Free Labor Institute (AAFLI), and Private Agencies Collaborating Together.  All the Missions place great emphasis on the role of NGOs in democratization. It is difficult to quantify the impact of the various projects; most are less than 18 months old, baseline and impact data are scarce, and many of the projects are small and short-term in nature.  However, there were many specific examples of accomplishment.  (1) A voter education program in selected hill districts of Nepal helped increase voter turnout for the 1991 elections by at least 25%.  (2) A Thai labor lawyer avowed that participation in AAFLI leadership training workshops had improved his case win percentage to 70%.  (3) The Sri Lanka Bar Association conducted seminars for 350 lawyers on recent developments in domestic and international human rights litigation.  (4) A campaign by FREELAVA, a Filipino NGO receiving ADP support, to publicize the plight of inmates in jails in Cebu, many of whom had not been charged with any specific crimes, led to prison cleanup and faster progress of cases through the courts. While the Missions had significant leeway in generating their own priorities, certain common areas of activity emerged, indicating consensus about how to achieve ADP objectives.  In light of these similarities, it is recommended that Asia Bureau reformulate its democratization strategy to cluster these activity areas around a new set of initiatives:  (1) civil society -- participatory development groups, advocacy NGOs, government accountability, and trade unions; (2) governance -- public administration, national legislatures, local government strengthening, institutional accountability and transparency, and electoral support; (3) rule of law -- legal awareness, judicial independence, administration of justice, informal dispute resolution, and human rights; and (4) information -- public policy reporting, citizen access, independent media, and journalistic accountability. Lessons learned were as follows.  (1) For ADP to have maximum impact, there needs to be an integrated effort among the U.S. State Department, USAID, and the U.S. Information Service, along with the pertinent NGOs, to devise a collaborative program; the Nepal program is an excellent example of such an effort.  (2) Projects that enhance constitutional structures can strengthen democratic processes.  (3) Projects funded by bilateral agencies are more likely to succeed if implemented by an indigenous NGO, particularly in sensitive areas such as judicial, administrative, or structural reform.  Too much preoccupation with promoting the U.S. role in democratization could produce a backlash in the long run.  (4) No single strategy for democratization is suitable for all countries, or even for a group of neighboring countries; project specifics must be designed by experienced area specialists.  (5) NGOs have a vital role to play in instigating political change, especially in the area of decentralization advocacy; democratization and NGO development are inextricably linked.","Delivery order no. 17","Special Evaluation","Documents","OTR-0000-I-00-0035-00","","4/1/1993 12:00:00 AM","","Democratization|Human rights|Indigenous private voluntary organizations|Private voluntary organizations","Asia|Thailand|Nepal|Sri Lanka|Philippines","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABG648.pdf","1,325 KB","000436 - Development Associates, Inc.","","007203 - USAID.

"Evaluates the business skills and communal banking program of PRO MUJER, a women's training and support organization in Bolivia. The program, financed under the Mission's P.L. 480 Title II program, supports research, training, and TA to enhance the integration of women into multi-sectoral development programs in Bolivia.  Interim evaluation covers the period 1992-4/93. The PRO MUJER program serves one of the most disadvantaged segments of El Alto's urban population.  About 40% of the participants are illiterate and less than a third have more than an elementary education; their net incomes average $20 for a 50-hour work week.  More than 95% speak Aymara or Quechua as a primary language and over 74% are migrants from rural areas.  Few qualify for formal credit or even meet the minimum criteria for loans from targeted microenterprise programs such as PRODEM or Banco Sol. PRO MUJER appears to be effectively stimulating income generation among this target group through training, credit, and empowerment activities.  The business and banking skills courses offer a unique approach to credit programs for microentrepreneurs. The methodology of providing 19 lessons, 14 on business skills and 5 on communal bank management, prior to providing credit, strengthens participants' abilities to assess the viability of their business, builds their ownership over the bank and its assets, and develops management skills prior to providing economic resources. The real impact of the training can be seen in the women's capacity to manage the banks.  Group and individual interviews with women in the communal banks, and other informal interviews indicate that women now use business plans and other skills developed through the training to improve their businesses. While it is too early to measure the impact of the communal banks program on the participants' businesses and income, there is anecdotal evidence that most women have been able to increase their earnings.  There is also anecdotal evidence of the participants' interest in and commitment to the banks. PRO MUJER has set income as the primary indicator of success. The evaluation recommends rethinking this indicator and substituting proxies for income, as well as adding process indicators, such as the number of participants that meet the eligibility criteria for borrowing from other microenterprise programs.  In the process, the project can contribute to knowledge about microenterprise growth without being held to an unrealistic standard. After considerable debate and analysis, PRO MUJER management have concluded that their primary mandate is to provide high-quality training, and that the communal banks are principally a vehicle for training women from disadvantaged areas of El Alto to manage credit and become familiar with the workings of financial institutions.  An expected result of the banking program in the future will be to prepare PRO MUJER's program participants to deal with other micro-credit institutions and formal banking structures. PRO MUJER's strength is in its training.  It needs to retain this focus and not be pulled into service delivery or long-term financial intermediation.  At the same time, PRO MUJER has the capacity to expand beyond direct implementation into providing TA to other agencies.  A mixed approach of direct program implementation, as a laboratory for program and materials development, in conjunction with increased training of other agencies, will achieve two objectives:  (1) effective education and economic development of disadvantaged populations; and (2) increased NGO capacity.

"Evaluates a project to reform Swaziland's basic education system through improvements in student assessment, head teacher management training, management information systems (MIS), organizational development of the Ministry of Education (MOE), and guidance and counseling.  Midterm evaluation covers the period 1990-7/93. Although its design, which aims to effect change at every level of Swazi education, might seem overly ambitious, the project has thus far been as productive as hoped, particularly in regard to implementing all of the required technical inputs:  classroom tests for continuous student assessment; training modules for head teacher management training; and data collection and processing systems for the MIS and organizational development. The project has also conducted or supervised hundreds of hours of in-country training and arranged for participant training abroad. However, most of these accomplishments have come through the efforts or under the direction of expatriate advisors.  To ensure that the components become institutionalized, the project must shift away from technical inputs to behavioral outputs. The latter point is exemplified in the continuous student assessment component, the project's centerpiece.  Thus far, the component has devoted virtually all of its resources to creating tests and designing a national data capture program.  Only 4.5 days of training in student assessment have been given to teachers.  The component should channel its resources into changing the way teachers teach -- i.e., shifting the classroom focus toward continuously assessing students' achievements and providing remedial instruction.  Shifting the component's focus from test creation to teacher behavior is the first and most important step in this process. A smaller shift should take place in the MIS and organizational development components.  Although enough data now exist to engage every MOE officer in data analysis and policy creation for the next year and beyond, most MOE officers are not so engaged. The project should create an environment where data are needed and demanded for problemsolving. Seminars, workshops, discussion groups, training sessions (even films and video games), as well as regular meetings of task forces and policymakers, will have to be held over time to ensure the institutionalization of the MIS and organizational development components. The head teacher management training component is well on its way to being institutionalized in the MOE, but the quality of the training must be improved and the capability of the In-Service Education and Training Unit to provide that training must be strengthened. Through the TA and training provided to the MOE's Educational Testing, Guidance and Psychological Services unit, the guidance and counseling component, geared toward increasing student awareness of career choices and employment options, has already achieved its goals. Given the needs still existing in other project components, it would be inadvisable to invest additional resources in this one. In sum, the project has made an excellent beginning on a difficult task.  It is time now to consolidate gains, shift from design to dissemination, and invest the remaining resources in the people who will have to carry on long after the project has ended.  Recommendations are provided for each of the five project components.","Evaluation summary: PD-ABJ-215|Project title: Advancing basic education and literacy (ABEL)","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-5832-I-00-0095-00","","7/1/1993 12:00:00 AM","","Educational development|Educational policy|Educational administration|Institution building|Management information systems|Student testing|Student evaluation","Swaziland","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABG659.pdf","1,104 KB","001341 - Creative Associates International, Inc.

"Evaluates A.I.D.-supported voluntary assistance for private sector development in Latvia, Poland, and Bulgaria for the period 10/90-10/93. The assistance is being provided under six projects (180-0002, 0014, 0023, 0024, 0027, 0032) via nine grantees (Volunteers in Overseas Cooperative Assistance, Agricultural Cooperative Development International, MBA Enterprise Corps, International Executive Service Corps, Peace Corps, National Cooperative Business Association, Land O'Lakes, Financial Services Volunteer Corps, and Citizens Democracy Corps). Over the past three fiscal years, A.I.D. has invested about 4% of its regional budget in voluntary agency assistance for private enterprise development.  This type of assistance has given meaning to the concepts of pro bono and local contributions. Further, it has provided a visible American presence that allows the testing of local development initiatives which can contribute to future policy and program formulation in transitional societies. Government and private sector entities have been highly receptive to voluntary agency assistance to private enterprise development, although at first there was skepticism as to why talented Americans were willing to provide voluntary services. Assistance has been particularly appropriate for the transition period, during which strategies and priorities have been unclear. Assistance has been successful because of a high degree of A.I.D. flexibility and the abilities of voluntary agencies to rapidly mobilize American expertise and know-how. Voluntary agencies have created a series of in-country experiments that use knowledge about local environments and test different TA and training modes.  Voluntary agencies share common development goals but have distinct identities and perform specific roles and functions which can be effectively tapped and integrated into A.I.D. programs at the country level.  High performance by voluntary agencies results from quality in-country planning, management, assessment, and follow-up.  The performance is enhanced by instilling local ""ownership"" and by leveraging other U.S. foreign assistance resources. Voluntary agency assistance could be improved by paying more attention to developing the capabilities of local institutions to provide effective business services.  Long-term private enterprise development depends on the continued development of ""success models"" that are being provided by the voluntary agencies, the results of which should be fed more systematically into ongoing policy and program development processes.  A.I.D. needs to develop a program strategy that is directed toward the circumstances and requirements of individual countries in Central and Eastern Europe and that draws upon the lessons of the first years of voluntary agency assistance. In sum, A.I.D.'s investment in voluntary assistance to private enterprise development is a cost-effective means to address the requirements of transitional societies in Central and Eastern Europe. Returns from these investments could be increased through a process that helps to tailor agency inputs to the comparative advantages of countries (and sub-regions of countries) in the marketplace.  The prospects for sustainability of these initiatives will increase as indigenous private sector groups are strengthened and can lobby for fiscal policy and legal system reforms that are necessary to create favorable business environments.  This focus is lacking and should be a priority for future A.I.D. decision making, perhaps through the mobilization of resources from well-matched U.S. trade and investment entities.  Finally, long-term private sector development depends on institution building, primarily through improved business schools and services and increased government planning and decision making capabilities, particularly at the municipal level.  A.I.D. is funding such complementary investments, which despite their weak integration, may be strengthened through the devolution of resource control to the field or country level.

"Final evaluation of the IEC subproject of the Family Planning II Project in Egypt.  The subproject has been implemented by the State Information Service (SIS) under the Ministry of Information, through its IEC Center and 58 local information centers. SIS has made major efforts to implement the recommendations of A.I.D. evaluations and assessments and to achieve the subproject purpose of increasing family planning knowledge and contraceptive awareness and practice through the mass media and interpersonal communication.  It has demonstrated that it has a comparative advantage as an IEC family planning implementing agency in three areas:  reaching rural women through television; reaching rural men through interpersonal communication activities; and using its extensive network of local influential and religious leaders. One of SIS' major strengths is its sound base of professional and committed staff at both the central and local levels as well as its willingness to respond to recommendations and to innovate. It has demonstrated that it is able to both implement and use surveys and research.  In order to increase its efficiency in reducing the family planning acceptance-practice gap, SIS needs to place greater emphasis on rural Upper Egypt where contraceptive rates remain low; base its television productions on formative field research in order to effectively reach the target audiences; develop a field-based planning process for its local activities; and improve the methods and materials used in its interpersonal communication activities.  SIS is also in a prime position for developing inter-agency coordination at both national and local levels. The following lessons were learned.  (1) It is more cost-effective to pass family planning messages through short, well-targeted spots than through multi-episode series.  Focus group surveys indicate that rural women will remember short, specific messages.  (2) Television spots that are placed in a rural setting and that show everyday rural situations are the most effective in reaching rural women.  (3) Media messages targeting rural and poor urban men and women need to be linked to the daily reality of these groups, who find it difficult to relate to national issues.  (4) Television spots cannot effectively achieve their objectives unless pre-production research is undertaken with the target to identify the most appropriate themes for passing on messages and to test alternative scenarios/images before going into production.  (5) In order for interpersonal communication activities to effectively address local problems, local workplans need to be developed in the field by the local offices themselves through a ""diagnostic"" process involving all of the local actors and agencies.  (6) Central office staff can only address local office program needs if they are in regular contact with the field through visits and field-based technical assistance.  (7) In order for workshops for local influentials to achieve maximum efficiency they must be designed to meet the needs of participants who work with specific target groups, e.g., religious leaders/rural men; female social workers/rural women; teachers/high school students; and male youth leaders/male youth. (8) When several local office staff are actively involved in IEC family planning activities, it is important that they be trained side by side in major skill areas in order to use the same approaches and pass on the same messages.  (9) Local activities are much more effective and the coverage much broader when implemented in close conjunction with other implementing agencies.

"PACR of a project (7/83-8/90) to establish the Caribbean Financial Services Corporation (CFSC) as a private, for profit, development finance institution to provide term lending and other financial services to private enterprises in the English-speaking Caribbean. CFSC was successfully established as a responsive long-term lender to manufacturing, service, and tourism ventures.  Its management has demonstrated willingness to base loan decisions on expected cash flow rather than restrictive collateral requirements, and to take security positions secondary to those of shorter-term lenders.  At PACD, CFSC's loan and investment portfolio showed 76 cumulative approvals valued at $22.7 million, with the outstanding portfolio being $16.12 million. Some $14.775 million of the USAID obligated amount of $14.835 million was drawn down for 50 loans, primarily to agro-industry, manufacturing, and tourism, with a significant portion going to small and medium-sized firms.  Shareholders' equity at the PACD was $3.012 million. In the area of services, CFSC took a very cautious approach, although it does participate in the Barbados Stock Exchange and provides brokerage services for clients. The CFSC report for the period ending 9/90 indicates that 834 long-term jobs resulted from its investments and estimates foreign exchange earnings at $32.55 million.  According to a 1987 evaluation, CFSC's foreign exchange figures represent gross rather than net earnings, and its job impact figures fail to consider the effects of replacement equipment or construction activity.  Nonetheless, the evaluation considered the CFSC project a success in terms of total investment, employment, net foreign exchange earnings, and prospects for sustainability. Three lessons were learned.  (1) A project which responds to a specific market need will succeed in meeting its objectives.  (2) The involvement of private sector personnel in project design is very likely to result in their commitment to achieving outputs. (3) Unnecessary exposure of development projects to foreign exchange risks should be avoided.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","7/1/1993 12:00:00 AM","","Development finance institutions|Institution building|Private enterprises|Loans|Credit","Eastern Caribbean","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABG699.pdf","150 KB","007707 - USAID.

"PACR of a project to help the Leeward Islands to recover from the effects of Hurricane Hugo by carrying out (1) power rehabilitation activities in St. Kitts/Nevis and (2) agricultural sector and road rehabilitation activities in Dominica. The project achieved its goals, and thereby allowed the two countries to resume productive economic activities.  The most important effect of the U.S. assistance, however, was the alleviation of the human suffering and hardship caused by the hurricane. Specific accomplishments were as follows.  Primary electrical distribution systems in St. Kitts/Nevis are now operational, as are primary and secondary road networks in Dominica.  Planting targets in Dominica for the 1989 season were met, including the rehabilitation of 6000 acres of bananas; by the PACD, weekly banana production had risen from 400 tons immediately after the hurricane to 1,050 tons.  Also in Dominica, the project:  (1) rehabilitated 750 acres of other crops, particularly cocoa and vegetable crops, through inputs of fertilizer, planting material, and various farm implements; and (2) assisted about 500 artisanal fisherman, leaving the country's fishing industry fully operational.  (Chemical analyses of river water in Dominica revealed no fertilizer-related quality problem in any of the watersheds tested). Two unplanned outputs were the restoration of the primary and secondary electrical distribution system in Montserrat and the restoration of sea walls and drainage lines in Dominica. The following lessons were learned.  (1) The Government of Dominica did not follow precisely some of the regulations of the project.  Early and more precise instructions should be given to governments in emergency relief projects in order to ensure strict adherence to requirements.  (2) The successful use of a concurrent audit showed that such audits are the most suitable form of financial monitoring in disaster assistance and similar type projects.  To ensure that such audits are performed on time, RDO/C should engage a local CPA firm.  (3) In short-duration projects, it is essential that appropriate counterpart personnel be appointed at the inception of the project to ensure proper implementation.  Dominica did so, resulting in a quality of management that was above normal standards.  (4) Contracting of the infrastructure rehabilitation work to the private sector resulted in timely completion, as did the on-site pre-placement of Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) specialists.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","8/1/1993 12:00:00 AM","","Disaster rehabilitation|Transportation infrastructure|Roads|Crop production|Electric power|Electric power distribution|Beneficiary count","Saint Kitts-Nevis|Dominica|Montserrat","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABG734.pdf","1,080 KB","001373 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (8/87-2/91) to develop strategies and operating procedures for combating Tropical Bont Tick and associated livestock diseases in the Caribbean, using Antigua as a test site.  The project was implemented by the Animal and Plant Inspection Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA/APHIS) and Antigua's Ministry of Agriculture. The project did not achieve its goals or objectives.  The main component (eradication demonstration) was never initiated because the USDA insisted on using an acaricide which had not been approved by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), even though the project design called for the use of two EPA-registered acaricides. Instead, USDA/APHIS proposed using Bayticol, which was said to have tremendous advantages in terms of its efficacy and ease of application.  However, an environmental assessment conducted in 1989 by independent experts strongly recommended against the use of Bayticol because of serious data gaps regarding its environmental and health impacts. Under the information and evaluation component, two studies were initiated, an economic impact analysis and a wildlife study.  The wildlife study provided information on the life history of the bont tick, the animal species which it affects, and principal vectors.  The economic impact analysis provided only incomplete information. The following lessons were learned.  (1) Difficulties arise in projects where there are two implementing organizations, each with its own rules and regulations.  In such cases, clear lines of authority and the division of responsibilities should be defined.  (2) Before USAID can fund the use of a chemical, an environmental assessment of the chemical must be performed and the chemical must be EPA-approved.

"Evaluates project to modernize and privatize one of the nine Artificial Insemination and Breeding Stations in Poland to serve as a model for privatizing the rest of the industry.  Evaluation covers the period 3/92-4/93.  The project has been implemented by the American Breeders Service (ABS) and the Olecko Artificial Insemination (A.I.) and Breeding Station in Poland. At the midway point the project is viewed as a success by the Olecko A.I. and Breeding Station, Polish Officials, USAID, and ABS.  All parties involved seem to have learned a great deal from the project's first year of implementation and are now ready to apply those lessons to the remainder of the project. While the first year of the project has been successful, there are several activities crucial to the project's overall success that need to be carried out in this second year, including:  (1) completion of the privatization and business plans; (2) placement of a strong leader with good business skills at the Olecko Station; (3) taking a more pro-active role in policy reform; (4) training the personnel of the other Polish A.I. and Breeding Stations as well as interested individuals; and (5) completing the modernization of the Olecko Station.  This last activity will require establishing or completing a national marketing force, an operational computer system, and a modern semen collection, handling, processing, packaging, and distribution system. In order to accomplish these tasks, the project will require additional time and funding.  The original time and funding needs were perhaps underestimated.  The reason for this has been twofold.  Some activities are taking longer than anticipated. Other activities have been so successful that additional activities can now be carried out. An example of this second situation is that the training at the Olecko Station has worked extremely well; now other A.I. and Breeding Stations and private individuals are interested in receiving training and the government has asked ABS to extend the training program beyond Olecko. With additional funding, it is likely that the Olecko A.I. and Breeding Station will become a private business within a relatively short time.  This example could lead the way to the entire industry being privatized and subsidies ending.  This project has been the driving force beyond these developments and is expected to continue to lead the industry in its efforts to change.  Ultimately however, the Government of Poland has to make the decision about privatizing the industry.

"Evaluates as of 8/93 Save the Children Federation's Children and War (C&W) Program, which helps children who have been adversely affected by the war in Mozambique by documenting ""unaccompanied"" children, tracing relatives, reuniting families (or finding foster placements), and providing for the children's psychosocial needs.  In the C&W program, bilateral USAID/Mozambique funds (along with other-donor funding) support activities in Malawi and Zimbabwe as well as Mozambique. In all areas save one, the program has met and surpassed its goals and objectives, the exception being Documentation, Tracing, and Reunification (DTR) in Malawi, where appropriate remedies are already being applied.  The program has proven flexible, adapting well to difficult external factors and as a result has become involved -- often very successfully -- in unanticipated areas. It has succeeded in mobilizing human resources and the grassroots in a way that is particularly rare in Mozambique, and that ensures medium- and long-term sustainability. In Mozambique, C&W established a computerized Documentation and Tracing system, developed a network of over 7,000 volunteers, and played a major role in documenting over 10,000 unaccompanied children and reuniting or placing more than 4,000 (twice that number if spontaneous reunifications, some of which were influenced by C&W, are counted).  Its approach of encouraging displaced persons to organize themselves for collective action and volunteer their time and labor is, for Mozambique, truly revolutionary.  C&W has such strong ties with local community leaders that often it can intervene successfully with provincial governments when children's rights have been compromised.  In Malawi, C&W established the Consolacao program, documented 705 unaccompanied children, and assisted 10 with reunification.  In Zimbabwe, C&W documented 145 children and helped 15 with reunification. Other achievements include:  material assistance to needy families; psychosocial assistance for and skill training of children; influence on Mozambican law and policy toward child war victims; cooperation with and training of personnel from government agencies, NGOs, and community groups; and development of an ability to operate subregionally, across international borders, and to address policy issues such as the repatriation of Mozambican children in institutions in Zimbabwe and Malawi. The program teaches several lessons, particularly, but not only, for other programs in Africa.  (1) Reuniting unaccompanied children with their families is not a high priority for governments or NGOs, particularly in times of war, drought, or starvation. However, it is a priority for families, and there will be informal DTR programs operating, consisting of networks of people communicating with each other on such matters.  DTR programs should discover and assist these networks. (2) Programs directed at the psychosocial needs of children tend to be catalysts for other positive developments in the community. In rural Africa, any such program needs to be sensitive to accommodating indigenous beliefs about mental problems and must not depend on highly trained personnel or other outside resources.  Interventions can take many forms, e.g., organizing cultural and recreational activities, working with sensitive adults who know how to help children heal their wounds.  The best approaches mobilize active community support. (3) The main lesson in the area of human resource development and institutional linkages is that no matter how defined program activities are, it very difficult to set boundaries and rigid guidelines in emergency situations such as drought.  Although the role of government should not be eliminated, C&W with its network of community volunteers is currently fulfilling much of that role.  Also, the emergence of spontaneous support groups among women and mothers involved in skill training has benefitted children as well, and, along with other grassroots activities, bodes well for sustainability.","Assignment no.

"Pakistan's energy conservation program, the focus of this evaluation, began in 1986 as a $15.5 million component of the larger USAID Energy Planning and Development Project, and centered on creating the National Energy Conservation Center (ENERCON), a public sector institution.  The program has had an impact on energy savings and reduced pollutant emissions by participants, which though small in the national context, demonstrates the potential for energy efficiency in many sectors. ENERCON estimates that the program has led to $3.6 million in annual savings and 50% reduction in carbon monoxide and sulphur dioxide emissions in participating firms, an 11% reduction in gasoline consumption and a 50% drop in carbon monoxide and sulfur dioxide emissions in tuned-up cars, and substantial reductions in energy consumption and/or noxious emissions in agriculture and public buildings.  After recovery of the private investment costs of participating firms, the rate of return on USAID's $15.5 million is, in the industrial sector alone, about 19%.  Additionally, energy audit and training costs have dropped to sustainable levels.  Overall, ENERCON's sustainability is uncertain, although it has strengthened both public and private sector technical capacities and has created a modest demand for energy conservation consulting services.  It has proved most effective when it has sponsored focused energy audits (e.g., improved boiler efficiency, electric power use adjustments) and less effective when it has attempted total energy management surveys.  Lessons learned are as follows. (1) A successful energy conservation program requires a favorable economic and political climate.  (2) Energy conservation sells best when participants are given access to low-cost technologies with prompt pay-backs.  (3) Local private engineering expertise is critical for spreading and sustaining energy conservation services.  (4) Flexible project designs permit managers to respond effectively to new conditions.  In conclusion, the evaluation discusses three outstanding issues -- the roles of subsidies, of nonproject assistance, and of NGOs -- recommending that they be reassessed after 5 years.","Summary highlights: PN-ABG-015","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","9/1/1993 12:00:00 AM","","Energy conservation|Energy economics|Energy audits|Energy costs|Energy consumption|Pollution","Pakistan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAX269.pdf","155 KB","007222 - USAID.

"Evaluates 44 activities implemented between mid-91 and 2/93 in the Czech Republic, Poland, and Hungary under the Privatization and Enterprise Restructuring Project at a total cost of more than $31 million, about two-thirds of total project funding. It is estimated that over 70% of the expenditures have resulted in either outright success (52%) or mixed success (20%).  The Czech Republic's percentage of successful or mixed success results is 80%, Poland's is 64%, and Hungary's 85%.  A.I.D. assistance has led to outright success in the provision of specialized transaction assistance (96%), institutional support (89%), and policy/program support (80%). By contrast, 47% of the firm-specific projects have not been successful, and only 44% of sectoral studies have had enough impact to be considered successful. Some of the more notable successes have included:  (1) specialized transactional support to the Czech Ministry of Privatization through Crimson Capital/D&T; (2) assistance to the Mass Privatization Program in Poland; (3) work with the Czech Savings Bank; (4) development of an Employee Sponsored Ownership Plan program in Hungary; (5) financial sector regulation assistance in Poland; and (6) support to the State Property Agency in Hungary.  These successful projects either:  helped effect or speed up actual privatizations; established financial institutional structures for future privatizations and market development; established operational procedures for future privatizations; achieved concrete economic benefits (e.g., increased purchase prices, investment); or provided unanimous, tangible political benefits such as strong host government appreciation and/or demand for more A.I.D. services. Successful projects:  (1) enjoyed strong government and A.I.D. support; (2) were undertaken in the middle of the privatization sequence (e.g., during development of procedures or policy guidelines) or even towards the end when privatization proposals were being implemented; and (3) were focused at the policy/program or institutional support level and at one stage of the privatization process (e.g., transaction negotiations) and rendered to many firms. The following lessons have been learned.  (1) Facilitating the privatization process is better than promoting a single privatization transaction.  (2) Almost all the long-term advisors have been considered either critical or very useful to privatization programs by government officials and clients. These advisors often develop a strong understanding of the capability of government officials they are supporting, provide continuity when there are changes in Ministry staff, and establish credibility for the government with outside advisors and for A.I.D. with the government.  (3) Initiating advice early in a policy/program cycle can create credibility and jumpstart a policy/program, as has occurred several times in Hungary and the Czech Republic.  (4) A.I.D. privatization assistance should be focused yet diversified.  A.I.D. is especially qualified to supply foreign transaction assistance, but this should not be to the exclusion of rendering domestic privatization support; projects should not emphasize foreign investors for the sake of short-term economic benefits to the neglect of longer term domestic issues such as restructuring and promotion of domestic investment.  (5) At times, lack of coordination of contract management between A.I.D./W and the field has impeded project timeliness.  Conversations with A.I.D. representatives and A.I.D./W personnel reveal an underlying tension and debate as to which should manage the privatization program.  Currently, contract management is centered in A.I.D./W, which has been understaffed, had high turnover, and not always had funds for regular field visits.  These constraints, along with fast-changing demands in the field, have led to some disagreements and funding delays which have hurt A.I.D.'s credibility. (6) A decentralized, reactive privatization strategy in which initiatives are defined by government demands and/or marketing efforts of contractors can generate politic support and good will, and can be useful for testing pilot interventions.  However, continued application of an ad hoc strategy can dissipate resources, and in the absence of concrete results, weaken political support for a program.  Also, having the host government set the rules for project conduct is not always a reliable guide.  The evaluation includes guidelines for developing privatization programs in the Southern Tier countries and the Baltics.

"Evaluates project to strengthen management capacity in selected municipalities in the Ivory Coast through training, assistance with revenue enhancement, and facility construction.  Midterm evaluation covers the period 9/90-3/93. Progress -- particularly in revenue enhancement -- has been slowed by changes in the political and economic climate, major personnel turnovers, and institutional rivalry between the Ministry for Environment, Construction, and Urban Affairs and the Central Directorate for Public Works (DCGTx).  However, efforts by project management to circumvent the institutional problems at DCGTx, along with continuing dialogue with mayors, should result in improved performance in phase II. The project's strongest feature is its relevance to the emerging needs created by rapid extension of the local government system in the Ivory Coast.  The training strategy is particularly relevant because it provides technical training on-site, where the needs are most felt; this allows professionals to stay in the community instead of being sent to regional training centers. The sustainability of these onsite training efforts will require coordination with the management training being provided by the International Labor Organization. The major issue facing the project is sustainability, and specifically, the continued existence of the training unit. Neither the Directorate of Local Government nor the Ministry of the Interior have shown any institutional commitment to the unit, and given the government's financial problems, it is unlikely that they will.  It is more realistic to expect financial support to come from either other donors buying in to the training program or from the municipalities themselves.  However, privatization of the training unit will depend on two factors: that the trainers receive enough training and TA to enable them to respond to the emerging needs of municipalities in the decentralization process; and that the municipalities are able to identify their own training needs. With regard to planned participation in the training component by the Department of Social Development (DSS), sustainability will depend on the availability of local resources to support this initiative.  Given the dim economic situation faced by local governments, it is unlikely that the municipalities benefiting from the project will have the resources to meet DDS requirements for housing a social center or for financing the social workers to manage community action groups.","Delivery order no. 1","Special Evaluation","Documents","PCE-1008-I-00-2064-00","","3/1/1993 12:00:00 AM","","Urban development|Municipal level|Decentralization|Management training|Public administration|Financial management|Cities and towns|Beneficiary count","Ivory Coast","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNABP880.pdf","1,421 KB","006381 - Abt Associates, Inc.","","004517 - USAID.

"Final external evaluation of the Second Primary Education Project (PEP-2) in Pakistan, which sought to improve teaching in primary schools by introducing learning modules and training learning coordinators to assist teachers in their use.  The project was implemented over the period 1984-92.  Modules were developed in three provinces, but this evaluation is limited to Balochistan and Northwest Frontier Province. The project-developed learning modules are designed to serve several needs, including inservice teacher training, learning aids for students, and a focal point for measuring and upgrading student achievement. However, while the modules are available in the schools, the teachers are not using them.  Teachers are only vaguely aware of the modules and do not associate the training they received from the learning coordinators with the application of the modules for teaching. The project had a good idea, but its implementation strategy was weak.  Project directors failed to effectively establish a system of formative evaluation and they failed to integrate PEP-2 with the regular educational system; instead of working through the provincial departments of education, PEP-2 created a parallel Project Implementing Unit (PIU) in each project province.  This meant that on many occasions, the PEP-2 system competed with or conflicted with the regular system. Recruitment of staff with appropriate experience and competence was also a problem.  A project that aims at implementing a new and untried innovation in a very traditional society must recruit a dedicated team. The project never succeeded in doing this. Many provincial PIUs were without a Project Director for extended periods of time, and as responsibility for module development kept changing hands, the modular concept gradually diverged from its original design.  Those responsible for training project staff and learning coordinators came from a highly conventional background of teacher training and often were unclear or ignorant about the concept of the learning modules.  Early formative evaluation could have alerted those concerned to the fact that the initial PEP-2 concept had been abandoned due to the prevalence of the failed ideas that keep primary education in Pakistan in its present sorry state. Recommendations are made for a new project which not only builds on the gains and mistakes of PEP-2 but to a large extent on its original intentions, which remain unrealized.","Delivery order no. 9","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","PDC-5832-I-00-0082-00","","4/1/1993 12:00:00 AM","","Primary education|Teacher training|Educational innovations|Educational methods|Educational materials","Pakistan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNABP910.pdf","1,313 KB","000461 - Education Development Center, Inc.

"PACR on a project to provide U.S. training opportunities to participants from the Eastern Caribbean in the areas of business, tourism, nontraditional agriculture, youth leadership (including drug abuse education) and, to a lesser extent, emergency preparedness. Project was implemented by the Partners of the Americas.  Evaluation covers the period 7/86-7/89. The project trained 223 short-term and 1 long-term candidate in the United States.  Of these, 125, or 55%, were women (USAID targeted 40%), and 170 were from the private sector.  Of the fields of study offered under the project, business was the most popular, with 149 persons being trained in this area. Additionally, the Grenada-Broome County Partnership was successfully established and 12 Grenadians received training through this Partnership. The following lessons were learned.  (1) The project was affected by a number of implementation problems stemming from the weak institutional framework of the Eastern Caribbean Partnerships. This was largely reflected in the Partnerships' inability to process applications and prepare documentation for training in a timely manner.  One result of these slow implementation efforts was that project achievements, with respect to individual training, were less than planned and RDO/C was forced to intervene and use the group training mechanism in order to attain the targets originally projected.  (2) Strictly volunteer organizations, operating without the necessary support staff, often lack the essential framework to execute developmental programs of any significant magnitude.  Lack of support staff particularly affects participant training programs, which are extremely labor-intensive.  (3) Lack of support staff also affects the trainee recruitment process; in some cases the best caliber candidates were not selected for training.

"Final external evaluation (XD-ABG-819-A) of a project (1988-12/92) to increase livestock production in Belize. Of the seven EOPS (end of project status) indicators, four were achieved, one was partially achieved, and two were not achieved. Indicators were met in four areas.  (1) In the beef production component, improved Brahman stock were imported, and breeding plans made and computerized.  The pasture improvement program introduced new grass species and nurseries and trained farmers in pasture management.  As a result, beef production continues to meet domestic supply requirements. However, exports dropped with the closure of the Belize Meats Ltd., the beef exporting company, so that production increases did not lead to increases in farmer income.  In fact, if the present surplus of cattle is not exported, prices will actually drop.  (2) Personnel development at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries (MAF) functioned very well. Three MAF staff members obtained B.S. or M.S. degrees, and 32 persons, mostly MAF staff, received short-term training abroad in different livestock disciplines.  Seminars and demonstrations provided training to 1,238 participants in extension methodology, pasture management, cattle management, dairy management, cattle breeding, artificial insemination, swine management, poultry production, and beekeeping.  In addition, training and equipment were provided to the Soil and Tissue Analysis Laboratory and the Veterinary Clinic and Diagnostic Laboratory at the Central Farm.  Funds were lacking, however, to operationalize the pesticide residue analysis laboratory.  (3) In furtherance of the goal to increase the private sector's role in the livestock industry, the project helped the Belize Livestock Producers Association (BLPA) add new activities, including management of a credit program for fattening steers and management of the new Livestock Central Market (LCM).  The roles of MAF and private sector have become distinct while working together for betterment of the livestock industry, although BLPA's limited financial resources constrain it from assuming a greater role. (4) The screwworm eradication program was a success.  On June 21, 1992 Belize was declared free of screwworm and remains so to this day. The marketing and credit component was partially successful.  A market assessment for Belizean cattle and beef was conducted in CARICOM countries, Mexico, and the USA, and the project assisted in the construction of a facility to export live cattle to Mexico. Furthermore, the LCM, expected to become operational in April 1993, will assist in marketing of all livestock.  The project also helped establish credit for fattening of steers by farmers (Fondo Ganadero).  Credit for pork and milk production was not considered. Two EOPS indicators were not achieved.  (1) Domestic pork production did not increase.  The number of pigs slaughtered each year from 1988 to 1992 remained constant, and the demand for pork by processors remained unsatisfied.  On the positive side, the project:  imported breeding stock, developed breeding plans, computerized swine records, and trained farmers in production. The analysis of feeder pig production in private sector, as recommended in Project Paper, should have been given priority in efforts to increase pork production.  (2) The target to increase milk production was also not met.  The amount of milk purchased by Macal, the processing plant, dropped about 20% after 1989 and remained at about one third of the processing capacity of a single shift.  Project activities in the dairy sector included: development and revision of operational and management plans for Central Farm and farmers, artificial insemination and training of farmers.  The problem is not the lack of milk cows but internal management problems at Macal.","Attached to PD-ABG-819","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","3/1/1993 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural production|Livestock|Beef cattle|Swine|Dairy cattle|Milk|Animal husbandry|Beneficiary count","Belize","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDABG819A.pdf","1,235 KB","","","007158 - Belize.

Midterm evaluation covers the period 12/91-9/93. The project's focus on income increases and/or job creation has led to the emergence and consolidation of a new type of NGO -- one that specializes in agricultural technology transfer and provides inputs to the small farm sector.  Neither the state nor the private for-profit sector have a significant presence in either activity or in the sector. The Government of Bolivia could use this component as a model for a new national system for agricultural technology transfer as it reorganizes the Institute of Agricultural Technology (IBTA). To date, more than 20 NGOs have received project grants and have provided TA to more than 6,500 families (over 1,100 in the Chapare); almost 600 pilot projects have demonstrated production technologies and/or new crops in the zone; over 12,000 people (78% men and 22% women) have received short courses or on-the-job training in agriculture and livestock production technologies, soil and water conservation, accounting, credit operation, and crafts.  Yields per ha have increased significantly, in some cases doubling or tripling, through the use of high quality seeds (not even certified seeds), new varieties, improved technologies, and the unadulterated inputs provided by the NGOs. Although net incomes have increased, along with yields per ha, long-term improvement in quality of life will not be determined until these increases can be sustained for some time.  For this, farmers will require continued access to production inputs and TA.  As NGOs are currently the only source of TA in most project areas, it is advised that the project revise its strategy to encourage NGO self-sufficiency and extend the life of the component, which is scheduled to end in June 1994. PA administers the component through a well-designed, very detailed system, and is generally respected by NGO staff. Complaints, few in number, seem to have centered not on technical or administrative issues, but on occasional overzealous project supervision.  If the component is extended, PA will be well-suited to continue its implementation. On a broader scale, the NGO component would benefit if the many agencies involved in project implementation were to reach a consensus regarding the NGO component's purpose and implementation and adopt Integrated Product Development Plans (IPDP) as their guide to action.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","9/1/1993 12:00:00 AM","","Coca|Crop substitution|Indigenous private voluntary organizations|Agricultural extension|Agricultural training|Beneficiary count","Bolivia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABG866.pdf","2,264 KB","001335 - Chemonics International Consulting Div.","","008515 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to increase the international competitiveness and employment generating capacities of Sri Lankan industry through technology transfer.  Interim evaluation covers the period 6/91-7/93. The project has been extremely successful and cost effective. Clients have enjoyed a composite growth rate of approximately 62%, compared to a 1992 national growth rate of approximately 5%. More than 2,800 new full-time jobs have been created in addition to a substantial increase in the number of contracted piece-rate workers.  U.S. imports to Sri Lanka have increased threefold, and non-U.S. imports have increased by approximately 87%.  Domestic sales have increased 34% and export sales 100%. Expenditures on technology and equipment have increased 100%. There is every reason to believe that client initiatives will be sustained through self-determination and a dynamic market system. The project has experienced a huge demand for assistance, and has approved more than $3.2 million in subgrants compared to budget projections of $2.4 million.  Appropriate adjustments were made to the Cooperative Agreement (2/93) to reduce the number of activities, award fewer grants in smaller increments, and require larger client contributions.  Quality performance, however, has not been affected, and demand remains strong. The project's success has been driven by promotional and support activities.  Through visits to over 1,000 businesses, promotional activities through industry and trade associations, feasibility reports, speaking engagements, and workshops and seminars on enterprise development and technology trasnfer, the project gained 205 active clients, and has directly reached in excess of 5,600 individuals in primary economic sectors, government, and public services.  The U.S. staff prepares brief trade show reports and reports on industry reconnaissance opportunities; coordinates market and technology research studies through the American Business Linkage Enterprise (ABLE) network; assists in searches for U.S. suppliers, equipment sources, and markets; and coordinates client visits to the United States (including arrangements with the Entrepreneurs International program).  One hundred and twenty-eight subgrant activities have been completed.  Over 100 Sri Lankan clients and over 200 U.S. principals have been mutually introduced. The project's primary focus, grant activity, has allowed clients to identify new sources of technology; upgrade processes; license new products; design production lines; receive training and consulting services; develop marketing materials; make environmental and safety improvements; receive export marketing assistance; make laboratory equipment purchases; and form linkages with potential foreign collaborations. The following lessons were learned.  (1) The project's integrated design is unique and could serve as a model for USAID and International Executive Services Corps (IESC) private sector initiatives.  However, it may not work for donors that lack access to an integrated business network, like that of IESC.  (2) Successfully implemented projects require exit strategies for graceful project completion.  (3) A demand-driven approach has enhanced the project's ability to meet client needs.  The project urged clients to submit proposals based on their own needs.  (4) Non-targeted assistance avoids making political or economic assumptions about sector preferences or capabilities, thereby averting potential conflicts in the host country and reinforcing client confidence that the project will remain impartial in awarding grants on merit and initiative.  (5) Implementing projects outside the realm of government direction and control prevents the project from coming under undue government influence and strengthens the project's credibility in the eyes of its clients.  (6) Promoting the concepts of self-worth and self-determination is essential for success in private enterprise development.","Delivery order no. 7|Companion evaluation summary: PD-ABH-878","Special Evaluation","Documents","AEP-0085-I-00-3003-00","","8/1/1993 12:00:00 AM","","Private sector|Economic development|Business support services|Business enterprises|Technological development","Sri Lanka","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABG867.pdf","2,150 KB","000356 - Checchi and Co.

"Final evaluation of a project (9/85-9/93) to enhance the capacity of Egypt's local governments to (1) plan, implement, and maintain basic service delivery systems (BSDSs), and (2) sustain such services through local resource mobilization (LRM). Results were mixed. On the positive side, systems for planning and implementing BSDSs have been established in each governorate. Local popular and executive council members, along with governorate, markaz, and village/district officials, have planned and implemented 17,000 BSDS subprojects which have provided basic services in water, electricity, roads, wastewater, and school renovation. In addition, many facilities were put in place under the operations and maintenance (O&amp;M) component, including, inter alia, 875 village workshops, 175 markaz maintenance centers, and 31 zonal/district workshops and central garages/workshops. All told, BSDS services have benefitted nearly 90% of Egypt's rural and urban population. Finally, improvement in local government capacity to implement BSDSs was demonstrated at all levels. Notable achievements included training of over 94,000 governorate staff through Governorate Training Centers, and establishment in each governorate of a maintenance coordinator and of management information systems (MIS) which use quarterly data to allocate funds for local subprojects. Prospects for sustaining these achievements are mixed, however. The MIS exhibits the greatest potential, as long as the Office of Cabinet Affairs requires automated retrieval of governorate information; the Land Management Units and the Offices of Analysis and Financial Development also show promise. Sustainability of other elements is unlikely. Prospects for O&amp;M are dim due to the Government of Egypt's (GOE) failure to address recurrent cost funding, and only a handful of established training institutions have incorporated project-designed training programs into their curriculum. As for institution-building, the project's use of block grant funding, which provided the greatest stimulus in this area, has not been institutionalized by the GOE, and there exist no central coordinating agencies linked to the Ministry of Local Administration (MLA) to assist in developing guidelines for local efforts. Overall, the project erred in linking local institutional development to GOE policy and organizational changes. Well-entrenched and powerful elements in the GOE will dominate local bodies for years to come. The LRM component was limited by existing law, which does not allow local authorities to collect, manage, and retain significant amounts of money. Nevertheless, numerous local attempts are made by rural and urban governorates to generate revenue for basic services, including fees-for-service, income generation, cost recovery, assessments, leasing of public facilities to private operators, privatizing public enterprises, and voluntary contributions. There has been no evidence of cooperation among the Ministry of Finance, the MLA, and local administrative units to promote and support LRM. In sum, the purpose of the LRM component was not met and is not likely to be met for years to come. The following lessons were learned. (1) Infrastructure development, which immediately affects much of the population, is an effective incentive for innovations in administrative and government systems in which improved performance is not immediately felt or credited to the proper source. (2) Basing sustainability of basic services on a major policy change at the GOE level was unrealistic. In practice, local projects are most likely to be sustained with local initiatives not sanctioned in any way by the GOE. (3) Had project activities been set within the GOE rather than within a parallel structure which the GOE administrative organization is not equipped to direct, the chances of sustainability would have increased.","Companion evaluation summary: PD-ABJ-054","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","263-0182-C-00-3067-00","","9/1/1993 12:00:00 AM","","Public services|Local level|Government|Institution building|Project sustainability|Local financing","Egypt","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABG869.pdf","2,969 KB","001600 - Associates in Rural Development, Inc.

"Evaluates project to improve family planning (FP) services in Latin America through the application of operations research (OR) and TA. Interim evaluation covers the period 9/89-5/93. Having completed 3.5 years, the project has developed 42 subprojects (SPs) in 11 countries, thus fulfilling its major contract requirement. It has demonstrated flexibility in developing different types of SPs and applying different research approaches. The majority of the SPs involve field testing solutions to service delivery problems, ranging from increasing access to FP in rural areas to developing postpartum programs in large urban hospitals.  About a third of the SPs are primarily TA efforts, and these range from conducting a seminar or workshop to refining a model for a postpartum adolescent program.  The remaining SPs are diagnostic studies, including a comprehensive situation analysis. Although most of the SPs are still underway, considerable progress has been achieved.  The project is testing new ways to increase access to an expanded range of FP methods in rural areas by working through PVO networks and ministry of heath units.  It has led a successful effort to introduce FP in postpartum hospital programs and has spurred replication in various countries in the region and by other A.I.D. cooperating agencies. It has also incorporated cost-effectiveness analysis and pricing strategies into efforts of private sector FP agencies, and is working to put into practice a theoretical framework for quality of care in a number of programs. The project has contributed to a widening awareness of OR concepts and its value to FP service delivery, although institutionalization of OR capacity is found only in selected agencies in a few countries.  The project has also provided broad and effective support for reproductive health as an approach to the delivery of FP services.","Project title: Population technical assistance (POPTECH)","Special Evaluation","Documents","DPE-3024-Z-00-8078-00","","5/1/1993 12:00:00 AM","","Operations research|Family planning services","Latin America|Caribbean","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABG870.pdf","2,553 KB","006243 - Dual & Associates, Inc.|000673 - International Science and Technology Institute, Inc.

"Midterm evaluation of the Population Communication Services (PCS) project, administered by Johns Hopkins University's School of Hygiene and Public Health.  The project, which began in 1990, provides TA and support in the area of information, education, and communication (IEC) to family planning (FP) programs in developing countries.  The current project is the third cooperative agreement between JHU and USAID, with work having begun in 1982. The project has achieved significant outputs and has 55 country projects underway or completed at mid-term.  The highly qualified PCS staff and the application of standard and innovative research methods to strategically plan, design, implement, and evaluate projects set a high standard for IEC programming and create a strong demand for PCS services.  USAID has encouraged PCS to respond to this demand even though this strategy has meant accelerating spending beyond levels estimated in the cooperative agreement. The following lessons have been demonstrated.  (1) Effective IEC campaigns can lead to increases in contraceptive prevalence.  (2) Research is indispensable at every stage of an IEC intervention. It is as important to conduct a needs assessment and field test products at the design stage (to identify whether message approach and content are appropriate) and to monitor their progress during the campaign (to identify need for any fine tuning) as it is to assess their impact at the end point.  A strategic plan, based on a needs assessment and integrating multiple IEC aspects, can result in more far-reaching and sustained program efforts. (3) IEC has demonstrated that contraception can be discussed in public without strong negative reactions.  Major institutions, policymakers, and opinion leaders can be helped to address FP issues without compromising their roles.  (4) Operationalizing IEC campaign goals (such as informed choice and spousal communication) in order to improve contraceptive behavior is not a simple process.  Careful training of counselors to be flexible and address real life situations is needed in order to avoid erecting rather than lowering barriers to contraceptive use.  (5) TA can be so helpful that host country staff are unwilling to give it up, even after their skills have been upgraded. (6) Use of resident advisors for large-scale activities results in more consistent program efforts and better cooperation with other organizations. (7) Organizing an international assistance project geographically can result in duplication of technical skills among geographic regions but may be more responsive to field needs than a functional approach.  (8) Although mass communications have been shown to be capable of reaching large numbers of people effectively, traditional formats such as village gatherings and festivals can also provide channels for transmitting messages where technology is undeveloped. (9) Even though many countries may have low literacy levels, newspapers can serve as a useful medium for communicating FP information to opinion leaders and other literate persons who in turn can reach the larger community.  (10) An organization like PCS, with a clear but limited mandate and a strong, highly qualified staff, needs to be careful about accepting requests to assist in related non-family planning areas unless these activities serve to expand the audience for its primary issues and can do so with existing resources. More attention could now be given to activities that address the gap between awareness and family planning use, to effective collaboration with other Cooperating Agencies, and to dissemination of important research and program findings.  The project merits favorable funding consideration in the next cooperative agreement to ensure funds for expansion of activities.

"Mid-term evaluation of the Agribusiness Exchange Program (ABE) to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of private agriculture in Central and Eastern Europe through training.  Evaluation covers the period 4/91-8/93. The ABE training project is a good entry approach to assisting the development of private agriculture in Eastern Europe.  U.S. training has been particularly effective in developing new patterns of free enterprise thinking and opening the minds of trainees to what is possible.  Repeated in-country courses have created a strong cadre of private entrepreneurs, extension agents, rural bankers, and others committed to private sector cooperatives and farmer-controlled agribusinesses. The project has had the following outputs:  (1) initiation of a national debate in Poland to prohibit cooperative employees from serving on boards of directors necessary to convert old style cooperatives to member control (legislation was subsequently vetoed by the president over this issue); (2) assistance in the drafting and passage of a new cooperative law in Lithuania, growing out of the shared experiences of U.S. training participants; (3) strengthening of small agribusiness companies and cooperatives, including an outstanding private poultry processing plant in Poland which uses U.S. packaging, processing, and other techniques; (4) training of extension agents, farm organizational leaders, and government officials, who constitute a strong institutional base to promote farmer-controlled agribusinesses, especially in Eastern Poland; (5) assistance in the creation of regional policies favorable to the formation of farmer-controlled cooperatives through strengthening of regional foundations; and (6) strengthening of 500 Polish rural cooperative banks and 3 recently formed regional banks by training key bank officials, managers, boards of directors, and over 285 loan officers, as well as rural lending institutions in Estonia and Romania, especially in credit lending practices for private agribusinesses. The project has an excellent evaluation system and is well coordinated with Volunteers for Overseas Cooperative Assistance (VOCA), USDA, and other providers of training and TA.  Linkages with VOCA volunteers for short-term TA and to carry out U.S. training have been particularly successful. ABE will need to focus more tightly on a clear strategy and concentrate on change agents to enhance measurable impacts.  ABE is ready to shift from generalized, diagnostic training to highly targeted training interventions at an enterprise level. The project is in the process of shifting resources to  Southern Tier countries and has the opportunity to benefit from lessons learned from its earlier programs which have successfully linked small agribusinesses with sources of capital. Among the lessons learned are that training programs in Central and Eastern Europe are effective in helping the transition to a market economy through a ""shift in thinking"" by participants. However, demonstrated impacts require a series of training interventions, one-on-one TA and, in the case of entrepreneurs, access to finance. Generally, a training strategy should target emerging entrepreneurs in specific sectors of small-scale, value-added agricultural activities. Stand-alone training projects should be linked closely with other collaborators to provide a full range of interventions (e.g., policy and legislative reform, banking services and complementary short and long-term TA).","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","8/1/1993 12:00:00 AM","","Agribusiness|Agricultural cooperatives|Agricultural training|Agricultural extension|Private enterprises","Central and Eastern Europe|Lithuania|Poland|Estonia|Romania","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABG872.pdf","1,295 KB","000238 - Agricultural Cooperative Development International (ACDI)","","007154 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to increase public awareness of development issues and strengthen the professional capability of organizations involved in development education.  Evaluation covers the period 1982-10/93. The project has made significant strides toward increasing awareness of development issues within the American public and has made certain, but unsteady, strides toward strengthening the field of development education. The size and types of audiences reached by the project are difficult to measure due to insufficient feedback from grantees; however, a conservative estimate is that 37 million people have been reached at least once.  Grantees have done a good job of targeting and reaching the kinds of leadership, practitioner, and group audiences intended for the program.  Targeted audiences were found to be knowledgeable, articulate, influential, and active in their communities, and are considered likely activists for promoting wide, lasting impact. Grantees have also done a good job of focusing on the primary development issues of global interdependence, hunger, poverty, and the key roles of agriculture and the environment.  Audiences have been most receptive to themes of global interdependencies among nations, and the humanitarian responsibility of the United States to help other nations, including the provision of economic assistance; and least receptive to the message of helping others before solving our domestic problems, the idea that root causes of Third World hunger and poverty are the same as in the United States, and that aid can be effective in dealing with poverty, population growth, and environmental conditions.  To the project's credit, development messages have been diversified, and have changed over time to reflect shifts in A.I.D. policies.  On the negative side, however, at times these message have been one-sided, lacked substantiation, and included weak recommendations for follow-up action. Grantees' programming approaches have varied.  About three-fourths of the grantees have tried overtly to change public attitudes; fewer than half have encouraged public involvement in Third World issues, programs, or causes.  The diverse mix of the grantees selected through open competition is most often seen as the program's greatest strength.  The program's greatest weakness is lack of an overall plan (consisting of consistent objectives, themes, activities, and information products) by which grantees' performances can be evaluated.  Lessons learned in this area include the need of grantees to have the support of their parent institutions, the need to monitor audience reach, and the need to conduct more thorough and more frequent self-evaluations and improve reporting and information dissemination. Development education is a new field, and one result of the diversity among grantees has been a high degree of innovation. However, mechanisms for replicating these innovative programs are lacking.  Chances for project sustainability are mixed: generally, grantees that were already involved in development education prior to project support will continue to work in this field, perhaps using skills newly learned under the project; grantees that were not involved prior to a project usually do not continue after it.  Finally, the program has been a catalyst for development education efforts nationally, and has contributed to the growth of an informal, often local professional network, as well as a national network (which, however, remains small). The best mix of organizations to increase impact would be many of the same organizations in the field now, but with improved guidance and stronger, explicit contract requirements.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","FAO-0800-C-00-2085-00","","10/1/1993 12:00:00 AM","","Development education|Grants","USA","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNABP964.pdf","8,654 KB","003019 - Intercultural Communication, Inc.","","007028 - USAID.

"Evaluates the Consulting Assistance for Economic Reform (CAER) project, designed to help A.I.D. and developing countries design, implement, and evaluate economic policy reform.  Interim evaluation covers the period 7/89-6/93. At the time of the evaluation, 24 core and 51 buy-in activities had been completed.  Illustrative efforts have included: identification of lessons from Asia's development experience applicable to Africa; a Costa Rica capital markets study; an examination of the social costs of macro-economic structural adjustment in Africa and Latin America; recommendations for Central Bank reforms in the Philippines; and a study on tax and pension reform in Hungary. Without question the project has achieved its objective of enhancing A.I.D.'s capacity to provide economic policy assistance to developing nations.  The project has been well-managed by both A.I.D./PRE and the main contractor, the Harvard Institute for International Development (HIID); both have operated in a client-oriented and professional manner. The quality of work has been consistently excellent, probably because HIID has done an exceptional job of fielding high-quality TA teams. HIID has also developed useful publication series for disseminating project products, including the CAER Briefing Notes series and the CAER Discussion Paper series.  Presentations have also been used effectively in conveying lessons learned to A.I.D. staff. The demand for buy-ins from A.I.D./W bureaus and USAID field missions has been greater than expected.  This has kept the project's research agenda demand driven and has ensured that technical oversight remained within the funding bureau, two aspects which have enhanced the project's quality and responsiveness.  One of the project's strengths has been its ability to serve as a quick-response mechanism for delivering clearly defined products through short-term TA.  (There is no demand from the field for long-term TA.)  It appears that the project has filled an important niche, both for applied analytic work for A.I.D./W bureaus and for TA to field missions.  For many of its activities, the project has been the only logical contracting mechanism available. Given Harvard's stature, the project perhaps should be given a broader role in developing A.I.D.'s economic policy reform agenda. Other recommendations are to:  increase dissemination activities; increase the funding ceiling for individual buy-ins, especially as there will likely be continuing demand for large buy-ins from the New Independent States and Eastern Europe; and explore ways to collaborate with related A.I.D. projects.

"Final evaluation of a program (1983-91) to strengthen local institutional capacities for and awareness of human rights issues in Yemen, Egypt, Tunisia, Morocco, and Jordan.  The program comprised projects 3980054 and 3980280 and was implemented by AMIDEAST. Participant training for law faculties and judiciaries, almost all of it conducted at an annual month-long seminar in Strasbourg, was the most significant component of the program. The program effectively introduced participants to the world of human rights, although reaction varied by country (e.g., Egyptian participants were highly critical of the course, while the Moroccans valued it highly).  A 1991 training program held in Siracusa, Italy, for media professionals was valued highly by participants, most of whom felt it should be continued and extended to other groups.  On the other hand, observational tours of the U.S. judicial system for parliamentarians and justices proved costly and ineffective due to language barriers and the significant disparity between the Near East and the U.S. approach to law. The above assistance has yielded practical benefits.  Legal professionals spoke of how the training changed their views and practices on human rights issues, and judges have begun deciding cases differently.  In addition, human rights content has been incorporated into law school curricula, one law professor produced a textbook on human rights, and a Moroccan participant came home to organize an organization for human rights. Networking was cited as a significant benefit of training. By contrast, the project had little success in assisting local human rights advocacy groups.  Some groups felt that A.I.D. assistance could jeopardize their independence, while in other countries governments have discouraged the formation and activities of such groups.  Assistance to the Tunisian League for Human Rights was possible only because AMIDEAST respected the League's independence and the assistance was not identified as coming from the United States.  On a brighter note, assistance to women's organizations for educational and advocacy work in Jordan, Tunisia, and Morocco was well received.  The Tunisian organization successfully lobbied parliament to pass new family laws protecting women's rights related to child custody and alimony. While decentralization of project management to USAID and AMIDEAST field staffs in 1989 did not hinder the project, A.I.D.'s limitation of funding to one-year increments undercut the project's ability to develop a long-term strategy.  There was also a fair amount of A.I.D. micro-management of the project. Currently, Missions have little interest in managing a human rights program, which is seen as political and a diversion from their primary task of promoting development. Embassy staff have a deep interest in human rights, but most do not see themselves involved in implementing the program. Lessons learned included the following.  (1) Significant short-term changes in human rights practices are more likely to be brought about by political events than by development programs.  (2) U.S. institutions are effective administrators of A.I.D.'s in-country human rights programs and an essential mechanism in supporting local advocacy groups. No regional institution with this capability yet exists, although the Arab Institute for Human Rights holds promise.  It is important that the U.S. intermediary know the region well, however.  (3) Education and training -- particularly of advocacy groups and opinion leaders -- are the key to changing human rights practices.  (4) There is a lack of human rights material in Arabic.  (5) Local human rights advocacy groups will require donor subsidies for some time if activities are to be sustained and expanded.","Delivery order no. 16","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","OTR-0000-I-00-0035-00","","1/1/1993 12:00:00 AM","","Human rights|Legal systems|Participants|Legal education|Judiciary","Yemen|Egypt|Tunisia|Morocco|Jordan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABG951.pdf","3,378 KB","000436 - Development Associates, Inc.","","004200 - USAID.

"Evaluates a grant to the National Council for International Health (NCIH) to strengthen the role of PVOs in the prevention and control of HIV/AIDS.  Midterm evaluation covers the period 1991-1993. The project has been an effective and relatively inexpensive way for A.I.D. to help expand access to HIV prevention and control programs in developing countries.  Under NCIH leadership, the PVO network expanded from 30 members in mid-1990 to over 140 by early 1993.  Washington-based international health PVOs have benefitted most from the project, though the new relationship with Interaction may attract more non-health oriented members.  While smaller PVOs have profited less, project leadership has made significant efforts to respond to their needs.  It has been somewhat difficult for the project to involve indigenous PVOs because the level of funding has not been sufficient to reach small organizations based in developing countries. The project's most impressive accomplishment has been the networking opportunities it has provided PVOs through: workshops, especially the annual conference, which remains NCIH's premiere activity; newsletters, especially the bimonthly AIDSLINK; frequent informal meetings in Washington; and other links made by the Project Manager.  These fora have given credibility and support to PVOs new to the area of AIDS/HIV, linked PVOs having common needs and valuable experience to share, matched PVOs with funding sources, and linked U.S. domestic and U.S. international PVOs. In addition to its service to PVOs, the project has become an information resource on the international AIDS epidemic for other organizations and concerned citizens.  The project has also facilitated dialogue between PVOs and AIDSCAP, A.I.D.'s largest AIDS project.  In addition, the project manager has served as a de facto negotiator/facilitator in discussions of Government/PVO funding issues; an example is the Project's role in preparing the draft concept paper, ""HIV/AIDS flexible funding,"" in which PVOs present a rationale for increased funding of HIV/AIDs activities in developing countries. However, despite the utility of this role, it is strongly recommended that in the future the project concentrate on substantive, programmatic issues. While the project has improved PVOs' HIV/AIDS programming by facilitating the exchange of successful program models and experience, it has not played a major role in providing TA, information, or materials (the NCIH Project Manager feels that budget and staffing do not permit this), although it has frequently put PVOs in touch with sources of technical information.  In the area of service delivery, efforts have focused on care for AIDS orphans through ongoing formal and informal meetings.  The issue of home-based care may be discussed at a forthcoming workshop. Finally, the project has undertaken several initiatives not outlined in the original scope of work, including (1) planning a forthcoming meeting on AIDS in Eastern Europe with the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) and the International Center for Better Health; (2) participation in a CSIS working group on AIDS as a foreign policy issue; (3) assisting in the preparation of AIDS documents for President Clinton's transition team; (4) working with Funders Concerned about AIDS to link domestic and international AIDS activities; and (5) contributing to strategic thinking on overall policy and program priorities for the U.S. Government in international AIDS efforts.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","DPE-5929-C-00-0049-00","","4/1/1993 12:00:00 AM","","Institution building|Private voluntary organizations|Disease prevention and control|HIV/AIDS|Networks","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABG945.pdf","930 KB","006404 - Atlantic Resources Corp.","","006943 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of a project to provide employment, food, health, resettlement, and relocation assistance to displaced Salvadorans. Evaluation covers the period from 1982-93.  The project evolved during its eleven-year history in response to the unpredictable course of the conflict in El Salvador, changing circumstances of the displaced, and periodic evaluation. Initially, the project focused on emergency relief through the provision of temporary employment, immunization and oral rehydration salts, curative health services, and food distribution. Beginning about 1987 the project emphasized reintegration and graduation through assistance for relocation and resettlement. Conclusions are as follows.  (1) The project successfully provided a safety net for many of the displaced when the Salvadoran government could not and helped to settle or relocate in rural areas many who otherwise would have migrated to overcrowded urban centers.  (2) The project adjusted and responded well to changing circumstances through timely use of evaluations and flexible management. The following lessons were learned.  (1) Adjustable project design and rapid response capacity are critical ingredients for a displaced persons program.  (2) A too proactive donor role may lead to the host government making less effort to support the program.  (3) Graduation from relief support should occur as early as possible in accordance with a specific plan and criteria.  (4) Coordination is often lacking and needs attention in emergency programs to stretch resources and avoid duplication. (5) If availability of implementing institutions is limited in a civil conflict context, strengthening support for inexperienced institutions may be needed. The evaluation team recommended no further special programs for the displaced.  Safety net objectives have been met, most displaced have reintegrated, and remaining needs can and should be met within the context of national welfare and other development programs.

"PACR of a project (8/88-12/91) to establish a debt/equity conversion mechanism within the Central Bank (CB) of the Dominican Republic as a vehicle for increasing U.S. and domestic equity investment. Project implementation was delayed until 4/90 because the CB was slow to commit to the project, and because of difficulty in obtaining amendments to the commercial bank credit agreements allowing the initiation of debt reduction programs.  Nonetheless, the project did establish and train a Debt Conversion Unit within the CB, and provided training to 15 other CB personnel.  Eighteen debt conversion projects have been completed (vs. 30 targeted) in the following broad investment categories:  tourism (5); environment and social development (3); commercial bank recapitalization (4); and commercial and industrial uses (6). The projects resulted in a tendering to the CB of almost U.S. $70 million in external debt instruments, or 1.7% of the Dominican Republic's average outstanding external debt as of 5/31/90. On the broader issue of external debt strategy, the TA team helped the Dominican Republic to re-establish open communications with commercial banks, the IMF, and other external creditors, culminating in an IMF economic program in 8/91.  The team was also instrumental in bringing about an 11/91 debt restructuring agreement with the Paris Club group of official creditors (the project's most significant accomplishment).  The team also helped the Dominican government to identify options for debt renegotiation based on information from recent U.S. Treasury (Brady Plan) debt restructurings with other Latin American countries, but no renegotiation has yet been done. The TA team prepared sensitivity analyses, which the government presented to the San Jose Accord creditors (Venezuela and Mexico) and used to repurchase, at a significant discount, approximately $500 million in past due loans.  This transaction offered the Dominican government the chance for new petroleum credits from these two main suppliers.  All of this was done so that the government could enter into a new debt agreement with the commercial banks that would allow debt conversion using lender bank debt instruments. The following lessons were learned.  (1)  The project had to accommodate the significant variations in the approaches of 3 CB governors; careful judgment was needed to determine how their attitudes could be accommodated.  (2) Since debt conversion is dependent on the larger issue of debt restructuring, the project design could have focused TA on external debt consultation. (3) The management information systems support was greater than the volume of operations warranted.  A more basic installation would have sufficed.  (4) Debt conversion projects should: (a) have A.I.D. Legal Counsel review debtholder documentation to ensure that debt conversion or other debt reduction is permitted; (b) coordinate with the U.S. Treasury, which monitors the debt status of restructuring countries; and (c) consider funding integrated external debt advisory services.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","4/1/1993 12:00:00 AM","","Debt repayment|Debt equity|Financial institutions|Debt servicing","Dominican Republic","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABG983.pdf","1,074 KB","008537 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (9/89-2/93) to help local manufacturers and suppliers in the Dominican Republic increase their sales to manufacturers located in the Industrial Free Trade Zone (IFTZ) and eventually to other offshore markets. The project was making excellent progress in linking indigenous companies and IFTZ firms and in preparing the former for export markets when it was terminated in 2/93 following enactment of the Foreign Operations Export Financing and Related Programs Appropriation Act for FY 93, a provision of which prohibits assistance to export processing zones if such assistance could negatively affect U.S. jobs. A total of 11 business linkages were formed in the sub-sectors of wire, packaging materials, labels, adhesives, sheet metal, and leather shoe soles, generating more than $2 million in annual sales.  In addition, a total of 22 linkages were in the process of being formed in the above subsectors and the additional subsectors of transformer bobbins, alcohol, ceramic tiles, shoes, and untreated leather, with projected sales of more than $34 million.  Over 200 business associations and individual firms attended seminars/workshops on topics such as World Class Manufacturing and Establishing an Export Promotion Law.  The project also:  produced monthly bulletins and a comprehensive database of buyers (IFTZ firms) and sellers (indigenous firms); drafted specific modifications to the Dominican Republic's Temporary Admissions Law; and developed a proposal, openly endorsed by the private sector, for a comprehensive Export Promotion Law (now under review in the Dominican National Council for Industrial Restructuring). However, the project probably would not have achieved its overall targets even if it had been continued.  First, project designers overestimated the demand for free trade zone and local firm sales and purchases.  Second, contrary to what was expected, the project could not work around legal obstacles:  the Lautenberg Amendment, which prohibited the development of some of the project's highest demand products, e.g., loths; the 807 Assembly Law, which makes it economically advantageous for IFTZ firms in the free trade zone to import goods from the United States; and inadequate Dominican temporary admission laws. The following lessons were learned.  (1) The project's ability to establish successful linkages was due to selective targeting of firms that showed the most capability of using TA effectively; requiring firms to pay for project TA proved helpful in identifying such firms.  (2) The amount of TA required to prepare Dominican firms for international competition is 6-8 weeks, rather than the 3 weeks predicted by the project.  This is due to the need to upgrade their managerial and not merely their technical capabilities.  (3) A proactive and cohesive marketing strategy is essential to project success.  A basic flaw in the project design -- as evident in the project budget -- was to subordinate marketing expertise to communications.  The resignation of theommunications Director, together with the inability to find a suitable replacement, exacerbated this situation.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","4/1/1993 12:00:00 AM","","Industrial development|International trade|Export promotion|Free trade|Free zones|Business enterprises|Institutional linkages","Dominican Republic","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABG984.pdf","312 KB","008537 - USAID.

"Evaluates the impact of private sector development programs implemented by USAID/Sri Lanka since 1983; 11 major projects and programs are given full analysis, while briefer attention is paid to several related programs. The consensus is that USAID/SL has designed and implemented a sound and well-balanced private sector program, in consonance with the Government of Sri Lanka's (GSL's) dramatic 1977 policy shift toward a market economy and well-suited to the needs and maturation patterns of the country's business community.  The greatest impact may have been qualitative, i.e., in helping to create an atmosphere conducive to progress and increasing the general competitiveness and skills of Sri Lankan businesses. Most USAID/SL programs have been designed and carried out in-house, although there has been effective use of some central and regional A.I.D. programs.  The Mission has benefited from the experience and talents of its professional staff, and also from its association with an energetic reform-minded cadre of government and private sector leaders. Unlike many donors, USAID/SL is comfortable and effective working directly with private businesses and entrepreneurs. The Mission has succeeded at both the institutional/sectoral level and the firm level.  For example, the Private Sector Policy Support (PSPS) project contributed substantially to strengthening leading chambers of commerce and improving dialogue between business and government; it also helped launch the Security Exchange Commission, strengthened the Colombo Stock Exchange, and created Sri Lanka's first truly private venture capital company, as well as a merchant bank.  In addition, various Mission programs have supported GSL legal and regulatory reform. USAID/SL also underwrote the GSL's extremely successful public awareness campaign to rouse support for privatization, and when lack of transparency threatened popular support, the Mission was crucial in helping to reform the process. At the individual enterprise level, the Technology Initiative for the Private sector Project (TIPS), which collaborated with the highly successful IESC Volunteer Executive Program, clearly showed the business community the advantages of using improved technology to increase international competitiveness and also assisted individual firms with planning and modernization.  While TIPS focused on large companies in Colombo, at the other end of the spectrum the Mahaweli Enterprise Development Project helped establish hundreds of small and medium agribusinesses, creating over 7,000 jobs; prospects for sustainability are very good.  The PVO Co-financing program also supported numerous income-generating activities among disadvantaged groups, especially in rural areas. The increasing sophistication and effectiveness of USAID/SL's program has come about because the Mission builds on its lessons learned.  For example, the overly ambitious Private Enterprise Promotion Project led to the better organized and more effective PSPS.  It is for such reasons that the Mission is recognized as the leader among the donor community promoting private sector development in Sri Lanka. USAID/SL's experience teaches several lessons, among them:  (1) direct assistance to the private sector is most effective when demand-driven; (2) the hands-off policy of both the GSL and the Mission in regard to transaction oriented program operations has paid off handsomely; and (3) projects that were not deliberately targeted, were prematurely ambitious, or were unfocused organizationally and programmatically were less successful. The evaluation team recommends that more attention be paid to the following issues/concerns:  ensuring sustainability after USAID support ends; meeting the needs of small and medium businesses in provincial business centers; promoting further GSL disengagement from the economic arena; and addressing continuing constraints in the policy and legal environments.  Within these contexts, future programs should focus on five areas:  human resources development, capital generation, macroeconomic policy reform, legal and regulatory reform, and enterprise development.","Delivery order no. 3","Special Evaluation","Documents","PCE-0001-I-00-2050-00","","10/1/1993 12:00:00 AM","","Private sector|Economic reform|Economic policy|Private enterprises|Institution building|Beneficiary count","Sri Lanka","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABG999.pdf","6,887 KB","000356 - Checchi and Co.

"Final external evaluation of a project (8/90-3/93) to support efforts of the American Institute for Free Labor Development (AIFLD) to promote democratic labor unions in Latin America and the Caribbean. AIFLD is and will remain the principal U.S. instrument for strengthening Labor in Latin America and the Caribbean.  AIFLD's education and training programs, conducted both in-country and at the George Meany Center in the Washington area, have been highly successful. AIFLD has done a good job of refocusing its curricula on the new problems facing labor today, problems that arise both from the need for economic restructuring and from the advent and rapid spread of the global marketplace.  These education and training activities, which comprise the great bulk of AIFLD's A.I.D.-financed activities should continue and should be extended, as possible, to many democratically oriented groups that do not now profit from them. AIFLD's activities, however, can profit from some tightening up. Two ancillary programs -- agrarian union development and social projects -- are of relatively lower pay-off than its core education and training programs and should be phased out; the union-to-union program also needs reviewing.  Programming should be tightened by requiring clearer and more precise statements of objectives and indicators.  Outside professional guidance should be sought to improve the management of its training programs and to bring the field and Meany Center programs into closer concordance.  Also, AIFLD continues to lag in its efforts to convince Latin American and Caribbean labor leaders of the value of bringing more women into high-level positions in their federations and confederations.  (AIFLD should examine its own hiring and promotional practices in this regard.) A.I.D.'s management of the AIFLD program has been deficient. While the A.I.D./W personnel in charge of managing this program admit to having no real country-by-country knowledge, A.I.D. field personnel never see either the program submissions of the AIFLD Country Program Directors or the final program document as approved.  Monitoring responsibility is unclear.  Washington looks to the field to monitor AIFLD programs but the Missions deny they have that responsibility. (The program has been in existence for 30 years.)  Specific steps are recommended in this report to get A.I.D. management back on track. A.I.D. personnel in the field who would be in charge of carrying out the expanded labor program recommended in this study have little knowledge of labor as either a productive force in the economy or a societal force of potentially great value as an ally in programs to strengthen democracy and encourage economic growth.  A training program is recommended.

"Evaluates Phase II of the community-based distribution (CBD) family planning program, implemented by the Family Planning Association of Kenya (FPAK) and USAID/Nairobi.  The evaluation covers the period 1990-9/92. Phase II of the CBD project was launched in 1990 in 19 sites.  By 1992, FPAK had recruited 734 CBD agents and 51 field workers as supervisors in an effort to expand family planning services to reach over 170,000 new clients.  Within 2 years FPAK surpassed the latter target. CBD agents provide short-term family planning methods and refer clients to clinics for long term or clinical methods.  Their standard services include:  supply of contraceptives, referrals for examinations and clinical methods, and family planning counseling.  Upon selection for the program, CBD agents receive a comprehensive two-week training course.  Agents are assigned to locations covering anywhere from 300 to 800 households.  They meet each month as a group with their supervisor to discuss problems in the field, receive refresher training, and be re- supplied.  CBD agents collect and record a significant amount of information regarding the services they provide.  CBD agents seem to be involved in more than family planning services; they also participate in and/or lead activities such as health and nutrition education and civil registration. FPAK's most significant achievements in developing the CBD program can be summarized as follows:  the program's operational goals have been met; it is well established in the communities; structures and systems are in place and functioning appropriately. The implementation of CBD activities at the local level has benefited significantly from a well-managed supply system, and FPAK headquarters relies on a simple and well- designed management information system which produces service information on a regular basis. Additionally, in every site visited by the team, FPAK has been successful in engaging the support of the community.  Communities showed positive perceptions of the benefits of the CBD program, and the team found significant community involvement in the launching of the program and in the recruitment of agents.  Also, the program has strengthened area-level family planning programs by complementing clinic services. Moreover, the program has gained legitimacy within the local health system, both at MOH and NGO levels.  Perhaps of greatest importance is the fact that enough empirical evidence exists to indicate that the CBD program is expanding family planning availability and acceptance. The evaluation team found eight primary areas of concern that should be addressed in the planning for Phase III, and made recommendations in those areas.  These areas are (1) method mix expansion, (2) community willingness to share costs, (3) CBD agent's workload, (4) honoraria and other compensation for agents, (5) planning and coverage, (6) CBD management information system, (7) supervision and training, and (8) future expansion and phase out.","Task order no.

"Final evaluation of a project (12/88-9/93) to reduce Vitamin A deficiency among children in Haiti's Maissade area.  The project, implemented by Save the Children (SCF), achieved success through an innovative approach combining the elements of: a defined, registered population with identification of high-risk individuals; community-based distribution of Vitamin A capsules; promotion of home gardens with Vitamin A-rich plants; training of mothers in appropriate feeding practices stressing Vitamin A-rich foods; and creation of women's groups with a focus on income generation. The project carried out an informative baseline survey which documented significant findings on child health and nutrition; these findings were used in program planning.  Also, SCF developed a useful field method of assessing Vitamin A risk and monitoring Vitamin A consumption.  More importantly, intensive growth monitoring activities (94% of children under 5 have a growth monitoring card and 60% were weighed within the 3 months preceding the evaluation) suggest that the project has the means to identify malnourished children. Project achievements were based on a dual approach which emphasized increased access to Vitamin A as well as increased maternal knowledge. Compared with baseline data, the percentage of children aged 6 months to 6 years who had received a Vitamin A capsule within the last 4 months increased from 26% to 60%, and a significant number of home gardens containing Vitamin A-rich food were begun.  Some 56% of mothers had knowledge of at least one Vitamin A-rich food, and practically all children at risk of Vitamin A deficiency had received one Vitamin A capsule within the 6 months prior to project evaluation.  While few mothers in the general population could explain accurately why Vitamin A was important, members of special women's groups and mothers who participated in the ""roving nutrition centers"" generally understood the importance of Vitamin A. The project effectively used data for decisionmaking.  The Health Information System is population-based, all families being registered. This allows for identification of areas where coverage is low and of individual children who do not use services. Coverage data are routinely monitored and fed back to project staff (health agents and nutrition monitrices).  Efforts to extend this feedback process to community groups have been initiated. The project has developed a systematic approach to combating childhood malnutrition which involves comprehensive growth monitoring and the use of the roving nutrition centers to rehabilitate malnourished children and teach proper child feeding practices. While the centers were shown to benefit some two-thirds of the children attending them, resources were insufficient for extending them to the entire population. As a result, the nutritional status, project-wide, of children under 5 did not seem to improve during the project. The project successfully integrated the Vitamin A programs into other child survival activities and, while lacking an explicit sustainability objective, laid the groundwork for sustainability by increasing mothers' knowledge of Vitamin A-rich food.  Were SCF to cease all activities in the Maissade area, some of this maternal knowledge would remain, as would an increased understanding of inexpensive ways of incorporating Vitamin A-rich foods into the family diet.  The task of making Vitamin A capsules available to all children would fall back on Ministry of Health personnel.

"Evaluates the impact of two participant training projects in El Salvador:  the recently completed Central American Peace Scholarship (CAPS) project (1985-92), and the Caribbean and Latin American Scholarship Program II (CLASP-II), which began in 1990. For the most part, the projects have had a significant impact on the life of each participant.  Trainees have generally been very satisfied with most aspects of training.  All three training components (i.e., skill development, leadership training, and Experience America) have been implemented with apparent success by educational institutions contracted in the United States.  One of the projects' greatest strengths has been their provision of training to socially and economically disadvantaged Salvadorans. All the end-of-project status (EOPS) indicators have been satisfactorily met, with the exception of the indicator for returned trainees' awareness of U.S. culture.  This could be due to methodological biases in the evaluation; some forms of ongoing interest in the United States were not measured, e.g., interest displayed through activities such as listening to the radio or watching television. One of the most important accomplishments of USAID/ES has been its ability to learn from the past and continuously improve the design and implementation of the CAPS/CLASP-II projects. Improvements include the following.  (1) In all CAPS/CLASP training programs since 1991, intermediary institutions nominate candidates; trainees report that they feel the selection process is fair, objective, and efficient.  (2) Experience America has become an integral part of technical and academic training, complementing and reinforcing what trainees learn in the classroom.  (3) Leadership training encompasses formal lectures, visits to municipal governments, attendance at community meetings, and participatory, experiential learning.  In the latter, trainees are asked to select their own leaders, and to solve problems as a group.  (4) Predeparture orientations range from 3 weeks for short-term programs to 2 months for long-term programs.  Orientation includes lectures on American culture, the training course, and general characteristics and expectations of the program, as well as training in basic English.  (5) Since 1989, USAID/ES has made arrangements for program coordinators from U.S. training institutions to make fact-finding visits to El Salvador, so that they can design their training program in accordance with the levels of technology of El Salvador.  (6) CLASP-II has been built on the lessons learned from CAPS and represents a departure from CAPS in at least three important dimensions:  the leadership component is emphasized in CLASP-II design, though not at the expense of technical training; greater importance is placed on what trainees can give back to their communities; and follow-on is seen as a fundamental component.

"PACR of a project (4/85-1/92) to strengthen Ecuador's National Malaria Eradication and Vector Control Service (SNEM) and enable SNEM to control the current malaria epidemic. Results were mixed.  A total of 1.27 million houses were sprayed, vs. 2 million targeted; 265 entomological tests were performed, vs. 338 targeted; 2 million presumptive drug treatments were given, vs. 2.2 million targeted; and 864,000 mass medications were accomplished, vs. 2.4 million targeted.  By the end of the project, 67 laboratories were operational, vs. 70 targeted.  The Ministry of Health strengthened SNEM by establishing a technical committee. The contractor, United Schools of America, failed to meet performance expectations and was continuously behind in payments to its consultants. This led to the resignation of the first long-term advisor, delaying project implementation. In-country training was provided to rural physicians, auxiliary nurses, and laboratory technicians in malaria control, prevention, diagnosis, and treatment.  The Vector Biology Control Project provided training to sprayers.  Two observational visits were funded. The Centers for Disease Control and the Vector Biology Control Project delivered satisfactory short-term TA and laboratory supply.  The most important TA areas were information systems; assessment of the Aedes aegypti infestation; evaluation of vector control methods; a pilot study on integrating malaria control into general health services in Manabi province; analysis, evaluation, and training to improve spraying; logistics and supervision of field activities; administrative and logistics training; dengue control; and review of the Aedes/Dengue control program to improve program planning and to retrain national staff. Operations research related to computerization of information systems, stratified malaria control methodology, the sensitivity of P. falciparum to drugs, vector incrimination, and urban mosquito control. However, these research activities were delayed by continuous strikes by SNEM personnel. Any future initiative in malaria control in Ecuador must be preceded by an institutional analysis that examines SNEM, its role within the Ministry of Health, its strengths and weaknesses, and the presence (or absence) of political commitment to carry out fundamental institutional changes. The following lessons were learned.  (1) Technical advisors should receive clear directions as to their responsibilities and authority. Counterparts must be fully aware of advisors' scope of work (2) Project extensions (cost or no-cost) should be analyzed in depth when counterpart administration has proven weak.","Loan no. 518-U-062","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","7/1/1993 12:00:00 AM","","Malaria|Disease prevention and control","Ecuador","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABH057.pdf","216 KB","008537 - USAID.

"PACR of a Phase II project (6/88-6/93) to help the Government of Belize (GOB) increase livestock production and marketing. The project has helped to increase livestock processing and expand livestock markets.  Beef production is now sufficient to meet domestic needs, along with export of a few live cattle to Mexico.  Locally produced pork continues to increase its market share versus imports, but cannot yet meet demand.  The Belize Livestock Producers Association (BLPA) and the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries are promoting more pork production. The project improved local herds by importing breeding swine and cattle and via an artificial insemination program.  The latter was more successful with dairy producers, whom it will continue to support, than with beef producers; the program has been cut back to include only government-owned cattle.  The Government of Belize (GOB) continues to support the Screwworm Eradication Program, which has maintained the country's screwworm-free status since 8/92. The BLPA played an active role in the project, directing livestock programs in collaboration with GOB entities. Successful BLPA-GOB collaboration included coordination of private funding for a new slaughter facility; joint marketing trips to Guatemala and Mexico; and the establishment of quarantine and inspection stations at the Guatemalan and Mexican borders.  In addition, the BLPA sponsors the Fondo Ganedero Steer-fattening Credit Program, which has placed 534 locally procured feeder steers with 17 farmers. BLPA will also manage the new Central Livestock Market. Construction of the market cost more than anticipated, with additional costs ($58,000) borne by the GOB. Training exceeded expectations.  Long-term U.S. training (in animal nutrition, poultry science, and agriculture extension) was provided to 3 persons, and short-term U.S. training to 37. In-country seminars and workshops benefitted over 1,500 farmers. The pasture development program provided training and demonstrations of cost/benefit, weed control, and pasture management; and assisted farmers in the production of grass, legume seeds, and vegetative stock for sale to other farmers.  A honeybee rehabilitation program included country-wide workshops on the management of Africanized bees, and the creation of a queen-rearing center which disseminates improved stock to beekeepers. The following lessons were learned.  (1) Project design must be clear in determining outputs, assigning responsibilities, and establishing disbursement procedures that are timely yet ensure fiscal responsibility.  (2) Provisions should be made to supplement host-country staff shortages due to training and other project-related demands.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","8/1/1993 12:00:00 AM","","Livestock|Pork|Beef|Beef cattle|Dairy cattle|Agricultural training|Agricultural markets|Agricultural production","Belize|Mexico|Guatemala","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABH058.pdf","107 KB","008513 - USAID.

"PACR of Mauritania activities of two regional projects to implement emergency locust/grasshopper control measures and related disaster relief and institution-building efforts:  the Africa Emergency Locust/Grasshopper Assistance Project (AELGA, 6980517, implemented 3/88-6/90) and the Africa Emergency Locust project (6250517, implemented 6/87-6/88 and then combined with AELGA). In Mauritania, the projects focused on providing TA, short-term operational training, commodities, and institutional support for aerial and ground survey and control activities.  The primary planned output, to assist the Mauritanian National Crop Protection Service (CPS) in rapidly suppressing crop-destroying grasshoppers and locusts, was accomplished.  During 1988, over 900,000 ha were treated with powder and/or liquid pesticides, and the CPS reported in 3/89 that sorghum, corn, and vegetable crops were out of danger and maturing favorably. The projects also assisted CPS in planning for future grasshopper and locust outbreaks. The program's success was attributed to the combined efforts of many actors, including the Mauritanian military in treatment and survey activities, and Peace Corps volunteers in survey operations.  Using data from the survey activities, technicians were able to detect high-risk infestation areas and mobilize vehicles based in Adrar, Assaba, Brakna, Gorgol, Guidimakha, Hodh Charghi, Hodh Gharbi, Inchiri, Nouakchott, Tagrant, Tiris, Trarza, and Zemmour. Project documentation noted the correlation between drought and pest cycles in Africa.  Although the earlier drought had hurt Mauritania's economy, it had also kept grasshoppers and locusts in check, while the return of rains brought with them the threat of pest-induced famine. The onset of unfavorable breeding conditions was therefore also a factor in bringing the plague under control. Despite its success, the program experienced setbacks due to the ethnic-based civil strife in Mauritania; firing and forced expulsions of government employees of Senegalese descent disrupted the implementing institutions -- the Ministry of Rural Development, Department of Agriculture, and the CPS.  However, the vacancies were eventually filled. In the absence of project reviews or evaluations, lessons learned could not be ascertained.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","9/1/1993 12:00:00 AM","","Pest control|Crop pests|Locusts|Grasshoppers|Disaster recovery|Emergency relief","Mauritania","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABH065.pdf","204 KB","004517 - USAID.

"PACR of the Mauritanian component of a training project (8/83-9/91) to develop the human resource capabilities of Sahelian public institutions in key development sectors. The project offered educational opportunities to Mauritanian students and professionals working or intending to work in the public sector, with special emphasis on administrative capacities.  Training included long- and short-term U.S. training and third country training, and in-country seminars, workshops, and courses.  Due to budgetary limitations, third country training was preferred over U.S. training when possible. Academic training was offered in the following fields: agricultural crop and livestock research; agricultural economics and farm management; veterinary medicine and animal husbandry; cooperatives; agricultural education; civil and environmental engineering; forestry, fisheries, and natural resource planning; public health and paramedical care; maternal/child health; family planning and nutrition; rural development; social anthropology; communications; public and business administration; economics; educational technology; and nonformal education.

"PACR of the Mauritania component of a project (3/86-12/90) to support population and family planning (FP) programs in the Sahel. The project produced significant outcomes in the areas of demographic research and analysis, program planning, and FP service delivery.  In the area of demographic analysis, the project produced three technical reports analyzing data from a 1981 fertility survey and published research conducted by Mauritania's Center for Demographic and Social Studies (CEDS). It helped the CEDS to analyze demographic data collected by ministries and public and private agencies throughout Mauritania, and along with two experts from the Future Group, developed a RAPID computer model for Mauritania of the impact of population growth on development; the model was presented to statisticians and policymakers in a week-long seminar on population and development. Training included:  (1) short-term, third-country training of six nurses, nurse-midwives, and health administrators in clinical aspects of FP, program management, and education and communication; (2) attendance by two Ministry of Health officers at courses in Lome on communication and FP; (3) training at The Hague for two CEDS demographers; (4) attendance by the Ministry of Economy and Finance's Director of Statistics and by a CEDS demographer at a conference on the dissemination and use of census data; (5) U.S. training in FP administration for one person; and (6) observational tours by four government, educational, and religious leaders to FP programs in Morocco and Tunisia and by one official to the Sahel region and Mali. FP/health service delivery was improved through construction of the Family Health Referral Center in Nouakchott, including the provision of ob/gyn equipment and office supplies.  The work was completed despite ethnic unrest in April 1989.  The center has provided FP and sexually transmitted disease services, and trained nurses and midwives. Other achievements included an assessment of population policy and FP services and a study of laws related to population and the family. A mid-term evaluation in 1988 revealed that communication barriers between the CEDS and OAR/Nouakchott caused a 6-12 month delay in project implementation.  This was attributed to the fact that the Health Officer who had initiated the project was transferred, and not replaced for 4 months.  The evaluation's recommendation that a contractor be hired to monitor the project in the Officer's absence was not accepted, and instead an OAR/Nouakchott official filled in, and instituted a new management system.  In the absence of a final evaluation, it is impossible to measure the effects of the system, although project outputs seem to speak for themselves.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","9/1/1993 12:00:00 AM","","Population programs|Demographic research|Family planning services","Mauritania","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABH070.pdf","154 KB","004517 - USAID.

"PACR of Phase III of the Mauritania component of a project (7/86-6/93) to provide technical training aimed at strengthening the ability of public and private institutions in the Sahel to achieve development objectives. The project filled a crucial need created by the absence of Mauritanian post-secondary institutions providing training in relevant development fields.  According to available project documentation, 14 persons received long-term training at U.S. universities; 18 received long-term third-country training in Senegal, Italy, Mali, Morocco, and Tunisia; 21 received short-term training in Burkina Faso, Senegal, Italy, Morocco, Kenya, Tunisia, and the United States; and 38 received short-term in-country training through programs organized by the Centre de Recyclage et de Perfectionnement in Nouakchott and the University of Nouakchott. The project addressed shortcomings identified in Phases I and II by taking full advantage of third-country and in-country training opportunities and by increasing supervision of curricula and trainees' performance.  A short-term consultant assisted in preparing training plans, installing a computerized participant training management system, preparing materials for pre-departure training, developing an alumni association, conducting a survey of private sector training opportunities, and holding workshops for local training officers. Citing a lack of project reviews, the report does not identify any lessons learned.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","9/1/1993 12:00:00 AM","","Personnel development|Education for development|Technical training|Participants","Mauritania","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABH072.pdf","74 KB","004517 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (9/82-3/91) to improve and maintain rural roads that serve potentially high food production areas in Mauritania's Guidimaka and Gorgol regions. The project was revised in 1985 because assumptions made in the design document were found to be invalid.  The UN Sudano-Sahelian Office (UNSO), under which road construction activities in the regions had been initiated, had been working with inadequate equipment, inexperienced construction staff, and within unacceptable design standards.  Under the revision, A.I.D. rehabilitated 70 km of road from M'Bout to Selibaby (originally worked on by the UN project); undertook extensive training of construction brigade personnel; instituted work plans; and monitored project performance more strictly.  As a result, the program achieved positive results. The project built a total of 233 km of new road, built 164 drainage structures between the regional capitals of Kaedi and Selibaby, and rehabilitated the main road between Boghe and Kaedi.  The impact of the new road system on economic development in the Guidimaka and Gorgol regions has been significant; roads have facilitated access to markets and provided a means of moving social services and agricultural inputs into the high-potential food production areas.  Moreover, the project has become a model for road construction in other African nations. A 35-member maintenance brigade received training in secondary gravel roads maintenance and in the operation and maintenance of road construction equipment.  However, only 5 of a planned 24 people from the Department of Public Works were trained in construction planning and implementation, and in maintenance, although 4 others from a different government department received road maintenance training under another project.  The project purchased equipment and visual aids for a government training center for equipment operators and maintenance mechanics. Project managers faced numerous difficulties during implementation. Tax exoneration from the Mauritanian government was not secured until after the project began and this caused procurement delays and work cessation.  Unstable drainage structures required extensive repairs and additional funding. Technical expertise needs had been underestimated and the project had to add a direct hire engineer, a project development officer, and a project officer to the implementation team.  Finally, A.I.D.'s system for payment of monthly invoices received from the Mauritanian government was inefficient, requiring almost 45 days to process vouchers. The following lessons were learned.  (1) Invalid project design assumptions made it impossible for the project to fulfill the original output targets.  (2) Periodic meetings with the Mauritanian government and other donors in the transportation field greatly improved the project's outcome.  (3) The importation of project commodities and the necessary tax exoneration for the items should have been negotiated and agreed upon in writing with all related host government agencies before the grant was signed; a great deal of time and effort was lost by the Mission in trying to obtain tax exonerations after the fact. (4) Although the Mauritanian government has exhibited sincere concern for road maintenance, it has not yet developed an institutionalized system to provide for this.  A host government maintenance policy should have been included in the original agreement to guarantee a budget for long-term recurrent costs.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","7/1/1993 12:00:00 AM","","Access roads|Road construction|Road maintenance|Farm to market roads","Mauritania","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABH073.pdf","228 KB","004517 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (7/83-12/92) to improve basic health services in three rural regions in Mauritania -- Trarza, Guidimaka, and Assaba. The project suffered from an inordinately complex and overly ambitious design and was scaled back following a mid-term evaluation in 6/86; fewer studies were performed and the vast Expanded Program of Inmunization (EPI) extension component was curtailed due to transportation constraints.  Problems with personnel in key TA roles delayed implementation and necessitated the first of three PACD extensions.  Nonetheless, the project eventually met its reformulated objectives.  Basic health services (which were previously concentrated in urban areas) were significantly expanded in the target regions, hundreds of health care workers received training, some studies were performed, and primary health care (PHC) was accepted by the Ministry of Health and Social Affairs (MOHSA) as the preferred way to provide rural health care at all levels. One of the project's greatest achievements was to facilitate the EPI program.  Substantial EPI operations were begun in Trarza and Guidimaka, and operations were maintained in the Assaba region.  More than 200 villages in the three regions received services.  The project helped establish both mobile teams and fixed facilities, reaching 60% of the target population.  EPI and community health worker (CHW) teams cooperated in activities, providing supervision and referrals.  The EPI Documentation and Statistical Unit is now capable of producing annual report on EPI activities.  In all, 25 mobile team nurses were retrained, 30 EPI fixed centers re-equipped and made functional, 10 regional EPI and central EPI depots equipped and established, and 13 dispensaries re-equipped. Functional PHC systems were proved to be feasible and technically acceptable in Mauritania.  The project produced the following outputs: 600 village health workers trained or given refresher courses; central, regional, and departmental supervisors and trainers trained; 60 fixed center nurses re-trained; and over 300 new CHWs and traditional birth attendants (TBAs) trained.  PHC is now well-integrated in the MOHSA and is likely to be sustained. Ministry personnel benefitted from training in management, epidemiology, computers, health information, training, supervision, and service delivery.  In addition, supervision and village sensitization programs were made operational, and a National Commission for Primary Health Care was formed and was instrumental in integrating the various levels of the PHC network.  Cost-recovery initiatives have provided funding for the activities of CHWs.  Project-funded studies and data collection yielded information on topics such as morbidity rates, treatment, immunization, and pharmaceuticals. Lessons learned include the following.  (1) Project designs must be realistic in defining goals and the resources and time required to achieve them.  (2) The project suffered from the late arrival of key advisors.  Also, advisors to the EPI and health information system programs departed at the end of their contracts, but their expertise was still needed.  (3) The EPI program did not establish a reliable transportation system.  This hurt efficiency.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","7/1/1993 12:00:00 AM","","Community health care|Primary health care|Rural areas|Immunizations|Health professional education|Paramedical education","Mauritania","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABH074.pdf","183 KB","004517 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (8/84-12/93) to upgrade the technical and administrative capacities of public and private sector personnel in Mauritania, particularly so as to help meet the country's food security needs. The project achieved most of its planned outputs, providing training in four targeted areas:  agriculture and rural development; fisheries; food procurement, importing, and distribution; and human resource planning.  More than 40 persons attended U.S. universities, almost 200 were trained in Senegal, Tunisia, Mali, or Morocco, and over 400 professionals participated in in-country seminars.  Agriculture was a major emphasis, accounting for 20 of the U.S. slots, several third-country slots, refresher courses for extension agents, and seminars on planning, production techniques, and policy.  The seminars emphasized U.S. management techniques, and used a participatory approach.  One seminar spurred dialogue between the public and private sectors, which had previously been suspicious of one another regarding regulation and privatization, and another elicited requests for follow-up workshops. U.S., third-country, and on-the-job fisheries training helped Mauritania regain control of its most important foreign exchange source by developing qualified indigenous workers to replace the South Korean nationals who had constituted most ships' crews. U.S. training in artisanal fisheries management was also provided. The food procurement component included third-country B.S. and M.S. business management training for officials of parastatals and private enterprises, seminars for public and private officials, and in-country training for clerical workers.  This training aimed at improving the marketing and distribution of agricultural and fisheries products. Mauritania's capacity for human resource planning was improved through long-term training of government employees in planning, labor and employment analysis, and educational statistics; short-term computer and financial management training; and seminars for public officials. The project made a strong effort to reach the private sector in what is traditionally a donor-to-government type project:  28.5% of training funds were used for the private sector (vs. a targeted 20%).  Less positively, none of the long-term U.S. trainees and only 5 of the third-country participants were women. The project's relation with the Directorate of Plan was hindered by the fact that the Directorate was understaffed, and those employed were not qualified to expedite project matters.  No Directorate employee was designated as a counterpart.  Most damaging was the high turn-over of directors -- four during the project period. Long-term project impacts could be affected by the intercommunal disturbances of Spring 1989, which resulted in random expulsion of Mauritanian nationals of black African origin, including five former participants who occupied important positions in ministries and parastatal organizations. The following lessons were learned.  (1) Mauritanian officials often pressured the participant selection committee to choose family members or friends, a culturally acceptable practice in the country, and one that is difficult to expose.  Development of a strict selection process could minimize favoritism.  (2) The project was overly optimistic; the immensity of the human resources development problem in Mauritania (only 17% of the country's male working-age population was considered literate at project inception, and only 65% of these had completed primary school) required a long-term approach.  This lack of qualified participants caused the project to implement training on a more primary level than anticipated.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","8/1/1993 12:00:00 AM","","Participants|Food security|Personnel development|Education for development|Public sector|Private sector|Beneficiary count","Mauritania","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABH076.pdf","246 KB","004517 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (4/84-5/89) to provide emergency Section 416 food assistance to drought-affected populations in Mauritania. The project was implemented by CARE and Catholic Relief Services (CRS) in collaboration with Mauritania's Commission for Food Security (CSA). CARE coordinated the successful transport of a total of 99,000 MT of food commodities, supplied by various donors, during six national distributions between 2/85 and 2/87.  A.I.D. supported all but the first two distributions.  Most of the 24,170 MT of A.I.D.-provided commodities (12,870 MT wheat, 8,800 MT milk powder, and 2,500 MT butter oil) were distributed during the third distribution.  The remaining butter oil and milk powder stocks were provided during the fourth through sixth distributions as complementary commodities to the cereal rations provided by other donors.  CARE suspended operations in 4/87 and OAR/Nouakchott assumed responsibility for the remaining 5,000 MT of Section 416 milk powder and butter oil.  Due to improvements in agricultural conditions by 1987, significant stocks of emergency Section 416 products were not distributed as emergency feeding.  The government was advised to distribute them at the regional centers. CRS, which had been distributing Title II food in Mauritania since 1975, assisted the project by coordinating the storage and transport of 830 MT of Title II food commodities, with priority given to pregnant and lactating mothers and malnourished children in drought-stricken areas. CRS also experimented with Food-for-Work programs; two of these -- a road construction project in Soumass and a dam construction project in Guerou -- were successful, while a third -- a community garden project in Ajouer -- was not.  CRS also terminated its activities in 1987, citing poor collaboration with government agencies, insufficient funding, and its own inability to provide strict commodity control (due to low level of education and training of distribution center staff), to motivate interest in the nutrition centers, or to measure its impact on the country's malnutrition rate.  The rural nutrition centers were phased out, and the Nouakchott centers turned over to the Doulos Community, a U.S. PVO. The following lessons were learned.  (1) An efficient transportation method should be developed prior to food distribution efforts.  In this project, the CSA insisted that CARE, which had planned to use one large commercial carrier for all food contracts, make contracts available to all registered carriers, regardless of their reputation.  This arrangement resulted in transport delays and CARE was inundated with paperwork because separate contracts had to be drawn up for each transport.  (2) A banking mechanism should be clearly defined during the project design phase; funds channeled through the CSA were not handled expeditiously causing cash flow and accountability problems.  The financial process was streamlined following an audit.  (3) Contractor reporting and recordkeeping methods should be monitored closely from the beginning; CRS did not supply timely activity reports, commodity losses were not properly reported, and spoiled food was disposed of without OAR/Nouakchott consent.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","9/1/1993 12:00:00 AM","","Food for Peace Title II|Emergency food distribution","Mauritania","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABH077.pdf","246 KB","004517 - USAID.

Through ground and aerial spraying, short-term training, and an egg pod survey, the project helped contain locust/grasshopper infestation in Mauritania.  The grasshopper egg pod survey, conducted in conjunction with Mauritania's Crop Protection Service in the country's southern and southeastern regions, determined the geographic distribution of egg pod areas and determined species with active diapause or continuous reproduction.  With the survey results, the Service was able to optimize its efforts. The project also supported a public awareness initiative which used radio, newspapers, and television to address public health concerns and to recommend practices for safe insecticide use.  The project entomologist served as a representative at a grasshopper/locust workshop in Washington DC in 1988. While, overall, regional and national efforts to control infestation were successful, initiatives in the northern region were sometimes hindered due to that area's vastness, the presence of mines left from past military operations, and the potential for cross-border attacks from Senegal.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","9/1/1993 12:00:00 AM","","Pest control|Crop pests|Grasshoppers|Locusts","Mauritania","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABH078.pdf","366 KB","008576 - USAID.

"PACR on P.L. 480 Title II aid to Mauritania and on a project (5/88-6/93) to establish a Trust Fund in Mauritania as a mechanism for channeling P.L. 480 local currency generations into famine relief efforts, including Food for Work activities. Like the predecessor Title II program, this Title II program and Trust Fund project stressed price reforms of cereal imports as a means of encouraging local production, but also focused on strengthening the GIRM's Food Security Commission (CSA). Political events in 1988-89, including the forced expulsion of Mauritanian residents from Senegal and of Senegalese from Mauritania, undermined some policy reforms.  A 1989 evaluation found that, despite the GIRM's good faith efforts, agricultural liberalization had proceeded at a slow pace.  However, the CSA, as planned, had been significantly strengthened and had reduced free food distribution and instead promoted Food for Work. Significant policy progress was in fact made in 1989 when the GIRM created a Cereals Policy Monitoring Commission and established a price monitoring system which used a project-funded radio network to link distribution branches with the Mauritania Cereals Office (OMC) headquarters in Nouakchott.  The network improved accountability and gave the OMC the ability to gather data, analyze market developments, and react quickly to regional needs.  Moreover, the program facilitated the GIRM's efforts to allow local grain prices to rise to those of imported grains, promoted private sector participation in cereals marketing, and improved GIRM-donor collaboration.  Domestic grain production grew from 20,000 MT in 1984 to 139,000 in 1989, but it is difficult to assess if and how the program affected this growth. In addition, selected OMC agents and warehouse personnel received 1 month of training in grain marketing and storage and market surveillance. Constraints were experienced, as well.  Early in the program, commodities arrived in bulk and had to be bagged by hand, a Mission oversight it took nearly 4 months to rectify.  The scheme to provide American red sorghum at a price well below other cereals to make it appealing to poorer consumers failed due to the limited market for red sorghum; sales of the grain amounted to only 4,000 MTs a year, and the bulk of this was fed to livestock; unsold sorghum stock was used in the free distribution program. In 10/90, P.L. 480 Section 202 emergency stock provided 20,000 MTs of wheat to meet an one-time emergency need; of these, 12,000 MTs were distributed free of charge, while 8,000 MT were sold and funds used to pay program costs. The private sector was gradually allowed to assume most of the CSA's responsibility for distributing food commodities.  The GIRM also sold four rice mills to the private sector, agreed to develop a marketing policy and food sector management information system, and issued a policy statement which provided production incentives to farmers and encouraged participation by the private sector at both the production and processing stages. The following lessons were learned.  (1) Food security and self-reliance are long-term goals requiring concerted donor efforts to increase agricultural production and marketing efficiency; there is no single, immediate solution.  (2) It was difficult for the GIRM to enforce policy reforms when two-thirds of the commodities brought into the country were sold at below market prices.  (3) Obtaining price parity was incompatible with protecting domestic production; in the long run, import parity led to price increases.  (4) OAR/Nouakchott spent considerable time accounting for sales and micro-managing the CSA's financial systems.  The Mission was also forced to use call forward to force the CSA to account for all funds and bring about reforms, although the situation improved somewhat after the 1986 audit. (5) The program was overly ambitious in light of Mauritania's many constraints and could have had greater success with fewer goals focused within a fewer number of sectors.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","9/1/1993 12:00:00 AM","","Food for Peace Title II|Cereal products|Local currency|Food policy|Agricultural policy|Policy reform","Mauritania","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABH080.pdf","291 KB","008576 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (8/84-6/91) to strengthen the National Agricultural Research Center (CNRADA) in Kaedi, Mauritania, as part of a regional effort to upgrade agricultural research in the Senegal River Valley. The project was implemented by the Ministry of Rural Development. The project made considerable progress in strengthening Mauritania's agricultural research capacity at a critical time. Recent droughts had hindered crop and livestock production and the country had an immediate need to increase production in a sustainable way without reliance on large government subsidies. Specific activities included the following.  (1) A 5-year National Research Plan, based on a farming systems research approach, was created; the plan lays a strong foundation for future progress.  (2) Numerous reconnaissance and thematic studies and surveys provided useful data on farming systems in the region; 14 farming systems surveys were completed, 2 promising sorghum varieties were identified, a germplasm collection was established, sesame was tested as a cash crop, and 13 additional studies yielded data on ecology, technology, food consumption, nutrition, and women.  CNRADA staff conducted the research, with guidance from the TA team.  However, on-station and on-farm tests of rainfed and recessional grain crops did not produce the desired results, due probably to poor planning and inadequate funding.  Most of the tests were never completed. (3) Seven of CNRADA's top researchers received B.S. or M.S. training at the University of Arizona, and short-term training (in-country and third-country) was provided to other researchers and research assistants.  Other training included active participation of CNRADA personnel and researchers in international conferences; word processing training for secretaries; and on-the-job training in surveying, measuring, reporting, observing, and experimental designs.  (4) The project strengthened CNRADA's linkages with other Mauritanian research facilities and with international research agencies; all three levels have collaborated in surveys of farming systems, sponsored joint visits, and shared research and technologies.  These strengthened linkages have increased international recognition of CNRADA.  (5) The project financed the construction of four new research buildings by a private Mauritanian firm.  Unfortunately, the work was completed 2 years behind schedule and did not attain the anticipated quality. The project also experienced several difficulties.  (1) The assumption that expertise was in abundant supply in Mauritania proved false, a situation compounded by the late provision of counterparts by the Government of Mauritania (which did not provide full support to the project).  (2) TA skills were not utilized to the fullest advantage. According to the project design, TA was slated to play an advisory and training role. However, when it became clear that the absence of CNRADA researchers receiving U.S. training (which lasted for most of the project) would affect project research quality, the TA role should have been revised to emphasize implementation.  (3) According to the final evaluation, the problems with the on-farm and on-station tests stemmed from an attempt to conduct too many tests in too large a geographic realm without the necessary expertise.  In one instance, a 1988 sorghum trial in Djadjibini, farmers were required to serve as unpaid labor. (4) Nor was the project's budget sufficient to support an acceptable adaptive research program.  The GOM's budget allocation was spent on salaries and operational expenses, leaving few resources for the research programs.  (5) The project did not allow sufficient time to build CNRADA into a strong research institution.  A.I.D.'s decision in 1/90 to phase down OAR/Mauritania operations precluded the long-term effort that had been envisioned.  (6) CNRADA's centralized administrative structure impeded implementation.  The CNRADA Director retained control over all operations and decisions, including funding approvals; delegation was non-existent and coordination minimal.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","7/1/1993 12:00:00 AM","","Institution building|Research organizations|Agricultural research|Beneficiary count","Mauritania","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABH081.pdf","240 KB","008576 - USAID.

"Evaluates pilot project to improve Guatemala's capacity to provide ivermectin delivery in Suchitepequez Department.  The project is being implemented by the International Eye Foundation (IEF).  Mid-term evaluation covers the period 10/91-5/93. The project has become a model for the National Plan for the Elimination of Onchocerciasis in Guatemala.  Perhaps the project's greatest strength has been the capacity of its numerous players to work cooperatively to achieve project goals. A program for operational research, drug delivery, personnel training, health education/motivation, and monitoring and evaluation has been established within Guatemala's health care structure; these activities will eventually be assumed by the MOH.  More specifically, project has:  developed a methodology for rapid epidemiological assessment; established a functioning health management information system at project headquarters in the Universidad del Valle and in the MOH; developed a treatment coverage system in endemic areas (30,833 persons, or 84.1% of those eligible have been treated); created a system for the treatment of adverse reactions to ivermectin (2,228 persons were treated during the first distribution round); and developed a monitoring system which, with further refinement, will be capable of tracking key indicators of program performance and financial management. The project has suffered from the following weaknesses.  Training materials and the content of training sessions have been inadequate, particularly for MOH health promoters and community-based distributors. Recurrent costs continue to be relatively high.  Official counts have placed considerably more residents in the project area than project staff have been able to locate; nearly 56,000 of 91,000 official residents failed to be located in the distribution area.  The figure, if accurate, may consist largely of migrants from the highlands who descend for the coffee harvest in the fall.  Community-based distributors are only now beginning to function in their communities, although none has yet begun to distribute ivermectin alone; training to ensure sustainability will be a key concern.  Overall, health education has been neglected, due to limited funding and time, lack of experience with health education, and lack of communication with personnel from other ivermectin delivery programs, including the IEF Yepocapa project.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","DPE-5948-C-00-9030-00","","10/1/1993 12:00:00 AM","","Onchocerciasis|Pharmaceuticals|Eye care|Pilot projects","Guatemala","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABH084.pdf","1,434 KB","000627 - International Eye Foundation (IEF)|005969 - Medical Service Corp.

"Evaluates project to promote child survival activities in the Mkhota and Mbalachanda areas of Malawi.  Final evaluation, prepared by the grantee, Save the Children Federation (SCF), covers the period 8/89-8/93. Utilizing an impressive network of volunteer village health promoters (VHPs), village health committees, and village health supervisors, the project has increased knowledge and practice of its child survival interventions:  control of diarrheal diseases, immunizations, growth monitoring and nutrition education, treatment of malaria and acute respiratory infections, antenatal care, child spacing, and HIV/AIDS prevention.  (There are still shortcomings in immunization coverage, nutritional status of children, and malaria treatment, however.) A total of 141 drug revolving funds (DRFs) were established in Mbalachanda, and 136 of these are still operating; the communities have assumed ownership of the DRFs, and do not see them as only the VHPs' responsibility.  Mkhota communities have also expressed a desire to have DRFs.  Unfortunately, the supply of drugs in villages has not been continuous:  45% of VHPs interviewed did not have oral rehydration salts, and even in Mbalachanda (where DRFs are operational) only 66% had chloroquine, 47% aspirin, and fewer than 30% had bactrim, panadol, fansidar, or eye ointment.  The shortages may be due to the fact that resupply requires collecting a large amount of money for bulk purchasing from Central Medical Stores.  The small buffer stock available in the Mbalachanda project office is not sufficient to ensure continuous drug supplies. SCF has developed supportive relationships with the project communities, a fact which is reflected in the very low attrition rates for VHPs, many of whom have been working for almost 7 years.  SCF provided soap as an incentive to the VHPs, which the village health committees state they will not be able to continue (although many of the committees will offer other incentives, such as income-generating activities).  However, most VHPs are willing to work, even without the soap incentive.  Less positively, some VHPs have had difficulties maintaining community health reporting forms. Sustainability was not given enough attention at the beginning of the project.  Prospects are strong at the village level, but seem less certain at the supervisory, health center, and area levels. The MOH was not adequately involved in the design, planning, and the assigning of responsibility for activities; MOH staff feel that information sharing has not been sufficient. The following lessons were learned.  (1) Women have been effective community health supervisors and health surveillance assistants.  (2) Establishing village-level responsibility for incentives from the beginning of the project is wise since donor-provided incentives, such as soap, may be difficult for villages to sustain.  (3) Training of health personnel requires more than single sessions; other methods include refresher training, informal training during monthly meetings, use of skill assessments, and regular supervision.  (4) Community-based health projects require intensive sustained levels of effort and work with villages, more than the 3 years allotted for this project.  (5) More care should be taken in choosing sites for projects; Mkhota falls under two different Districts and is bisected by a river which making transportation difficult and expensive.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","OTR-0500-A-00-9149-00","","10/1/1993 12:00:00 AM","","Child survival activities|Community health care","Malawi","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABH089.pdf","4,838 KB","001407 - Save the Children (U.S.)","","006982 - USAID.

"The project, after 3 years of operation and 2 of field work, has almost achieved its life-of-project goals in term of coverage and number of beneficiaries; the Foundation for International Community Assistance's (FINCA's) concepts on village banking have found fertile ground in El Salvador.  Two components, financial and non-financial services, are in place and fully functional. The third component, institutional development, has not developed at the same pace as the other two. The financial services component has been implemented under two modalities, with different structures, staff, promotional approaches, and loan terms and conditions for borrowers.  The first is the village banking model, with a divisional manager at the central office, and 4 operational managers running fully decentralized regional offices; each regional office is well staffed with promoters, mostly women, who are organized in groups of 6-12 under the direction of supervisors who report to the regional manager.  The village banking program is providing credit to 27,000 borrowers (95% women) through 540 banks.  The average loan size is $70 and default and delinquency rates are very low. The second modality is individual credits to microentrepreneurs requiring either a solidarity group or co-signer.  The scheme of successive loans also applies, but initial loans are larger (ranging from $125 to $250).  In addition, repayments, including principal, interest, and savings, are made to the project on a monthly basis.  This program has an independent structure under a separate divisional manager.  It operates with credit officers in the field, who are managed by regional supervisors from the other division. The non-financial services component is the project's training arm. Its 6-person training staff includes a department head (who resigned during the evaluation period), a newly appointed assistant experienced in microenterprise credit training programs, and 4 regional trainers deployed to the field.  The rapid expansion of the Village Bank's division during the second year of field operation is largely due to the project's training approach. The institutional development of CAM (Centro de Apoyo a la Microempresa) lags behind the field operations, despite the emphasis given to this component by FINCA during the last 6 months.  The project's central office has grown to direct, support, and supervise the field operations, and to comply with the extensive needs of financial and statistical information that this type of project demands, rather than in accordance with a rational institutional development plan. FINCA did not take a prudent approach to building up CAM. Lessons learned included the following.  (1) Critical factors to the success of such projects are:  clarity and consistency in project design, so that implementation plans can be adapted according to field reality without losing focus on concepts and goals; proven expertise of the advisory group in all necessary aspects of the project; defined and reachable funding sources; market understanding and the flexibility to redesign services according to demand; intensive and extensive training in the field and office.  Large projects impact the target population more effectively.  (2) Technologies and approaches which contribute to a large project's success include:  well-defined and well-articulated lending approaches; strict market analysis and permanent follow up; and systematizing of implementation and expansion processes.  Expansion periods tend to restrain operational efficiency in these projects.  (3) Project sustainability can be affected/enhanced by:  promotion of efficient lending as a means to social development; institutional orientation emphasis of financial intermediation rather than social promotion; implementation driven by market demand and location instead of geographic coverage; and external support delivered via TA rather than direct intervention.  (4) In analyzing the microenterprise development project's replicability, it should be kept in mind that the design of village bank methodology for permanent operation is not complete, nor is the role of individual lending to microentrepreneurs. The Salvadoran environment and typical beneficiary have particular characteristics that are relevant to FINCA success which are not necessarily similar in other countries.  (5) Future A.I.D. activities in village banking should give paramount attention to CAM as the major village bank operation, and to sustainability. Other institutions with integrated services can include village banking as part of their packages to motivate efficiency and competitiveness.  CAM/FINCA's methodology cannot be imposed on other institutions, although recovery of full capital and opportunity costs shall be enforced.

"Findings from evaluations of A.I.D. child survival (CS) programs in six countries -- Bolivia, Egypt, Haiti, Indonesia, Malawi, and Morocco -- are synthesized.  According to the report, institution building may be the unsung success of the program:  in three of the six countries examined, A.I.D. has been instrumental in developing innovative institutional arrangements for providing low-cost services. Sustainability is a problem, however, in mature programs, such as Egypt and Morocco, where A.I.D. is having problems phasing out support.  Other key conclusions are as follows.  (1) A.I.D.'s CS program has been cost-effective and has played a notable, though not easily quantifiable, part in lowering child mortality and morbidity.  (2) A.I.D. has cooperated with other donors in expanding immunization coverage and has taken the lead in reducing high-risk births.  A.I.D. has tried to take the lead in oral rehydration therapy as well, but efforts have been disappointing due to underestimation of support requirements. Breastfeeding and vitamin A supplementation appear to have been cost-effective interventions, but impacts in the areas of nutrition, water and sanitation, and acute respiratory infection are unclear.  (3) The program is managed by an eclectic group of direct hires, contractors, university fellows, and professionals from other U.S. agencies; staffing needs to be rationalized.  A.I.D.'s complex administrative requirements have led to long delays, wasted resources, and strained relationships. On the other hand, A.I.D. was wise to concentrate CS resources on selected emphasis countries and has successfully involved the commercial private sector and PVOs.  Policy dialogue has been moderately successful, though not in persuading host governments to increase their CS budgets.  Donor coordination in CS has been better than in many other social sectors.  All in all, the report concludes that the program is successful and should be continued. However, both operational problems and strategic issues are identified and it is recommended that A.I.D.'s CS strategy be updated, based on lessons learned during the past 8 years.  Other general and specific recommendations are made.","Evaluation highlights: PN-ABG-017|Summary: PN-ABG-038","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","10/1/1993 12:00:00 AM","","Child survival activities|Child health care|Project sustainability","Bolivia|Egypt|Haiti|Indonesia|Malawi|Morocco","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAX272.pdf","110 KB","008058 - USAID.

"USAID's program to help Panama recover from years of economic mismanagement prior to 1989 and from the effects of the U.S. military action that year is evaluated.  Findings concerning the program's three components are as follows.  (1) The private sector reactivation program was initially conceived as a $108 million ""safety net"" for lending by Panama's banks, which were in a very poor position due to capital flight.  However, when depositor confidence and deposits returned much more quickly than expected, the funds were reprogrammed to support a new program, FREN (Fund for National Economic Recovery), to boost the availability of funds for lending to the private sector.  FREN has had significant positive effects on GDP and employment, although the overall unemployment rate declined only slightly. Reflows from FREN are expected to be considerable -- $100 million over the next 4 years -- and USAID will likely treat these reflows as additional assistance, attaching policy conditionality to their disbursement.  (2) The public sector investment program provided $113.9 million for priority investments in agriculture, health, education, justice, other social sectors, natural resources, and infrastructure; $20 million of this was channeled through an emergency fund to support small, labor-intensive social development programs.  While the initial disbursement was conditioned on Panama's planning specific structural adjustment actions, the second and third disbursements were linked to Panama's negotiations with international financial institutions (IFIs) -- the World Bank and the InterAmerican Development Bank -- USAID essentially adopting IFI conditionalities, which coincided substantially with USAID objectives.  (3) The U.S. provided $130 million to help Panama settle arrears incurred with the IFIs during the crisis years; conditionality was again appropriately linked to that of the IFIs.  Overall, however, the Panama program demonstrates the drawbacks of hurriedly designing a rigid program before circumstances are fully understood.  While these rigidities were built in at high policy levels in the U.S. Government, the responsibility rests with USAID to use its influence at the design phase to guard against excessive rigidity.  Lessons about program strategies are detailed.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","525-9999-C-00-2278-00","","9/1/1993 12:00:00 AM","","Nonproject assistance|Cash transfers|Economic assistance|Economic recovery|Private sector|Public sector|Financial institutions","Panama","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAX271.pdf","1,555 KB","000833 - Robert R.

"The last in a series of evaluations aimed at gleaning general conclusions and lessons learned from A.I.D.'s worldwide child survival program, this report evaluates efforts in Malawi, which have focused on building local institutional capacity. The study assesses the Malawi program in five areas:  (1) the effectiveness of interventions in water supply and sanitation, health education, child spacing, maternal and child health services, immunization, and malaria, HIV/AIDS, and diarrheal disease control; (2) economic efficiency; (3) financial and institutional sustainability; (4) long-term impacts; and (5) the program's relevance to specific conditions in Malawi. The following general conclusions emerged.  (1) Female illiteracy is a critical obstacle to child survival.  (2) The shortage of trained health personnel severely limits the quality and quantity of child survival services.  (3) Child survival services have benefitted from being integrated within the broader national health portfolio.  (4) The presence of many donors creates a management burden for the Malawi Government.  At the same time, donor support for child survival is unpredictable.  (5) In Malawi, malaria is the major barrier to further declines in infant and child mortality.  HIV/AIDS is another major threat; with nearly 10% of the population infected by the virus, infant mortality could increase by as much as 50% over the next 10 years. (6) Interest in controlling diarrheal diseases has declined among both donors and the Ministry of Health.  (7) Child survival investments are economically justified.  (8) Sustainability is the most important objective of A.I.D.'s child survival programs, but the most difficult to attain.  (9) Institution building and integrated health programs can be effective approaches to assisting national child survival programs. (10) Poor measurement of results weakens child survival programs. Appendices provide more detailed analyses of program sustainability and effectiveness, along with child mortality and morbidity data.","Summary highlights: PN-ABG-008","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","11/1/1993 12:00:00 AM","","Child survival activities|Institution building|Child health care|Health care administration|Project sustainability","Malawi","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAX270.pdf","4,702 KB","008058 - USAID.

"PACR of a multidonor project, implemented in coordination with UNICEF and the Peace Corps, to improve water supply and sanitation in the Zou department in northern Benin.  The report covers the period 8/80-9/92, including a 4-year suspension from 12/81-12/85. The project was a success.  Reliable potable water sources were provided to 309 villages, vs. a target of 275, and villagers are maintaining their pumps from funds collected for this purpose, aided by the fact that initial maintenance costs for the India Mark II pump are low.  Quantitative targets for latrine construction were achieved, and additional demand exists, though cost is a limiting factor to installation of family latrines. The project positively affected health/hygiene practices.  All participating villages received training in social mobilization, pump maintenance, and health education, as well as educational materials on village hygiene, excreta disposal, latrine construction, and Guinea worm prevention.  These aids have been used by village committees in both house to house demonstrations and public presentations. Although not originally designed to eradicate Guinea worm disease, following a 1986 World Health Assembly resolution on Guinea worm the project took the lead in helping the Government of Benin (GRB) hold a National Guinea Worm Eradication Conference and develop a national eradication plan.  Guinea worm incidence in the six project districts declined approximately 80% (from 286.5 to 55.8/100,000) between 1988 and 1991, against a target of only 30%.  This dramatic reduction is a good indicator that the target communities have adopted improved health practices and have abandoned traditional water sources for drinking. Evidence of improved hygiene practices is less strong, although evaluation reports do indicate a seemingly improved sanitary environment. The project attained a key objective when its participatory community development approach was adopted by the GRB as a model. The Ministry of Energy, Mines and Hydraulics has incorporated many project experiences into its planned reorganization of the Hydraulics Division, including heavy reliance on local NGOs to carry out community organization and health education campaigns; the strategy includes some, but not all, of the project's health education themes.  Also, the two ongoing well drilling programs in the Zou department -- one in collaboration with UNICEF and the second with the Japanese government -- are using materials and methodologies developed under the project for the formation and training of village pump committees, although they do not include health education. The project teaches several lessons about multidonor projects. (1) Such projects require coordinated fielding of implementation teams; where USAID is the prime funding agency, its project design cycle should govern the timing of team deployment.  Peace Corps volunteers should not be fielded until their jobs, logistics, and counterparts are defined. (2) The roles of participating agencies should be carefully planned and documented to avoid management conflicts.  (3) Where UNICEF participates in a project predominantly funded by USAID, the coordinating responsibility must be shared equally, and all participating agencies should receive due credit for their contributions.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1993 12:00:00 AM","","Rural areas|Water supply|Potable water|Project sustainability|Health education|Community participation|Local groups|Outdoor toilet facilities|Disease prevention and control|Water related diseases|Donor coordination|Health committees","Benin","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABH170.pdf","188 KB","008514 - USAID.

"Evaluation of the Peace Fellowship Program to provide U.S. graduate training to public and private sector personnel in Egypt.  Evaluation covers the period from 9/88-9/93. Nine hundred and twenty-nine Fellows have completed training and 172 are still participating in U.S. training versus a goal of 1,250 Fellows. The latter target will certainly be met and could be exceeded by the PACD, 10/95.  The Peace Fellows have completed degrees, thesis research, and published many academic papers in collaboration with U.S. counterparts and they have gained a wide exposure to the U.S. educational system and culture, one of the original motivations for the program following the Camp David Accords. Throughout the program various targets have been established and amended for specific groupings of Peace Fellows.  The latest amendment (1992) aims to draw 24% of total fellows from the private sector, 23% from the public sector, and for 18% of Fellows to be women.  In this aspect, the project's management performance has been good. The overall management of this project by the host government is one of the best illustrations of how an assistance project should work.  The Egyptian government, in the task of providing graduate studies for Egyptians, has had long experience through its own programs funded by the Egyptian Ministry of Higher Education (MOHE); the MOHE has managed the Peace Fellowship Program with confidence.  If USAID/Cairo continues support for Egyptian participants in graduate level studies in the U.S., the MOHE would be the most appropriate counterpart agency to manage a new project of that type.  A.I.D. has implemented the program in a professional manner.  The USAID project officer has established effective working relations with the MOHE at all levels. The one serious weakness in the program's administration has been a lack of structured participant follow-up activities after the Peace Fellows complete their training and return to Egypt.  A Comprehensive Orientation, Follow-up and Evaluation (OFE) Program has been proposed, and A.I.D. is urged to adopt it in the near future. Recommendations are as follows.  For the near term, some adjustments should be made in the procedures of the MOHE, USAID, and the Egyptian Cultural and Educational Bureau, Washington, D.C. (ECEB).  For the longer term, USAID, in collaboration with the MOHE, should design and implement a new program that would maintain the momentum of the current program and provide academic degree training in business, including general management, operations management, accounting, finance, management information systems, marketing, international business and trade, economics, environmental studies, tourism, education, nursing, and city planning.

"Ex post facto impact evaluation of the Water and Sanitation Sector project (1985-91) in Sri Lanka, implemented by the National Water Supply and Drainage Board (NWSDB).  The evaluation, which focused on sustainability, was conducted in 8/93. The major gains in institutional strengthening made over the life of the project have been maintained.  Performance improvement was most striking in the area of financial viability and commercial performance. Since the end of the project, billings have increased by 98%, and collections by 125%.  In 1992, the Board met its goal of covering operations and maintenance costs and two-thirds of debt service, and generated a surplus of 189 million rupees. In addition to financial viability and commercial improvement, performance had significantly improved in three other areas: relations with external entities; use of modern management tools of analysis; and implementation of preventive maintenance of facilities.  Performance had improved to some extent in the following areas:  budgeting; decentralization and regional level capacity building; and use of training and human resources development.  In four areas, performance in 1993 was much the same as at the end of the project:  strategic problemsolving and forward planning; operating and maintaining systems, and producing a high-quality product; consumer relations and responsiveness to consumers; and delegation of authority to the regional level and below. In general, NWSDB demonstrated patterns of organizational behavior and managerial action that (mostly) supported its improved institutional effectiveness.  Four patterns of behavior supported sustainability:  (1) setting targets collaboratively, monitoring performance against those targets, involving people in developing strategies and plans to deal with problems identified in the monitoring process, implementing those plans using a variety of approaches and then continuing to monitor progress; (2) staff at working levels taking the initiative when a problem exists and not waiting for directions from the top; (3) providing continued training, coaching, and consultation in support of clear programmatic objectives; and (4) creating an organizational environment in which ""it's not okay not to care.""  Two patterns of behavior inhibited sustained institutional improvement:  (1) paying attention to short-term operational issues at the expense of long-term planning and policy development; and (2) micro-managing at all levels.

"Mid-term evaluation of a project to support the development of small and microenterprises (SMEs) in Jamaica.  Evaluation covers the period 1991-9/93. The project has catalyzed the development of a microcredit industry in Jamaica by strengthening the lending capacities of two NGOs -- the Agency for the Selection and Support of Individuals Starting Trade (ASSIST) and Enterprise Development Trust (EDT) -- and by changing professional and public attitudes within Jamaica's financial sector.  It has been particularly successful in targeting women and has helped develop a database which will be useful in formulating macro policies for Jamaica's SME sector. Project TA has expanded the lending program of both ASSIST, which has approved 473 loans to SMEs, and EDT, which has approved 557 loans.  Both NGOs have targeted poorer, smaller enterprises; mandatory training and relatively low loan ceilings have deterred less disadvantaged borrowers. The average asset size of loan recipients has been US$1300.  The project has also strengthened other microcredit agencies, including the Credit Organization for Pre-Micro Enterprises (COPE), Trafalgar Development Bank (TDB), and the Microenterprise Investment Development Agency (MIDA).  A study tour to ADEMI and FondoMicro in the Dominican Republic was a great success in this regard and catalyzed a shift to market interest rates. The fact that EDT and ASSIST are meeting only 65% and 45% of their costs, respectively, is only slightly discouraging; the project's financial targets were overly optimistic.  EDT is, however, is facing growing administrative problems, including decline in the quality of its management, high turnover, shortage of personnel, and low morale; it has also been hindered by social unrest in its area of operation, Kingston. ASSIST, a larger organization with nationwide clientele, is well positioned for further growth, and with TA should be a viable institution within 3-5 years.  A demonstration effect has already begun to attract other entrants into the microcredit industry.  Also, EDT, ASSIST, and other financial agencies are discussing collaboration with Kingston Restoration Company, a private urban renewal organization. In the multi-donor policy and research component, the University of West Indies and the Statistical Institute of Jamaica are working with Michigan State University on a program of surveys and studies of Jamaica's microenterprise sector.  Results will be used to improve SME regulations and policies. The project included a gender-sensitive design.  A large number of EDT loan officers are women, and 68% of EDT loans and 47% of ASSIST loans have been to women. The component to pilot-test noncredit assistance to SMEs has not been implemented. The project has apparently had a positive impact on the poor. ASSIST and EDT estimate that 2,000 new jobs have been created. To target the poor even more directly, USAID is adding a poverty lending component that will provide loans of no more than US$300.","Project title: Growth and equity through microenterprise investment|(GEMINI)","Special Evaluation","Documents","DHR-5448-Q-63-9081-00|DHR-5448-Q-00-9081-00","","9/1/1993 12:00:00 AM","","Indigenous private voluntary organizations|Microenterprises|Small scale enterprises|Financial institutions|Commercial credit|Institution building","Jamaica","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABH249.pdf","5,353 KB","006727 - Development Alternatives, Inc.

"Executive summary of a mid-term evaluation (PD-ABH-251) of a project to establish a maintainable rural road system in Sindh Province, Pakistan, and identify the policy, management, and financial reforms needed to achieve a similar system nationwide. The evaluation covered the period 6/87-5/93. Targets for km of maintained roads have been achieved in all but two districts despite changing local conditions (the Gulf War) and Pressler amendment funding cuts.  Targets for rehabilitated paved roads had to be reduced by 10% for the same reasons. Targets for training in road maintenance management, road rehabilitation, and financial management also have not been met due to funding reductions. Most district engineers and their staff have limited or no equipment available for material hauling, and routine maintenance activities are limited to what work crews can do manually with hand-hoes and hand tampers; funding for equipment is badly needed. For periodic maintenance (e.g., resealing, new bituminous surface treatments), the district engineers rely on local contractors.  This helps involve the private sector, and since the contractors generally have more skilled work crews and easier access to equipment, they can do a better job for less. Although Districts have begun to include a line item for road maintenance in their annual budgets, they are still underfunding by substantial amounts.  Another potential funding problem is that District councils and engineers consider special grants from the Government of Sindh to be outside the regular budget and hence not subject to the same quality standards of construction as are required of the A.I.D. program. As a result, roads built with these funds will have higher rehabilitation and/or maintenance costs. In sum, despite severe reductions in funding, the objectives of an improved road maintenance program and an expanded system of maintainable roads have been met.  At the same time, other objectives have had to be reduced or eliminated entirely -- training for District-level engineering, administrative, and technical staff; the experimental road construction program; and the upgrading of katcha roads.  This reduction in the attainment of objectives also limits potential program sustainability.","Main document: PD-ABH-251|Companion evaluation summary: PD-ABJ-133|Delivery order no. 23","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-0249-I-00-0019-00","","5/1/1993 12:00:00 AM","","Road construction|Road maintenance|Rural areas|Districts|Financial resources|Technical training|Project sustainability","Pakistan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABH250.pdf","188 KB","000427 - De Leuw, Cather International, Inc.","","008588 - USAID.

"In Fall 1987, the United States Congress, concerned about the future of development in Africa, provided a new assistance instrument to the United States Agency for International Development (USAlD).  This instrument, called the Development Fund for Africa (DFA), was the tangible result of a new compact between USAlD and Congress on an approach to development in Africa.  Three key elements of the compact were: (1) a commitment to secure funding; (2) flexibility; and (3) a results orientation.  Congress asked that USAlD periodically report on its experiences, both positive and negative.  This report presents a frank appraisal of USAID successes and failures, and assesses the impact of USAID's use of about $3.5 billion of DFA monies between fiscal years 1988 and 1992.  Some programs have achieved negligible or limited results, but, overall, USAlD programs are making a positive and substantive difference in the lives of the people of Africa.  The report presented here is divided into three parts.  The first section provides an overview of Africa's progress and USAlD's programs.  The second section looks at USAID's programs and impacts in three key areas: (1) investing in economic and political democracy; (2) investing in people (health, population and education); and (3) investing in agriculture (including natural resource management and the environment).  The report concludes with a discussion of sustainable development in Africa.

"A.I.D.'s contribution to Tunisia's family planning program over the past 25 years -- about $50 million -- has been significant for a country of only 8 million people.  This report analyzes the effects of that contribution.  Section II reviews Tunisia's social and economic climates and their relationship to family planning from the 1950s to the present. Section III provides a component-specific review of the national program, while its overall effectiveness, efficiency, sustainability and long-term impact are discussed in Sections IV and V.  Among the successes of the program, detailed in Section VI, are that it: dramatically reduced fertility and abortion rates, as well as government expenditures on health and education; effectively expanded use of modern contraceptive methods (especially IUDs and female sterilization), the access of poor women to modern methods, and overall program coverage; and was cost-effective. A.I.D.'s contribution to this effort focused on: (1) diversifying the modes of service delivery through mobile units and a social marketing campaign, thereby increasing program access; (2) supporting training and TA in highly effective clinical methods, thereby enhancing contraceptive prevalence; (3) improving health outreach via extensive training of professionals and field workers in clinical methods, management, and service delivery, including IUD provision; and (4) enhancing institutional capacities by supporting the establishment of training centers.  Less positively, as of 1990, when A.I.D. funding terminated, the Agency had not contributed to the program's financial sustainability.  A price increase was needed for the contraceptive social marketing program to increase profits and reflect real costs, and the program had not been privatized; nor had A.I.D. supported analyses or pilot programs to test cost-recovery schemes.

"Between 1968 and 1991, USAID supported 8 bilateral and 43 centrally funded family planning (FP) programs in Ghana. Assistance fell into two distinct phases -- 1969-1982 and 1985-1991 -- with assistance suspended from April 1983 to July 1984. This report assesses the impact of this assistance in light of the country setting and the national FP program which it supported, with specific attention to that program's overall efficiency, cost-effectiveness, sustainability, and long-term development impact.  According to the assessment, progress was practically negligible in the initial period of USAID assistance, but improved during the second phase:  the number of FP delivery points increased dramatically; nearly all of the clinics distributing contraceptives were reporting regularly; the Ghana Social Marketing Program made significant progress in expanding the number of delivery points for commercial sector condoms; and during the period 1987-91, couple years of protection nearly tripled, from 75,000 to 223,000. Nonetheless, FP has made only limited gains in Ghana in terms of fertility rate (6.8% in 1965 vs. 6.4% in 1988) and contraceptive prevalence rate, which is the most reliable measure of the impact of any FP program.  While the latter rate did increase from 9.5% in 1979 to 12.9% in 1988, the increase was largely in traditional methods; use of modern methods actually dropped slightly, from 5.5% to 5.2% during the period, although it rose to 8%-10% by 1991 and seems to be rising still. One factor behind Ghana's weak demand for modern contraceptives has been the severe economic crisis of the late 1970s and early 1980s, which led to a deterioration of both public and private health services.  This situation was compounded by a mass exodus of Ghanaian professionals, including doctors, and the suspension of USAID assistance.  Three additional factors explaining poor program progress have been: lack of political commitment; cultural attitudes (especially among men) favoring large families; and the fact that in many instances, contraceptives and FP counseling were not regularly available from a convenient and trusted source which ensured clients' privacy.","Summary highlights: PN-ABG-019","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","11/1/1993 12:00:00 AM","","Family planning promotion programs|Family planning services|Contraceptive prevalence|Project sustainability","Ghana","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAX274.pdf","3,439 KB","008058 - USAID.

"India's policy regime is highly anti-export, making difficult for firms to compete in world markets.  Even so, as this case study shows, Indian entrepreneurs are ready to take advantage of any slight opening the Indian Government provides. Although not intended to promote exports, A.I.D.'s Program for the Advancement of Commercial Technology (PACT) project in India was highly successful in linking Indian firms with U.S. partners for commercially viable projects.  PACT helped to promote the creation of a venture capital industry in India, and reinforced the competence of Indian entrepreneurs. The following lessons can be learned from the PACT experience. (1) Projects can have significant policy fallout when they demonstrate the benefits of better policy and indicate directions for such policy, as PACT did for indigenous research and development in India and for linkages to foreign firms.  (2) The findings of Keesing (1992) and others are strongly confirmed: government export promotion activities are of limited or marginal value.  It is possible to spend, as India does, large amounts of resources without significant impact.  (3) Indian firms seem to misperceive the risks and rewards of exporting.  Being in a protected environment, they are insufficiently aware of the potential for sharp increases in productivity and profits from better technology and methods.  (4) Close collaboration between foreign and domestic firms in a repressed economy like India's result in high payoffs, though only over time.  (5) USAID/India should focus on the key problem of the massive waste of the country's scarce investment resources:  India's capacity to save would allow annual growth of 9-10% per year.  The challenge for USAID is to identify paths of economic liberalization, particularly in trade, that will help improve efficiency.

"Evaluates efforts to promote democratic institutions in Eastern Europe through the Rule of Law (1800020), Education Reform (1800021), and Independent Media (1800022) programs.  Interim evaluation covers the period 1991-4/93 and is based on visits to Bulgaria, Lithuania, and Poland. The Rule of Law program's impact is sufficient to justify its continuation in the three countries visited except, possibly, Poland, which is further advanced and where legal authorities have become sensitive to receiving advice from external sources. Efforts should focus on supporting the growing private sector economy and on dealing with economic and organized crime and government corruption.  There is no convincing reason to have separate programs run by the Central and Eastern European Law Initiative Program (CEELI) and the U.S. Information Agency (USIA), and there are some disadvantages; CEELI could provide the full range of services required.  In-country advisors do not spend enough time in-country or receive enough advance preparation; they should be sent for longer periods, even if this means sending fewer advisors and paying commercial rather than volunteer level compensation. Despite favorable reviews, CEELI's commentaries on draft legislation had little impact on the legislative process and in some instances did not reflect an understanding of the local legal culture and institutions.  This aspect of the program should be downplayed and the process modified to address the weaknesses.  Also, more attention should be given to linkages to national institutions such as private bar associations and training centers for justice sector personnel. The Education Reform program is the least promising of the three. Little progress has been made in reforming the educational systems inherited from the communist era.  The will to reform is weak, and the resource needs large.  USIA is using its existing programs and has not modified them to focus on curriculum reform. If continued, the program should include support for the Ohio State Education Program in Poland and modify the USIA exchange programs and the Books for Democracy program so they directly support reform. With help from the Independent Media program, the number of newspapers, periodicals, and private radio stations has jumped significantly in all three countries, and in Poland even the number of private TV channels has increased.  The program has had several favorable impacts:  it has supported successful private newsgathering and reporting agencies in Lithuania and Bulgaria; helped start or strengthen five private radio stations in Bulgaria; and assisted the Media Resource Center in Poland, which is making such progress that it may develop into a new, practically oriented journalism training institution.  Key constraints are the poor economic conditions facing investors (especially in Lithuania and Poland), the lack of a journalistic tradition of fact above opinion, and the lack of practical training in running a commercial media outlet.  Given the economic situation, it is important that equipment be supplied to a media outlet only after close review of its economic prospects and business plan, and TA and training for media personnel should focus on practical matters. In addition, the program should be expanded to include establishment/strengthening of national journalism training, again, with a practical focus. In general, USAID field offices lack expertise in program design and monitoring.  A.I.D. should establish one or more positions under each program to have multi-country responsibility in these areas.  These persons could also give more emphasis to addressing problems on a regional basis and increasing interchange of experience among country-level programs.  A.I.D. should also make greater use of in-region institutions and personnel in addressing common problems under the three programs.","Also known as: Final report : program evaluation of selected AID|assistance to democratic institutions in Bulgaria, Lithuania and|Poland (dated November 23, 1993)|Delivery order no. 4","Special Evaluation","Documents","AEP-0085-I-00-3003-00","","11/1/1993 12:00:00 AM","","Democratization|Administration of law|Educational reform|Communication media|Privatization","Central and Eastern Europe","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABH360.pdf","12,764 KB","000356 - Checchi and Co.

"PACR of a project (4/89-4/93) to strengthen the Government of Tunisia's (GOT) capacity to conduct economic analyses, especially those needed to support the GOT/World Bank Agricultural Structural Adjustment Program (ASAP). The project succeeded in readying the Tunisian economic environment for an agribusiness focus.  Through formal and on-the-job training, it increased the capability of GOT personnel to conduct policy analyses, and through policy dialogue, it has changed attitudes toward private sector participation in policy decisions and development within the agricultural (and other) sectors. The project conducted more than 35 TA assignments with contractors, the GOT, and numerous public and private sector institutions.  Its major accomplishments were in the areas of policy reform, training, study tours to the United States and other countries, use of mathematical tools to analyze policy impacts, and institutional development. Highlights include:  (1) policy reform in cereals assembly, storage, and marketing; (2) assistance in setting up a grain grading system; (3) demonstrations and training for the Director of Agricultural Statistics on methods of improving crop forecasting; (4) liberalization of imports of powdered milk and animal feed, and of exports of edible oils, olive oil, and wine; (5) reduction or elimination of subsidies on agricultural inputs, irrigation water, grain transportation, and a number of basic food prices; (6) seminars on structural adjustment and policy reform and roundtables on specific commodities such as cereal and flowers; and (7) institutional development in such areas as project management, contracting procedures, financial management, drafting scopes of work, and reporting. Lessons learned include the following.  (1) An interministerial coordinating committee is vital in getting consensus on priorities, making decisions about implementation, and disseminating information about project activities and results. Committee members should be high enough to represent their agencies, but not so high as to be too busy to attend meetings. (2) Participation by host country experts is essential; subcontracting with local consultants is one way to ensure participation, but unfortunately does not increase host government capacity.  (3) At the earliest possible date, the project should use local experts to assess procurement needs, and if appropriate, make the prime contractor responsible for procurement.  (4) The project should maintain flexibility in implementation, but should try to stick to a yearly plan so that TA can be planned in advance.  (5) Host country contracting procedures should be thoroughly reviewed to avoid unforeseen problems; in this project, a misunderstanding on payment held up one contract more than a year.  On the other hand, direct USAID contracts can be very time-consuming, so contracts under $25,000 should not require formal bidding.  (6) A variety of information dissemination mechanisms (brochures, newsletters, roundtables, seminars, etc.) proved helpful in this project; the host country organization should institutionalize these activities.  (7) The project's seminars were very well-attended by the public and private sectors, generated a lot of discussion, and resulted in proposals and actions for policy reform.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","8/1/1993 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural policy|Policy analysis|Policy reform|Policy dialogue","Tunisia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABH366.pdf","591 KB","008616 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (7/89-3/93) to support the development of small and medium-scale enterprises (SMEs) in Guatemala, and promote U.S.-Guatemalan joint ventures.  The project was implemented by the International Executive Service Corps (IESC). While the project did not reach all of its goals, it did have a positive impact on SMEs, as demonstrated by increased sales and production.  A survey of 95 assisted firms revealed that:  58% improved product quality; 56% increased their profits; 49% increased sales; 43% increased production; and 31% increased workers' wages. The most successful activity was the U.S. Volunteer Executives program, which provided management assistance and technology transfer to 139 firms; assistance went mostly to agribusiness enterprises, followed by woman-owned businesses and manufacturing firms.  Although efforts were made to coordinate activities with local business associations, such as the Guatemalan Entrepreneurial Chamber (CAEM), the Guild of Non-Traditional Product Exporters (Gremial), FUNDAP, FUNTEC, and the Guatemalan Management Association, attention was not paid to strengthening these institutions' capabilities, but rather to tapping them as a source of potential clients.  No progress was made under the Guatemalan Volunteer Executive program; deep mistrust and strong competition among Guatemalan firms prevented them from sharing with one another what was perceived as confidential business information. In the Trade and Investment Services (TIS) component, sector surveys were completed for a range of products in the agribusiness, manufacturing, wood, and metalworking sectors. However, no marketing and promotional efforts were developed for these sectors, nor were any joint ventures launched.  However, the American Business Linkage Enterprise services did put a number of Guatemalan firms in contact with U.S. firms interested in investing in the region.  As a result, two Guatemalan businesses entered into negotiations with U.S. firms, for a loofah export business and a data entry operation. Unfortunately, the negotiations were unsuccessful and neither transaction was completed. The following lessons were learned.  (1) IESC should focus its efforts in its areas of strength.  Although TIS activities have been successful in other countries, in Guatemala much more success was derived from Volunteer Executives.  (2) In designing projects for SMEs, attention should be paid to ensuring that services are affordable.  In the case of IESC/Guatemala, high local operating costs combined with mandatory fees to IESC's U.S. headquarters gradually raised the cost of services (even with a large subsidy from the Mission) out of the reach of SMEs. Although efforts were made to work with IESC on alternative delivery mechanisms and operating procedures to lower their costs, there was a great deal of resistance to doing so, with IESC preferring to charge higher fees and move to larger clientele.  (3) A monitoring system should be established that meets both A.I.D.'s and the implementing institution's needs. While IESC/G made every attempt to respond to the information needs of the Mission, their U.S. headquarters, and their clients, this distracted their attention from service delivery, a situation which would not have occurred if reporting needs had been thought through at the initiation of the project.  Also, USAID/G changed project officers frequently and each officer had a tendency to place new reporting requirements, because of the lack of an adequate reporting/monitoring system.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","10/1/1993 12:00:00 AM","","Small scale enterprises|Medium scale enterprises|Business support services|Management training|Investment promotion","Guatemala|USA","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABH388.pdf","411 KB","008550 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (8/82-8/92) to increase the availability and use of family planning (FP) services and information through public, private, and commercial sources in Guatemala. The project met or exceeded most of its numerical goals.  It reached a half million more couples with FP services than planned, and increased the use of contraceptives from one-fourth of the target population to almost one-third.  Expanding services in rural Mayan areas proved much more difficult than in urban Latino areas.  Strategies addressing the special needs of Mayan and other underserved populations must be developed if they are to be reached; the experience of the Guatemalan Family Life Education Association (AGES) indicates that these activities will be both resource- and time-intensive. Conservative opposition, led by the Catholic Church, proved to be the main obstacle to increasing the provision and use of modern FP methods in Guatemala.  Nevertheless, with studies indicating that 26% of all married women of fertile age want no more children, the Ministry of Health (MOH) continued to provide FP services even after the Archbishop of Guatemala sent a letter of protest to President Reagan.  In response to this situation, USAID supported the integration of selected maternal/child health (MCH) services into FP agencies; for example, local PVOs conducted publicity campaigns stressing the positive impacts of birth spacing on lowering both infant and maternal mortality. The conservative attack thus had a positive impact by forcing the implementing agencies to redefine their delivery of FP services through the incorporation of MCH services and to change their institutional missions to contribute to the reduction of maternal and infant mortality and morbidity. A large segment of the Guatemalan population still does not have access to or knowledge of the range of FP services.  Studies of voluntary surgical contraception (VSC) users showed that, for most, VSC is the only FP method that they have ever used, indicating that FP services are not being used to space births but rather to prevent births when a desired family size has been reached.  This excessive reliance on one method limits the impact that modern methods of birth spacing can have on lowering maternal and infant mortality rates. Having never benefited from strong government commitment to FP, the MOH's ability to implement FP service delivery is very limited, as is its status as a leader in the provision of FP services.  In addition, it continues to have a poor image, which hampers its ability to promote and provide FP services at the community level.  Because of the political nature of the MOH, personnel changes are frequent and, therefore, training must be an ongoing activity combined with supervision to maintain minimum levels of service quality. Although duplication may occur -- such as having both a MOH and an APROFAM (Asociacion Pro Bienstar de la Familia) clinic in the same town -- having a wide variety of service providers and methods allows couples better overall access and some choice, both of which are key elements in a voluntary FP program. Despite the conservative nature of Guatemalan society, the social marketing program was able to carry out mass media campaigns of brand name contraceptives.  Nonetheless, the political environment will continue to affect the use of FP services in Guatemala, and the Mission must recognize that it is vulnerable to attack by conservative elements of society as long as it supports these activities.  In the long run, however, none of the Mission's efforts will have a lasting effect if Guatemala's population continues to grow at over 2.5% a year.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","9/1/1993 12:00:00 AM","","Family planning services|Family planning promotion programs|IEC|Political aspects|Rural areas|Urban areas|Public health care|Private health care","Guatemala","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABH389.pdf","336 KB","008550 - USAID.

"PACR of a subproject (1982-8/92) to field test renewable energy technologies in Egypt. The project was essentially a failure.  Only 4 of 11 targeted field tests were conducted, and 3 of these suffered serious delays, resulting in three PACD extensions.  More importantly, no significant progress was made towards addressing the real constraints to the effective development and utilization of renewable energy in Egypt, namely, economic, bureaucratic, and administrative constraints.  Rather, the project focused on lack of appropriate technology, which is not the main constraint. The project was not without accomplishment, however.  Training was provided for 152 policymakers and 500 engineers, versus a target of 40-100 for each group.  Also, a Renewable Energy Information System (REIS) was established and is functioning at the Government of Egypt's (GOE's) New and Renewable Energy Authority (NREA); numerous economic and environmental analyses were also completed.  Finally, 56 new initiatives for field tests were proposed and 1 of these was implemented, versus respective targets of 6 and 1-2. Lessons learned included the following.  (1) Successful technology transfer requires attention not only to technological issues, but also to the financial viability of the technologies; the existence of local infrastructure for their manufacture, sale, and marketing; and a strategy for the organizational, financial, technological, and policy elements required.  (2) The design of field test systems suffered from insufficient interaction among the U.S. contractors, NREA staff, and the GOE. In a related vein, the process of obtaining approval from NREA and USAID/Cairo for field testing and system design documentation was too time-consuming and expensive.  Excessive detail is to be avoided in drafting Requests for Proposals for smaller-scale field tests. (3) Training should focus on (a) experience in engineering-experimental data acquisition and analysis (including microcomputer use), and (b) practical exposure to hands-on renewable system operation and trouble shooting.  (4) Ensuring that a system can pay its own way, through some form of a monetary collection model, can greatly contribute to sustainability.  (5) When possible, portable data loggers should be used instead of PC units, which can complicate data collection processes and are more susceptible to hardware and software failure under adverse environmental conditions.  (6) Overly centralized project management and evaluation can create unnecessary delays.  Localized evaluation in particular is more productive, since evaluators are more familiar with projects and their implementors.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","3/1/1993 12:00:00 AM","","Renewable energy resources|Alternative energy technology|Institution building|Technology assessment|Technology transfer|Field work|Constraints|Beneficiary count","Egypt","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABH391.pdf","307 KB","008539 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of a project to enhance agricultural planning and policy analysis in Sri Lanka.  Evaluation covers the period 8/86-8/93, against a 12/93 PACD. The project was an important, successful effort.  It responded to Sri Lankan needs, and was appropriately modified to meet changing provincial roles.  Although not originally designed to directly affect policy reform (but rather to create its intellectual and administrative infrastructure), it had a far greater positive impact than could have been expected. The provision of long and short-term TA was combined with training and equipment in a judicious and supportive manner.  The TA advisor was eminently successful, playing critical roles in the management of policy and research papers.  Training was the most important aspect of the project, although language testing issues clouded the choice of some candidates.  Procurement was probably the most delayed and troublesome aspect of project administration. A functioning agricultural planning system is in effect; and a mid-term national agricultural strategy will be completed by 12/93.  The technical and analytical capabilities of the planning units have been strengthened, including the provincial units, whose outlooks have been broadened and whose staff capacities have been enhanced.  Much closer links now exist between the National Planning Division and the provinces, which are the base for the new agricultural strategy. Legislators and policy makers increasingly seem to have turned to these groups for policy advice and options. Sri Lankan officials indicated that they were able to present sound, prioritized policy alternatives to the cabinet on short notice because of the project, and that its overall impact was positive.  This type of project can speed the reform process when the direction has been determined, provide analytical data on which reforms my be justified, and train those who prepare policy options.  But it cannot change policies that the state is unprepared to alter.  The policy successes were a product of proper timing, the correct choice of policy issues, excellent TA, and donor policy coordination. The project should be terminated as scheduled; however, the project should first fund studies and seminars for the new agricultural development strategy to be developed after PACD. Lessons learned are as follows.  (1) TA is a highly personalized activity, and advisors should have disciplinary competence, country experience, and cross-cultural sensitivity.  (2) Host-country contracts create administrative headaches, but may provide the basis for host-country relationships that are more effective.  (3) Agricultural and rural sector projects should be considered within the broad political economy.  (4) Policy reforms will take place when governments perceive them to be in their interests; donors must be prepared administratively and conceptually to respond quickly.  (5) It is usually impossible to pinpoint the genesis of policy change and assign credit to any one donor.  (6) Training is an important investment in long-term sustainable policy and developmental change.  (7) Project modifications, training, and commodity procurement, because of the increasing complexity of USAID and U.S. Government regulations, are becoming more difficult and require intensive staff effort in order to be successful.

"The measurement of benefits from export promotion programs raises difficult practical and technical issues.  This paper explores methodologies for ex post impact analysis of export promotion projects. The paper discusses several types of benefits:  direct benefits (foreign exchange earnings, employment generation, returns to local capital, value added); indirect benefits (e.g., new or stronger institutions to promote investment and exports and an improved policy environment for export-oriented investment); and externalities (benefits or costs, either to unassisted firms or to others, resulting from the project-related activities of assisted firms).  The following conclusions are reached.  (1) Rigorous cost-benefit analysis of promotion projects is extremely difficult to perform ex post. Substantial data are needed for such analysis (requiring an unjustifiably large expenditure of scarce evaluation resources), and the reliability of the results is questionable.  (2) More limited cost-benefit analysis based on data gathered in short field trips (as done for this report) provides only a rough estimate of the rate of return.  (3) Where time and financial resources are limited, a rate of return calculation based on employment benefits may serve as a useful proxy for a more complete analysis.  (4) Promotion projects can have significant indirect impacts, but measuring such impacts poses significant challenges. Learning from other firms, for example, has potentially large benefits.  (5) Performance monitoring is essential in promotion projects, but formal cost-benefit analysis is likely to be impracticable in most circumstances. Often more appropriate are less ambitious measures such as setting specific targets linked to government objectives (e.g., job creation), use of intermediate measures (e.g., an increase in the number of export leads being actively pursued), and periodic surveys of assisted firms.

"Evaluates the capacity of U.S. PVOs and indigenous NGOs in Lesotho to expand participation in the USAID/L program.  The evaluation is based on interviews with nearly 40 U.S. PVOs, 25 Lesotho NGOs, major donors, international volunteer organizations, and several consulting firms and training institutes. Like their counterparts in most developing countries, most Lesotho NGOs -- including many ""modernized"" church-related groups -- are new and inexperienced organizations, functioning largely through volunteer members, and working in development areas in which they have great interest but limited experience. Institutional strength in management, technical, and absorptive capacity is understandably low in these institutions; consequently, their potential outreach and developmental capacity are limited. The environment within which Lesotho NGO's operate consists of three institutional forces -- the Government of Lesotho (GOL), the donor community, and U.S. PVOs.  The GOL is supportive of NGO and PVO programs, making it easy for NGOs to register, obtain tax exempt status (something which is difficult in other countries), and set up programs. While there has been some tension between the GOL and a number of the progressive NGOs, especially those with agendas of social transformation and change, these are still permitted to operate.  Due to the failure to GOL and other traditional means of reaching the grassroots level, donors have also shown strong support for Lesotho NGOs.  This support, which comes largely from multilateral rather than bilateral agencies, has focused on NGOs with a proven track record and has generally neglected building up NGO institutional capacity. There are only five U.S. PVOs operating in Lesotho, each with a long-term focus and significant private funding.  These PVOs have traditionally developed their own country programs, unconcerned with donor funding or collaboration with other members of the development community.  They expressed interest in the objectives of the present study and felt that with additional funding they could expand their development programs, though these do not necessarily correspond to USAID/L's development priorities. In contrast, U.S. PVOs not established in Lesotho are a newer breed, specialized providers of management and technical assistance to public and private sector institutions, and, increasingly, to their counterparts in the developing world.  These PVOs have significant experience with USAID and in South Africa, and see their role as supporting Lesotho's NGO programs, not as establishing their own. The assessment concludes that partnerships between those U.S. PVOs without Lesotho programs and Lesotho NGOs would have the greatest long-term developmental impact.  Also, while some PVOs merit support for establishing or maintaining programs, the most effective role for a U.S. PVO would be to support Lesotho NGOs. The assessment also finds that donor funding for PVOs/NGOs in Lesotho will increase over the next 3-5 years, though still neglecting PVO/NGO institutional development and sustainability issues. It is recommended that USAID/L make a commitment to strengthening indigenous NGOs, including assistance in new sectoral focus areas such as agricultural/natural resource management, AIDS and family planning, enterprise development, and democratization, with U.S. PVOs working as partners with Lesotho NGOs.  USAID/L should channel its support through an umbrella intermediary.  Finally, political and social divisions, and tensions arising from religious affiliation, are a reality in Lesotho, and must be taken into account when considering grant support to religious development institutions.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","HNE-0000-I-00-2097-00","","4/1/1993 12:00:00 AM","","Private voluntary organizations|Indigenous private voluntary organizations|Development organizations|Institution building|Development projects|Development strategies|Development cooperation","Lesotho","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNABQ352.pdf","4,429 KB","003970 - Management Systems International, Inc.

"Interim evaluation of the policy dialogue, economics training, and policy implementation components of a project in Ecuador to establish a process for macroeconomic policy dialogue (PROGRESEC project).  The evaluation covers the period 9/90-11/93.  The project is being implemented by the  Instituto Centroamericano de Administracion de Empresas (INCAE). PROGRESEC has achieved a significant number of accomplishments, but there are questions as to its overall impact as well as the direction it is headed.  The main successes are those to be expected from a prestigious academic institution like INCAE.  The short-term economics training being provided is probably the best ever available in Ecuador: the teaching and materials presented are almost invariably excellent and have succeeded in raising both the level of information and the level of debate. What is less clear is the success of the policy dialogue program, especially the policy implementation component. INCAE has improved the environment for policy dialogue, and has contributed to greater understanding of Ecuador's economic model and macroeconomic issues, but it has not advanced policy debate on specific issues.  The lack of a strategic focus is now reducing this component's potential impact. The policy implementation assistance component was added in 1992, but with a couple of important exceptions, little activity has taken place. Although INCAE (reluctantly) agreed to take on the component, it has argued that cost, along with its need to maintain a position of strict neutrality, make it very difficult to take an active role. Realistically, INCAE is not likely to improve its performance in this area, so alternatives must be sought. Given INCAE's current structure and operational mode, sustainability of PROGRESEC activities after the PACD is unlikely; little in the way of local capacity building for the three components has been generated. INCAE should begin to explore mechanisms to reduce PROGRESEC's dependency on INCAE's headquarters in Costa Rica, help PROGRESEC develop its own personality and identity, and seek greater local input on project management and emerging opportunities and issues.  USAID/E and INCAE must jointly re-define the project's objectives, re-examining each component and the linkages among them.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","AEP-0085-I-05-3001-00","","11/1/1993 12:00:00 AM","","Economic policy|Policy dialogue|Economic administration|Business schools|Management training|Economics education","Ecuador","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABH410.pdf","1,543 KB","003970 - Management Systems International, Inc.

"Interim evaluation of a project, implemented by the International Eye Foundation (IEF), in Cameroon's Dja et Lobo Division to test a model of cost-effective, sustainable distribution of ivermectin for onchocerciasis treatment through the rural primary health care (PHC) system.  The evaluation covers the period 9/91-10/93. IEF had serious difficulties in carrying out surveys, training, and supervisory visits due to safety, communications, and logistical problems caused by the social turmoil associated with the 10/92 Cameroonian presidential elections.  Remarkably, however, it was still able to produce significant accomplishments, and, except for the coverage rate for ivermectin distribution, has the potential to achieve all objectives by the project completion date.  Overall, and in spite of the unfortunate timing of the project, the integration of ivermectin delivery into the PHC system is unique, and presents a cost-effective, sustainable, and replicable model for disease prevention and control. IEF's accomplishments included:  (1) intensive and rapid epidemiologic assessments to establish the endemicity of onchocerciasis in the division of Dja et Lobo; (2) completion of a KAP survey as a basis for delivering appropriate health education materials and messages; (3) development of delivery protocols, materials, and methods for tracking project progress; (4) treatment of 17,800 persons for onchocerciasis during the first round of ivermectin distribution; and (5) training/supervision of more than 100 health personnel in all Ministry of Public Health (MOPH) facilities in Dja et Lobo. However, there were numerous weaknesses:  the coverage rate for the first round of ivermectin distribution was about 20% of the eligible population, well below the goal of 80%; consolidation and analysis of data were hindered by a malfunctioning computer and poorly designed onchocerciasis treatment forms; the use of ophthalmic methods for establishing prevalence of blindness to correlate with onchocerciasis was not a successful approach; and health education messages concerning guidelines for exclusion from treatment and protocols for handling adverse reactions require reinforcement and standardization. Lessons learned included the following.  (1) A system which relies solely on passive distribution at health facilities is unlikely to produce high coverage.  (2) It is important to make sure that the target PHC system is ready before beginning actual distribution of drugs; the degree of coverage is a function of capabilities of the PHC system.  (3) Where public understanding of onchocerciasis and the availability of treatment are low, concerted efforts are needed to develop demand for treatment. (4) The use of PVOs as implementing organizations has both advantages and disadvantages in the African context, where public sector health delivery is usually less efficient than PVO methods.  A PVO may be unwilling to give up its own efficient system, even if it accepts local integration in principle.  (5) An information system should be viable in non-computerized form before attempts are made to computerize it. (6) It is essential that implementing PVOs establish a strong in-country presence.  (7) Roles and responsibilities of the PVO, host government institution, and project sub-contractors must be clearly established before the inception of the project.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","DPE-5948-C-00-9030-00","","12/1/1993 12:00:00 AM","","Disease prevention and control|Onchocerciasis|Pharmaceuticals|Delivery systems|Primary health care|Public health care|Rural areas|Private voluntary organizations","Cameroon","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABH412.pdf","2,555 KB","005969 - Medical Service Corp.

"PACR of a project (9/84-7/92) to support three programs providing business management education in Jordan:  the Master's in Business Administration (MBA) and the M.A. in health services management programs at the University of Jordan's Faculty of Economics and Administrative Sciences (FEAS), and short-term training at the Jordan Institute of Management (JIM). Results were mixed.  Outputs were expected to include 300 MBA and M.A. graduates; 13-16 FEAS staff members and 9 JIM staff members trained or their skills upgraded; 3,400 managers trained at JIM; FEAS curricula developed or upgraded; training aids installed; and research projects undertaken. Actual results were as follows.  (1) Only 42 MBA degrees and 50 M.A. degrees in hospital administration (11 of the latter to women) have been awarded so far, and future projections for graduation are unknown, although with 306 students still enrolled in the two programs the final number of graduates will be greater than at present.  (2) Fourteen FEAS and JIM staff members were trained or their skills upgraded.  (3) The target of 3,400 managers trained by JIM was far exceeded -- 7,110 managers were trained.  (4) The project was successful, to some degree, in improving FEAS curricula and in installing computer training aids, but little research was undertaken. Overall, the sustainability of project accomplishments is assured, although the quality of the programs will almost certainly suffer due to the Government of Jordan's fiscal constraints. There were six lessons learned.  (1) The relatively low salaries of FEAS staff resulted in low morale and high turnover.  The project agreement should have required that FEAS faculty receive salaries commensurate with those of the faculty of the engineering college.  (2) Project design needs to take into account the reality that many students will be only part-time, especially in regard to estimating the numbers and timing of graduations.  (3) It should be required that designated faculty and administrators be in place before the initial disbursement of funds; in the present case, FEAS was extremely thin in management areas and attempted to use already overburdened professors for administrative duties.  Joint appointments with other faculties should be pursued to maximize faculty use at no additional cost to the university.  (4) The University of Jordan, when developing MBA and M.A. programs, should put more emphasis on strategic management and resource allocation.  However, the university did prove that, with proper TA, it is capable of developing and implementing respectable programs in new disciplines.  (5) In order to maximize short-term training dollars, JIM should focus more on joint training, which provides for improved technology transfer and implementation, and should design short-term courses for several instructors at a time, in an established institution. (6) In general, the grant needed a more focused approach to training and an improved long-term relationship with established universities and training institutions.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1993 12:00:00 AM","","Management training|Management education|Masters degrees|Universities and colleges|Beneficiary count","Jordan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABH423.pdf","179 KB","008564 - USAID.

"PACR on a grant (4/88-4-93) to Fundacion Natura (FN), an Ecuadorean PVO, to expand environmental education and awareness in Ecuador.  This was the third consecutive such grant to FN, and focused on increasing public awareness of the deterioration of the natural resource base. The project was successful in all its targeted areas, with the greatest success in the area of formal environmental education, which was institutionalized in Ecuador's school system in 6/89. FN organized ecological clubs for high school students; distributed a total of more than 300,000 copies of instructional materials and teachers' manuals for the preschool, primary, and secondary school levels; and trained more than 40,000 teachers in delivering environmental education.  The financial contribution by the Ministries of Health, Social Welfare, and Education toward this component was three times that of the grant. Under the environmental awareness component, an environmental knowledge, attitudes, and practices survey was completed; 780 press releases were distributed to major national newspapers; 60 radio spots were broadcast on 120 radio stations; and several books and pamphlets were published.  Five hundred public leaders attended 20 environmental awareness seminars, 10 of which dealt with specific issues such as industrial pollution, agriculture and the environment, and contamination of the Machangara River. The other 10 seminars dealt with the drafting of a national environmental law which is currently under consideration. Under the industrial pollution component, FN prepared a report on industrial processes, which heightened public awareness of industrial pollution.  FN also identified the effluents of over 39 types of industries; the information has been widely disseminated, and FN has worked with the government to develop norms and regulations for effluent disposal.  In addition, five municipalities in El Oro province were assisted in developing ordinances to prevent contamination from gold mining. Under the community development component, secondary school students in Quito distributed and explained an educational document on proper garbage handling, resulting in improvements in the appearance of city streets; 130 member municipalities of the Ecuadorian Association of Municipalities (AME) received training in environmental concerns (these are now dealt with extensively in AME's own training program); and 500 community development institutions were provided with training in environment and development. Finally, FN developed a document center which houses over 12,000 documents and 770 periodicals and is used by over 300 people each month -- primarily high school and university students, although other groups, such as professors and government personnel, also use the center. The following lessons were learned.  (1) The project's success was due its evolution, in three phases, over a 10-year period; changes in attitudes and behavior take time.  (2) While evaluations found this project to be successful, a lack of measurable benchmarks made it difficult for the evaluators to provide solid evidence of this achievement.  (3) NGOs should offer employment conditions that attract and hold experienced professionals, perhaps through convergence with the private for-profit sector in the areas of management and entrepreneurial pursuit of funding.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","11/1/1993 12:00:00 AM","","Environmental education|Pollution|Public awareness|Indigenous private voluntary organizations|Beneficiary count","Ecuador","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABH424.pdf","140 KB","008538 - USAID.

"PACR of a program (9/82-3/91), comprising Housing Guaranty (HG) 520HG04 and grant-funded TA (5200261), to increase the private sector's role in financing and constructing low-cost housing in Guatemala.  The program was implemented by the Bank of Guatemala (BOG) and the Guatemalan Mortgage Insurance Institute (FHA). Program start-up was significantly delayed; in the absence of a Guatemalan institution with experience in housing matters, and after several years of negotiation, the BOG assumed responsibility for program implementation in 1986.  However, the Bank itself had no experience in housing policy or project implementation, and was further constrained by the country's lack of policies related to subsidies and interest rates. Despite these problems, the program has had a positive effect. It successfully guided the FHA to lower minimum standards to a 13 sq meter shelter solution, thereby expanding the housing market to include lower-income groups.  Private developers were also encouraged to promote minimum standard shelter solutions, and in 1991 developers began providing housing units of 28 sq meters.  A total of 1,851 low-income housing units were built over the life of the program, providing jobs to approximately 850 construction workers at the peak construction phase. A shelter network comprising some 35 public and private institutions was established, provided significant support to housing leaders, and drafted and submitted to Congress a new housing law.  Seminars, short courses, and conferences helped members of the FHA, BOG, the Guatemalan Construction Chamber, and various cooperative organizations participate in promoting needed changes. The private sector was heavily involved in the provision of shelter solutions; after the program was reactivated in 3/91, five private developers completed approximately 50% of the program's housing units. A follow-on program is not recommended until there is a clear political commitment on the part of Guatemalan government to establish an appropriate policy framework to support low-income housing production. The following are lessons learned.  (1) The immense shelter problems in Guatemala will not be solved by piecemeal housing and community development projects.  (2) Guatemala's shelter problems must be solved with local human and financial resources, and without dependence on external financing and assistance.  (3) The Government must establish a permanent financing and policy institution in charge of the shelter sector.

"PACR of two projects implemented between 4/91 and 5/92 to restore transportation infrastructure in the Atlantic Zone of Costa Rica damaged by the 4/22/91 earthquake.  The International Disaster Assistance Project (9071048) addressed the country's most urgent infrastructure concerns.  The Rural Infrastructure Restoration Project (5150269) addressed longer-term restoration of bridges and roads bypassed by the immediate restoration.  Both projects were implemented by the U.S. Army Southern Command (SOUTHCOM). The projects achieved their desired results of restoring vital infrastructure, and this contributing to Costa Rica's economic recovery. Cooperation between the Ministry of Public Works, the Railroad Institution, the Aeronautics Administration, local contractors, A.I.D., the U.S. Corps of Engineers, and Embassy personnel was outstanding.  The projects restored the Limon airport and 2 railroad bridges, constructed 4 temporary bridges, reconstructed 5 highway bridges, and restored roughly 40 km of highway from Limon to La Estrella.  Contingency funds were used in part to mitigate the effects of two major floods (8/91 and 5/92).","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1993 12:00:00 AM","","Disaster reconstruction|Emergency relief|Rural areas|Earthquakes|Transportation infrastructure","Costa Rica","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABH600.pdf","85 KB","008533 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (9/88-12/91) to strengthen Guatemala's judicial sector.  Checchi and Company Consulting, Inc. implemented the project. The project experienced both failures and successes.  Planned training of Judicial Branch personnel never took place, due to communication problems and a failure to agree on a training plan. However, a small training unit was established at the Attorney General's office, and was quite successful and exceeded expectations, with more than 800 persons participating in 15 courses.  The unit was fully equipped and the Attorney General's office has assured its sustainability by taking responsibility for all recurring costs. Perhaps the most relevant impact of project training has been not in the number trained, but in the excellent performance of those who were. The project updated the Judicial Branch's National Center for Legal Information Systems (CENALEX), expanding its legal reference and case load management system, and its financial management systems.  CENALEX services all criminal courts in Guatemala City, all judicial and administrative offices in the Judicial Branch, 4 universities, the Guatemalan Bar Association, and government institutions in the executive and legislative Branch.  A major achievement was the establishment of a permanent electronic connection (via modem) between CENALEX and the Computer Center of the National Congress.  The project failed to meet only one of its targets for CENALEX's expansion -- the integration of the full text of all Guatemalan laws and jurisprudence into the system's indexes; the contractor was delayed in procuring needed equipment. The component to improve the court system completed 17 studies related to the judicial sector, but was unable to complete a planned study of the court structure due to lack of cooperation on the part of the court.  The studies completed -- concerning financial systems, standardized forms, statistics, records management, and case flow management systems -- are being used and followed up on by units of the Judicial Branch. The National Justice Commission, created as a prerequisite to this project by the Regional Administration of Justice project, failed as an institution.  Although the Commission was quite active in 1987 and 1988, it has since lost support, even among its members; although it still exists, it is inactive,  However, there are informal monthly coordinating meetings of judicial institutions which address some of the issues that the Committee was designed to address. Of 8 planned judicial system assessment studies, only 1 has been completed, an analysis of the Public Ministry.  The results of the study were accepted by judicial sector officials, the head of the Public Ministry, and the Attorney General, who is attempting, with the help of the Association of Research and Social Studies (ASIES), to implement the study's recommendations. While the initial authorization was for $5 million with a 3-year term and a possible 2-year extension with additional funding, USAID/G decided to terminate after 3 years and a total obligation of $3.4 million.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1993 12:00:00 AM","","Institution building|Judiciary|Administration of law|Beneficiary count","Guatemala","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABH855.pdf","847 KB","008550 - USAID.

"Final external evaluation of a project (1986-9/930 to upgrade irrigation technology in Honduras. Irrigation systems were constructed on 5,255 ha, and three irrigation districts in Comayagua Valley were rehabilitated, leading to increased production and productivity, mainly in export crops.  Export earnings from this project are expected to constitute 4-5% of Honduras' total, and unemployment is expected to drop by 1.5%.  However, in some cases, crop yields have been low due to insufficient assistance in on-farm water and fertilizer management. The project provided extensive training in irrigation project design and construction supervision, and most of these services have been privatized.  There has been a substantial increase in the capacity of Honduran firms to construct irrigation systems, drill wells, and supply irrigation equipment.  The demand for irrigation equipment, especially sprinkler and drip equipment, has also increased substantially.  The only shortage is in surface irrigation, where land leveling equipment is scarce. Management of the irrigation districts in the Comayagua Valley has been turned over to water users associations, which, with training, should be able to maintain and manage the districts as soon as these are rehabilitated and equipped for routine maintenance. However, project benefits have not reached a significant number of subsistence farmers, except possibly through better water supply in the Comayagua irrigation districts.  Major obstacles are a lack of clear titles and water rights.  A national water law, which would guarantee water rights, has been proposed, but it faces considerable political opposition.  Land tenure mechanisms for small farmers have not been developed.  While private banks are financing new irrigation development, this financing has benefited only large landowners with title to their land. Other concerns include the following.  An institutional capacity for interagency coordination in water resource planning is lacking.  There is danger of overexploiting Honduras' water resources; the extent of groundwater resources which can be developed in Honduras is not known. Credit availability for future irrigation is limited. The following lessons were learned.  (1) Rapid awareness of the benefits of irrigation can be brought about through an extensive irrigation project such as this.  (2) Good capability in irrigation design and construction can be developed in a relatively short time through formal training programs (mostly short-term) and extensive hands-on experience.  (3) Privatization of irrigation design, construction, and supply industries can be promoted through an extensive project.  (4) Credit cannot be made available through the private banking system if farmers do not have titles to their land.","Evaluation Summary: PD-ABJ-523","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","9/1/1993 12:00:00 AM","","Irrigated farming|Agricultural extension|Agricultural credit|Irrigation system construction|Crop production","Honduras","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABH884.pdf","4,265 KB","007951 - Agro Engineering","","008555 - USAID.

"Evaluates a subgrant from the National Cooperative Business Association (NCBA) to the Rwandan Cooperative Training and Research Center (IWACU).  Evaluation covers the period 1989-11/93. IWACU has had a positive impact on co-ops, although variables such as weather and agricultural prices make it difficult to quantify.  By helping them prepare business plans, brokering access to credit, and providing management training, IWACU has helped co-ops to increase revenues and has contributed to their sustainability.  Moreover, co-op members have gained experience in the democratic process and enhanced their credibility in the community; women, who account for 30% of IWACU's participants, have benefitted through greater earnings, more interaction with other women, greater confidence to speak out in the community, and access to credit otherwise unavailable.  Also, in helping co-ops, IWACU has promoted private sector development and stimulated new business. IWACU is not financially self-sufficient, and it would be unfair to expect it to become so any time soon, given that its very mandate is to work with groups which cannot afford to pay for professional services and which need outside funding. NCBA has provided a variety of short-term TA, including computer training, pedagogical training, and general advice on grant and monitoring issues, which IWACU staff found to be useful.  NCBA should have done more, however, to shore up IWACU's training and follow-up programs, as these constitute IWACU's principal services to co-ops, and to help IWACU develop an effective training methodology. Lessons learned included the following.  (1) Progressively withdrawing TA from an indigenous organization such as IWACU is a good strategy as long as the organization has the fundamental skills it needs to run its programs; until then, TA should be provided.  (2) USAID's hands-off policy regarding grants is understandable.  It is important, however, that the local implementing agency have someone available for discussing program issues.  (3) Excessive compartmentalization of units detracts from the continuity of operations and integration of activities. (4) Training should emphasize applicable, real-world topics, rather than theory.  (5) Program outputs should be designed to encourage implementation in the field, not just tabulate numbers of people trained.","Delivery order no. 18|Project title: Implementing policy change (IPC)","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-5451-I-00-1026-00","","12/1/1993 12:00:00 AM","","Cooperatives|Management training|Training centers|Agricultural cooperatives|Institution building","Rwanda","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABH887.pdf","1,404 KB","001335 - Chemonics International Consulting Div.","","008598 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (9/82-12/92) to promote the role of the private sector in Tunisia's economy and increase the rate of return on completed or nearly completed A.I.D. projects. During its first phase (1982-88), the project undertook a number of small, demand-driven interventions (e.g., seminars, studies, trips abroad, short-term training and TA) that were not very focused or coherent, and which imposed a high administrative burden.  In 1988 the project was redesigned to focus on three issues:  privatization, capital markets development, and trade liberalization. Overall, the project achieved its objectives.  Training has increased the capacity of Government of Tunisia (GOT) personnel to conduct policy analysis and draft action plans, and policy dialogue with the GOT on privatization has helped in the implementation of liberalization policies.  Some of the changes that have taken place over the project's life have been striking. Exports have been virtually freed from licensing, and several initiatives have been undertaken to encourage exports; price controls have become less extensive; state-owned enterprises are being sold (albeit not at the rate or of the type anticipated); investment approval procedures have been centralized and streamlined; tax laws on expatriates have been modified; the Stock Exchange is viable, even though it is smaller than had been hoped.  The Tunisian-American Chamber of Commerce is serving the business community; U.S. businesses -- mostly recently, Sara Lee -- are seeing the value of doing business in Tunisia; and the environment for foreign investment has improved.  With these developments towards a market economy, Tunisia is ready for even more changes. The project yielded a fine harvest of lessons learned.  (1) When commitment to a relatively new concept such as private sector development is weak, a target of opportunity approach makes sense -- but has high administrative costs.  (2) Activities implemented directly with or through the private sector tend to advance more rapidly than those involving public organizations.  (3) Use of multiple implementing mechanisms reduces the risks associated with employing a single contractor, but greatly increases administrative complexity.  (4) Lack of publicity can facilitate initial privatization transactions, but in the long run harms the program by increasing the suspicions of labor, the private sector, and the general public about the government's motives. (5) Given the reluctance of most privately owned businesses to open their capital to outsiders, the government can be a prime force in developing financial markets by widely distributing public share offerings of state-owned firms.  (6) Tunisia views European technology as having originated in the United States and therefore finds efforts to increase direct access to U.S. technology attractive.  (7) USAID regulations effectively preclude the possibility of a direct grant to a newly formed local organization, complicating the task of creating such organizations. (8) It is difficult to reconcile the interests of local and U.S. members of a Tunisian-American business organization; the former focus on identifying new markets and sources of inputs in the United State, the latter on problems with local administration.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1993 12:00:00 AM","","Private sector|Market economy|Privatization|Capital markets|Trade liberalization|Investment environment|Technology transfer","Tunisia|USA","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABH888.pdf","2,122 KB","008616 - USAID.

"PACR of project (8/81-9/92) to provide U.S. training for Tunisian science and engineering students. The project has achieved its purpose and has increased the pool of highly skilled individuals able to help Tunisia develop a competitive market economy.  Preliminary indications are that its impact on the economy, in particular the private sector, has been positive.  Thanks to dialogue with the private and public sectors, project training was provided in appropriate fields. Also, in contrast to earlier reports that a U.S. degree was considered a handicap in finding a job in Tunisia, the Tunisian business community has found that U.S. graduates possess important leadership qualities and the potential to hold key positions as managers and directors. However, only 60% of participant trainees have returned to Tunisia, a fact that has had some impact on Government of Tunisia (GOT) thinking on its financing of overseas scholarship programs. The GOT has instituted schemes to recover the costs of educating non-returnees and now requires all overseas students to promise in writing to return to Tunisia and work at least 10 years. The goal of influencing GOT personnel planning was not achieved; the GOT has never been motivated in this area.  Also, efforts to establish links between U.S. and Tunisian technical institutions ended in 1986 when the allotted portion of the budget ran out; as a result, Tunisian curricula were not upgraded, and the country remains dependent on overseas education.  Lack of degree equivalence is another problem -- the GOT has not kept its promises to resolve this issue -- and a major contributing factor to the non-return of Ph.D.s. Despite the low return rate, in recent years the likelihood of returned trainees remaining in Tunisia to work after visa stipulations are met is rather high in contrast to 12 years ago. Thus, at least in the short-term, the newly acquired skills are being applied to GOT development.  In addition, the GOT is quick to point out that Tunisians working outside the country will probably return eventually and are already sending money or gifts home to relatives and in this way contributing to the economy. The following lessons were learned.  (1) Funding of back-to-back degrees should be avoided.  It is extremely difficult to reintegrate into Tunisia students who have been absent 8-10 years, having left at age 18.  (2) Restriction of extensions is imperative if students are to return home quickly.  The longer students are provided security through scholarships, the less likely they are to be prepared to face the job market.  (3) The liberal policy of allowing students to return home for summer break was costly because it precluded attendance at summer school, kept students from participating in short courses or internships that could enhance their employment chances, and diluted the pain of separation from family and friends and weakened the incentive to return to Tunisia promptly after finishing their degree.  (4) Re-entry counseling and job placement services by AMIDEAST contributed greatly to the number of students returning and finding work.  (5) Use of the Fixed Amount Reimbursement (FAR) method to finance scholarships caused USAID/T to lose control of the project because it did not provide an accurate way to measure the time needed for degree completion; using PIO/Ps would have been better.  (6) It is essential to have an in-country counterpart to ensure smooth running of the project.  In 1989, when the GOT began implementing the project through a Washington, D.C., office, the project became quite time-consuming.  Even when, at USAID insistence, a counterpart in Tunis was named, that person could make no decision without clearance from Washington, causing constant delays in the submission of reports to the point where USAID was at times literally forced to make tuition payments just to keep students enrolled.  (7) The GOT's liberal policy of supporting students through as many as three university degrees is disguised welfare and contributes to the creation of an intellectual cadre ill-prepared for the realities of occupational life.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1993 12:00:00 AM","","Education for development|Personnel development|Participants|Science education|Engineering education|Brain drain","Tunisia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABH890.pdf","666 KB","008616 - USAID.

"Four years after the completion of A.I.D.'s Combatting Childhood Communicable Diseases project in Rwanda, a team of health professionals evaluated the project's sustainability, assessing over 50 indicators on the basis of six criteria:  (1) perceived effectiveness; (2) integration and institutional strengthening; (3) local financing, community participation, and private sector provision of services; (4) training; (5) constituency building; and (6) local ownership.  It was found that there is a strong national commitment to continue project activities, and that the activities are well integrated into public and private health structures.  It was unanimous among Ministry of Health (MOH) staff and participating donors that the project was needed and effective and that it achieved most of its objectives.  On a scale of 0 to 3, Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) and Training/Supervision were judged to be the most sustained of the project's seven support strategies and interventions, with a score of 3 (permanent activity with improved quality), while diarrheal disease control and health education rated a 2 (permanent activity with maintenance of quality), and malaria control and health information systems a 1 (permanent activity with a decline in quality).  Only operations research rated a 0 (it was not sustained).  Lessons learned included the following.  (1) Many public sector health professionals are leaving for the more rewarding private sector, thus jeopardizing sustainability. (2) Priority programs like EPI -- which has the highest status in the MOH and is the most organized -- perform better at all levels. (3) Health personnel motivation, e.g., financial incentives, is essential to program success and sustainability. Unfortunately, these incentives, currently being paid by UNICEF and the World Bank, will end with the phase-out of their projects.","Project title: Africa child survival initiative-Combatting|childhood communicable diseases (ACSI-CCCD)","Special Evaluation","Documents","AOT-0421-C-00-2163-00","","5/1/1993 12:00:00 AM","","Child survival activities|Disease prevention and control|Child health care|Project sustainability","Rwanda","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNABQ752.pdf","2,434 KB","006404 - Atlantic Resources Corp.","","006899 - USAID.

"PACR on a project (4/87-6/92) to support commercial production of nontraditional crops in the Dominican Republic.  The project's three components -- Commercial Farming Systems, Rural Financial Services, and Bridge Credit Fund -- were implemented, respectively, by the Agricultural Development Foundation (ADF), the Central Bank's Rural Financial Services Office, and Banco de Reservas (instead of FIDE, as originally planned). The project made progress under each component.  (1) Under the Commercial Farming Systems component, ADF made 15 research grants, implemented 12 rapid response TA consultancies for agribusinesses and farmers, provided extensive technical training, and established an information center, which responds to production inquiries and distributes research findings.  An Endowment Fund was capitalized at more than twice the peso level originally sought.  (2) Though implemented during a severe banking crisis, the Rural Financial Services component strengthened BAGRICOLA, which has mobilized over RD$180 million in deposits from 150,000 rural clients, and decreased its reliance on subsidized agricultural credit, so that a large portion of its lending operations are now conducted at market rates of interest. In addition, TA and training provided to 14 rural credit unions were instrumental in increasing deposits from RD$7.6 million to RD$59.5 million for the period; over 22,000 primarily middle- and lower-income credit union members received access to financial services.  (3) Under the third component, the Bridge Credit Fund was established with $10 million in A.I.D. loan and grant funds and a counterpart contribution of $2.5 million.  While only 8 of 37 planned agribusinesses participated in the Fund, they extended loans to 12,713 small and medium-scale outgrowers (vs. a targeted 6,000), suggesting that credit went out in smaller units and reached further down the economic scale than expected. The following lessons were learned.  (1) In the ADF component, sponsorship was an important element of success.  This component enjoyed strong support in technical, business, and political circles, and as a result, gained recognition and a continuous flow of private cash donations.  The component -- which was designed by its intended beneficiaries -- also teaches the value of self-interest in project design; it reflected a real demand and there was continuing interest in its activities and offerings. (2) The Rural Financial Services component demonstrated that weak financial intermediaries are a major obstacle to the flow of financial resources to rural areas.  The success of BAGRICOLA and the rural credit unions demonstrates that the rural economy generates ample domestic savings, and these can be mobilized in a cost-effective manner by different types of financial intermediaries. The institutional development of financial intermediaries is best achieved through TA and training in savings mobilization; external credit, besides being unnecessary, tends to undermine the financial viability of intermediary institutions.  However, prudential external supervision of financial intermediaries is critical.  The component also taught that modest pilot projects in the field can have an impact on the decisions of policymakers.  (3) The Bridge Credit component built on an informal financing scheme already set up by agribusinesses and farmers. The component's success demonstrates that added investment in an ongoing venture may offer a greater development return than an innovative start-up exercise.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","2/1/1993 12:00:00 AM","","Commercial farming|Agribusiness|Crop diversification|Crop production|Nontraditional exports|Banks|Institution building|Financial institutions|Agricultural credit","Dominican Republic","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABH935.pdf","1,558 KB","008537 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of a project to strengthen the Hassan II Agronomic Institute (IAV) in Morocco.  The project was implemented by the University of Minnesota.  Evaluation covers the period 1988-93. IAV has become one of the most sound scientific and technological institutes for agriculture and rural development in the developing world.  Between 1988 and 1993, an additional 80 faculty at IAV, and its two sister schools, the National Agricultural School (ENA), and the National School for Forestry Engineers (ENFI) completed their doctoral studies, increasing the number of U.S.-trained doctoral-level faculty working within Morocco by 150%.  IAV also enhanced its long-established reputation as a fine research institute through a significant number of contract research activities by faculty members, primarily in the areas of animal science and crop science.  In addition, IAV faculty participated in the Small Ruminant Collaborative Research Support Project (CRSP) and in a number of other collaborative research projects in the United States, Europe, and Africa.  For example, the Institute hosts an International Irrigation Center in collaboration with the University of Utah, and the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization has involved IAV faculty in more than 40 consultancies covering a range of disciplines. Project sustainability remains the outstanding issue.  The assistance IAV has received from USAID and other major donors over many years has protected it from the dynamics of the environment in which it exists, and in which it must now function independently.  To ensure sustainability IAV will have to make several institutional improvements, including curriculum reforms and the development of research and development agendas, administrative functions, management information systems, organizational structures, accountability, leadership, incentives, and strategic planning.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","11/1/1993 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural colleges|Agricultural education|Institution building|Agricultural research","Morocco","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABH941.pdf","2,782 KB","003970 - Management Systems International, Inc.

"Mid-term evaluation of a project to institutionalize ivermectin delivery within Nigeria's local public health care system.  The evaluation covers the period 8/91-9/93. The project has made satisfactory progress in strengthening the capacity of the government health services to provide cost-effective and sustainable delivery of ivermectin.  Adequate numbers and categories of field staff have been trained at both the local and state government levels.  In two of the three local government areas (LGAs) visited by the evaluation team, policy makers appear to have adopted the program as their own responsibility; during the second year of the project they dedicated sufficient management capacity to address most of the administrative needs and sufficient funds to pay for at least 75% of the running costs of distribution.  The third LGA, however, has failed to adequately support ivermectin distribution activities despite an abundance of resources. Although the state governments express support for the project, the State Ministries of Health (SMOH), particularly the Taraba SMOH, appear to have made inadequate progress toward assuming management responsibility or responsibility for paying for the field expenses of the State Onchocerciasis Control Unit (SOCU). Rapid assessment (nodule palpation and blindness) surveys were carried out by local government health workers trained and supervised by SMOH staff.  Epidemiological assessment has been completed in all 16 of the LGAs of Adamawa State, but in only three in Taraba State. Based upon the rapid assessment data, it appears that in addition to the three LGAs that which have already benefited from ivermectin distribution, Adamawa State has two more LGAs that are in need of distribution services.  The epidemiological surveys have confirmed that the public health impact of river blindness in parts of these two states is significantly greater than in most other areas with endemic onchocerciasis.  In the 100 communities rapidly assessed during the first year of the project, an average of 15% of the men were blind. Under these circumstances, treatment of onchocerciasis should be and has become a leading public health priority in selected parts of Adamawa and Taraba States. During the first 12 months of distribution (3/92-2/93), ivermectin was distributed to 84,300 people, covering all targeted LGAs.  By the 19th month, the project had exceeded the End-of-Project objective for ivermectin distribution.  Based on enumeration carried out by the project itself, 86% of eligible persons in the target communities were treated during the first round of distribution.  The second round of distribution began in May 1993 and was about half completed at the time of the evaluation; an estimated 80% of the eligible persons in the targeted communities have been treated.

"Evaluates collaborative research support program (CRSP) in pond dynamics and aquaculture.  External evaluation covers the period 9/88-8/93. The CRSP has been marked by considerable change, some impressive achievements, and new initiatives.  The most notable change has been a shift in focus from a study of tilapia production at the El Carao station in northern Honduras to a study of the problems constraining the development of the shrimp industry in brackish water ponds in southern Honduras.  Significant changes have also occurred in Rwanda, where studies were delayed, relocated, or temporarily abandoned early on due to political unrest in the North, and the termination of the remarkably successful tenure of the U.S. research associate.  However, research prospects improved in early 1993 when political crisis eased, the research associate was replaced, and resident, host country staff were able very successfully to implement the project as planned. Thailand continues to be a model project.  Research and the production of scientific literature have been of high quality; educational and outreach elements have been remarkable; and the project's role in Southeast Asia has expanded.  The region could serve as springboard for further aquaculture research in Laos, Vietnam, and Cambodia. The University of California, Davis, has continued to develop several pond dynamics models, which are now in use.  These have clarified general understanding of such sensitive parameters and/or relationships as primary production, sensitivities of phytoplankton to light, interrelationships between temperature and dissolved oxygen, and the effects of turbidity and depth on pond productivity.  Oregon State University (OSU) continues to translate project field research findings into pond management guidelines for global use.  One of the guidelines, which governs the fertilization of aquaculture ponds, is considered a landmark development in the science of fishpond management. A recent development of major significance has been the addition, after lengthy negotiations with representatives of Egypt's National Agriculture Research Project, of a new temperate site into the CRSP. The effort will include studies on polyculture, bioconversion, and biotechnology, and is funded under a separate contract.  Participants will include new researchers from long-time CRSP institutions such as OSU as well as a new institution (the University of Oklahoma) and a new host country entity (the Central Laboratory for Aquaculture Research, Abassa, Egypt).  A second major initiative has been the testing of CRSP models on research stations and farms in the Philippines.  This has been made possible by the 20% increase in funding provided the project in 5/91 and by matching funds from the University of Hawaii and Central Luzon State University.  Also in the Philippines, cooperation with the International Center for Living Aquatic Resources Management (ICLARM) appears to hold opportunities, especially in regard to stock testing of improved tilapia strains. In summary, the CRSP is exceptional for several reasons:  (1) its faithful adherence to the original CRSP concept; (2) its application of a global experiment utilizing U.S. and foreign inputs to strengthen the knowledge base; and (3) its potential to contribute to a new form of agriculture that uses underutilized sources in an environmentally sound way to produce food, income, and employment. The project's most serious constraint is a grossly inadequate level of funding.

"Although the Ivory Coast's program to decentralize governance to the level of municipalities or communes is the broadest and most sustained in Francophone Africa, it faces a number of problems which need to be addressed both within the country and by supportive donors such as USAID.  This report presents a detailed review of Ivorian decentralization, concluding with recommendations for USAID.  After an opening review of the program's history, four case studies of the structure and functions of governance at the commune level are presented, along with a description of the role of central government agencies. An ensuing analysis of the financial situation in Ivorian communes (a particularly important issue in light of the 1992 Finance Law which reduced tax allocations to communes, along with the central government's lack of liquidity) discusses ways to make the use of existing resources more efficient and to generate new resources.  It is recommended that USAID support government efforts to sustain and strengthen the communes as institutions of local democracy.  In regard to resource mobilization, this will mean considering support for a wide range of projects in both the short term (e.g., a simplified property tax, substitution of unskilled labor for capital intensive equipment in garbage collection and other areas) and the medium and long terms (e.g., decentralization of tax authority, improved administration of real estate and business taxes, encouragement of professional and artisanal associations).  Collaboration with other donors and local NGOS in these efforts is urged, and stress is laid on the continuing importance of training commune officials and elected councilors in basic administrative functions.","Executive summary: PN-ABQ-746|Delivery order no. 4","Special Evaluation","Documents","PCE-1008-I-00-2064-00","","10/1/1993 12:00:00 AM","","Public administration|Communes|Cities and towns|Financial management|Revenues|Decentralization|Municipal level","Ivory Coast","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNABR133.pdf","5,128 KB","006381 - Abt Associates, Inc.","","004517 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to ensure minimum environmental management for selected sites in Latin America and the Caribbean.  The project has been implemented by The Nature Conservancy (TNC), NGOs, and local government environmental organizations (GOs). Interim evaluation covers the period 9/90-10/93. The project is meeting its objectives -- permanent patrolling and protection activities have been established to protect 14 million acres in 22 parks and reserves in Belize, Bolivia, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominica, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Guatemala, Mexico, Panama, Paraguay, and Peru, and activities have been initiated at 3 other sites. Activities have included construction or improvement of existing ranger posts, provision of field equipment and transportation for rangers, development of communications systems, and demarcation of 1,214 km of boundaries.  Expansion in the number of sites is recommended in order to allow more NGOs and GOs to participate in the project. The project has provided increasingly greater amounts of training for field personnel in topics including natural resources, personnel, protected management, and community relations.  This has included on-site training and basic instruction for park rangers; a conservation training week in the Dominican Republic for approximately 300 participants; and a wildlands management course for protected areas specialists.  Institutional cooperation among GOs, NGOs, TNC, and A.I.D. Missions has improved; GOs and NGOs have increased their number of project coordinators and improved their planning, administrative, logistical, and resource management skills.  In addition, linkages between NGOs and GOs and local communities have been strengthened; NGOs have employed local people as rangers and extension agents, and local communities support NGO and GO park staff through assistance in park patrolling, environmental education, and regulation enforcement. The project has conducted environmental threat analyses at 19 sites, and further biological and socioeconomic studies are underway at these sites.  Baseline data collected by the project is managed, in part, by local Conservation Data Centers. Efforts have begun at 12 sites to develop long-term financial mechanisms.  Financial evaluations of Amboro National Park, Noel Kempff National Park, Corcovado National Park, and Darien Biosphere Reserve have been initiated.  In general, the project's reporting formats and procedures have been evolving, but still need some improvement. The project has suffered a number of deficiencies.  Too little emphasis has been placed on compatible human uses in buffer zones. Community participation in the most critical resource management decisions has been limited.  Local management capacity has been hindered by low salaries and morale, high turnover and inadequate numbers of park rangers, limited training opportunities, and differing interpretations by GOs and NGOs about their respective roles (e.g., at times they have been delinquent in delivering resources).  Close to half of the sites operate under the limitation of annual management plans.  Where long-term financial plans have been developed there have been some delays in the disbursement of funds provided through commercial debt-for-nature swaps.  Inaccessibility, supply and labor transport, inclement weather, and poor security have hampered field presence in key site areas.  Finally, in-country politics, unstable economic conditions, and unclear natural resource policies have slowed implementation at some sites.  In some cases, insufficient attention is being give to environmental issues and land tenure conflicts.  Includes individual reports on the 22 protected sties.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","LAC-0782-A-00-0047-00","","10/1/1993 12:00:00 AM","","Biological diversity|Protected environmental areas|Environmental management|Environmental protection","Latin America|Caribbean","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABI166.pdf","19.529 KB","007244 - The Nature Conservancy (TNC)","","000114 - USAID.

"Evaluates program/project to improve primary education in Mali. Mid-term evaluation covers the period 8/89-12/93. The project has contributed positively to primary education in Mali in many ways, including basic in-service training of nearly 7,000 primary school teachers and all regional directors and inspectors; renovation of more than 400 classrooms; increased girls' participation rates in the project's zone of intervention; improved collecting, processing, and analysis of basic school data; institution of a standardized national testing capacity and broader monitoring and evaluation competencies; nationwide distribution of reading texts for grades one and two; and overall planning and management improvement in targeted divisions of the Ministry of Education (MOE). Despite these considerable successes, it is difficult to conclude that the project has had a systemic or lasting impact on schooling in Mali.  This is due in part to design and implementation flaws, but more to contextual circumstances, associated with the start-up and USAID's management and with the social and political changes and turmoil experienced by Mali over the past 3 years.  Moreover, 4 years of implementation are hardly enough to resolve a problem as entrenched and pervasive as that of education in Mali. The challenge now is to exploit the strengths of the project so as to ensure their further evolution and lasting nature.  The project has shown that if sufficient resources and quality technical support are provided, dedicated, qualified personnel within the Ministry will respond.  But how does this process of improvement continue without the sort of resources ($20 million) provided by the project?  Neither the monitoring and evaluation, the in-service training, nor the girls' schooling activities will be able to maintain even close to their present levels of activity without continued donor support. Project experience has indicated that the following factors inhibited achievement of the project's purpose:  (1) design of the project as a discrete set of strategies (modeled after the World Bank's Fourth Education Project) rather than a systemic approach; (2) constrained communication and cooperation between USAID and the MOE, as well between different units within the MOE and even to a degree between different components of the project -- a situation exacerbated by the changing roster of MOE officials; (3) inability to move beyond rhetoric to implementation in achieving USAID's and the Ministry's regionalization objective; (4) apparent disjuncture between the project and the MOE's education reform objectives, and a lack of strong MOE involvement in the project, a situation again exacerbated by changes in key officials and the country's volatile sociopolitical context; and (5) USAID's focus on its part of the World Bank Fourth Education Project, rather than on a broader systemic national education reform strategy articulated by the government.","French ed.: PD-ABI-171","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","12/1/1993 12:00:00 AM","","Educational reform|Primary education|Basic education|Educational goals","Mali","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABI170.pdf","11,184 KB","008014 - Education Development Center, Inc.

"PACR of a program -- a Housing Guaranty (HG) loan and TA grant to the Central Savings and Loan Bank for Housing (CACEN) -- to expand the capacity of Bolivia's private sector to provide low-cost housing.  PACR covers the period 9/83-9/92. Although the HG loan was not implemented in 1983 as scheduled, due to political problems and the country's economic crisis, the grant portion began on time.  The program had mixed results in achieving its quantitative targets.  It achieved a Savings and Loan (S&L) portfolio of $106 million, which exceeded the target of $96 million set for 1991; however, the number of loans disbursed was only 45% of the targeted 9,500.  In addition, the S&L Mutuals' market share did not reach its target of 13%, controlling only 10.9% of the savings market. HG loans were mostly in accord with set criteria.  However, 20% of the families receiving loans had monthly incomes that exceeded the upper limit set by the program.  Further, CACEN was forced to slow its disbursements of loans to Mutuals because of their lack of compliance with the safe ratio established in their loan agreements.  The ratio between the Mutuals' loan portfolio generated under the project and their debts to CACEN has fallen well below that set in the agreements. CACEN's problems first arose when two large Mutuals in La Paz refused to join in a consolidated S&L system, and in fact, actively worked to de-stabilize CACEN.  (It appears that wounds resulting from many years of a top-down approach on the part of CACEN were too deep to forget.) Another problem arose when a new Minister of Urban Affairs developed plans to expand the role of the Fondo Nacional de Vivienda (FONVI).  He proposed that FONVI, created to concentrate public funds for housing and complement the financing efforts of S&Ls, totally replace CACEN.  His decree precludes CACEN from continuing its loans to Mutuals.  Even greater problems developed when CACEN and some of the Mutuals agreed to act as intermediaries for loans for agriculture and agroindustry.  This was done without adequate analysis, and many of the loans were politically related.  These loans contributed to the technical bankruptcy of CACEN and some of the Mutuals. Despite its problems, Bolivia's S&L system was strengthened in its capacity to provide financing for low-cost shelter. According to CACEN, the system has financed 95,113 housing loans for $306 million since its inception in 1950.  In addition, FONVI has captured millions of dollars each year for housing finance. Nevertheless, this success should not minimize the serious problems remaining within the S&L system -- in its current state, the system is not financially self-sufficient. Lessons learned from this program are as follows.  (1) Many financial programs fall prey to the illusion that finance programs for the poor are social programs not financial ones.  In this program, CACEN, through its noble intentions, opened at least four Mutuals in areas that can barely support a bank, much less an institution focusing only on housing.  Support of such institutions which are financially inviable adversely affects the entire system as well as the social cause.  This may be the fate of Bolivia's S&L system.  (2) CACEN's supervisory powers were never adequately exercised.  CACEN was not able to function as both promoter and supervisor of the S&L system.  USAID programs should have independent supervision.  (3) Institutions managing USAID programs should be strong and technically competent.  Early evaluations of CACEN revealed serious problems; however, CACEN failed to implement recommendations for improvement.  Continued USAID support of CACEN should have been tied to satisfactory adherence to the recommendations. (4) Programs such as this should be monitored by USAID staff who maintain permanent residence in-country.  The final 2 years were managed only with the assistance of a short-term advisor who visited Bolivia for four or five days a month.  This resulted in insufficient coverage and continuity.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","9/1/1993 12:00:00 AM","","Housing investment guaranty|Low cost housing|Savings and loan associations|Credit cooperatives|Institution building|Private enterprises","Bolivia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABI175.pdf","678 KB","008515 - USAID.

"Evaluates project component to strengthen the capacity of Egypt's Ministry of Public Works and Water Resources (MPWWR) to plan and implement a rehabilitation/modernization program in 11 canal command areas covering 337,000 feddans.  The evaluation covers the period 1987-11/93. The project is making satisfactory progress.  Implementation was delayed until 1989 because key personnel had to be replaced during the first year.  Since 1991, the project has gradually gained momentum and is now accelerating, although not all planned outputs will be in place in each command area by the PACD. To date, the project has created 7 Directorates and 2 Inspectorates, which are equipped with computers and office equipment, laboratories, transportation facilities, and trained personnel.  Equipment for construction activities is in place and 36 mesqa improvement contracts covering 52,000 feddans and 26 main delivery system improvement contracts are in progress. While these efforts have not yet had a quantifiable impact on crop yields, they have given farmers the water resource security they need to select more high-yielding crops. Although institution building is still incomplete, the project has made significant progress in establishing a capacity within MPWWR to carry on project work after the PACD.  Specifically, the project has trained engineers at the command levels; developed the Irrigation Advisory Service (IAS), which has conducted 17 feasibility studies; facilitated the evolution of a network of construction firms; and developed a technique for training and promoting Water User Associations (WUAs).  The commodity procurement plan, which had overstated needs, has been revised and substantial savings have occurred as a result. The project has suffered from the following deficiencies. While irrigation system designs are generally appropriate, mesqas have been improved using mobile pumps, a strategy which is not always up to good design standards.  Construction activities need to be more closely supervised and coordinated.  Because implementation of downstream control structures to introduce continuous flow was delayed, many completed mesqas are now getting by on rotational delivery.  What most hinders the project's sustainability and MPWWR's institutional capacity is that the WUAs are still awaiting legislative approval and the cost recovery issue has not yet been resolved despite several attempts to do so. The following lessons were learned.  (1) It is important to consider the ensemble of a project's outputs -- not just physical outputs -- when deciding whether or not the project has met its goals.  In the present case, while the number of mesqas installed and feddans improved has been low, the project has improved water control and delivery systems and created the potential for environmental amelioration.  (2) The project's attempt to develop procedures to rehabilitate irrigation systems and increase crop yields requires an organization capable of managing the effort.  The creation of an authority might be an improvement, but its political and financial implications need further study.  (3) The project was well-planned; its major constraints have been lack of shared understanding among MPWWR, A.I.D., and the TA contractor.  Disputes related to implementation and financing should be settled during the negotiation phase.  (4) Interministerial coordination and cooperation are difficult to achieve; grant awards should be conditioned on positive policy decisions within projects that require a multidisciplinary approach.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","11/1/1993 12:00:00 AM","","Irrigated farming|Irrigation system construction","Egypt","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABI207.pdf","6,673 KB","006434 - Devres, Inc.","","008539 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to expand the delivery of family planning (FP) services by Haitian PVOs.  Evaluation covers the period 8/86-6/93. In general, the project has been a success.  As of 1992, there were approximately 175,000 new contraception acceptors (vs. a targeted 200,000), although the retention rate could not be measured. Thirty-three (vs. a target of 35) PVOs are providing FP services; and 31 PVOs (vs. a target of 23) are capable of providing voluntary surgical contraception.  Almost 6,000 cycles of low-dose orals are marketed monthly at over 200 commercial sales points.  The cost per couple year of protection has decreased, which demonstrates the significant returns to early investment and increased cost-efficiencies over time. In general, the quality of services provided falls within accepted averages, and it is clear that project management is placing a good deal of emphasis on improving the determinants of quality; some of these efforts are new and have not yet borne results.  Access to a full range of method choice is limited by lack of training of service providers for the more clinically oriented methods, such as IUDs and Norplant, and also, at some institutions by an insistence on conducting pelvic exams before providing hormonal contraception.  Great progress has been made in the area of education and counseling provided by nurses, auxiliaries, and community workers, but doctors are far behind in counseling skills, and client contact, from welcome, to group education, to individual counseling still needs a good deal of attention. The Port-au-Prince Field Office has made progress in the collection and analysis of service statistics.  Particularly notable is the Mystery Client activity, which provides useful feedback to participating organizations.  Contraceptive management practices (i.e., inventory, supply) have improved markedly, and previous obstacles to developing and using IEC materials have been overcome.  Project and PVO management (especially financing management and reporting) have clearly benefited from TA and training, but planning and supervision still need much attention. While the project paper did not include a cost-recovery strategy, some PVOs have initiated cost-recovery pilots, and 3 PVOs are conducting cost-recovery operations research.  Although PVOs' interest in incorporating cost into program planning has increased, no PVO at this time has devised a cost recovery strategy that would decrease dependence on the project over time. Quantitative targets for many project objectives have decreased through successive project amendments, due to the instability of Haiti's political and economic environment.  That no PVO disappeared, and that almost all PVOs maintained continuity during Haiti's periods of upheaval is impressive and can be attributed to committed staff and capable management. Numerous recommendations are made.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","6/1/1993 12:00:00 AM","","Family planning services|Private voluntary organizations|Indigenous private voluntary organizations","Haiti","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABI264.pdf","6,335 KB","008554 - USAID.

"This report provides an overview of USAID/Bolivia's food assistance programs (Titles II and III) and assesses the contributions that the programs are making to three dimensions of food security -- food availability, food access, and food utilization.  The report concludes that USAID/B's food assistance programs are having a positive and significant impact on food security in all three dimensions.  The wheat production program, for example, which has been financed with Title III local currencies, has increased Bolivia's ability to supply its wheat needs from domestic production.  The Title II municipal Food for Work program, by providing over 150,000 person-months of temporary employment in 8 cities and 22 towns in FY92, is making a contribution to household food security in areas of high poverty.  The Mission's food assistance program has also had a positive effect on improved food utilization, through the use of Title III local currencies to support the government's Expanded Program of Immunization and communicable disease programs. Recommendations are made for further refining USAID/B's food assistance and for substantiating the food security impacts of its assistance.

"Final evaluation of a project to support collaborative research by Arab and Israeli researchers into the reuse of sewage water in low technology stabilization pond systems.  The project has been implemented by the University of Michigan, Egypt's Academy of Scientific Research and Technology, and the Hebrew University in Israel.  The evaluation covers the period 4/90-4/93. Overall, the project has been a success.  The Suez Experimental Station, completed under the project's predecessor, has been well operated and maintained.  Station trials have demonstrated (with the caveats noted below) that fish and crops can be safely and efficiently grown in treated wastewater.  The Station, the only site in Egypt to systematically examine the public health aspects of such a technology, has become a sustainable asset for the Egyptian government's National Institute for Oceanography and Fisheries. Because of the project's activities (reciprocal visits between Israeli and Egyptian researchers; their joint participation in workshops and seminars and other training activities; and joint research and publication) a core group of senior researchers linked by strong professional and personal bonds has emerged in the region.  However, the political context in which the researchers have worked is intimidating; it is still an act of courage for an Egyptian researcher to become a visible participant in the project, as evidenced in the fact that only 6 of the 40 Egyptian participants have visited Israel. The following issues remain unsolved.  (1) The extreme salinity of the influent, and the much greater salinity of the pond effluent at the Suez Station, have presented practical problems for agronomic trials and leave open a number of questions regarding pond operation and wastewater reuse.  (2) Helminths are still present in the maturation pond of the treatment system and in the fishraising pond at levels that equal or exceed WHO guidelines.  (3) Viral analyses of the treated wastewater have not yet been performed, despite training provided to Egyptian scientists; such analyses are need to assure that the wastewater is acceptable for use in agriculture and aquaculture.  (4) Researchers do not know the actual retention time of wastewater; no dye tests have been performed.  (5) Israeli researchers have not solved thermal stratification problems in Israeli ponds. There may be implications for Egyptian attempts to replicate the Suez technology.  (6) The performance of the Suez pond system regarding coliforms is better than predicted, although the reasons why, necessary if the technology is to be replicated, have not yet been determined. Unfortunately, the project has been delayed in:  implementing local and national workshops to discuss the application of Suez research in Egypt; completing economic and sociological analyses on costs and benefits, changing social and cultural attitudes, and investment opportunities and risks with different wastewater re-use applications; and producing operational manuals for pond operation and monitoring, fishrearing practices, and agricultural applications.  In addition, the rate of publication by Egyptian researchers has been low.  While some of the above activities cannot be implemented until the project's near end, others such as the workshops, publications, and social and economic analysis should have been already been launched or completed.","WASH task no. 473","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","DPE-5973-Z-00-8081-00","","11/1/1993 12:00:00 AM","","Regional relationships|Wastewater|Waste recycling|Sewage treatment|Sewage stabilization ponds|Pilot projects|Research collaboration","Egypt|Israel","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABI325.pdf","3,373 KB","000333 - Camp Dresser and McKee, Inc.

"PACR of a project (1988-6/92) to help the Government of Morocco (GOM) repel desert locust invasions. The project, which was well coordinated with other donor assistance, was a success, helping the GOM to increase its daily aerial and ground control capacity from 2,000 ha/day in 1987 to 30,000 ha/day currently. As a result, Moroccan crops and livestock were protected, with no reports of serious harm to human health.  The project helped the GOM upgrade its pesticide storage facilities and equipment; acquire a well-trained cadre of experienced pilots, survey teams, radio operators, and crop protection technicians; and develop a highly effective control strategy, which was implemented through the National Locust Control Center (NLCC), to suppress locust swarms before they could cross the Anti-Atlas mountains.  The NLCC, overseen by two Moroccan ministries, ensured a well-organized array of technical capabilities unique among locust control programs in the region. In addition, the project made several significant contributions to the GOM's capacity to protect human health and monitor environmental impacts by providing pesticide workers with protective clothing, cholinesterase test kits, and training in cholinesterase testing; by training Moroccan biologists in ecotoxicological assessment and analytical chemists in pesticide residue analysis; and by installing two gas chromatographs with phosphorus-specific detectors for pesticide residue analysis. These materials and training, coupled with Morocco's already excellent health care and safety education system, reduced the number of persons treated for organophosphate poisoning from 400 in the first campaign to 23 in the second campaign.  In addition, the Denver Wildlife Research Center conducted an environmental impact study on the effects of dichlorvos (DDVP) and malathion (the two most widely used pesticides) on the fauna of Morocco. The following lessons were learned.  (1) The NLCC was successful because of its highly disciplined organizational structure.  (2) Continued functioning of a national locust control organization such as the NLCC is needed for ongoing preparedness.  (3) The use of large aircraft in relatively unpopulated and nonagricultural areas proved feasible.  (4) Future locust control projects should include funding for professional pesticide inspection services. (5) A regional approach to the prevention of locust outbreaks is essential.  (6) To avoid overstocking, pesticides should, to the extent practicable, be ordered only as needed.  (7) Pesticide management plans and cholinesterase testing kits should be included in all projects that provide pesticides. (9) Areas where pesticide spillage is likely to occur should be well-prepared to contain spills.  (10) To the extent practical, wildlife censuses should be performed prior to large control campaigns.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1993 12:00:00 AM","","Locusts|Crop pests|Pest control|Pesticides|Institution building","Morocco","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABI331.pdf","1,099 KB","008579 - USAID.

"Evaluates program to provide humanitarian assistance to Afghans in Afghanistan and in surrounding refugee camps.  Evaluation covers the period 1985-3/93. The program has been productive and effective.  However, it has been vulnerable to the environment in which it operates; to the fact that A.I.D. assistance was but one aspect of a larger, more complex U.S. Government foreign policy initiative; and to program content and operating modalities.  Because the program faced difficult field conditions and could not be implemented within traditional ranges of accountability, the U.S. Congress, from the outset, gave it special ""...notwithstanding any other law"" authority.  Though used sparingly, this authority was necessary for the Mission to do its work.  Having far-ranging authorities and an open, reactive portfolio of assistance activities made the A.I.D. program a valuable element of the U.S. effort. However, large annual expenditures and pressures from other organizations may have encouraged unnecessary cutting of corners and dilution of operational controls.  Overall, however, A.I.D. staff did an exceptional job and accomplished several important objectives under very difficult circumstances. Soviet forces departed Kabul in late 1989.  With continuing internal turmoil, the country program rationale is also changing. The Office of the Inspector General and others feel emergency measures and blanket exceptions to A.I.D. procedures have outlived their context.  The program should perhaps shift to interventions and delivery approaches that better reflect expected A.I.D. resources and the continuing risks of a country undergoing a major social transition.  A more focused portfolio and tighter AID/REP administration could possibly lower control and vulnerability problems identified in the team's report.

"Final evaluation of the Irrigation Support Project for Asia and the Near East (ISPAN), which provided TA and training to the Asia and Near East Bureau and Missions in support of irrigation projects.  The evaluation covers the period  9/86-11/93. The project has met all of its original objectives, and, as a result of the broadening of ISPAN's agenda per a mid-term evaluation to include water resource activities other than irrigation -- issues of water quality, water rights, flood control, water treatment, etc. -- has had even more impact than expected; since 11/91, the project has worked on 21 activities for A.I.D. Bureaus, supported 6 regional activities, and assisted 12 Missions in implementing 75 assignments. ISPAN has proven a flexible and responsive technical support mechanism; its performance in servicing the needs of Missions has been truly outstanding.  Senior management in all Missions visited were satisfied with ISPAN buy-ins; however, there were some complaints. Missions in Egypt, Indonesia, Pakistan were dissatisfied with the timing or quality of ISPAN reports, while USAID/Nepal and to a lesser extent USAID/Philippines were less than positive about ISPAN's ability to improve the irrigation and water sectors.  At the Bureau level, officials interviewed were unanimously enthusiastic as to the value of ISPAN and, in particular, the ISPAN Technical Support Center. Throughout its life, the project operated under funding limitations and endured frequent changes in the prime contractor's senior management.  The main casualty of the funding limitations was the project's capacity to capture A.I.D.'s experiences in the water resources sector, to synthesize valuable experiences, and to disseminate these to a broad audience; in fact, only one paper was produced under the applied studies/lessons learned component. Although the regional institutions component was largely eliminated as a formal project element, ISPAN, through its work with local groups in almost every target country, helped build local institutional capacities in a manner which was consistent with the spirit of that component; in fact, the actual arrangements produced may have been more appropriate. The evaluators do not support the general premise that only large and relatively long-term buy-ins are appropriate for centrally funded projects, pointing out that Missions frequently have a need for more flexibility than such arrangements provide. Also, ISPAN's activity in the Flood Action Plan activity in Bangladesh proved a creative exception to the normal rules for Mission buy-ins.  If USAID/B had been forced to go through the normal design or contracting processes, the needed technical support would have arrived too late to be effective. Given A.I.D.'s continuing involvement in water resource activities, the evaluators unequivocally support the development of another ISPAN-type project.  An important question is whether such a project should be regional or global.  The evaluators present arguments for both approaches but eventually recommend a global approach. Lessons learned included the following.  (1) The broadening of ISPAN's agenda to include all aspects of water resources development and conservation increased the project's utility. (2) If an ISPAN-like mechanism is to perform optimally, A.I.D. management and contracts personnel must prepared to support new approaches to novel TA situations.  (3) Field experience is more valuable than purely technical and/or general knowledge in implementing water resource projects.  (4) The ISPAN experience suggests that universities may be better suited to core-funded applied research and synthesis activities, rather than short-term consultancies, because of teaching and other contractual obligations that can limit flexibility of university scientists. Conversely, consulting firms are more appropriate for short-term consultancies.","Delivery order no. 8|Project title: Irrigation support project for Asia and the Near|East (ISPAN)","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","PDC-1406-I-00-0062-00","","11/1/1993 12:00:00 AM","","Irrigation|Agricultural water management|Technical assistance|Water management","Asia|Middle East","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABI339.pdf","3,391 KB","006900 - Agricultural Development Consultants, Inc.","","004200 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of Phase I of a project (1988-8/93 to upgrade maternal and neonatal care in developing countries (MotherCare project). The project has been implemented by John Snow, Inc. MotherCare's first phase has been marked by significant achievements in project design, health research, health policy, and dissemination of health care information.  In part, this success can be attributed to a highly skilled and committed project staff; well-planned, high-quality activities; and effective collaboration with central, bilateral, and regional projects, ministries of health, NGOs/PVOs, professional associations, universities, other donors and organizations, and the private sector. In general, the project has enhanced A.I.D.'s reputation as a global leader in maternal and neonatal health care. The project's state-of-the-art methods for project design and implementation have included (1) an integrated, 4-component demonstration and research approach that has addressed issues of improved service delivery and facilities, IEC, and health policy; (2) development of a typology for classifying geographic areas by availability of health services; (3) use of health planning tools and indicators, including situational analysis (a key to the success of MotherCare's complex demonstration projects), community auto-diagnosis, maternal and perinatal deaths case reviews, verbal autopsy, and an assessment of the maternal care system; (4) activities addressing the needs of expectant mothers from the home, to the medical center, to the hospital; (5) sustainable, community-based, development activities in isolated conditions with limited resources; (6) a comprehensive approach to training traditional birth attendants; (7) capacity building activities for local universities and research agencies; and (8) promotion of local ownership through involvement of key stakeholders in project planning, design, and implementation. Major research activities have included:  (1) the Kangaroo Mother Method study in Ecuador, which proved that babies that remained longer in hospitals became less seriously ill and were less likely to return to the hospital after being discharged; (2) community-based distribution of iron-folate tablets in Indramayu, Indonesia, which increased the treatment's acceptance; (3) a study in Probolinggo, Indonesia, which proved that slow-release iron capsules can raise hemoglobin levels in anemic pregnant women; and (4) an IEC enhanced syphilis treatment campaign in Nairobi, Kenya, which raised the treatment level of seropositive women from 9% to 85%, and to 52% in their partners. The project's long-term demonstration projects have lain midway on the continuum between advocacy and policy formulation, the most advanced of these being the Uganda Life-Saving Skills activity, which has led the Ministry of Health to allocate funds for upgrading midwives' skills, using a MotherCare training model.  Indonesia, Guatemala, Bolivia, and Bangladesh also plan to adopt MotherCare training models. Finally, MotherCare core and field staff have written extensively; publications include a working paper series, journal articles, a newsletter, training manuals, guides, and conference proceedings. Where the project's performance has been less successful than expected, blame could be placed on limitations in staff size, financial resources, interest by host countries and A.I.D. Missions, and time.  In some instances, other A.I.D. centrally funded projects were already addressing maternal and neonatal care. It is recommended that during Phase II, the project:  ""scale up"" (e.g., geographically or in terms of target populations) successful Phase I activities; focus on maternal nutrition and neonatal health and nutrition; emphasize research on barriers to health care, including transportation, costs, and relationships with health care providers; and maintain its integrated, 4-component approach. The following were among the lessons learned.  (1) Development of a warm respectful environment in birth centers can be achieved by sensitizing health care providers to the needs and concerns of center users.  This, in turn, can increase center use.  For example, in a health clinic in Cochabamba, Bolivia, women were provided with a private room to discuss family planning; as a result, the local contraceptive prevalence rates were raised. (2) While the project has used various approaches to health service delivery based on local needs, its basic tenets have remained the same and are appropriate for maternity care around the world.  (3) Because few women in the Third World use child delivery facilities, interventions should focus on educating women about labor and delivery danger signs and how to seek appropriate medical treatment.  (4) Good referral systems include not only treatment protocols but also community workers who can assess danger signs, clearly established lines of referral for each danger sign, 2-way radios that can speed referral between health centers and hospitals, and reliable, emergency transportation.  (5) Medical worker supervision and follow-up are paramount.  (6) It is important to balance market and with epidemiological research to ensure a comprehensive picture of a community's needs.  (7) The project's Technical Advisory Group (TAG) meetings, attended by principal investigators and counterparts from field projects, can be useful model for other centrally funded projects. The project also taught lessons regarding administration and contracting:  communication between A.I.D. and the contractor is critical; the number of contractually required documents should be carefully reviewed and all reporting simplified; there are no financial savings in an administratively understaffed report; while buy-ins have facilitated some of MotherCare's work, they are in general cumbersome.","Project title: Food security and nutrition monitoring (IMPACT)","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","PDC-5110-I-00-0087-07|PDC-5110-I-00-0087-00","","8/1/1993 12:00:00 AM","","Maternal health care|Infant health care|Health care planning","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABI342.pdf","4,086 KB","000981 - Pragma Corp.","","006943 - USAID.

"In July 1992 the Zambian government created the Zambia Privatization Agency (ZPA) to facilitate and manage the privatization of 50 state-owned enterprises (SOEs).  This report, which is designed to help the ZPA fulfill its mission, synthesizes 12 lessons learned from case studies of privatization worldwide.  (1) Systems for selecting and classifying SOEs for privatization should facilitate their quick sale, restructure, or liquidation.  (2) Different types of companies will require different privatization strategies; therefore, a diverse privatization portfolio should be maintained.  (3) Financial markets, even where they are unsophisticated, should be used to mobilize local resources.  (4) Clear and transparent criteria should be established to determine the value of SOEs and the disposal of assets.  (5) Legal, regulatory, and policy frameworks should be modified so that they facilitate privatization. Privatization is more effective when it is part of a broader macroeconomic reform program aimed at improving the business operating environment.  (6) Local ownership should be encouraged through various techniques, such as employee stock ownership plans, share allotment schemes, incentives for small share purchases, voucher systems, and the use of extensive publicity and promotion.  (7) Opposition to privatization should be anticipated and strategies developed to overcome it.  (8) Environmental liabilities should be settled before privatization through environmental audits and by determining those responsible for the cost of clean-up.  (9) Social safety nets (e.g., severance pay, job-search assistance and training) should be provided to workers affected by labor retrenchment.  (10) An investment-friendly environment should be cultivated to attract foreign investors.  (11) High-potential buyers should be identified through investor searches.  (12) The development of technical skills in valuation, investment finance, negotiations, and legal reform is vital to the sustainability of privatization programs.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","DPE-0016-Q-00-1002-00","","8/1/1993 12:00:00 AM","","Privatization|Parastatals|Privatization techniques","Zambia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNABR541.pdf","7,165 KB","002851 - SRI International|007433 - Price Waterhouse","","007005 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (1984-12/90) to improve maternal/child health care (MCH) in Central America and Panama by promoting the use of oral rehydration therapy (ORT), growth monitoring, and appropriate feeding practices during illness.  The project was implemented by the Nutrition Institute for Central America and Panama (INCAP). The project was a success and contributed greatly to improved MCH in the region.  Specifically, INCAP:  (1) facilitated, in collaboration with WHO/PAHO and UNICEF, national agencies, and the private sector, the development of effective national MCH programs, and supported diagnostic studies and applied research; (2) strengthened MCH delivery systems by promoting use of WHO/PAHO's methodology for system evaluation, conducting research on specific child survival subjects, and helping to establish sentinel surveillance systems and MCH management information systems; (3) improved MCH skills by participating in educational and networking activities of the UNICEF-WHO/PAHO-supported Regional Training Project for MCH personnel, helping to establish educational reference centers in key training hospitals and to establish regional education units and special health and nutrition units, collaborating with Ministries of Health in developing child survival training modules, and producing educational materials for community members and volunteer health personnel; (4) increased the dissemination of scientific and technical MCH information by publishing the bimonthly bulletin Progress in Child Survival (ASI), developing three distance learning programs for MCH providers, distributing packets of MCH technical materials on a quarterly basis as well as packets of reference materials for 80 national and regional seminars, and responding to hundreds of individual and institutional requests through its information clearinghouse; (5) provided quality control services for oral rehydration salts to all member countries; (6) supported basic research on risks of perinatal, neonatal, and maternal mortality in Guatemala, applied research on dietary management of diarrhea and the causes of persistent diarrhea, and operations research on diarrhea, growth monitoring, and appropriate feeding practices; and (7) helped El Salvador to control Vitamin A deficiency by fortifying sugar with Retinol Palmitate. The project strengthened INCAP's technical cooperation capacity in MCH in the region, and in 1991 an INCAP professional responsible for such cooperation was assigned to each participating country.  In addition, the decentralized process of TA delivery supported by the project has continued at the country level through formation of technical groups that support local health systems.  This development is particularly noticeable in Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras. The following lessons were learned.  (1) While interinstitutional coordination between donors and implementing agencies at regional and national levels slows project implementation and is time-consuming and expensive, it conserves resources over the long term.  (2) INCAP's effectiveness is contingent on the willingness of beneficiaries to adopt technologies as they are introduced; at times, the project's effectiveness was limited by host countries' lack of follow-through, limited resources, and high turnover of top-level officials.  These realities must be taken into account if INCAP is to provide effective TA.  (3) INCAP staff and their counterparts are limited more by management deficiencies than by technical deficiencies.  Training in both areas is necessary.  (4) A country- or even locality-based approach to problemsolving is required to complement regional programs.  The latter are useful when there are gains due to economies of scale (e.g., in certain kinds of training, equipment-intensive analyses, and basic research).  However, country or local action is needed to effectively respond to variations in conditions, capabilities, interests, etc.  (5) Multicenter studies can be effective means by which to transfer technology while checking applicability under different conditions. However, multicenter studies require close supervision and frequent follow-up, which are more time-consuming and expensive than isolated studies.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","10/1/1993 12:00:00 AM","","Regional development|Oral rehydration therapy|Child nutrition|Child survival activities|Growth monitoring|Maternal child health care","Central America|Panama","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABI413.pdf","400 KB","002290 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (FY85-10/93) to improve the effectiveness of food assistance activities in Central America and Panama by establishing national coordination mechanisms and by upgrading the capacities  of the Nutrition Institute of Central America and Panama (INCAP) and of national public and private agencies. Despite a delayed start-up, inadequate host government and agency commitment, and shifts in U.S. policy, the project produced nearly all of its planned outputs as well as some that were unplanned.  In the planning and coordination component, nearly all of the regional meetings, workshops, and task forces were held.  In the training and information component, targets for TA to INCAP were met or surpassed, while under the research component, most planned studies and assessments were carried out. Unplanned outputs included the development of food security strategies or policies in five countries, institutional assessments, special studies and evaluations on maternal/child health and targeted consumer subsidy programs, the development of a methodology for conducting operations research methodology at the strategic level, surveys of the nutritional impact of structural adjustment, and improved methodologies for studying food consumption. As a result of the project, INCAP has become the provider of choice for governments needing food program TA.  It has broadened its contacts with international food and nutrition improvement efforts, begun building a reputation outside of the region, and demonstrated to those involved in food aid programs the value of interorganizational cooperation.  In addition, government officials have increased their awareness of developmental role of food aid, and technical food aid staff in all participating countries have improved their food aid management skills. The following lessons were learned.  (1) The levels of commitment among the government, donor, and implementing agency are not always equal but should be kept high if food aid technical support projects are to meet their goals.  (2) Long-term advisors should begin working as soon as possible after project start-up if they are to develop the trust needed to be included completely in project activities.  (3) Flexibility is critical when working with a resource such as food aid, which can be used in so many ways, and within a dynamic political and social environment.  (4) When food programs are not implemented as designed, it is preferable to carry out process evaluations and improve the programs accordingly than to carry out impact evaluations.  (5) The focused multidisciplinary project team approach to implementation is dynamic and highly productive for this kind of project.  (6) Video documentaries, filmstrips, and slide shows on food programs are a major support to advocacy and training programs. (7) A balance between country and regional approaches for specific activities enhances the effects of a project such as this.  (8) Ultimately, food aid programs will become effective only when they are operated effectively at the community level.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","10/1/1993 12:00:00 AM","","Food aid programs|Technical assistance|Institution building|Research centers","Central America|Panama","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABI518.pdf","1,306 KB","002290 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (1/85-6/93) to increase tax revenues, especially from sales and income tax, in Ecuador, and to strengthen the capabilities of the General Directorate of Revenues (GDR). Little progress was made during the first 3 years due to a delay in the reorganization of the GDR and the Government of Ecuador's (GOE) refusal to provide duty-free customs clearance for project commodities. However, the new GOE administration which took office in 8/88 responded positively to USAID/E's request for a recommitment to the project by initiating a rapid series of procedural changes; resolving the customs clearance problem; honoring a project obligation to add 20 collection agents to the GDR; passing legislation to expand the tax base, simplify tax collection procedures, and facilitate tax payment through the private banking system; and, finally, passing a comprehensive tax reform law. Despite these achievements, a final external evaluation showed largely negative results.  The training of over 4,600 GDR personnel yielded little, since too many individuals were trained in areas not directly usable by the GDR.  As a result, productivity failed to increase, and actually decreased in some critical areas.  The situation was exacerbated by a lack of personnel incentives and the dismissal of 30% of the trainees, many of them tax collectors, when collections began to be implemented through the private banking system.  Further, while the collections program was implemented successfully -- close to 100% of tax collection is now done through banks -- tax evasion remains high. In addition, the objective of improving the collection of delinquent accounts was not met; TA provided the data processing organization, constructive during Phase I, proved unsatisfactory during Phase II; computer equipment procured by different donors was often incompatible and is either not used or not used to capacity; and the Objective Global Assessment System created by the tax reform proved impractical and an open invitation to evasion.  The projected increase (due to increased tax revenues) in public sector investment to 10% of GDP was never achieved. The project's failures resulted from a combination of factors, including resistance to change and a lack of leadership within the GDR, deficient TA from contractors, and lack of flexibility in adjusting to changing circumstances. The following lessons were learned.  (1) Until the GOE places a high priority on tax collection and enforcement, donor funds for tax administration and reform will likely be underused.  (2) Project implementation should take place in stages, with continuation subject to successive achievements of specific goals and continuous government support.  (3) Focused training programs should be developed for key areas, but only if the GOE commits itself to increasing salaries for tax personnel.  (4) In joint ventures among donors, there should a clear delineation of respective target areas and objectives.  (5) The project should have developed, for fiscal analysis purposes, a tax computation model based on disaggregated information from tax returns. Such a model is badly needed in Ecuador.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","12/1/1993 12:00:00 AM","","Public administration|Revenues|Tax collection|Institution building|Government departments","Ecuador","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABI521.pdf","157 KB","008538 - USAID.

"PACR of a commodity import program (CIP -- 1984-92) to provide balance of payment support to the Government of Pakistan (GOP) and to contribute to energy production and energy conservation related to the GOP's Sixth Five-Year Plan. The CIP has been a success.  Equipment and commodities worth $97.2 million were procured for 9 public agencies and 26 private businesses operating in all major energy subsectors (e.g,. energy conservation, fuel conversion, power sector, coal mining and processing, renewable energy, and oil and gas exploration); and short-term equipment operation and maintenance training was provided to approximately 110 GOP officials.  Public sector demand for commodities was very high from the beginning, private sector demand less so, though it increased after the rate of interest was reduced from 14% to 11% and the repayment period increased from 3 to 5 years.  Despite occasional bottlenecks, GOP cooperation with program implementation was remarkably good. Public enterprises that received assistance included the Water and Power Development Authority, Karachi Electric Supply Corporation, the Oil and Gas Development Corporation, the Geological Survey of Pakistan, the Pakistan Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, Hydrocarbon Development Institute of Pakistan, Pakistan Council of Appropriate Technology, Pakistan Mineral Development Corporation, and the Directorate General of New and Renewable Energy Resources. The program greatly benefited the Pakistani people.  For example, refurbishment of thermal, gas, and steam power stations increased the electricity supply.  Oil and gas exploration led to discoveries in Punjab and Baluchistan provinces.  Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) stations were established in Karachi, Islamabad, and Lahore (CNG is an alternative to vehicle gasoline and three times cheaper); nearly 1,200 vehicles have converted to CNG systems, and the GOP has announced plans to commercialize CNG conversion.  In addition, the country's research capacity in coal and petroleum development has been increased. The following lessons were learned.  (1) Public institutions are likely to become unrealistically acquisitive when requesting equipment; frequently, GOP agencies requested unnecessarily sophisticated equipment that required extensive user training. Equipment requests should be thoroughly screened.  (2) CIPs should include more accountability and training than was included in this program.  (3) Recipient agencies spent too much time preparing and finalizing technical specifications, evaluating bids, and awarding contracts.  TA is essential to ensure timely preparation of error-free bid packages and realistic equipment requests.  (4) Earlier private sector participation would have been encouraged had funds been more accessible, interest rates lower, and had there been an extended payback period on capital goods.  (5) Successful marketing of U.S. equipment in Pakistan requires the availability of spare parts and sale services, as well as competitive prices.  (6) Public sector purchasing agencies should provide clear delivery instructions to their equipment suppliers; on several occasions equipment was delivered to the wrong location.  (7) Purchasing agencies should not pay vendors for equipment without certifying that the order is complete; in some instances, time and energy was wasted in locating supplies that were missing from an order.  (8) Counterpart agencies should be familiarized with auditing processes.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","9/1/1993 12:00:00 AM","","Commodity import programs|Energy resource development|Public enterprises|Private sector|Equipment","Pakistan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABI522.pdf","422 KB","008588 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to upgrade family health care in Burkina Faso through subprojects to improve maternal and child health, strengthen the planning capacity of the Ministry of Health (MOH), and improve health financing.  The evaluation covers the first two subprojects; the third, which had a late start-up, will be reviewed later.  Mid-term evaluation covers the period 1990-11/93. Overall, the project has performed well and met most mid-term objectives despite a complex administrative structure and a high rate of organizational change within the MOH.  The Government of Burkina Faso has adopted a multi-pronged approach to family planning (FP) service delivery.  Subproject 1, child survival and maternal health, has evidenced complementarity among its component activities (FP, nutrition, diarrheal disease control, and condom social marketing).  There has been functional integration at the level of service delivery.  Only condom social marketing remains somewhat out of the loop as it is oriented toward the private sector; nevertheless its activities have been coordinated with the MOH.  Contraceptives are now offered through the public sector, the private sector, social marketing, and -- on an experimental basis -- community-based delivery.  In this manner, the country has rethought its health delivery system, which, traditionally focused on providing medical services rather than on preventive care. National health service delivery norms have incorporated project-generated training materials, curricula, policy and standards, protocols, and IEC materials.  The MOH has participated fully in project planning and implementation, and is committed to achieving the project's goals, particularly those for FP and maternal/child health.  According to the Demographic and Health Survey (1992-93), the contraceptive prevalence rate among women in union is 7.9% (with 4.2% using modern methods) versus 1% in 1987.  Finally, the social marketing program has helped define a product image and market niche for contraceptive products and has resulted in the rapid infusion of condoms into the private sector; however, much still needs to be done to raise awareness of condoms as a protective measure against pregnancy and disease. Subproject 3, strengthening health planning, has provided support to the Directorate for Studies and Planning (DEP) to increase its planning capabilities and its budget from non-USAID sources.  DEP is now involved in all planning and evaluation functions of the MOH.  However, it needs to improve the quality of its documentation and make better use of the annual donor coordination conference. The following lessons were learned.  (1) The MOH's acceptance of project activities as integral to its own goals has ensured common training, service provision, and quality targets throughout the country, notwithstanding variations in donor support.  (2) Integration of diverse activities of several subprojects can be a sensible strategy when working with limited human resource capacity and infrastructure constraints, especially when efforts are made to ensure acceptance and adoption project outputs by all participants.  (3) The design of a bilateral project as a compilation of activities supported by different contractors and cooperating agencies fostered some trade-offs.  While efficiencies were realized at the outset in preparing only single set of A.I.D. project documents and in continuing work begun by centrally funded projects, subsequent demands on USAID and MOH personnel were heavy as they had to prepare separate subcontracts for each activity and work with consultants from different organizations.  (4) The presence of local technical counsellors and easy access by regional contractor staff ensured routine monitoring of progress, reducing the need for A.I.D. to directly intervene in project activities.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","11/1/1993 12:00:00 AM","","Family health care|Family planning services|Institution building|Maternal child health care|Health care planning","Burkina Faso","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABI545.pdf","2,304 KB","006434 - Devres, Inc.","","008520 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (9/82-9/91) to provide protected habitats for wildlife displaced by agricultural development and human settlements under the Accelerated Mahaweli Program in Sri Lanka. Despite security problems at Maduro Oya Park and the Government of Sri Lanka's (GSL) initial difficulties in implementation, the project was reasonably successful in meeting its objectives and contributed substantially to the development of a national park program in Sri Lanka.  Exceptional progress was made towards establishing seven protected areas, totaling some 250,000 ha or nearly 45% of the lower Mahaweli Basin and representing 30% of the area under wildlife conservation in the country.  About 90% of planned construction was completed, including buildings for park administration, training and education, research, and staff housing.  These buildings support the nationwide conservation efforts of the Department of Wildlife Conservation (DWLC). The DWLC used GSL funds to establish a Training, Research, Education, and Extension (TREE) center at Randenigala, one of six such centers to be established nationwide. Upgrading of the DWLC was achieved via task-oriented workshops by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and via overseas training/study tours for 66 persons.  The DWLC now has a comprehensive staff development and training plan, along with an in-house training capability.  In 11/92, the DWLC initiated a program at its Wildlife Training Center at Giritale to train mid-level staff in ecology and park management; 30 wildlife range assistants and 150 wildlife guards have been trained.  The DWLC also added 8 new professional and 128 new support personnel to its staff, and it became fully decentralized as of 12/31/91. Further strengthening of the DWLC is expected under the Natural Resources and Environmental Policy Project. In the research component, the DWLC collaborated with university researchers on four projects on protected area management problems.  The DWLC also established a link with the University of Peradeniya; as a result, five additional research topics are being worked on at the Victoria-Randenigala-Rantembe nature reserve. The project helped to formalize the need to manage protected areas scientifically and promoted recognition of contributions that protected areas make to conservation, sustainable development, and socioeconomic development.  Project parks were planned and managed not only for water and soil conservation, but for tourism and rural development opportunities.  The project also was the first attempt in Sri Lanka to manage protected areas not as isolated units but as components of a single conservation unit. Today, cluster management of protected areas is being advocated under a proposed DWLC 5-year investment program with the UNDP. One of the most significant actions of the project was the development of a Sustainability Action Plan to ensure the continuance of project activities.  After development of the Plan, A.I.D. assisted the GSL in establishing a Wildlife Trust to support TA, fundraising, and innovative public-private approaches to sustaining wildlife resources. The Trust provides the first opportunity for a collaboration between Sri Lankan wildlife conservation efforts and the private sector. Expectations for the project were overly ambitious given the inadequate technical, institutional and financial capabilities of the DWLC at project start-up.  The first 2 years should have been devoted to improving the the technical capabilities rather than actually implementing park development and construction, as was the case.  DWLC experienced great difficulty in getting buildings and boundary surveys completed in the initial years, and was not able to adequately manage the parks after they were surveyed and legally defined.  It was only in the last 2 or 3 years, after DWLC enhanced its staff capabilities, that many of the benefits of the project actually emerged. At the same time, execution of the project from the beginning by the DWLC (despite its deficiencies) would have created a better sense of ownership of the project.  As it was, implementation of the project by a unit of the Ministry of State in isolation from the DWLC created an antagonism which lingers despite the integration of the two offices in 1990.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","7/1/1993 12:00:00 AM","","Integrated regional development|Wildlife resources|Natural resource management|Natural resource conservation|Protected wildlife areas","Sri Lanka","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABI558.pdf","877 KB","008606 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (8/87-12/92) to help the Government of Sri Lanka (GOSL) to complete the tertiary irrigation system, roads, and settlements on the left bank of System B of the Mahaweli Basin, primarily Zone 4A.  The project was implemented by the Mahaweli Engineering and Construction Agency (MECA), an agency under the Mahaweli Authority of Sri Lanka. Implementation was seriously curtailed by terrorist activities which resulted in the death of several MECA staff members, contractor personnel, and farmers.  As a result, construction targets were cut in half in 1990 with the removal of Blocks 402, 403, and the northern part of 401 from work plans and the restriction of efforts to Blocks 404, 405, and the southern half of 401.  Despite ongoing security problems, the revised targets were largely met.  In all, the construction of 55 km of distributary canals, 128 km of field canals, 126 km of turnout drains, 23 km of market roads and 80 km of hamlet roads, and 1 area and 8 hamlet settlement centers (no towns or village centers were constructed), along with the clearing of 2,625 ha of jungle and 1,780 ha of on-farm development (no farm-level drainage canals were built) led to the settlement of 2,000 farmer families and 600 non-farmer families in Zone 4A. In a technical innovation, project personnel developed a revised toe drain filter design for tank embankments which reduced construction costs while improving functioning.  Also, use of detailed soil information greatly facilitated the layout design and construction of irrigation project facilities, and eliminated rock outcrops and shallow soils on farm plots. A significant project achievement was a revised land use plan which deviated significantly from the conventional land use method used in the Mahaweli Agriculture and Rural Development Project.  The revised plan increased homestead size from 0.2-0.4 ha to 0.5-1.0 acre and thus increased settler incomes; included high-intensity surveys, which minimized design-related construction adjustments and reduced land leveling costs; utilized down-the-slope designs for farm plots, which made the division of quality land among farmers more equitable and reduced drainage problems; and, where possible, allowed the use of operation and maintenance (O&M) roads as farm-to-market roads in order to reduce land requirements and construction costs. The project also fostered the development of farmer organizations in Zone 4A; O&M of field canals has already been transferred to these groups.  Additionally, the Mahaweli Economic Agency plans to transfer O&M of distributary canals to farmer organizations. Training included in-country workshops, seminars, lectures, and on-the-job training of MECA staff (including training in computer-assisted design of tertiary irrigation systems and farm plots), and four overseas training tours for MECA engineers in investigative, design, construction, and administrative skills. Construction of the tertiary irrigation system and the settlement program in Block 401 are being continued by the GOSL.  Since the PACD, some 20 km of distributary and field canals have been completed and 150 farm families settled in an accelerated resettlement program. Improvements in the main outlets of the drainage system in Zone 4A, recommended in the revised land use plan as a remedy for imperfectly drained soils, remain incomplete.  Though MECA has placed a high priority on this effort, security remains a major constraint.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","7/1/1993 12:00:00 AM","","Irrigated farming|Irrigation system construction|Water supply structures|Agricultural land settlement|Road construction|Terrorism","Sri Lanka","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABI559.pdf","846 KB","008606 - USAID.

"PACR of a subproject (9/86-9/93) to promote environmentally sound development of the Southeast Peninsula of St. Kitts. The project was a success.  Primary achievements included creation of a Land Development and Conservation Board (LDCB); adoption of land use management plans (for erosion control and sediment reduction, wildlife/endangered species, beaches and dunes, marine resources, parks and protected areas, and reforestation) and of land development guidelines; enactment of a National Conservation and Environment Protection Act and a Special Development Area Tax Act; construction of a 6-mile access road; and installation of electricity, water, and telephone services.  The LDCB has approved 6 development plans, most of them submitted by hotel and resort developers; a beach bar and grill, a dive shop, and a general shop have been constructed and are operating. Tax revenues have been used for road maintenance and other conservation services, and the project has already generated employment, including that from beach vending. The project has also succeeded in raising the environmental awareness of the people in St. Kitts and Nevis to an unprecedented level, resulting in the formation of a national association that monitors and lobbies for environmental protection and that has already prevented one developer from degrading the peninsula's ecosystem.  Finally, the project has become a case study that is used by environmental educators throughout the Eastern Caribbean. The following lessons were learned.  (1) Despite the project's concern about the environmental impact of development, there were insufficient funds to examine the engineering design of the road, which had the potential to affect the environment more than any other project activity.  Once road construction was started, it was discovered that the substrata predictions were completely wrong, and the road had to be redesigned.  However, there was no time to investigate potential problems with the redesign. (2) All relevant personnel should be involved in the project from the design stage.  In this project, not only was the environmental monitor not involved in project design, but the environmental firm involved in designing the project was not the same one chosen to monitor construction.  (3) The project's timeframe seems to have been chosen arbitrarily.  Enough time was not allowed, for example, to help the LDCB implement the environmental protection program, which was only able to begin after road construction was completed.  (4) Although funds were allocated for project evaluation and financial oversight, there were no plans to ensure that regular audits, which would have been helpful to the project officer, would be carried out.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","9/1/1993 12:00:00 AM","","Regional development|Road construction|Land development|Environmental protection","Saint Kitts-Nevis","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABI677.pdf","156 KB","007707 - USAID.

"Mid-term evaluation of a project to support institutional reforms that enhance market economies and democratic processes in Eastern Europe and selected developing countries.  The project is being implemented by the University of Maryland's Institutional Reform and the Informal Sector (IRIS) Center.  The evaluation covered the period 9/90-10/93. The IRIS Center has attracted a large team of first-rate researchers who have produced generally very high quality output (as witnessed by increasing publication in refereed journals) and have placed IRIS at the forefront of the effort to expand the knowledge base on the relationship between institutions and economic growth.  Topics investigated have included, inter alia, the strategic role of institutions in economic growth, the transition from socialism to market economies, political institutions and democratic constitutions, land markets, financial institutions, fiscal policy, and retail and international trade. The Center's field programs have achieved substantial progress in Poland, Nepal, Mongolia, and, to a lesser extent, Chad.  New programs are underway in India, Madagascar, and Russia. In Poland, where evaluators were asked to focus most attention, the Center has promoted improved laws and regulations and increased international awareness of the role of institutions in economic development; outreach and dissemination efforts have been particularly effective.  The Center has promoted reform in banking collateral law, in bankruptcy law, and in intellectual property law (particularly as it affects technology commercialization). In Mongolia, the Center has conducted workshops for senior public and private sector personnel on key legal and economic issues related to the transition to a market economy, e.g., competition law.  Success seems due to the fairly large and high-quality staff assigned to the project under the terms of the Mission buy-in.  Much of the research conducted in Mongolia should be helpful in shaping future A.I.D. programs in other Southeast Asian countries. Efforts in Nepal have been impressive, though the rudimentary nature of the private sector indicates a need for substantial long-term TA.  To date, the Center has helped to reduce notably the time required for registering a new business (a major hurdle to privatization) and has provided valuable analytical support in the areas of company law; fertilizer, airline, and petroleum deregulation; foreign exchange convertibility; off-shore banking; and stock market planning.  Success has been due in part to the excellent work of the long-term advisor. Also, as in Poland, the use of universities as a base has blunted the perception of inappropriate foreign government intervention in local affairs. While satisfactory, the Center's experience in Chad has lacked continuity, though this should change with the placement of a long-term advisor.  In Madagascar, the Center and the Mission have wisely decided to focus on the investment environment, including financial and banking system reform.  The success of democratization and economic liberalization in Madagascar could have significant spill-over effects in other very poor nations of southeastern, sub-Saharan Africa. In India, the Center is in the process of implementing a program to deal with the free-market developments that have taken place over the last 2 years.  The core of the program will be collaborative research conducted with a small number of Indian research institutes. In the western hemisphere, the Center appears to have had a limited impact on the democratic and economic transformations occurring in major countries, such as Mexico, Chile, Argentina, and Brazil.  Nor has it had a significant effect on democratic and economic developments in smaller and poorer countries such as Haiti, Nicaragua, and Bolivia.  In the case of the larger countries, the Center has been behind the curve of democratization and privatization.  In the case of some of the smaller countries, there have been military and political constraints, though some of these appear to be lifting.  More effort in this region is recommended. In regard to program administration, staff have been of high caliber, but the program is facing some problems in cost-effectiveness due to heavy burdens imposed by A.I.D. administrative requirements. It is recommended that A.I.D. support for the IRIS Center be extended beyond the 2 years remaining under the contract. Recommendations for the individual country programs are provided.","Evaluation summary: PD-ABI-942","Special Evaluation","Documents","PCE-0001-C-00-3018-00","","10/1/1993 12:00:00 AM","","Economic reform|Institution building|Market economy|Democratization|Universities and colleges|Economic research|Research centers","Poland|Nepal|Mongolia|Chad|India|Madagascar|Latin America","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABI793.pdf","3,079 KB","008031 - Brimmer and Co., Inc.","","007931 - USAID.

"Mid-term evaluation of a project (the SARSA II project) to support applied research on two interrelated themes:  rural-urban linkages and natural resource management (NRM).  The evaluation covers the period 1989-10/93.  The project is being implemented by Clark University (CU), Virginia Polytechnic Institute (VPI), and the Institute for Development Anthropology (IDA). Overall, the project is producing high quality research that is useful and relevant to A.I.D./W and USAID Missions.  A key indicator of this is that the project has generated more add-ons and OYB transfers than have similar cooperative agreements. However, there are many areas which require substantial improvement and/or change. Research highlights include, inter alia:  (1) the strengthening of IDA's applied anthropology capacity, which has produced many Mission add-ons and quality research -- in Tunisia on water management, in Senegal on the social and ecological effects of the Manantali Dam, in Burundi on household income strategies, and in Malawi on the estate sector; (2) IDA's work in NRM, especially in Latin America and Africa, which is helping to refine an analytical framework elucidating how political, economic, and social factors at the micro- and macro-levels affect natural resource utilization and degradation; (3) the CU/VPI Ecology, Community Organization and Gender (ECOGEN) project, which is advancing concepts of feminist political ecology; and (4) CU's work on refining the Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA) method, as well as its development of a geographic information system software package, called IDRISI, which has been well received throughout the world. IDA has performed the best in developing its own capabilities, in implementing a coherent, relevant research program, and in meeting the needs of USAID and other donors.  IDA has followed a clear trajectory in producing case studies that are then assembled, along with the work of other scholars, into synthesis documents.  CU's ability to productively interact with USAID missions and other donors is also well-developed. Through IDRISI, ECOGEN, and PRA, CU has carved itself out a useful niche, although the planned strengthening of its Department of Geography is proceeding far more slowly than expected.  VPI is struggling; its failure to develop a coherent research program, or generate any interest in the form of add-ons from Missions, or to contribute in any of the ways originally envisioned has led to its increasing isolation from the rest of the project. More generally, the project as a whole lacks intellectual focus and direction, resulting in poor collaboration/coordination among CU, VPI, and IDA.  For example, the integration of IDA's anthropological and CU's geographic perspectives has not materialized to the degree anticipated; and, with the exception of the CU/VPI ECOGEN effort, there has been no collaboration in gender-related research -- one of the project's main planned outputs.  Thus, while individuals at all three institutions seem genuinely committed to the values of sustainable development, project research appears to the work of solitary academics who are pursuing their own interests and agenda rather than collaborating to meet the needs of A.I.D. The project clearly needs better research direction to make its work more relevant and improved collaboration and integration between disciplines and institutions, and the evaluation makes recommendations to that effect.  It also strongly recommends that dissemination of research results be improved; specific recommendations are to establish a standard format for all project reports which includes informative executive summaries, and to disseminate on a wide scale summary research reports from which readers can order full reports.  Finally, funding for VPI should be limited to support of its ECOGEN researchers who have effectively collaborated with CU.","Related document: PD-ABM-830","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","11/1/1993 12:00:00 AM","","Applied research|Economic research|Systems approach|Regional development|Universities and colleges|Research organizations|Natural resource management|Rural urban linkages|Institutional linkages|Research collaboration","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABI459.pdf","3,239 KB","000362 - Clark University|000594 - Institute for Development Anthropology, Inc.|001252 - Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University","","007984 - USAID.

"Clear and measurable objectives are an important management tool, particularly in health sector programs.  This paper examines the effect of setting quantifiable objectives (e.g., increasing the percentage of fully immunized infants from 65% to 85%) on the Philippine Child Survival Program (CSP) and what can be learned from the experience.  The CSP objectives were output rather than impact indicators because the former are easier to measure and more directly related to the health system's efforts. Establishment of quantitative indicators had a positive effect on managers' collection and use of data.  For example, a new way of doing household surveys was created to measure the contraceptive prevalence rate.  On the other hand, the CSP indicators did not appear to give a common direction to staff, because they were not widely known.  The targets were infrequently used to make course corrections because baseline data were not readily available and because there were few occasions on which they were discussed by top management. The CSP experience suggests that:  (1) much time and effort are needed at the beginning of a project to establish a few easily measured, epidemiologically valid, output indicators; (2) it is important to spend the small sums of money required to establish baseline figures for the selected targets; (3) for objective targets to lend a common direction to an organization they need to be widely circulated and discussed; (4) quantitative indicators need to be measured regularly, at least annually, and preferably more often; (5) reviews of progress toward accomplishing targets should take place at all levels of the organization, starting with top management.

"Final evaluation of Phase II (1988-1993) of a project to develop U.S.-LDC trade and technology linkages (MTAP II).  The project included two components:  research and TA by the InterAmerican Management Consulting Corporation (IMCC); and sponsorship by the National Association of State Development Agencies (NASDA) of collaborative trade and investment efforts between individual U.S. states and developing countries. In general, the problems that hindered Phase I were not remedied during Phase II, which did not create new funding strategies, offer more varied and expansive projects, and/or match developing country technology and investment needs with U.S. technical services and support. In the language of sports, IMCC left the playing field after 5 years without ever having scored, and its overall performance was rated only 4 on a scale of 10 by the evaluators.  Work plans were weak, frequently changed, and rarely adhered to; there was little evidence of research or evaluation; efforts were tenuously related to project objectives; and the dissemination/network development component was a major failure. Further, IMCC contract objectives were in a constant state of flux due to the changing emphases of the S&T and PRE Bureaus (i.e., Mission buy-ins vs. commercial transactions), frequent USAID project management changes, USAID's inability to enforce the contract, and the vague nature of the contract itself, which, though amended 30 times, never included specific requirements for quantifying or highlighting achievements, thus creating a great dilemma for the evaluation team.  A particular failure was the IMCC program in Guatemala, which accounted for nearly 42% of all buy-ins. IMCC's first effort in this country -- an export promotion effort with GEXPRONT costing hundreds of thousands of USAID dollars -- yielded little that the Mission could not have accomplished by hiring a field consultant directly.  Its second effort, a forestry initiative known as INFORDE, supported a one-person project which was frustrated by personality conflicts between the individual in question and USAID/G, with no effort made by either IMCC or the Mission to correct the situation. By contrast, the NASDA program was relatively successful.  NASDA fulfilled all main objectives and almost all specific tasks of the cooperative agreement, and was particularly successful in heightening states' awareness of developing country markets and dissipating skepticism about their potential.  The Business Seed Fund yielded 40 approved projects which generated commercial activity estimated at $10 million, while also providing jobs and new investment, strengthening the private sector, introducing new technology, and improving developing countries' export potential; the Environmental Technology Fund generated 37 projects involving over 100 U.S. firms in 20 countries as well as 30 sponsoring organizations; and the Governor-Ambassador Business Development Initiative organized 15 business opportunity seminars and hosted 3 governor-led, ambassador-hosted business missions to ASEAN. However, both the Business and the Technology Funds had excessively high rates of project rejection, mainly because of an inconsistent and erratic approval system. The key lessons learned concern management.  In multi-part programs like MTAP II USAID should pinpoint management accountability at the contractor's home office, in the field, and in USAID/W.  Regular evaluations and timely, accurate, and substantial reporting are vital. Also, the size and composition of the contractor's team should be an important criteria in selecting contractors for nontraditional export promotion programs.  Programs involving agriculture and forest products, for example, require knowledge of a number of areas such as pre- and post-harvest, marketing, pricing, environment, and financing. Other lessons learned are as follows.  (1) Projects like MTAP II require better communications with USAID posts and embassies so that U.S. officials abroad can work more closely with grant recipients and more fully understand program objectives.  They also require more publicity, aggressive promotion, and flexibility.  (2) More incentives should be provided to U.S. firms and sponsors to participate in follow-up activities to develop opportunities created by MTAP.  Future efforts should be longer-term and should assure continuity.  (3) Continued USAID support for private ventures should be encouraged, although some fears and suspicions of this approach remain in USAID.","Delivery order no. 7","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","AEP-0085-I-00-3002-00","","11/1/1993 12:00:00 AM","","Business enterprises|International trade|Export promotion|Investment promotion|Networks|Joint ventures|Contractors","Guatemala|Turkey|Tunisia|Yemen|India|Thailand|Costa Rica","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABJ056.pdf","3,021 KB","000436 - Development Associates, Inc.","","007984 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (8/86-6/92) to improve the management of irrigation systems in Sri Lanka. The project was implemented by the Ministry of Lands, Irrigation and Mahaweli Development (MLIMD), Irrigation Management Division (IMD), the Irrigation Department (ID), Sheladia Associates, Inc. (SAI), and the International Irrigation Management Institute (IIMI). The project was revised to include a performance-based disbursement element to leverage major institutional and policy reforms; the project disbursed $7 million in loan funds in three tranches. The PACD was extended to 9/30/92 to accommodate workshops to institutionalize lessons learned from the project's research studies; and again, to 12/31/92, to resolve minor shortcomings in fulfilling all of the requirements under the third and final tranche. The project transformed the ID from functioning purely as a construction agency to one which works with and through Farmer Organizations (FOs); enhanced the legal status and powers of registered FOs; and turned over the tertiary irrigation systems to Distributory Canal Farmer Organizations (DCFOs) for joint operations and maintenance. However, FOs need to pursue more income-generating activities to remain financially viable and sustainable beyond the PACD. Many FOs have started such activities as fertilizer sales, marketing paddy, and assuming mortgages with great success. It is anticipated that the System Level Farmer Organizations (SLFOs) could expand and improve their activities with some outside assistance and enter into income generating activities such as rice processing, storage and marketing, and wholesaling of inputs. It is expected that A.I.D.'s new Agro Enterprises Project may assist the more commercially oriented organizations to develop such activities. The project conducted a series of Project Review Workshops designed and supported by the Training Resources Group (TRG) under the Irrigation Support Project for Asia and the Near East (ISPAN). These were very effective, and one of the key elements to project success.

"PACR of a project (8/86-12/92) to improve the management of irrigation systems in Sri Lanka. The project was implemented by the Ministry of Lands, Irrigation, and Mahaweli Development (MLIMD). The project's central and most successful element was its development of Farmer Organizations (FOs) to participate in irrigation system management; as of the PACD, 11,000 ha of irrigated areas were under joint management. Specifically, the project supported policy reforms which transformed the focus of the MLIMD's Irrigation Department from construction to working with and through FOs, enhanced the legal status and powers of the FOs, and transferred responsibility for operations and maintenance (O&amp;M)/rehabilitation of tertiary irrigation systems (e.g., distributory and field canals) to 40 Distributory Canal Farmer Organizations (DCFOs). By the PACD, a total of 800 km of canals had been maintained or rehabilitated, leading to improved water distribution and management, increased production, and a decrease in illicit irrigation water tapping and the use of slash and burn chena cultivation. Sustained O&amp;M of newly rehabilitated irrigation systems are being ensured through a joint DCFO-Irrigation Department Preventive Maintenance Program After a year of implementation, a low-cost, low-risk crop diversification program was introduced. Growing of mung beans between rice crops proved particularly successful; there was also considerable success with high-value crops such as chilies, onions, and cucumbers. Despite the mid-term evaluation, which felt that the program was beyond the project's scope, the program was continued, and replicated by farmers throughout the project area. The project generated significant economic growth. All DCFOs collect fees from their members and use these resources to generate income through agribusiness activities, undertaking canal rehabilitation contracts, and releasing mortgaged paddy fields of poorer member farmers who have mortgaged the fields and then defaulted on repayment. Additionally, improved irrigation and market access have increased agricultural production and profitability, as well as sustainable employment. In total, the project has increased annual productivity by about $4 million. Overseas training was completed as planned, augmented by a fairly large amount of in-country training in irrigation system O&amp;M, financial management, and computerized systems operations. Seven major studies and a literature review were among the achievements of the research component. Prospects for sustainability are good. FOs have the capability and authority to continue their activities, and the Government of Sri Lanka's commitment to irrigation development is clear and will ensure future funding, though at reduced levels. The project's impact has in fact already extended beyond its PACD: more FOs have been formed, training has continued, and the number of irrigated ha under joint management has almost quintupled. The following lessons were learned. (1) Measuring the impact on productivity of irrigation rehabilitation and management improvement can be difficult and unfeasible. It would require a detailed monitoring plan beginning with baseline data, as well as the analytic ability to distinguish and measure the impacts of many variables (e.g., project interventions, rainfall, pests, fertilizer prices, and civil unrest). In a similar vein, detailed site and system studies on constraints to productivity should precede design and implementation of interventions for improvement. (2) In introducing participatory management to irrigation schemes, institutional developers need to focus on building communication between engineers and farmers. (3) Institutional organizers of FOs should be recruited from the project area and have cultural and economic backgrounds similar to those of the targeted farmers. (4) Farmer representatives should be elected by secret ballot; politicization is a major threat to FOs in Sri Lanka. (5) FOs should be formed on the basis of hydrological rather than community boundaries. (6) An interdisciplinary, participatory management project for irrigation system improvement needs well-planned periodic workshops to assure integrated team planning, consensus, and implementation. (7) Since FOs were given construction contracts, their incentive was often to make a profit rather than to design cost-effective irrigation schemes. Requiring FOs to contribute a substantial portion of the rehabilitation cost for their area would encourage them to make more pragmatic decisions. (8) Trained and motivated technicians are a prerequisite to improved technology for irrigation water management. Problems using fixed amount reimbursement for irrigation rehabilitation and the project's solutions are discussed in an annex.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","9/1/1993 12:00:00 AM","","Irrigated farming|Agricultural water management|Farmer participation|Water user associations|Irrigation system construction|Crop diversification","Sri Lanka","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABJ402.pdf","17,038 KB","008606 - USAID.

"Evaluates the overall impact of USAID's participant training of Cameroonians, from the inception of USAID's program in the country in 1961 through 1993.  The training generally was provided as components of sector-focused projects; no bilateral projects were devoted solely to human resources development.  The evaluation is based on a survey of 100 former participants, case studies of several institutions, and USAID data. In all, 1,163 Cameroonians were trained in the United States (80%) or third countries, 544 in long-term programs and 619 in short-term.  All of the 100 survey respondents said that they directly benefited from training, and over 81% have introduced changes into their home institutions upon their return, primarily in the area of management, and also in upgrading training, teaching, and research skills.  Further, 60% of male participants and 50% of female participants were promoted within 3 years of completing training, although a direct correlation between USAID-supported training and professional development cannot be verified.  Over half of trainees gained fluency in English, a fact which -- given Cameroon's bilingual language policy -- will probably serve to increase the impact of their training. Most of the participants surveyed had maintained contact with professional colleagues met during training.  However, the lack of opportunities for additional training, along with poor access to information, were frustrating aspects of participants' professional lives.  Almost all participants felt their improved skills had spilled over to co-workers and family members. The fact that many long-term participants were not involved in designing their own programs seems to have lessened training impact. However, the early undergraduate programs in basic sciences and engineering resulted in the replacement of expatriates with newly skilled Cameroonians, many of whom introduced changes at key national institutions, particularly in agriculture.  Even so, their capacity to make improvements has been constrained by a lack of resources for research, field work, and training, and by personnel mismanagement, including job assignments unrelated to their qualifications, professional jealousies, and disinterest in improving work performance. Women comprised only 16% of the trainees.  While there has been no significant increase in long-term degree training for women, short-term training opportunities have improved, particularly since the regional Human Resources Development Assistance (HRDA) project began.  Women reported that training enhanced their professional standing, and generally helped to change the role of women in Cameroon.  Participant training of private sector employees has been negligible, most of it provided recently under HRDA. In general, it seems that well-designed short-term third-country training has a significant impact on trainees and their employers. However, in contrast to the experiences of graduates of earlier degree programs, returnees from short-term third-country training face obstacles such as poor employment prospects, and the limited capacity of local institutions to absorb highly trained cadres.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","11/1/1993 12:00:00 AM","","Participants|Education for development|Personnel development|Technical training|Institution building|Management development","Cameroon","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABJ512.pdf","14,636 KB","006007 - AMEX International, Inc.","","008524 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to strengthen the capacities of six Peruvian NGOs to deliver family planning (FP) services.  The evaluation covers the period 10/90-5/93.  The project is being implemented by Proyectos Informatica, Salud, Medicina, y Agricultura (PRISMA). None of the participating NGOs is either institutionally or financially independent:  PLANFAMI-Puno and ATLF have very low survival prospects, APROSAMI, INPPARES, and PROFAMILIA have reasonably good prospects, and CENPROF and PLANIFAM, probably because of their geographical location, have higher institutional prospects, but severe economic limitations.  However, all NGOs have a clear awareness of the need for growth and independence, as evidenced through their understanding of institutional vocabulary (e.g., strategic planning, costs analyses, market segmentation). Except for ATLF, the NGOs have significantly increased long-term contraceptive use among beneficiaries.  Also, all NGOs have continued community-based distribution (CBD) activities on their own despite a reduction in funds for this purpose, and all provide natural family planning (NFP) information during counseling activities.  However, NFP will not generate income, and will have to be supported by aggressive income-generating activities in both the health and non-health sectors. NGOs' attempts to expand into rural areas have been unsuccessful: because of Peru's poor economic situation, agencies that have worked with traditional campesinos have suffered net financial losses and have had to rely on financial subsidies from external sources.  Likewise, NGOs have been unsuccessful in attempting to offer their services in underutilized public health facilities alongside public health service providers.  On the one hand, health recipients were confused by the simultaneous provision of free and bought services; on the other, Ministry of health (MOH) doctors were resentful of private practitioners being paid on a fee-for-service basis. PRISMA has been effective in establishing good relationships with each of the six NGOs -- a difficult task given the heterogeneity of the group and the circumstances inherited from project's predecessor, the Private Sector Family Planning Project (5270269).  PRISMA shortcomings that will have the most effect on participating NGOs are the initial involvement in and follow-up on studies and recommendations performed by private technical consultants.  Additionally, there has been limited transfer of technology or methodology in the areas of cost analysis, marketing, and pricing (work done in the area of strategic planning was more successful).","","Special Evaluation","Documents","DPE-3056-C-00-1040-00|DPE-3056-Q-00-1041-00","","5/1/1993 12:00:00 AM","","Indigenous private voluntary organizations|Family planning promotion programs|Institution building|Project sustainability|Financial resources","Peru","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABJ700.pdf","6,619 KB","006564 - Deloitte and Touche","","008591 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (7/85-8/92) to establish a laboratory-based field epidemiology program in India. Initial progress was slow due to structural problems and bureaucratic delays, although good work was done by WHO consultants in developing a basic epidemiological curriculum, procuring laboratory equipment (including AIDS equipment), and upgrading laboratory procedures; USAID should seek where appropriate to involve WHO in future efforts, especially those involving equipment procurement.  In 1988, the project was thoroughly revised:  the field epidemiology and laboratory support components were combined into one; the management information system for malaria component was dropped; and the quality control of biologicals component eventually evolved into the Quality Control of Health Technologies project. The revised project made remarkable progress in its last 2 years, accomplishing 80% of its original objectives, most of them in a sustainable manner.  Under the aegis of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC), the field epidemiology and laboratory component created a 3-tiered (central-state-district) laboratory-based epidemiological service in the pilot States of Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh.  In addition, the process for nationwide epidemiological service was initiated, with the Indian National Institute of Communicable Diseases (NICD) as lead agency. Training provided under this component constituted the principal output of the project and included:  visits to CDC/Atlanta for 6 senior officials; short U.S. courses for 6 senior medical faculty, 16 senior epidemiology trainers, and 12 mid-level managers; and in-country training for 24 microbiologists and pathologists, 22 district health officers, 34 primary health care officers, 14 district pathologists, and 12 laboratory technicians.  In addition, 5 district health centers were established, and, together with the 2 State medical colleges and NICD, are now functioning as an integrated health laboratory service, with coordination between field epidemiologists and microbiologists/pathologists being of particular note.  Important linkages between U.S. and Indian health institutions and professionals were also established. In addition, 5 Clinical Epidemiology Units (CEUs) (vs. 3 targeted) have been established at:  All India Institute of Medical Sciences; King George Medical College; Government Medical College, Nagpur; Christian Medical College, Vellore; and Medical College, Trivandrum.  The CEUs, which have been designated as International Clinical Epidemiological Network (INCLEN) centers, are staffed with clinical epidemiologists, social scientists, and biostatisticians.  Project support included long-term U.S. training for 34 persons (vs. 45 targeted), research grants and institutional (core) support, and opportunities for exchange in international fora.  By project completion, a functioning INCLEN system with over 100 members had been organized in India. Postproject support for the INCLEN program in India has been provided through the centrally funded Data Decision Making project. The sustainability of most components is likely.  NICD has a mandate to continue the field epidemiology and laboratory support program in the 2 pilot States until 1995, and it is expected that activities will be expanded to other districts in these States. As for the CEUs, their establishment has been a milestone in the process of building Indian capacity for epidemiological research. They are expected to become centers of excellence and to serve as regional research and training centers; steps in this direction have already been taken.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1993 12:00:00 AM","","Epidemiology|Institution building|Medical laboratories|Medical schools|Health professional education|Medical equipment|Participants|States|Districts|Personnel development|Field work","India","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABJ757.pdf","1,268 KB","008557 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (1985-5/92) to establish the Investment Promotion Council (IPC) as a mechanism to coordinate public and private efforts to promote investment and export opportunities in the Dominican Republic. The project was highly successful in making the IPC into an effective agent for improving the Dominican business climate, promoting investment, and improving investor and exporter services.  IPC's technical staff are highly competent, and its administrative and financial controls are gradually approaching acceptable standards.  Even in activity areas that were only marginally responsive to the IPC initiative, e.g., customs services, heightened awareness brought about by IPC's interventions and public announcements triggered reform efforts which continue to be pressed forward by the private sector and some elements of the Government of the Dominican Republic (GODR). Specifically, IPC:  (1) received grants from the World Bank, the Governments of Japan and the Republic of China, and the UNDP for policy and administrative reform studies; (2) proposed a modification (partially implemented by the GODR) in laws affecting the operations of firms with export potential in Free Zones and elsewhere; (3) contacted about 4,000 firms and induced 150 of them to invest a total of $120 million in the Dominican Republic, resulting in the direct generation of over 28,000 jobs; and (4) arranged export contracts with a total value of $14.9 million over the life of the project, resulting in the generation of some 5,500 jobs. The project had a number of shortcomings, however.  Although the IPC had legally become a private institution, it remained dominated by government related interests and procedural norms. The administrative and financial practices of the new IPC were derived from those of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. This was not consistent with the provisions of the grant agreement, and thus caused periodic suspension of A.I.D. disbursements and consequent programmatic delays. IPC's organizational and administrative problems distracted it from its intended role.  Although it did make several sub-grants to private and public sector institutions and obtained cooperation from other private institutions for specific activities, it gradually became the sole implementing agency. Relationships with other institutions were ad hoc in nature.  A lengthy delay in obtaining long-term TA also constrained project implementation.  Ultimately, as members of the Association of Free Zones (ADOZONA) increasingly took over export promotion activities and as other, more effective institutions began addressing free market policy issues, it became apparent that IPC had outlived its usefulness and at its request the project was terminated on 5/15/92, against a PACD of 12/31/92. Lessons learned are as follows.  (1) The successful achievement of investment and employment generation objectives was due to the ability of USAID and contract personnel to accurately monitor and assess project implementation and make the necessary mid-course modifications.  (2) The degree to which accepted ways of thinking can be changed must be carefully gauged and monitored, especially where these modifications are essential to the achievement of the project purpose.  (3) USAID and local participants must recognize that prior investment does not justify continued investment in projects that are no longer able to achieve their purpose.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1993 12:00:00 AM","","Exports|Export promotion|Investment promotion|Institution building|Nontraditional exports|Trade","Dominican Republic","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABJ731.pdf","741 KB","008537 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (6/83-3/93) to develop the Government of the Dominican Republic's (GODR) capacity to support irrigated farming.  The project was implemented by the GODR's National Institute for Hydraulic Resources (INDRHI) and Utah State University. The project was a success, with most goals met or surpassed. Specifically, the project:  (1) established 12 water user associations (WUAs); (2) rehabilitated 160 km of irrigation canals (vs. a target of 306 km); (3) reclaimed 400 km of drainage canals (vs. 210); (4) leveled and increased irrigation efficiency on 2,000 ha, (vs. 1,500); (5) improved 2,300 farm ha with new drainage and 1,500 farm ha with irrigation systems, vs. targets of 1,150 and 1,150; and (6) provided 6,500 farmers with training, 75 persons with off-shore training, and 25 persons with degree training, vs. respective targets of 5,000, 40, and 26.  An unexpected result was the training of 7,500 farmers outside the project area. Despite the project's success, the Dominican Republic's weak agricultural marketing structure and deficient agricultural credit system places the goal of increasing farmer income through increased productivity in irrigated agriculture outside the project's influence. Farmers, previously reluctant to let canals be dug through their lands, became eager to cooperate with the project when they saw dramatic increases in crop production, water use efficiency, and incomes resulting from improvements in irrigation, drainage, and land structures.  The improved physical systems enabled, indeed were essential to, the next step -- encouraging farmers to organize WUAs, under which they became responsible for the operation and maintenance of their own irrigation and drainage systems.  The WUAs allowed farmers to participate in the process of democratic decision making, and some served as bases for entrepreneurial ventures. Privatization of control of the irrigation districts through the WUAs within the project area of influence was so successful that INDRHI decided to encourage the formation of WUAs throughout the country, and plans to turn all irrigation districts over to the WUAs.  INDRHI's 1993 budget should cover, after PACD, the turn-over of 29 irrigation systems comprising 26,300 ha to 7,261 farmers organized into WUAs.  These activities will be supervised by INDRHI's new National Center for Training in Irrigation and Drainage at Bani. The following lessons were learned.  (1) A top-down approach is not as effective as a bottom-up approach in developing WUAs.  (2) Motivation through clear, personal benefits was the key to eliciting farmer cooperation and to motivating farmers to invest their time and money into developing WUAs.  Similarly, the GODR's cooperation and enthusiasm were gained as soon as the project's progress became evident.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","10/1/1993 12:00:00 AM","","Irrigated farming|Irrigation system construction|Water user associations|Institution building|On farm water management|Farmer participation|Land drainage|Canals|Beneficiary count","Dominican Republic","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABJ732.pdf","455 KB","008537 - USAID.

"Special report by USAID/El Salvador on the impact of two participant training programs:  the Caribbean and Latin American Scholarship Program II (CLASP II, which began in 1990), and its predecessor, the Central American Peace Scholarship (CAPS, 1985-92) Program.  The purpose of the report is to present information (not included in a recent external evaluation, PD-ABH-061) on national-level impacts that support the Mission's strategic objectives. According to the report, the CLASP program is having an often unrecognized nationwide impact in several areas.  For example, The CLASP Program for Leaders of Primary Education (CAPS Teachers Program) resulted in the establishment of a nationwide cadre of 226 teacher trainers, who have served as an invaluable resource and have assisted in developing a new teaching methodology for grades K-6.  The program is now being used as a model for training in both Honduras and Nicaragua. The Teachers of English as a Foreign Language Program is establishing, for the first time in El Salvador, a curriculum and modern methodology for teaching English in the public school system nationwide. As a result of the program, the number of hours of English taught each week has increased from 2 to 3 in pilot areas, and certain classrooms have been designated as English language training centers. The Teachers' Program for Urban Schools with Social Problems has trained 33 teachers, directors, and supervisors from 6 urban schools in methods for coping with social problems; those trained have in turn trained more than 1,200 of their colleagues, representing 30 of the nation's most plagued urban schools.  A second urban schools program is planned. The National University Project, scheduled to begin in January 1994, will provide U.S. training to 25 of the University's planners.  A key result of this training will be a draft 5-year development plan for the University, in what is hoped will be a first step in the restructuring of the nation's higher education system. The Women's Leaders Program provided a nationwide network of field workers and managers with specialized women in development training, including an 8-week session for 80 field workers and their supervisors, and 2 weeks of U.S. training for 22 executives; training was aimed at establishing procedures for assuring that grassroots women in development (WID) concerns are addressed at the national level.  Eight national-level action committees have been established and have been active and successful in promoting WID. The Mayors' Program has provided more than half the nation's mayors with their first in-depth training in the principles of managing a democratic system of government and with firsthand experience of how this is done in the United States.  While it is difficult to attribute measurable policy-level changes to the program, there are indications that the experience has enhanced the mayors' concept of the value of the democratic system.  A second program will be held after the mayoral elections in January 1994.","Attached to PD-ABI-863","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","10/1/1993 12:00:00 AM","","Education for development|Participants|Social impact","El Salvador","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDABI863A.pdf","231 KB","008540 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (8/88-7/93) to provide family planning services, primarily contraceptive distribution, through PROFAMILIA in Costa Rica. Only condoms were procured, as other products did not receive approval for sanitary registration in Costa Rica due to marketing and legal determinations by U.S. suppliers.  All condoms procured were received and distributed.  Based on sales figures and average usage (couple years of protection), 34,750 users were estimated.  Improved program efficiency caused the average price per couple year to drop from $12.75 in 1988 to $5.37 in 1993. The contraceptive product line at the end of the project included two condoms, which were available in single condom packaging in vending machines.  However, low dose oral contraceptives were registered for sale in late 1993 and NORPLANT contraceptive implants are currently being registered.  The Copper T-380A IUD remains unregistered, since small market share does not justify the complicated and costly registration process.  PROFAMILIA is also marketing a condom product for gays, a complete kit for papanicolaou examinations, rubber gloves, infant training cups, and medical instruments. PROFAMILIA has proven to be an effective and efficient means to augment the accessibility to contraceptive products, providing a low-cost, convenient alternative to public sector services and using innovative and culturally sensitive marketing techniques to break down taboos against the use of condoms. At the purpose level, the 1992 contraceptive prevalence survey indicates the use of temporary methods increasing from 17% to 26% among women of fertile age between 1986 and 1992, with PROFAMILIA accounting for 4% of that increase. Lessons learned include the following.  (1) The primary lesson was the importance of hiring an effective manager; the second was the allowing the manager to innovate and break ground in untried terrain. (2) As a central procurement agent, A.I.D. cannot effectively deal with market needs.  This project was able to achieve self-sufficiency only because the Mission received a policy determination from the Office of Population permitting the project manager to expand the contraceptive line beyond what A.I.D. provided through in-kind donations.  The two-fold purpose of providing low-cost contraceptives and making the program self-sufficient requires a creativity, flexibility, and accountability which, while they may not exist in most countries where A.I.D. works, do exist in Costa Rica.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","12/1/1993 12:00:00 AM","","Family planning services|Contraceptive agents and devices|Commercial retail sale of contraceptives|Condoms|Social marketing","Costa Rica","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABL478.pdf","161 KB","008533 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (3/90-6/92) to assist ADIFAC, a local PVO, to improve drug abuse education at the community level in Costa Rica. The project was originally given a 6-month extension with the provision that the ADIFAC Board of Directors cease interfering in project administration.  Unfortunately, the Board reneged on its promise and on 6/4 fired both the Project Director and Deputy Director.  As a result, the Mission terminated the project agreement for cause, effective 6/15/92. Despite these problems, all targets had been met or surpassed by the original PACD of 3/92.  More than 300 ""Drugs No"" Committees averaging 7 members each were established, with 3 of the members receiving intensive training in drug abuse prevention, enabling them to serve as multiplier agents in their own communities. Project personnel and committee members also conducted courses, workshops, and conferences on drug prevention in 310 communities around the country.  These activities were attended by more than 8,500 people, mostly community leaders.  As a basis for development of sustained drug awareness projects at the community level, 24 bulletins were prepared and distributed, and an audiovisual on the ""Impact of the Project on the National Community"" was completed, but not fully edited by the time of project termination. Lessons learned include the following.  (1) There is increasing concern on the part of both the public and private sectors over the growing use of ""recreational drugs"" by the general populace, especially youth.  (2) The project was well-received because there was a real need for information, didactic materials, and training on how to prevent the use of drugs.  (3) The sudden termination of the project mid-way through the extension period had a negative effect on the work being done in communities by the ""Drugs No"" Committees.  (4) Given the constant conflicts between the Project Director and the ADIFAC Board of Directors, the project should not have been extended, especially since all the planned outputs had already been achieved by the original PACD. (5) The role of the Board of Directors of any PVO should be well-defined, in order to avoid interference of the Board members in day-to-day project management.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1993 12:00:00 AM","","Drug abuse|Drug abuse education|Community participation|Indigenous private voluntary organizations","Costa Rica","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABL479.pdf","59 KB","008533 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of a project component (1/92-6/93) to provide TA, training, equipment, and advisory services to improve district heating systems in six countries in the New Independent States (NIS). The project was successful in reaching its objectives. Achievements included:  (1) energy audits of district heating systems in nine cities; (2) provision of low-cost energy efficiency instruments demonstrating improvements in the production, distribution, and consumption of heat supplies; and (3) studies and recommendations regarding policy, regulatory, institutional, and pricing reforms needed to improve the management of district heating systems and the energy sector in general. There have been significant benefits to the district heating systems, including estimated annual savings of more than $14 million based on world market prices for fuel oil and natural gas.  In addition, by using improved combustion equipment, boiler plants have reduced carbon dioxide, sulfur, and other emissions into the atmosphere, thereby providing an environmental benefit as well. The project taught that there is great potential for transferring new energy technologies to the NIS, where technical and industrial know-how are advanced and where the escalating costs of fuel ensure demand for energy saving technologies.  The challenge is in the area of finance, both to cover the cost of a system upgrade, and the cost of start-up ventures to manufacture and distribute the necessary energy efficiency products needed in the NIS.  The success of the program suggests that USAID expand its demonstrations to other district heating sites and major industrial complexes, which are large energy consumers.  Project results should also be disseminated widely both in the United States and the NIS.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","7/1/1993 12:00:00 AM","","Heating|Energy conservation|Energy technology|Energy audits|Districts|Private sector|Policy analysis|Energy policy|Energy costs|Financing|Environmental aspects","New Independent States","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/GetDoc.axd?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MjM5NzI2&pID=NTYw&attchmnt=VHJ1ZQ==&uSesDM=False&rIdx=MjQ4NTU=","","003970 - Management Systems International, Inc.

"Evaluates child survival project being implemented in the Khulna area of Bangladesh by the World Relief Corporation (WRC) and its Bangladeshi affiliate, Christian Service Society.  The project has been operating in its original area for 69 months and in its new area for 24 months. Mid-term evaluation covers the period 1987-10/93. The project has made good progress towards meeting its year two objectives in its new area.  In both old and new project areas, over 90% of the project's objectives had been realized by September 1993 with respect to childhood immunization, diarrhea treatment, kitchen gardens, Vitamin A distribution, contraceptive use, prenatal care, training of health workers, and establishment of functioning community health committees.  In addition, the new project area has achieved over 90% of year two goals in tetanus immunization of childbearing women, and infant and child growth monitoring.  The old project area has achieved over 90% of year two goals for the formation of women's cooperatives.  The project is also distinguished by its success in income generation and its potential for sustainability. WRC needs to improve training methods, add a professional health educator to its staff, improve quality control of health information, expand income generation (including development of a sustainability strategy), increase networking with other NGO/PVOs, and avoid non-sustainable direct service activities.

"Evaluates the impact on Guinea of the African Manpower Development Program (AMDP II).  The evaluation covers the period 1982-92 and is based on interviews with 30 returned participants and 6 supervisors. The African Graduate Fellowship Program (AFGRAD), although a component of AMDP in the Project Paper, is not discussed evaluation; AFGRAD is generally considered a separate program because it is regionally funded, omitted from Country Training Plans, and implemented by the African-American Institute. Under AMDP II a total of 534 participants, most of them from public sector agencies in dire need of strengthening, were trained, either overseas or in country. The evaluators had a difficult time locating participants, who may be working in other than their targeted institutions or fields.  However, both those interviewed and their supervisors were very pleased with the quality and appropriateness of the training, and its positive impacts on their job performance. Participants strongly asserted that the training has made them more effective in their jobs; supervisors generally concurred. The skills acquired by AMDP II participants are very relevant to USAID/Guinea's current strategic goals.  The impact of the training can only increase as the public sector institutional framework (which has been undergoing a good deal of reorganization) stabilizes and when USAID/G's follow-on efforts, such as the Human Resources Development Assistance (HRDA) Project, bear fruit. The exclusion of AFGRAD from the evaluation makes the project's impact on training institutions, a major objective, difficult to measure.  AFGRAD was the more attractive program for graduate-level participants.  The number of non-AFGRAD training participants from primary training institutions, including the Universities of Conakry and Kankan, Centre National de Perfectionnement en Gestion (CNPG), Centre de Perfectionnement en Administration (CPA), the Institute of Forestry at Faranah, and the Institute of Agricultural Research at Foulayah, was severely limited.  This may be because in the 1980s many individuals went to the Soviet bloc to take advantage of the opportunities for Ph.D. level training there, and because small institutes such as CNPG and CPA had small staffs and could not afford to send many people for training at a time. The following lessons were learned.  (1) Due to the absence of a formal selection process and the ministries' practice of selecting participants, the program lacked the transparency that is now the norm for selection.  (2) Few participants or supervisors set concrete training goals, making it difficult to determine training impact; USAID should continue to require participants to articulate training expectations in cooperation with their employers, making it a prerequisite for selection.  (3) Women made up 18% of the total number of participants.  Constraints to women's participation have been given considerable attention in the design of the HRDA Project.  In-country short-term programs hold the best hope of maximizing recruitment of women.  (4) Participants and their supervisors often do not know under which project they were funded, limiting their understanding of the overall context of their training; USAID should provide summaries of project papers to participants and supervisors.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1993 12:00:00 AM","","Education for development|Participants","Guinea","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABL671.pdf","880 KB","000013 - USAID.

"PACR of a subproject (5/88-7/93) to strengthen family planning (FP) service provision by the Costa Rican Social Security Fund (CCSS). The project surpassed most of its targets.  Public sector clientele increased from 127,000 to 183,000 vs. a target of 180,000, while contraceptive prevalence among women in union increased to 74.8% vs. a goal of 70%.  Modern contraceptive methods remain at 44.6% for temporary methods vs. a goal of 50%, but sterilization rose from 17% in 1986 to 24% in 1992.  Finally, the crude birth rate dropped from 28.5 in 1988 to 25 in 1992, thereby reducing the natural growth rate to 2.1%. Specific achievements were as follows.  (1) CDSS is now procuring of its requirements for oral contraceptives, condoms, and IUDs, and the method mix was expanded in 1993 to include Depo-Provera. Sterilization remains tightly controlled and must be justified before a medical board. (2) Training emphasized training of trainers, in-service clinical training, and inclusion of practical clinical and counseling aspects in medical and nursing school academic and internship programs; a core group of medical doctors and nurses received technical training at the Johns Hopkins Program in Obstetrics and Gynecology and have subsequently prepared curricula for their universities and teaching centers.  (3) Nationwide contraceptive prevalence surveys were carried out and preliminary results were published; continued analysis will be financed under project 5150261. Patient flow analysis in clinics pointed out strengths and weaknesses in outpatient management.  (4) Mass media, print, nd video information, education, and communication (IEC) materials were developed for a variety of groups, including industrial workers, adolescents and pre-adolescents, and postpartum women. (5) Although the project management unit has dissolved, the CCSS has approved a new position to monitor reproductive health concerns within the Women's Health Program.  Training, logistics, procurement, and information programs all continue. Lessons learned include the following.  (1) The success of Costa Rica's FP programs may not be replicable because of the unique strength of the country's public health programs.  Statistics show demand is greater in the public, prepaid sector than in the significantly higher-cost private sector market.  No major NGO is involved in clinical services.  The subproject helped the CCSS to improve access to and quality of services.  (2) Rural residence, socioeconomic status, and, above all, female education are still major indicators of differences in fertility.  (3) In a country with a strong health services network and a mature FP program, transition to full domestic financing is highly desirable.  By subproject end, the program had been institutionalized as part of Costa Rica's preventive health scheme, with provision of outpatient services on a regular basis.  The fear that external entities were setting policies had been overcome.  (4) Even if services are horizontalized, there needs to be a person monitoring procurement logistics, technical standards, new product introduction, training, and information.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1993 12:00:00 AM","","Family planning services|Contraceptive distribution|Family planning education|Family planning promotion programs|Contraceptive prevalence|Contraceptive prevalence surveys|Public health care|IEC","Costa Rica","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABL778.pdf","77 KB","008533 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to support Missions in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) in the areas of basic education, vocational skills, and management and participant training (EHRTS project). Mid-term evaluation covers the period 1989-5/93. The EHRTS project is making a critical contribution to the LAC Bureau and Missions, its design evolving to support changing A.I.D. and national agendas without weakening the original intent.  To date, the project has:  (1) published comprehensive reviews of experience and practical applications for project design, implementation, and evaluation in the areas of basic education and vocational and participant training; (2) negotiated and managed 69 technical service orders (TSOs), 34 of which are buy-ins from 12 Missions; (3) participated in the formulation of a new LAC/DR/EHR vision focusing on education as an investment in human resources with an economic, political, and social impact (in contrast to A.I.D.'s previous focus on the internal efficiency of teacher training, textbook provision, and school construction activities) and used a core group of consultants to transform this vision into concrete activities; (4) developed an educational policy reform agenda, along with tools for generating national dialogue and championing support among local groups; and (5) disseminated to A.I.D. Missions publications and information packages on current educational topics, and commissioned state-of-the-art papers under the title ""Advocacy Series."" The following lessons have been learned.  (1) The goal, purpose, and objectively verifiable indicators in the logframe bear no relation to the project as implemented.  Identifying different and more appropriate indicators has been a difficult task. Indicators need to be easy to track, realistic, and related to project interventions.  (2) Working through numerous TSOs for project implementation is not only tedious, but a tremendous management burden.  In addition, the Contract Office's prohibition on using subcontractors outside the original consortium has made it difficult to fill positions with the most qualified candidates. Different contracting mechanisms need to be explored.  (3) The RSSA with the Department of Labor, while an important resource to LAC/DR/EHR and field Missions, is of less direct value to the EHRTS project and the broadness of the RSSA's scope of work may preclude its complete integration into EHRTS. Nonetheless, it is important to capture RSSA experience and incorporate it into the cross-fertilization mandate of EHRTS. (4) The important task of writing, publishing, and disseminating documents has experienced lengthy delays.  Most Missions would like more documents to share with host country counterparts, as well as more conference.  (5) The restriction on operating expense (OE) travel monies has constrained the project, precluding important marketing efforts needed at the beginning of the project and allowing only one educational officers' conference to take place.  For more extensive cross-fertilization to take place, Mission and host country personnel need fora in which to exchange experiences and lessons learned.","Contract no. listed on document as: LAC-0032-00-9036-00","Special Evaluation","Documents","AEP-0085-I-01-2060-00","","6/1/1993 12:00:00 AM","","Educational development|USAID|Development strategies|Development planning|Vocational training|Management training|Participants|Educational policy","Latin America|Caribbean","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABL830.pdf","1,252 KB","005886 - Datex, Inc.|007223 - USAID.

"Evaluates efforts of the International Foundation for Electoral Systems (IFES) to support elections in new or re-emerging democracies. Interim evaluation covers the period 9/91-8/93. IFES has provided pre-electoral assessment and technical onsite electoral assistance, electoral commodities, civic education, election observation; conducted symposia and conferences; developed an electoral resource center and data base; and produced publications.  Few other organizations perform similar services; IFES is not regionally limited like Centro de Asistencia y Promocion Electoral (CAPEL) in Central America, the closest organization to it in purpose (and also established with USAID funds), and it is less political than the National Republican Institute (IRI) or the National Democratic Institute (NDI).  Its role in providing electoral commodities is not filled by any other organization. IFES is viewed by people within USAID and others in the field from many perspectives.  Some see it as largely a passive organization that does what it is told and is politically naive. Some among these hope that IFES would initiate projects on its own. Others see IFES as an organization too often unwilling to follow Mission, USAID, or Embassy directives and therefore as not ""responsive.""  Most respondents, however, view the substantive field work of IFES as excellent.  To these observers, the primary problems in USAID's relationship with IFES lie in the management area, particularly IFES' sluggishness in meeting some of USAID's bureaucratic requirements.  These people are concerned that IFES has not responded to USAID's request to do more strategic planning and develop a longer time horizon.  Nearly everyone is bothered by the inefficiencies in the principal Cooperative Agreement between IFES and USAID, particularly its provision for ""add-ons"", which in practice has led to disappointing delays when teams had to get into the field quickly. Recommendations address these problems.

"Evaluates Energy Technology Innovation Project (ETIP), which promotes the use of clean and efficient U.S. energy technologies in the electric power sectors of developing countries.  Mid-term evaluation covers the period 8/91-11/93. ETIP is providing critical, relevant, and desired services within the defined scope of activities, and should make substantial progress in introducing innovative and environmentally benign energy technologies in the developing world, but needs to take more proactive action.  In order to make a real and sustainable change in the energy decisions of the developing world, ETIP will need to develop a comprehensive strategy with a committed long-term approach.  Bechtel has performed well and should continue to serve as contractor. Instead of actively pursuing a global strategy, ETIP has become predominantly reactive in nature, its staff and resources largely being used for quick-response activities in the New Independent States (NIS). Though these projects address critical needs, they limit the resources available for other activities.  Work in the NIS is being phased out though, as the NIS Task Force is securing its own energy contractor, and ETIP will soon move to a new phase of operation.  Neither Bechtel nor USAID officials have a clear vision of how ETIP will proceed.  It is recommended that ETIP develop a proactive strategy and focus on introducing specified changes in a limited number of countries -- particularly those which have a potentially large impact on global environmental well-being, and those that have a large and growing energy demand and are important to the United States for other foreign policy or economic reasons. Due to the time-consuming nature of NIS activities, no strategy has been implemented to encourage private sector involvement in ETIP.  Nor is there any means other than contractor goodwill to transfer lessons learned to the U.S. private sector seeking to enter new energy markets. USAID feels that there are not enough activities in the pipeline to sustain the project once NIS activities are taken over by a dedicated contractor.  Bechtel feels otherwise, but believes it is the Project Officer's responsibility to take the lead in marketing ETIP services. It is recommended that Bechtel not be reluctant to market ETIP's services.  There do in fact seem to be a number of untapped opportunities; unfortunately, there are not (and are not soon likely to be) sufficient travel funds to allow the Project Officer to promote ETIP to the Missions.  Better packaging of the project, e.g., providing Missions with a summary of ETIP's scope of work, experiences in developing countries, lists of projects completed, capabilities of subcontractors, and examples of services available. Generally, Missions are satisfied that ETIP activities have been However, in at least one case (Armenia) there was a sense that valuable funds were being used to analyze a problem that was already well understood and documented. Mission officials want greater control and interaction with the contractors working in-country on buy-in projects.  This arrangement has caused some frustration and has reduced the attractiveness of the buy-in mechanism to several Missions.  The problem can be overcome by establishing formal communication channels prior to initiation of Mission-level activities and by keeping Missions apprised of ETIP buy-in activities. ETIP has developed positive cooperative relationships with numerous organizations and institutions, including other USAID projects, the World Bank, and the Inter-American Development Bank.  Increased cooperation with trade organizations and continued exploration of cost-sharing and collaboration are recommended.","Contains draft ES [evaluation summary]|Delivery order no. 5","Special Evaluation","Documents","PCE-0001-I-00-2053-00","","11/1/1993 12:00:00 AM","","Environmental technologies|Energy technology|Technology transfer|Private sector|Marketing","New Independent States","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABM547.pdf","4,564 KB","009297 - DynCorp-Meridian|000555 - Harza Engineering Co.","","006974 - USAID.

"Evaluates subproject of the Population Policy Initiatives project to strengthen the Governors' Council of Women (GCOW) in Egypt in the areas of population and family planning (FP) and policy development.  Interim evaluation covers the period 6/90-4/93. The project has met planned outputs by establishing 11 active GCOW committees, providing training, and implementing 11 demonstration projects.  The committees are meeting numerical targets with respect to clinics established, community meetings and seminars, training of district and local women leaders, and implementation of literacy classes and women's income-generation projects.  The project has been very successful in motivating women leaders to become involved in population and FP.  Proposal preparation and planning abilities of GCOW members have been substantially strengthened, as has their capacity to lobby for and coordinate the efforts of ministries and agencies. However, the emphasis placed by GCOW committees on establishing new clinics and classes has a number of drawbacks. Some of the services duplicate those of other agencies, often within close geographic proximity.  The cost-effectiveness and sustainability of the services developed have not been appraised, and their long-term continuation presents problems.  Setting up services also takes resources away from the GCOW's broader policy, planning, and advocacy roles.  The project should be reoriented away from direct services toward coordination of other agencies. Overall, the GCOW project has been a success:  for the first time, women leaders have been systematically organized to address problems of FP and women's services.  The project has great potential to influence policies and planning related to women-in-development and population; the access of women leaders to governors has been excellent, as has their capacity to identify problems women face in acquiring services. Innovative activities to be considered include exploring ways to improve the quality of existing services, reducing FP drop-out rates, and coordinating more mobile FP outreach and services, e.g., by conducting client satisfaction surveys and reporting results to governorate decision makers and service providers.  As has been pointed out many times, the number of Egyptian women residing in underserviced areas is far smaller than the number residing close to poor quality services. GCOW training, orientation, and study tours should be designed to expose committee members to broader policy, advocacy, and quality control issues and give them the skills to deal with them.  Also, project TA, monitoring, and administrative roles need to be reorganized in order to provide GCOW committees with appropriate, non-duplicative technical and administrative support.  Mechanisms to ensure timely transfer of funds are also urgently needed.

"Evaluates a grant to the Sierra Leone Opportunities Industrialization Centers (SLOIC) to strengthen the country's micro and small enterprise sector by providing credit assistance and training in management, business development, and vocational/technical skills.  Mid-term evaluation covers the period 1989-2/93. The project, the only one of its kind in Sierra Leone, is responding to the urgent need to strengthen Sierra Leone's private sector, particularly micro and small enterprises. It is especially relevant to the Government of Sierra Leone's (GOSL) attempts to reach out to rural areas, involve more Sierra Leoneans in the development process, and thereby achieve a broader base of production capacity; four of SLOIC's five existing training programs are in Bo (2) and Makeni (2), with two additional programs being planned for Mattru Jong. SLOIC has implemented the major components outlined in the project document, but the programs are young, and it would be premature to try to assess their impact.  Moreover, the project is being implemented during a period of profound social, political, and economic instability. The situation in Sierra Leone since 1988 has negatively affected the project's target group and undermined most of the assumptions of its initial design. The project's inputs and expected benefits have become more valuable, however, as the country's financial conditions have worsened due to worldwide economic difficulties and internal problems related to the civil war in Liberia.  The resources that can be mobilized from within and outside of the country are currently limited in both time and scope. As the evaluation was concluding, the GOSL was considering closing its National Industrial Development Finance Organization (NIDFO) for reorganization; NIDFO has been the only major public institution established specifically to promote small and medium industries and assist entrepreneurs.  SLOIC has already conducted several seminars in management and business development for NIDFO's clients. PLAN International has been a major partner of SLOIC since 1989, when PLAN funded the construction of SLOIC's vocational training center in Makeni.  According to the agreement between the two PVOs, PLAN will provide for a major part of the center's equipment and operating costs until November 1994, while SLOIC will take 75% of its vocational trainees from students sponsored by PLAN.  SLOIC's training activities complement PLAN's objectives to alleviate poverty and socioeconomic inequalities while facilitating increased productivity and employment. SLOIC is also aggressively seeking UNDP support for its microenterprise development activities, particularly those expected to take place in Mattru Jong.  A proposal has been submitted to UNDP in the light of UNDP's emphasis on human resource development, training, grassroots initiatives, credit and employment in its fifth country program for Sierra Leone.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","636-0171-G-SS-8041-00","","2/1/1993 12:00:00 AM","","Private enterprises|Small scale enterprises|Microenterprises|Management training|Vocational training|Commercial credit|Economic depression","Sierra Leone","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABM829.pdf","5,792 KB","000912 - Opportunities Industrialization Centers International, Inc.","","008602 - USAID.

"Evaluates population and family planning (P/FP) assistance provided to Turkey through centrally funded Cooperating Agencies (CAs) since 1976, when bilateral assistance to Turkey ended. USAID's P/FP assistance has promoted appropriate strategies and programs in both the public and private sectors. Impact of assistance is unrelated to length of time in-country; some of the newer activities are already having major impact, while older ones are having less of an impact.  CAs' approaches have differed, with some CAs taking more of an overall systems approach than others.  The Government of Turkey values USAID assistance, especially its role in keeping P/FP a priority and in stimulating appropriate response. Although Turkey is in many ways an advanced developing country, its demographic characteristics and FP situation are more like those found in far less developed countries.  Even so, there is tremendous potential for rapid advances to meet demographic goals, due both to the extensive public and private infrastructure and to the very high demand for FP. The legal and policy framework is generally supportive of a modern FP program, but neither public nor private sector channels for FP service delivery have been adequately developed.  The quality of FP service delivery is low because of a number of interrelated factors, including inadequate pre- and in-service training, shortage of equipment and supplies, administrative limitations on services organization, personnel practices that support high staff turnover, poor or no supervision, weak logistical systems, lack of a management information system and of overall strategic or implementation plans, lack of counseling or counselors, provider bias, and lack of provider or client IEC materials. Largely as a result of these factors, client misinformation, dissatisfaction, and discontinuation of modern contraception is a major problem.  While over 70% of all married and fecund couples say they want no more children, only 42% of these couples are using an effective modern method; 40% are using an ineffective method, and 16% are not using any method. Abortion rates are so high (abortion is legal through the tenth week), that it appears many women may be using abortion as a principal means of fertility control.  At present, no FP counseling is given to women presenting for abortion. Because of Turkey's advanced socioeconomic level, opportunities for stimulating programs that will be cost-effective and sustainable are great.  Continued and intensified USAID assistance will be needed for an interim period to develop sustainable programs in both the public and private sectors; the need for USAID assistance will be greatly diminished by the year 2000.  USAID management of the program through its in-country contract employee, its CAs, and the USAID/W Turkey Working Group has been generally acceptable, but will need significant strengthening in order to carry out the recommendations in this report.

"The aim of the Home Care Project for the Elderly was to introduce new methods of health care delivery in Budapest's Eighth District.  With assistance from USAID, JDC-IDP, and the Hungarian Ministries of Health and Social Affairs, Hungarian physicians, nurses, home health workers, supervisors, and physiotherapists were trained to deliver services to the home-bound elderly. Over the two years of the project, the JDC-IDP team of experts trained a total of 38 physicians, 46 nurses, 57 home health workers, and 8 supervisors in home care service provision. Services for the home-bound were provided by multidisciplinary teams, each comprised of a physician, nurse, home health worker, and physiotherapist.  Bringing services to the homes of the elderly improved their quality of life while reducing the need for costly hospitalization.  It is estimated that the cost of hospitalization is three times that of providing services in the home. As a direct result of the project, physiotherapy was introduced as a legitimate profession.  Hungarian physiotherapists became integral members of the health care team, and dramatic improvement was evident in several of the physiotherapy patients.  The curriculum developed for this project has been incorporated into that of the Budapest School of Physiotherapy, testimony to the effectiveness of this project component. Budapest's five ""social clubs"" were turned into day centers, where higher functioning, well elderly were provided with physical, educational, recreational, and social stimulation in order to maintain and improve their health.  Before this project began, these clubs provided little else besides meals and a warm place to stay. In the fourth quarter of 1992, project activities came to a halt because of local political problems.  However, due to the commitment of the mayor and the Hungarian professionals trained through the project, home care services continued.  There are now 18 home care teams serving approximately 300 elderly, and requests are being received from other districts for these services.  A Professional Committee, consisting of accomplished professionals from each medical specialty, oversees and guides home care activities. The critical goal for the immediate future is to obtain new funding to allow additional training, the continuation of home care services, and expansion into additional areas of Budapest.  The mayor and the professionals of the Eighth District are taking steps to ensure that the important gains realized through this project continue.

"Final evaluation of a Housing Guaranty (HG) (12/82-11/93) to support the Government of Lebanon's (GOL) DL20 program, designed to help Lebanese citizens repair or reconstruct war damaged homes.  In 1992, the scope of the project was expanded to include seven infrastructure projects for improvements of sewer, water, road, and electrical systems. The DL20 program succeeded in achieving its overall objectives of assisting low-income families to repair or reconstruct dwelling damaged by the war.  A total of 9,465 loans were granted, benefitting over 13,000 families and some 65,000 people, more than half of them low-income.  Moreover, the infrastructure projects, which proved of great importance to the public at large, are located in urban residential areas in which over half of the households are low-income families.  However, the program failed to provide funds to all occupants of the 60,000 dwellings intended to be repaired, due to shortage of funds and continued hostility in the country, which did not end until 11/90.  The GOL indicated intentions to allocate funds from various non-USAID sources in order to complete the program. General findings are as follows.  (1) Application procedures were simplified to increase access for borrowers, and loan repayment conditions were favorable; quarterly repayments of the loan plus payments for shelter do not exceed 25% of family income.  (2) The establishment of regional and subregional offices increased the accessibility of the loans to the population at large and accelerated the lending process. (3) GOL management and accounting systems used for the DL20 program were sound and generally followed acceptable accounting practices; however, due to staff shortage, the loan repayments records were not current.  (4) There was confusion about the exchange rates to be used for infrastructure expenditures and hence disagreement about the total U.S. dollar amount of loan disbursement.  The GOL used exchange rates current at the time the construction contracts were issued, while USAID had stipulated that the exchange rate prevailing at the date of work completion be used.  (5) The maximum loan amount was not always sufficient to meet the requirements of individual borrowers, nor was total program funding adequate to meet national needs.  (6) The program would have benefitted by receiving TA to improve purchases of information technology, train staff, and manage the project more efficiently.  (7) Both USAID and the grantee would have benefitted if program managers submitted periodic and annual reports detailing the program's goals, activities, accomplishments, problems, and plans for the future.  (8) An interim program evaluation would have been useful to monitor the progress of the program as specified in the implementation agreement.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","11/1/1993 12:00:00 AM","","Humanitarian assistance|War recovery|War victims|Low cost housing|Building repairs|Public services|Domestic government programs|Housing investment guaranty|Financial resources|Housing credit","Lebanon","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABP046.pdf","2,595 KB","007595 - KPMG Peat Marwick","","008568 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to bring women in development (WID) concerns into the mainstream of programs and operations in Africa, mainly by placing Africa Bureau- and WID Office-supported advisors in regional offices in East, West, and southern Africa (AFWID project).  Interim evaluation covers the period 1989-9/93. The project has demonstrated the value of using regional advisors to give TA to USAID missions in developing the gender dimensions of their programs and projects, and has forged links between local women's groups and USAID mission programs.  However, there were many design and flaws that thwarted implementation. For example, those mission staff who were aware of, and presumably interested in, the project during its planning stages had been replaced by 1991 when the project was launched.  As a result, many of the missions were either unaware of or uninterested in the project's services creating a tense working environment. The project's strategy -- to focus resources on selected countries in each region -- aggravated the situation; some focus countries resisted AFWID's involvement in their mission, while other non-focus countries, which were interested in AFWID services, were not provided them.  Moreover, the advisors' job was difficult; they had a mandate which covered almost every aspect of the mission's program and had to operate within a complicated structure in which they were coordinated by the resident advisor in Washington, D.C., supervised by the regional office in Africa, and accountable to the funding WID office.  The resident advisor in Washington was hired by a local contractor (who was responsible for administering Washington-operations funds), but reported directly to the USAID project manager.  Finally, a 1991 reorganization of the Africa Bureau forced a separation between the Bureau's project management, which came from the Office of New Initiatives (ONI), and its leadership and policy guidance, which came from the Development Planning (DP) division. These structural flaws resulted in a breakdown not only of the executive (leadership) system, but also of operations, financial management, and information management.  Quality control by the regional offices has varied from one to the next; REDO/ESA has supported the regional advisor, REDO/WCA and the mission in Botswana  have not.  Other project constraints involved a high turnover in the project manager position, a financial data system that was not a good resource for information, and the fact that the project neither developed a gender information system, the intended cornerstone of the project, nor provided the short-term TA to regional advisors or missions as planned. Finally, there were disruptions within the WID office, a lack of attention from the administration in Washington to WID and gender concerns, and generally weak incentives for either bureau or mission staff to devote time to these concerns. In sum, despite some achievements, AFWID has not proven an effective means of institutionalizing WID and gender concerns within the region, although some of the functions introduced by the project -- advisors in the regions and technical and policy/advocacy assistance within the Africa bureau -- have been valuable and should be continued. The overall recommendation is that the Africa bureau phase out the AFWID project but not discontinue its support of WID activities, particularly regional advisors.","Delivery order no. 32|Contract no. listed on cover as: PDC-5832-I-0095-00","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-5832-I-00-0095-00","","9/1/1993 12:00:00 AM","","Women in development|Consultants|Gender analysis|Technical assistance|Development program planning|Development project design|Development project management|USAID|Coordinating|Attitude","Africa south of Sahara","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABP353.pdf","2,143 KB","001341 - Creative Associates International, Inc.

"Final evaluation of a child survival/Vitamin A project (10/89-9/93) implemented by World Vision in Mauritania's Assaba region.  Due to interruptions caused by the Gulf War, the APCD was extended from 3 to 4 years. At time of the extension a new component was added to integrate training efforts into the Ministry of Health's (MOH) primary health care (PHC) program. World Vision has achieved or surpassed all numeric goals related to the training of community health workers (CHWs) (45) and MOH staff (20) and the formation of community health committees (CHCs) (45).  It has surpassed its objective of promoting gardening activities in 90 villages or cooperatives, and achieved its objective of promoting breastfeeding and oral rehydration in basic health units (BHU) or ""emphasis"" villages. It has fallen just slightly short of its objective of seeing that 70% of childbearing women receive at least 2 doses of tetanus toxoid in BHU villages.  The only domain in which numerical goals have not been met is vaccination. Considering the local circumstances, the initial objective of 70% of infants being completely vaccinated before their first birthday appears to have been unrealistic. After aggressively promoting in the project's early years the distribution of Vitamin A capsules to children aged 6 months to 9 years and to mothers who had just given birth, World Vision decided to phase out these activities over the past year.  While objectives related to this activity (which was considered temporary in any case) were not evaluated for the present report, the ample evidence that promotion of Vitamin A gardening is leading to increased intake of Vitamin A-rich foods makes World Vision's decision appear sound. Above and beyond meeting most numeric targets, the project has apparently left a lasting mark on the region through its emphasis on training health workers who are actively promoting health issues in many villages around the region.  In addition, structures have been put into place that provide communities with the rudimentary capacity to confront their health problems themselves, e.g., CHCs, establishment of a fund for the continuous purchase of essential medicines.  Gardening also has become a very important activity throughout the region and this project has played an important part in its promotion.  Through its emphasis on training MOH personnel and assisting the MOH with immunization and its PHC program, the project has contributed to institution-building within the state structure. In sum, except for the lack of strong income-generating schemes, the project is/was quite competent in fulfilling its sustainability commitment. The following lessons were learned.  (1) Knowledge-based or training-based activities are often self-sustaining, as well as sustained by external sources.  The more one knows, the more one ""needs"" and wants to learn.  This may be especially true for women in the Mauritanian culture. (2) There is a strong need for careful and intense planning and for gradual phasing activities and responsibilities over to the local communities, i.e., the health committees, etc.  (3) Income-generating activities may develop from unexpected sources.  One should be prepared to seize and make the best use of these opportunities.  (4) Tribal rivalries may cause dissension within the community and lessen the effectiveness of the health committee. (5) The village committees have served as advisory councils in organizing the villages to achieve economic development and solve issues.  The contacts between the village committees and the project staff gives an exact understanding of the people's needs.  (6) Slowly but surely, a change is taking place in people's attitudes, behavior, and mentalities.  Some old medical practices (full of risks) are ending, e.g., traditional treatment of diarrhea.  (7) Supplying the villages with drugs provides access to modern medicines, saves money that would be used to transport patients to the city, and motivates people to take better care of themselves and take responsibility for their own health.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","OTR-0500-A-00-9156-00","","12/1/1993 12:00:00 AM","","Child survival activities|Institution building","Mauritania","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABP874.pdf","3,884 KB","003794 - World Vision Relief and Development, Inc.","","006982 - USAID.
