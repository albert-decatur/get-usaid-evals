"Evaluates project to increase the institutional capacity of the Centre for African Family Studies (CAFS) to provide training for family planning workers.  This evaluation focuses on two Francophone training courses - program management and communications.  Interim evaluation covers the period 1985-6/88, and is based in part on interviews with former trainees. Overall, both courses receive high ratings, especially for their relevance to trainee needs and for the valuable field practice opportunities they provide.  The communications course, however, has been criticized by former trainees with respect to lecture style, the theoretical content of certain sessions, and lack of time to fully assimilate knowledge and skills.  For the management course, it has been suggested that additional time be devoted to certain subject areas. The communications course has benefited from continuity in consultants (from Johns Hopkins and the Academy for Educational Development) and CAFS staff, as well as from the detailed guidance provided in the Project Paper.  CAFS now possesses the organizational structure, policies, procedures, and personnel needed to assume full responsibility for the course.  The management course, however -- developed by a different combination of consultants and with far less direction from the PP -- is not yet operating at the same level.  A co-trainer has not been hired, and the primary trainer needs more professional development.  A system needs assessment process has not been instituted; course material, such as case studies, has not been fully developed; and development of theoretical content has been problematic.  Development of the management course has also been hampered by deficiencies in public sector management training. CAFS has successfully developed the capacity to effectively provide for trainee transport, visas, lodging, meals, health coverage, field practice, and other support services, despite the considerable distance between the training site and CAFS headquarters.  Communication problems with USAID's and REDSO are relatively minor. Recommendations for the communications course center on lengthening the course by at least one week, improving the training process, and giving CAFS full responsibility.  For the management course, highest priority needs to be given to filling training staff vacancies and to furthering course design.  A cooperative agreement with one or more A.I.D.-supported institutions to accomplish this task should be considered. Recommendations are also made for expanding the Francophone program, providing in-country follow-ups to determine the future training and TA needs of CAFS graduates, and training graduates to replicate the CAFS programs.","Project title: Population technical assistance (POPTECH)","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Family planning occupations|Management training|Training centers|Training personnel|Family planning education","French speaking Africa|Africa","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAY648.pdf","887 KB","000673 - International Science and Technology Institute, Inc.

"In recent years A.I.D. has responded to the unpredictable, complex, and long-term nature of rural development by experimenting with alternative approaches.  This report draws general lessons from these experiments.  Discussion focuses on economically productive rather than social service activities and is restricted to factors within a donor agency's or project management's control, although methods of influencing external factors are also considered. The paper is organized according to four key project-related issues. (1) Project organization and management issues are examined, beginning with an assessment of various types of implementing organizations (i.e., government agencies, semiautonomous agencies, and private organizations).  General recommendations are presented for effectively engaging beneficiaries in management decisions, a key aspect of successful project performance and sustainability.  Management strategies are examined for addressing internal and external problems, enhancing indigenous institutional capacity, and improving financial viability.  (2) Discussed next are the two main technological issues affecting rural development projects:  (a) the acquisition and adoption of appropriate agronomic technical packages, and (b) the choice of appropriate rural infrastructure technologies.  (3) The paper then evaluates recently developed project design techniques, focusing on the factors of flexibility, size, lifespan, complexity, and integration. (4) A final section examines project monitoring and evaluation processes, which have also been revised recently to suit the realities of rural development. The report concludes by emphasizing that rural development strategies are rarely universally applicable - the key to success is the appropriateness of project approach to local contextual conditions.","Paper prepared for seminar|Seminar on Rural Development : Lessons from Experience (18-19 Feb|1988 : Paris, FR)","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Rural development|Development project design|Development project management|Development project evaluation|Development project implementation|Project sustainability|Institution building|Community participation|Agricultural technology","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAX213.pdf","86 KB","003433 - USAID.

"Between 1977 and 1987, A.I.D. funded 43 bilateral, research, and community projects in agroforestry, projects whose primary objective was to encourage farmers to grow trees using species and techniques (e.g., contour hedgerows, intercropping) that can protect and sustain topsoil, increase crop or livestock production, and, in most cases, provide wood and other products to augment income.  This study reviews A.I.D.'s agroforestry experience and identifies major issues to be addressed in designing and implementing future projects. The issues are discussed under six categories.  (1) The selection of tree species and techniques must be based on technical, economic, and sociocultural criteria.  Trees must be adaptable to agroclimatic and farming conditions, and the project must take into consideration the purpose of the planting (e.g., whether trees are grown for subsistence needs, as a cash crop, or both), as well as farmers' risks, benefits, costs, and customary beliefs and preferences.  (2) Tree growing must work within - or seek to change - government policies and traditional land tenure arrangements.  (3) Key institutional issues include the capacity of line ministries to meet technical and extension requirements, and the support that can be provided by the private sector.  A major lesson is that project designers and implementing agencies must train and supervise farmers and extensionists in site selection, planting techniques, spacing requirements, care of young trees, pruning methods and schedules, and the harvesting and use of tree products.  Close coordination among all parties is urged, as is encouragement of farmer participation.  (4) Some evidence suggests that traditional incentives such as free seeds may not be effective.  Recent projects have experimented with alternative incentives, e.g., helping to secure land or tree tenure or funding small community projects.  (5) Information gaps concerning past forestry projects underscore the need to fully fund data collection, monitoring, and evaluation.  (6) Crosscutting issues include the possibility of implementing projects in phases over 7 years or more; the importance of broad, programmatic approaches to improving and sustaining land use; and the importance of donor coordination.  Descriptions of A.I.D. agroforestry projects and 13 pages of references are appended.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Agroforestry|Trees|Agricultural technology|Development project design|Development project implementation","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAX212.pdf","148 KB","003433 - USAID.

"Interim evaluation of a project to establish an agricultural research management system, support research and extension activities, and promote improved crop and livestock technologies in The Gambia. External evaluation covers the period 11/85-1/89. Overall, the project has significantly increased the quality, quantity, and relevance of agricultural research in The Gambia. The review process for selecting and designing research projects has been strengthened.  A substantial number of research personnel have received short-term training, either in The Gambia or abroad, and a number are currently in long-term training overseas.  In addition, computer training and access have improved the timeliness, quality, and reporting of analyses.  A program budgeting system has been installed in the research service and is helping to improve project design and financial management.  The project has also initiated pilot promotional activities for rice and cowpeas in collaboration with the extension sevices and nongovernmental organizations; Save the Children has received a grant to promote improved production/varieties of rice and millet. On the negative side, many government personnel and agricultural development workers still feel that the research service's activities are largely irrelevant to current development needs, and in particular to the constraints facing Gambian farmers. Partly for this reason, and partly because of the conditions of service, researcher morale is low and a number of qualified personnel have resigned.  It is recommended that major farming constraints be identified as part of the policy/priorities statement to be prepared by the Directorate of Agricultural Research and that programs be developed to resolve them. Improvements also need to be made in research implementation, financial management, and research linkages with extension, PVO's, and other development projects.","Companion evaluation summary: PD-ABA-249","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural research|On farm research|Research management","Gambia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAY862.pdf","3,951 KB","006727 - Development Alternatives, Inc.

"PACR of an OPG to CARE (3/83-6/88) to promote tree planting and other conservation practices to counteract deforestation and general environmental degradation in a refugee area in eastern Sudan. Despite design flaws, the project had several accomplishments. Rural Sudanese and refugees have been employed to raise seedlings in the project's two nurseries and to plant them in the more than 8,000 feddans of plantations established by the project. The nurseries have also produced thousands of utilitarian, amenity, and fruit trees annually for distribution to local individuals and organizations. Seedling mortality remains a problem at some of the plantations, however, and even if the plantations are fully stocked, yields will probably not be great enough to meet local needs for fuel, fodder, etc. Appropriate agroforestry techniques have yet to be identified; some project innovations (e.g., changes in potting mix) were not based on valid analysis and thus cannot be assessed.  On the other hand, certain experimental trials were successful:  rainwater management and water harvesting techniques developed by the project have significantly lowered tree mortality on the plantations and can be used wherever similar agro-climatic conditions exist. An agroforestry extension program is working throughout the project area on a wide variety of village and school nursery programs, environmental education, and agroforestry demonstration plots.  The extension unit has developed effective procedures and materials to promote tree planting, but suffers from the project's lack of proven technical interventions. Several additional problems were caused by project design. Project headquarters in Gedaref were so remote from activity sites that some senior staff spent the equivalent of 100 days per year driving between the sites.  The design also failed to address the intended purpose of providing relief from immediate unemployment problems in the refugee settlements and nearby villages.  Finally, the project failed to undertake the required logframe exercise, causing difficulties in monitoring. Overall, the project is an excellent example of inter-agency coordination.  It is highly regarded by the Forestry Department (FD), which has benefited from management and technical training and the provision of office buildings, permanent nurseries, vehicles, and equipment.  The importance of infrastructure provided to host agencies as part of institution building is sometimes undervalued.  In harsh locales such as rural Sudan, project budgets should provide for vehicle and equipment replacement during the project's final months to ensure the host agency of receipt of worthy assets.  In this case, institutional inputs to the FD will be further refined during the follow-on project.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Reforestation|Refugee relief|Trees|Seedlings|Nurseries","Sudan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDBBP404.pdf","378 KB","008607 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (10/82-8/88) to strengthen the capacity of local governments in Thailand to plan, design, and implement rural development projects. The first 5 project years focused on conducting studies of rural development processes in 97 tambons to prepare rural development manuals for replication nationwide.  Work progressed in 3 stages. First, the project developed recommendations regarding the Government of Thailand's (GOT's) Rural Employment Generation Program (REGP), which resulted in a series of improvements in subsequent policies and guidelines.  The project then prepared and presented to the GOT 60-70 academic papers aimed at promoting decentralized development management and capacity building concepts.  Finally, discrete development manuals were designed, using findings from all studies. The last 2 project years were given to testing project-developed manuals on provincial development planning, the tambon financial system, human resources development for rural development, local-level rural development monitoring systems, village development funds, and local maintenance arrangements.  Except for the village development funds model, the tests demonstrated that the manuals could be modified for nationwide replication. The most useful manuals were those on planning, resource management, and maintenance.  While these models were being tested, REGP budget and A.I.D. loan funds were used to finance small-scale, tambon-level subprojects (SP's) using local natural resources; SP areas included water resource development, access road and bridge construction, economic promotion, and social needs.  Over the entire life of the project, some 3,060 such SP's were implemented. Approximately 140 tambons and 140,000 villagers benefited directly from these SP's and a large number of GOT officials at the provincial and district levels participated and learned about rural development processes.  The project provided training for approximately 5,000 people at the local level in the fields of planning, engineering, and project implementation.  In addition, 18 GOT officials participated in U.S. observation visits and resource management training. Several lessons were learned.  (1) The SP's proved to be both a training ground in natural resource management and a source of additional income for villagers.  Part of this revenue is returned to the tambon council or village development fund for use in other public projects.  (2) The most successful SP's are in tambons with strong local leaders, especially District Officers and their Deputies.  (3) The role of the province has been limited to reviewing and approving SP proposals prepared at the tambon and district levels.  (4) The Department of Local Administration now has the experience and the authority to institutionalize the most successful elements of the project.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Public administration|Rural development|Decentralization|Development planning|Development research|Development projects|Community participation|Local level|Districts","Thailand","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAY868.pdf","247 KB","008613 - USAID.

"Results are presented of a review of 287 evaluation reports submitted by A.I.D. Missions and offices during FY's 1987-88. The review addressed two main areas:  compliance with the A.I.D. Handbook, and the quality of the evaluations.  The main findings were as follows: (1) 89% of the reports evaluated single projects, 10% evaluated more than one project, and 1% evaluated nonproject assistance; (2) on certain key measures (e.g., completeness, methodology), evaluations prepared for the Asia/Near East and Latin America/Caribbean Bureaus rated best; (3) 53% were conducted solely by contractors, while A.I.D. and host country personnel participated in 29% and 27% of the evaluations, respectively; (4) 69% were interim evaluations; (5) in terms of primary focus, 64% addressed outputs, 28% addressed purpose, and 2% addressed goals; (6) complete data were available on outputs in 51% of the evaluations, on purposes in 19%, and on goals in 4%; (7) possibly because of the short time taken to conduct the evaluations (on average about a month), data collection relied heavily on key informant interviews and to a lesser extent on site visits, with little or no use made of focus group or community interviews, formal or informal surveys, or direct observation; (8) in regard to analytical methods, 50% analyzed trend data, 23% analyzed cost-effectiveness in detail, and 11% used comparison or control groups; (9) 60% contained information on financial monitoring and 79% on program monitoring, with 66% of the projects evaluated given high marks for financial monitoring and 54% given high marks for program monitoring; (10) 59% of the reports called for improvements in the project monitoring, evaluation, or management information systems; (11) two-thirds of the reports included the required ES or PES containing a section for listing actions to be taken on the basis of the evaluation; (12) on average, less than half of the recommendations could be acted upon by the A.I.D. Mission or Bureau which sponsored the evaluation, the rest being directed to those actually implementing the project; (13) 18% of the evaluations noted that recommendations from prior evaluations had not been implemented; (14) in terms of special concerns, detailed discussion was given to WID issues in 9% of the evaluations, to environmental issues in 8%, and to sustainability issues in 36%; (15) cost data, which were provided for 45% of the evaluations, indicate a mean cost per evaluation of $37,450, with 17% costing less than $10,000 and 20% costing over $60,000.","Later ed.: PN-ABC-321","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","3/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Development project evaluation|USAID|Evaluation methodology","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAY877.pdf","3,773 KB","000436 - Development Associates, Inc.","","000156 - USAID.

"Evaluates Food for Peace Title II program in Haiti implemented by CARE, Catholic Relief Service (CRS), and the Adventist Development and Relief Agency (ADRA).  Each sponsor works through a number of delivery mechanisms, including School Feeding (SF), Mother Child Health (MCH), and Food For Work (FFW).  External evaluation covers FY88 activities. The program provided food to approximately 500,000 children, or roughly 20% of all Haitian children, for at least 9 months of the year. It is likely that this supplemental food serves as a ""safety net"" for children and probably their families - a small constant in a rapidly deteriorating environment.  While this achievement is significant in terms of child survival and welfare, a broader development impact cannot objectively be claimed.  Neither USAID/H nor any of the sponsors is operating with a strategic plan; instead, efforts are devoted simply to moving food.  This quantitative focus is due to organizational mandates, Title II planning processes, and current sociopolitical conditions. Both CARE and CRS are now engaged in structured internal reviews to improve planning and targeting, while ADRA must strengthen program operations prior to undertaking a meaningful strategic planning exercise. The sponsors' expenditure and cost patterns mirror the strategic disarray of the P.L. 480 program.  Budgets are largely logistical, and there are no real cost linkages between the delivery of food and the establishment of developmental projects. Due to lack of cost-centered accounting and historical data, no trend analysis could be undertaken. CARE is the most cost-efficient sponsor, although margins are very slim. Major deviations in delivery mechanisms are not recommended, but existing mechanisms should be refocused towards development aims. All sponsors need to improve monitoring systems, not only for efficiency, but in order to judge effectiveness as they move towards new foci.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Food for Peace Title II|Maternal child feeding programs|School feeding programs|Strategic planning","Haiti","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAY919.pdf","5,292 KB","000241 - Louis Berger International, Inc.

"Interim evaluation of Umoja II - a housing guaranty in Kenya to strengthen the Nairobi City Commission's (NCC) administration of housing projects and to fund construction of low-cost condominiums.  External evaluation covers the period 1979-1/89. The project has succeeded in reaching low-income beneficiaries, although the objective of owner-occupancy has not been met. Beneficiaries are increasingly subletting the units to tenants of a slightly higher income group; currently two-thirds of the houses are so occupied.  This tendency is seen as unavoidable, since housing investment is viewed in Nairobi as a means of maximizing income.  The project's innovative concept of allowing several households to share a plot on a condominium basis has had a tremendous effect on increasing densities in regard to the number of housing units and the number of persons per ha, while the infrastuctural and building standards are a major breakthrough in Nairobi's formal low-income housing sector.  In general, the housing projects are well appreciated for their accompanying community facilities (i.e., schools, nurseries, markets, and clinics) and the security provided by the courtyard design. Criticism has focused on unclean drains, small room size, and the location of the cooking area and shower rooms. The NCC's complex, cumbersome administrative/political structure led to selection of an unqualified contractor and delays in standards and design approvals.  Furthermore, due to internal NCC coordination flaws, financial and legal problems were left unattended until a crisis developed.  Overall project costs have soared (from KSh. 212 million to KSh. 410 million) for several reasons:  (1) severe implementation delays, (2) rising construction costs, (3) faulty construction work, and (4) changes in contractors.  As a result, A.I.D. funds are insufficient to finalize the project and NCC does not have the resources to make up the deficit.  Thus, the NCC may be able to construct only 7 of the 8 planned project zones.  Coupled with the high level of defaults on monthly payments, the financial shortfall has impeded plans to set up a housing development fund.  All parties agreed that a clearly defined technical and financial monitoring system sponsored by A.I.D. would have prevented some of these problems. A total of 12 recommendations are made regarding the completion and replicability of Umoja II and future USAID/K support to NCC.","Delivery order no. 25","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-0000-I-00-6187-00","","1/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Low cost housing|Urban development|Housing administration|Housing investment guaranty","Kenya","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAY960.pdf","1,969 KB","006381 - Abt Associates, Inc.","","003241 - USAID.

"Interim evaluation of a project to increase the use of contraceptives in Pakistan through a social marketing campaign and increased distribution.  External evaluation covers the period 5/85-11/88. The project has made excellent progress and appears to have the potential to be one of the most effective social marketing projects in the world.  After only 2 years, sales of the Sathi condom have exceeded goals and are second only to the India and Bangladesh programs - both of which have been in operation for over 10 years.  Currently, the condoms are distributed to 161 towns, while expansion to 150 smaller towns is anticipated.  They have achieved a very high level of marketplace visibility, due to unparalled product presentation, which utilizes a consistent message and high quality graphics.  To date, marketing has been channeled primarily through distributors and retailers, although TV and radio advertising is now possible. On the negative side, very little is known about whether the program is reaching the target audience - low-income urban and semi-urban populations - or its impact on consumer attitudes and usage.  Although a number of research projects have been completed, their primary focus has been on distribution issues rather than consumer identification and attitudes.  No overall plan for research has been developed. The organizational structure is well-suited to sustain project activities.  A local firm, W. Woodward Pakistan Ltd., is given considerable discretion in conducting ongoing management, and its links with the Population Welfare Division are handled effectively by Pakistan Consultancy Services.  Project-provided TA has also been an important asset.  However, roles and operating procedures are not entirely clear, causing erosion of the cooperative spirit that has contributed substantially to project success.  A major problem has been disagreement over the sort of sales data to be yielded from the management information system.  This problem was resolved during the evaluation. It is recommended that the project be extended for at least 4 years. Emphasis should be placed on the following goals:  (1) expansion of the condom distribution network into another 150 towns and investigation of ways to develop demand in rural areas; (2) more extensive research regarding consumer attitudes and usage in order to refine advertising strategies and promotional activities; and (3) addition of an oral contraceptive component.","PIO/T no. 391-0484-3-40475|Project title: Population technical assistance (POPTECH)","Special Evaluation","Documents","DPE-3024-Z-00-8078-00","","2/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Condoms|Contraceptive distribution|Family planning promotion programs|Social marketing","Pakistan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAY963.pdf","4,356 KB","006243 - Dual & Associates, Inc.|000673 - International Science and Technology Institute, Inc.

"Fifty recent documents related to the prospects for U.S. foreign assistance - including major reports prepared by the A.I.D. Administrator, the House Foreign Affairs Committee, and other key agencies and interest groups - are the subject of this annotated bibliography.  The bibliography is arranged in three parts, focusing on, respectively:  (1) the future of foreign assistance programs, organizations, and legislation; (2) changing Third World conditions that these foreign assistance programs must address; and (3) particular substantive areas (agriculture and rural development, social services, and technology transfer). An introduction briefly analyzes the issues raised in the documents and points out areas of agreement and disagreement. Overall, the documents reveal the emergence of a broad consensus that U.S. foreign assistance needs re-thinking.  This consensus rests first of all on common recognition of development trends - the increasing diversity of developing countries, the growing importance of economic interdependence over economic dependence and aid, the relative insignificance of official foreign assistance compared to other economic relationships, the long-term nature of economic development, the relative importance of policy and institutional changes over project interventions, the transnational nature of many development issues (e.g., debt, drugs), and the ability of markets to allocate development resources more efficiently than governments.  The documents also share common perceptions of the internal problems facing U.S. foreign assistance - an obsolete Foreign Assistance Act, an ambiguous mixing of goals (military, political, humanitarian, and development), a weak constituency, emphasis on planning and monitoring over results and on short-term performance over sustainable growth, excessive rigidity, Congressional micromanagement, overreliance on the public sector, weak inter-donor coordination, and the declining size of U.S. foreign assistance relative both to developing world economies and contributions from other donors. Despite these commonalities, the reports differed in important respects, especially regarding the structure and role of a new or revamped foreign assistance agency, the strategic emphasis of foreign assistance (e.g., whether to emphasize poverty alleviation or economic growth, whether to accept the social costs of structural adjustment as unavoidable or seek to alleviate them) and the priority sectors and countries for foreign assistance.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","4/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Development assistance|Foreign assistance|U.S. Foreign Assistance Act|Development strategies|Economic development","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNABC092.pdf","106 KB","003433 - USAID.

"Evaluation of project to strengthen Pakistan's agricultural research system covers the period 1984-2/89. The project provides necessary support to a national agricultural research system whose products are sorely needed.  The project is close to schedule.  Most inputs have been delivered on time, and managed to produce programmed outputs.  Some delays have occurred in in-country training, which focused more on technical matters than on management improvement.  The impact of new elements added by the project, e.g., FSR and communications, cannot be expected until these have been fully integrated, nor can impact be expected from international degree training before the return of the participants.  Procurement of laboratory equipment has led to considerable aggravation because of unmet expectations, but other procurement has proceeded without problems. The time required for review and decision on study recommendations was underestimated, however; formal evidence of responsive action is scarce.  Otherwise, this project appears to be well managed, on track, and relatively free from implementation problems. Nevertheless, it is very unlikely that planned EOP's will be achieved.  Most of the management problems stem from two sources beyond the project's influence.  (1) The provinces' independent responsibility for agriculture represents a federal system of research.  It is an alliance rather than a controlled organization, so changes must be brought about by consensus, which takes considerable time and effort to develop.  (2) Inflexible public sector management systems are not readily modified, even by autonomy; staff are unwilling to risk their careers through innovation. Moreover, the project design is seriously flawed by expectations that are quite unrealistic.  Many of the proposed interventions (specifically the systems analyses and many of the convenanted studies) were inappropriate.  The indicators of EOP status were presented without baseline or targets.  The level of effort allotted to administration was infinitely small in relation to the extent and dispersion of Pakistan's agricultural research system. In addition, the sequencing and timing of interventions are incongruous.  Most degree candidates will not have returned to the project long enough for the impact of their training to be felt. Equipment provided in 1988 will have little immediate impact on science. Much of the output of the information transfer component must await the building and equipping of a center and the hiring and training of staff. USAID/P, the Pakistan Agricultural Research Council, and the contractors have nevertheless managed with flexibility to achieve significant progress toward the end of the project.  The fact that the project will not reach EOP status by PACD is due more to design problem than implementation concerns.

"PACR of a project (1977-88) to increase the capacity of (1) local governments in Central Java and Aceh Provinces in Indonesia to design, implement, and evaluate rural development projects and (2) central governments to support these efforts. A total of 1,119 subprojects (SP's) were completed. In Central Java, successful SP's were in integrated agriculture, food crop and livestock production, fish pond establishment, assistance to poor families, skills training, subdistrict area development (PPWK), and rural credit (BKK). The PPWK, BKK, and livestock (particularly sheep and goats) SP's proved particularly successful and replicable. Unsuccessful SP's were in eel and fish production in public waters, mixed breed chicken raising, silage production, land conservation, and seawater distillation for drinking water. SP's in Aceh were not as successful, though some success was had in SP's in agriculture, embroidery, and traditional dagger production, and the rural credit program made headway after a poor start. Salt production and marine fishery SP's were unsuccessful. In both provinces, lack of success was due to insufficient technical instruction and inadequate feasibility studies. SP's had a significant impact on beneficiaries: targeting success was quite high and the average real net gain represented an 11-18% real increase in average annual household income for recipients reporting a gain. The project also developed improved planning and information systems in the two provinces and provided in-country and overseas training to a total of 800 local and central government officials in such areas as rural regional development planning, integrated rural development, community development, etc. About 8,000 persons involved in the SP's were also trained. The project's orientation to the rural poor and the appointment of regional development planning boards at both the provincial and district levels to control project funds had a very positive impact on strengthening local government structural integration and coordination both vertically (delegating development management and planning authority from the central to the provincial and in some cases to the district and subdistrict levels) and horizontally (within the Technical Service Agencies at the provincial and district levels). In sum, as a result of the project Aceh and Central Java provinces now possess reliable infrastructures - improved staff and management systems and replicable SP packages of proven effectiveness in increasing rural employment and income. Central Java has shown strong indications of continuing project activities and even expanding them to a new district. Results in Aceh are less conclusive, as only Rp. 78 million have been allocated to continue project activities.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","2/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Regional development|Rural development|Public administration|Decentralization|Integrated regional development|Development projects|Income generation|Institution building|Management development","Indonesia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDCBB074.pdf","2,419 KB","008558 - USAID.

"PACR of Phase I of an integrated area development project (8/80-7/88) in Nepal's Rapti Zone.  Project activities aimed to improve food production and consumption, increase income-generating opportunities, strengthen local development institutions, and improve national delivery systems. The project helped transform the Zone from a chronic food deficit area into an area of moderate food surplus.  Annual food grain production increased by the targeted amount - from 174,000 MT in 1978-80 to 220,000 MT in 1985-87.  The project also helped in crop diversification, particularly into vegetables and fruits, and household consumption appears to have improved.  Technology extension, training, and credit were provided through several programs designed to increase income-generating opportunities. The most significant of these was a program to support Nepal's Agricultural Development Bank, which subsequently increased investment in the Zone from Rs. 3.7 million in 1980-81 to Rs. 24 million in 1986-87.  Other programs included women in development activities and efforts in household production systems, livestock, irrigation, forestry and soil conservation, formal and nonformal education, cottage industries, etc.  To facilitate input supply and marketing, 180 km of fair weather roads and 163 km of trails and mule tracks were improved.  As a result, the Agriculture Inputs Corporation increased the fertilizer supply fivefold. Data are not available to determine the broader income and income distribution effects of the project. The project facilitated the implementation of the 1982 Decentralization Act and 1984 By-laws which provide authority to district and village Panchayats in preparing development plans and approving district programs and budgets.  Government of Nepal offices have become more efficient in their financial and administrative operations and more experienced in dealing with village and district Panchayats in program formulation and implementation.  The project constructed 41 buildings to improve district operations and 10 subdistrict service centers to expand extension efforts.  Officer-level staff within project-related agencies was expanded from 33 to 80 persons. Degree and short-term participant training was provided to 19 and 180 persons, respectively. The project's success is attributed largely to its long-term commitment (Phase II began in 7/87 and will continue until 7/95) and the flexibility given to USAID/N to modify the project in response to development realities in the Zone.  Other factors included strong host country and beneficiary participation, the systematic testing of new crop varieties in the local farming context, and development (after a period of trial and error) of a computerized monitoring and evaluation system which has since been adopted for monitoring host government rural development nationwide.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Integrated regional development|Integrated rural development","Nepal","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAZ068.pdf","885 KB","008583 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (3/86-11/87) implemented by CARE to provide emergency drought relief in North Kordofan Province in Sudan by rehabilitating water points. All planned outputs were successfully accomplished.  The project rehabilitated 13 wateryards, 11 boreholes, and 9 hand-dug wells; drilled 3 new boreholes; constructed 8 hand-dug wells; and renovated 3 hafirs. CARE also provided two complementary extension programs.  The first instructed village committees on water-related topics including health implications, sanitation, up-keep, and management.  The second program established pump repair workshops in select villages.

"PACR of a project (1986-3/88), implemented by Save the Children Federation (SCF), to conduct an integrated emergency wateryard rehabilitation and reforestation program in drought-stricken Umm Ruwaba District in Northern Kordofan, Sudan. Because of problems encountered early on, the number of wateryards to be rehabilitated was reduced to eight and the PACD extended to 3/88. SCF accomplished all the revised outputs, rehabilitating eight wateryards, establishing eight village water committees and eight village nurseries, training National Water Commission and village personel in wateryard equipment maintenance and repair, and training villagers in nursery operation and reforestation techniques.  A 1/88 local currency grant enabled SCF to add three wateryards and two nurseries to the above-noted outputs. The original outputs were unrealistic; SCF assumed that each wateryard would only require a few spare parts, when in fact all the existing equipment had to be replaced.  Field investigations should have been carried out prior to the grant.  Also, some implementation delays could have been shortened if the Government of Sudan and USAID/S had monitored the project more closely.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","3/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Emergency relief|Water supply structures|Potable water|Reforestation","Sudan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAZ070.pdf","139 KB","008607 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to establish a Peace Fellowship Program to provide U.S. graduate-level training in key development sectors to Egyptian students.  The program is implemented by the Ministry of Higher Education (MOHE) and by the Egyptian Cultural and Educational Bureau (ECEB) in Washington, D.C.  External final evaluation covers the period 1980-1/89. The program is one of the largest bilateral training programs in history and a signal achievement in U.S.-Egyptian relations. Some 2,024 students have participated in graduate studies programs, exceeding the target of 1,900; in terms of person-months of training, targets have been exceeded by 15%. The program has been available to a cross-section of English-speaking Egyptians in the academic, public, and private sectors.  About half of participants have come from the universities, 38% from outside greater Cairo and Alexandria, and 19% have been women.  However, in the program's second phase, to be implemented under Project 2630125 (Development Training), some changes need to be made in participant selection.  Use of discipline-specific selection committees comprised only of university professors has biased the process toward applicants with good research plans.  Clinical medicine has been overrepresented, accounting for 17% of total training, even though few Egyptian doctors are qualified for hands-on clinical work in the United States.  It is recommended that this field be eliminated from eligibility.  Although the private sector target of 12% has been met, this level needs to be raised in response to both host government and USAID/E development plans, which place increased reliance on the private sector.  It is recommended that a portion of the budget be set aside for the private sector and that a new selection procedure for this group be adopted. The ECEB has functioned well in placing and monitoring participants. However, low salaries and poor working conditions have caused high staff turnover and low morale within the Peace Fellows unit.  Moreover, while the unit appears capable of handling the current number of participants, the expanded follow-on project may prove overwhelming.  It is recommended that special assistance be given to the ECEB in addressing these problems, as well as in providing improved orientation, field trips, and conferences for Peace Fellows. A major criticism on the Egyptian side has been that implementation has been delayed repeatedly by slow reimbursements and by low levels of obligations for new participants.  Phase II of the program has an estimated life of 3 to 8 years, and an estimated funding level of $5 million to $13 million.  Orderly planning cannot take place until A.I.D.'s intentions are made more clear.  It is recommended that USAID/E work closely with the MOHE to ensure that the expectations of both sides are clearly stated, fully understood, and sufficiently agreed to so that implementation can take place at a reasonable pace.","Companion evaluation summary: PD-ABA-077","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Education for development|Participant program administration|Participants|Graduate education|Fellowships","Egypt","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAZ073.pdf","2,667 KB","000356 - Checchi and Co.

"Final evaluation of a project implemented by the National Association of the Partners of the Americas (NAPA) and (as sub-grantee) the Corporacion Integral para el Desarrollo Cultural y Social (CODECAL) to promote civic and human rights education in Latin America.  External evaluation covers the period 9/84-9/88. Although most activities proceeded as planned, the project evolved - contrary to what was mandated in the grant agreement - into two independent, uncoordinated projects.  A main problem was CODECAL's unwillingness to accept TA from and work cooperatively with NAPA.  Other factors included inadequate grant planning; a lack of serious evaluations, follow-up, and adjustment mechanisms; poor communication and reporting systems; and a financial reporting system which did not follow a consistent format and lacked detail.  The project was also insufficiently focused, attempting overall to provide services for diverse target groups in overly extensive geographic and subject areas (20 countries and 37 subjects).  It also lacked established trainee selection criteria. NAPA used grant resources to fund successful and ongoing programs. Particularly successful was the provision of a grant which enabled U.S. specialists to travel to Paraguay to help develop the idea for a College of Human Ecology at the Autonomous University of Paraguay.  The idea has since been accepted and funded by the W.K. Kellogg Foundation for more than $1 million. For its part, CODECAL conducted 199 training programs in 10 different areas for 4,948 participants from 9 countries (2,227 of them from Colombia).  The quality of these efforts was generally satisfactory, and CODECAL's participatory training approach showed many positive results. On the negative side, the impact of the training has not been as effective as planned.  A significant number of the campesinos trained did not return home to train others to be trainers, although training of trainers was a major project objective.  In addition, while user reactions to CODECAL's instructional materials was positive, the materials were not subjected to a serious, professional evaluation. Further, the lack of evaluation and feedback mechanisms made it difficult to determine whether CODECAL's programs had met real needs or not.  Trainees from the Dominican Republic, for example, complained that the human rights course failed to address their most urgent problem - Haitian refugees.  Other problems included a tendency to use inexperienced instructors, an at times excessively theological (Roman Catholic) orientation, and an overemphasis on Colombian values and examples. Recommendations for follow-on activities focus on the above-mentioned problem areas.","Delivery order no. 43","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDL-0085-I-6097-00","","1/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Human rights|Civic education|Teacher training","Latin America","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAZ095.pdf","1,908 KB","000356 - Checchi and Co.

"Evaluates OPG's to four developing country umbrella organizations to prepare, monitor, and evaluate NGO project activities. Grantees are the Costa Rican Association for Development Organizations (ACORDE), the Federation of Private Development Organizations of Honduras (FOPRIDEH), the Association of Nongovernmental Development and Service Entities of Guatemala (ASINDES), and the Haitian Association of Voluntary Agencies (HAVA).  External evaluation covers the period through 9/88. All the organizations have shown ability to handle NGO subproject (SP) financing and these SP's seem to be having a favorable impact on target beneficiaries.  Training and TA programs for NGO's have been less successful than financing activities, however.  HAVA has increasingly focused on training beneficiary groups directly rather than through NGO's, ACORDE has opted to pay other organizations to carry out training functions, and ASINDES' internal difficulties have undermined its work in this area.  Only FOPRIDEH has recently given increased attention to training and TA in response to member demands. Progress has been made in institutional strengthening, principally in clarifying the purposes and basic identity of two of the organizations (FOPRIDEH and HAVA).  All have introduced new manuals and procedures governing personnel, administration, and recordkeeping, but greater consistency in applying the standards and procedures is needed. Financial staffs should be upgraded to enable them to unify budgeting and planning and to provide financial analysis.  All institutions have suffered serious problems in staff organization, use, and oversight due to restrictions on the levels of salaries and managerial support, personality conflicts, and lack of clarity concerning the roles of the Boards of Directors and the various staff levels.  Only FOPRIDEH and HAVA have made significant progress in becoming representatives or coordinators of the NGO's, since ACORDE, a non-member organization, has not sought this responsibility and ASINDES' membership is too static. Even though A.I.D. is receiving little recognition from beneficiaries or NGO's as the source of project support, all the organizations are still heavily dependent on A.I.D. and A.I.D.-related government resources for both operating expenses and program levels.  Efforts to raise funds from other donors are still weak, and only ACORDE is pursuing domestic fundraising. ACORDE also received office space from A.I.D., which makes its future somewhat less uncertain than the others.","Work order no. 36|Later ed.: PD-ABE-048","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-0085-I-00-6097-00","","1/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Institution building|Private voluntary organizations|Development organizations|Financial management","Haiti|Costa Rica|Guatemala|Honduras","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAZ122.pdf","15,700 KB","000356 - Checchi and Co.

"Final report on a grant (3/86-9/88) to improve the management and strengthen the developmental impacts of CARE's P.L. 480 Title II Food for Peace (FFP) Program in Haiti. Despite many difficulties and delays, the majority stemming from Haiti's political upheavals, the project succeeded for the most part in reaching its goals.  The beginning of the grant period corresponded to the destruction of the FFP program's logistic capacity as a result of the pillaging of all four of CARE/Haiti's food warehouses and the majority of its truck fleet.  Although reconstruction thus became a major activity during the first year, beneficiary levels fell drastically as damage to schools and the continuing atmosphere of insecurity in the country made feeding sites inoperable and caused problems with food delivery. Nonetheless, with additional funding provided by the Government of Haiti, the program's logistic capacity was rebuilt. Beneficiary levels have risen to 335,100, and the program supports 1,200 institutions in 4 of Haiti's 9 departments. Security problems still exist in the Department of the Northwest, however. CARE has taken several steps to improve community-level management of the FFP program, perhaps the most important being enlarging the staff of inspectors by 60% and redefining their role.  These personnel - who are the program's direct contact with beneficiaries - have been given increased responsibility for involving local institutions and communities in FFP management. In addition, their title has been changed from Inspector to Field Representative, and their skills have been upgraded through training.  They have helped to form and have trained parent/teacher committees which assist in administering the school canteen in approximately half of the institutions involved in the program. In addition, CARE has developed a ""mini-project"" component. Mini-projects are short-term activities, designed and implemented by the canteen committee, that increase the security, quality, or sanitary conditions of school feeding sites, e.g., through latrine construction, fencing, or school gardens.  CARE has been hesitant to launch new community activities, however, as funds are not always available when needed.  This uncertainty has made it impossible for CARE to plan and budget in advance. Finally, CARE has disseminated information on the FFP program through seminars, a newsletter, and audiovisual media.","Includes transmittal memorandum","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","PDC-0703-G-SS-6075-00","","1/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Food for Peace Title II|School feeding programs|Maternal child feeding programs|Internal conflict|Community participation|Beneficiary count","Haiti","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAZ139.pdf","473 KB","","","008554 - USAID.

"Assisted by one of the longest periods of continuous support ever provided by A.I.D., the Bogor Institute of Agriculture (Institute Pertanian Bogor or IPB) has been at the forefront of Indonesia's agricultural and educational development for over 30 years.  IBP faculty and staff have helped to develop and disseminate improved corn hybrids, control the brown plant hopper, improve soil fertility, develop farming and land-use techniques to promote transmigration, and promote major initiatives in natural resource management and conservation.  In the educational sector, IPB's pioneering efforts in academic planning have had notable repercussions throughout Indonesia, improving the quality of students and curricula and accelerating the rate at which students complete their studies.  IPB graduates are in great demand and its faculty are frequently called on by Government agencies to conduct research and provide policy advice, and by other Indonesian universities to serve as lecturers, administrators, and resource personnel. Yet a number of problems cloud the Institute's future.  Pressures to expand enrollment have stretched infrastructure and human resources very thin.  IPB is also being pressured by the Government to take the lead in promoting provincial universities at a time when its energies and resources are needed at IPB itself.  Opportunities for faculty development are much more limited than in the past, when donors funded overseas study; few of the new staff have had the development opportunities available to their seniors.  Cutbacks in Government funding have left IPB with almost no discretionary research funds, not only placing IPB's leadership in basic research in jeopardy, but leaving its very research agenda at the dictates of external agencies. If IPB is to remain a sectoral leader, it must develop a comprehensive, strategic, long-term vision and plan.  Major needs are to identify a smaller number of technical specialties on which IPB can concentrate its resources and to enlist external support to maintain faculty skills, stimulate innovative approaches, respond to changing development needs, and establish long-term linkages with academic and research institutions in the industrialized and developing world.","Appendices: PN-ABE-981","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","3/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural colleges|Agricultural research|Educational development|Educational planning|Agricultural education","Bangladesh","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAX216.pdf","63 KB","003433 - USAID.

"To provide a clearer picture of A.I.D.'s evaluation practices, this report reviews 287 evaluations submitted by A.I.D. Missions and offices during FY87 and FY88 to examine their overall quality and compliance with the A.I.D. Handbook. Among the report's key findings are (1) over half (53%) of the evaluations were conducted solely by contractors, while A.I.D. and host country personnel participated in 29% and 27% of them, respectively; (2) on average, less than 50% of the recommendations could be acted upon by the A.I.D. Mission or Bureau that sponsored the evaluation, the rest being directed to those actually implementing the project; and (3) regarding special concerns, detailed discussion was given to women in development issues in just 9% of the evaluations, and to environmental issues in 8%. Sustainability issues were discussed in 36%. Other findings are listed below. (1) The majority (89%) of the reports evaluated single projects, 10% more than one project, and 1% nonproject assistance. (2) On certain key measures (e.g., completeness, methodology), evaluations prepared for the Asia/Near East and Latin America/Caribbean Bureaus were rated highest. (3) Interim evaluations accounted for 69% of the total.  (4) Regarding their primary focus, 64% of the reports addressed outputs, 28% addressed purpose, and 2% addressed goals.  (5) Complete data were available on outputs in 51% of the evaluations, purposes in 19%, and goals in 4%. (6) Possibly because of the short time taken to conduct the evaluations (on average about a month), data collection relied heavily on key informant interviews and to a lesser extent on site visits, with little or no use made of focus group or community interviews, formal or informal surveys, or direct observation.  (7) Of reports using analytical methods, 50% analyzed trend data, 23% analyzed cost-effectiveness in detail, and 11% used comparison or control groups. (8) Some 60% contained information on financial monitoring and 79% on program monitoring; of these, 66% of the projects evaluated were given high marks for financial monitoring and 54% for program monitoring.  (9) A total of 59% of the reports called for improvements in the project monitoring, evaluation, or management information systems.  (10) Included in 66% of the evaluations was the required ES or PES containing a section for listing actions to be taken on the basis of the evaluation.  (11) Some 18% of the evaluations noted that recommendations from prior evaluations had not been implemented.  (12) Cost data, which were provided for 45% of the evaluations, indicate a mean cost per evaluation of $37,450, with 17% costing less than $10,000 and 20% costing over $60,000.

"Evaluates activities of the International Executive Service Corps (IESC) to provide short-term management, productivity, and marketing assistance to small companies in Honduras.  External interim evaluation covers the period 8/83-12/88. IESC has generally performed very well.  Of 50 former and current clients interviewed, the vast majority reported a very positive experience, most claiming that they received much more assistance than was originally requested.  The number of clients assisted has grown from 3 in 1983 to 62 in 1988, for a grand total of 186 businesses assisted. During the 1987/88 period, some 27 micro (0-10 employees) and 14 small (11-25 employees) industries were served.  Among the clients interviewed, production rose 35%, employment increased 21%, and scrap was reduced by 15%.  In many cases. progress was clearly shown through the enhancement of product design or improved packaging.  In companies already exporting, sales showed a marked increase where such design or packaging improvements were made.  Resource allocation could be improved, however, to better assist businesses in the agricultural sector, the basis of the Honduran economy. Payments for the direct costs of an IESC volunteer's services have been made by both large businesses (who paid in full) and small businesses (who paid in part). The major recommendation is that since the project is working well, it should be left alone.  Other recommendations are, inter alia, to: develop guidelines for charging clients; increase assistance to small and micro industries, especially, where feasible, in the areas of export promotion; and open a new IESC office in La Ceiba.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","LAC-0619-C-00-7038-00","","1/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Business enterprises|Business support services|Private sector|Small scale enterprises|Microenterprises|Industrial productivity|Management operations|Marketing","Honduras","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAZ188.pdf","7,683 KB","000673 - International Science and Technology Institute, Inc.

"PACR of a project (FY81-FY85) to improve the planning and management capability of Swaziland's Ministry  Health (MOH) through long- and short-term TA, participant training, and commodities. Progress was made in five major areas.  These included:  (1) development and implementation of an MOH decentralization plan; (2) improvements in the MOH personnel unit, including the training of unit officers and restructuring of personnel functions, development of computerized personnel inventory systems, preparation of a revised nursing service scheme, development of job descriptions and a training plan for all personnel, and on-the-job support to the MOH training and personnel management committees; (3) assistance in preparing the 1983 national health policy and the health sector component of the fourth national development plan; (4) assessment of alternative financing strategies for the health sector, operationalization of budgeting procedures and policies, and installation of computers in the health planning and statistics unit; and (5) training of two MOH officials at the Master's level in health planning.  The project also assisted in several other activities, including the development of a rural/primary care facility plan, a drug supply system strategy, and a national nutrition survey.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Management training|Health care administration|Health policy|Institution building|Government departments","Swaziland","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDBBP340.pdf","898 KB","008609 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (1983-88) to lay the groundwork for a follow-on A.I.D. project to upgrade smallholder agriculture in Guinea. The project did succeed in developing a design for the proposed follow-on project (6750210), but the follow-on was never approved by USAID/G, which decided instead to focus on supporting the market-oriented economic reforms of the new Guinean government, which came to power in 1985.  Other achievements under this project included: (1) furnishing and equipping facilities built under predecessor project 6750201 - the Foulaya Training Laboratory, Faranah Agricultural Training Institute, Faranah Demonstration Farm, and the Tindo Agricultural Extension Training Center; and (2) training 166 agricultural educators and technicians - four of whom received advanced U.S. training. The project-equipped facilities, as being used by the Government of Guinea (GOG), are seen to be of great value, even though no longer supported by A.I.D.  Nonetheless, the project teaches several lessons. (1) The project design was far too ambitious given Guinea's rudimentary institutional framework for agricultural development, and the resources allotted were insufficient, resulting in defections of contract personnel (sometimes after only 4 months of service).  Nor did the design provide for adjustments to GOG budgetary difficulties.  (2) Contractors and Mission management should monitor and continuously interpret current events in the course of long-term planning and seek to incorporate these events into the planning process.  In the present case, more than $1 million was spent in designing the follow-on.  It would have been advisable to close down the design activity and wait for events to unfold on the national scene.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Development project design|Agricultural development|Small farms","Guinea","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDBBP837.pdf","311 KB","008551 - USAID.

"The Mali Economic Policy Reform Program (EPRP), one of the first adjustment programs undertaken in the West Africa region by A.I.D., comprises fiscal and regulatory reform, budget restructuring, and computerization components, all aimed at strengthening the private sector and reducing the burden of the public sector on the economy. This report assesses the EPRP's regulatory and fiscal reform component. Efforts at regulatory reform have been in three areas.  (1) The new Commercial Code - enactment of which was made a condition precedent to disbursement - has enabled economic agents to do business in a modern way and abolished the requirement that businesses be officially approved, resulting in a boom in formal business registrations. (2) Price ceilings and preset profit margins have been removed for all but 26 products/services, a number soon to be reduced to 10.  (3) To complement price liberalization, foreign trade has been liberalized by reducing restrictions on exports and (especially) imports.  What restrictions remain will be removed before the end of June, 1989.  The overall result of regulatory reform has been to increase economic competition (to the benefit of consumers) and improve the business environment.  In regard to fiscal reform, several initiatives have been undertaken - including reducing the rates for major taxes and realigning customs duties so as to increase incentives for local manufacturing. Overall, fiscal achievements, while insufficient, represented a courageous step toward economic liberalization.  Recommendations are included for both the regulatory and fiscal areas.","French ed.: PN-ABR-031","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-0000-I-00-6136-00","","5/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Economic reform|Market economy|Policy reform|Fiscal policy|Trade regulation|Tax reforms|Price regulation|Private sector|Economic policy|Trade liberalization|Regulatory reform","Mali","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNABC496.pdf","6,220 KB","005742 - Louis Berger International, Inc.

"Case studies were conducted of apparently successful P.L. 480 - especially Title I - programs in Zambia, Haiti, Pakistan, Tunisia, and Mali to examine (a) the process of identifying and implementing self-help provisions and (b) the programming of local currency proceeds. Major findings were as follows. Self-help provisions  (1) As the programs in Haiti and Pakistan indicate, experienced A.I.D. foreign service nationals should play a major role in monitoring and evaluating self-help provisions, with short-term help, where needed, from U.S. or host government staff or from consultants.  (2) P.L. 480 self-help measures should be integrated as far as possible with the policy implications of other Mission projects in order to facilitate policy reform at the sectoral level. (3) Other donors must encourage the host government to achieve self-help objectives, as in the case of the Mali multi-donor cereals program.  (4) Host country officials should be given whatever help they need to report accurately on self-help provisions.  Such reporting should be timed to fit the schedule of the host, not the U.S., government. Local currency proceeds  (1) Large amounts of local currency proceeds can cause programming problems, especially for the host government.  In such cases, management of the proceeds should be kept as simple as possible, as in the case of Pakistan. (2) Reporting requirements should be adapted to host government accounting and budgeting procedures.  (3) Special accounts should not be required on the assumption that they will facilitate greater accountability.  (4) Early joint programming of funds is preferable to post-negotiation programming.  (5) Management difficulties often make the use of local currency proceeds to meet the 25% host government counterpart requirement impractical, as in Haiti. (6) More creative use should be made of local currency proceeds to support other donor efforts that reinforce A.I.D. policy reform goals. (7) USAID's should make greater use of local currency proceeds to help finance the implementation of self-help measures. The report also includes lessons for policy dialogue and recommendations for improving the P.L. 480 program.  Executive summaries of the case studies are appended.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","2/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Food for Peace Title I|Food for Peace Title II|Food for Peace Title III|Policy reform|Local currency|Food aid programs|Policy dialogue","Pakistan|Mali|Tunisia|Haiti|Zambia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNABC534.pdf","3,068 KB","000087 - USAID.

"Mid-term evaluation of a project to improve Benin's rural water/sanitation system through well and latrine construction, the creation of village self-management committees, and related education campaigns.  The project is a joint effort among USAID/B, the Government of Benin (GOB), UNICEF, and the Peace Corps. The project has recovered from a slow start-up and is advancing well toward its objectives.  Staff have responded to project review recommendations and field and coordination operations are now relatively efficient and effective.  Health education is perhaps the most active component, with more than 90 village committees created and trained. Activities currently focus on potable water education and will expand to include Guinea worm prevention.  Baseline data indicate significant project potential for reducing the incidence of Guinea worm.  Well drilling, begun in early 1988, has averaged 5 productive boreholes per month (a total of 37) - far below the rate necessary to achieve the target of 225 wells.  As a result, the proposed pump maintenance system, which relies on village funds and personnel, may not be institutionalized before project termination.  Field staff may be further burdened by ambitious cistern and latrine construction plans, neither of which have been initiated.  The latrine construction plan is also criticized for emphasizing public latrines over low-cost family latrines. Despite its problems, the project promises to be one of the best examples to date of the positive results of a community's involvement in owning and managing its improved water supply. The project model, developed and tested in neighboring countries and perfected in Benin, is ready for much broader application.","WASH activity no. 453","Special Evaluation","Documents","DPE-5942-C-00-4085-00","","2/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Water supply structures|Water management|Water supply structure maintenance|Water supply|Water sanitation|Community participation|Community self help","Benin","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAZ228.pdf","1,048 KB","000333 - Camp Dresser and McKee, Inc.

"Evaluates project to provide technical and managerial training to public and private sector individuals in Mauritania, focusing on four areas relating to food security:  rural development; fisheries; food procurement, importing, and distribution; and human resource development.  Evaluation covers 8/84-3/89. The project goal and purpose remain valid and respond directly to critical development needs.  Specific project objectives also remain valid and should not be altered in any substantial way. The project has been an enormous success in most areas:  all participants who were to go to the U.S. are now in U.S. institutions; innovative approaches to third-country training have resulted in placements in Senegal, Tunisia, Mali, and Morocco; successful seminars have been held in Nouakchott and local training courses have been arranged; a unique workshop for all A.I.D.-financed Mauritanian participants was held in California; and the project has been well managed by a capable and culturally sensitive U.S. Project Director fluent in French and Wolof.  Project funds have been competently managed and clear records maintained. The Secretary General of the General Confederation of Mauritanian Employers has termed the project ""the most important project in Mauritania in terms of its long-term benefits,"" adding that he found the project's implementation to be ""remarkable"" in that ""it (a) touches everyone in the country, in and out of government; (b) includes the private sector in more than a token way; and (c) is a practical and carefully drawn package of technical training aimed at the nation's critical weaknesses in human resources.""  A testimonial of this quality is a tribute to A.I.D.'s success at designing a project which so well targets Mauritania's needs and to the project management staff who have worked diligently under often difficult conditions to implement the project's objectives. The enthusiasm of the private sector for this project may in part be due to the fact that the project was designed to spend 20% of its funds on the sector, whereas 28.5% was actually spent to support 77 private sector participants, representing 67.5% of total long-term participants. The cost-effectiveness of this component and its targeted nature have maximized its impact. There are two areas where improvement is needed.  The project should make a determined effort to spend some of the remaining funds on training for women.  Of the 37 long-term trainees in the U.S., none are women and of the 77 in third-country training, 5 are women.  While there are valid cultural, historical and technical reasons for these statistics, A.I.D. nonetheless has an obligation in this area which the project has been unable to fulfill. Secondly, weaknesses in the Directorate of Plan in the Mauritanian government have resulted in less contact with host government officials than would be desired.

"Evaluates pilot project to upgrade management skills in the Eastern Caribbean.  This was a process evaluation conducted during the period 3/88-3/89.  The project was approved in 1986, but not actually initiated until 1/88. The evaluation team reached the following conclusions:  (1) There was strong support for senior and executive development programs. (2) Participants were willing to pay an increasing share of the training costs and full airfare, room, and board.  (3) Executive participants were willing to send their senior managers to the seminars.  (4) A large number of Eastern Caribbean cases were developed.  (5) There was only marginal support for the case writing and teaching workshops.  (6) Virtually no changes have yet been realized in the use of action-oriented teaching approaches, including case studies.  (7) Although the pilot project has forced an uneasy marriage between the leading members of the management education and training community, it did not contribute to any institutional strengthening of the University of the West Indies, the Caribbean Centre for Development Administration, or theBarbados Institute of Management and Productivity. The following lessons are highlighted for the benefit of follow-on project or similar institution-building education and training projects in the Eastern Caribbean region:  (1) Symposia/seminars are extremely important for ""networking"" the private sector.  Build in opportunities for formal participant interaction.  (2) The Eastern Caribbean has a highly personal contact culture.  People often only respond to highly personalized, face-to-face invitations, not ""businesslike"" approaches. (3) The project should be flexible and ""demand-driven,"" not cast in a blueprint at the outset.  (4) The public sector plays a major role in stimulating and/or constraining economic development in the private sector, but has limited awareness of business or how to heighten its impact.  The two sectors need to work together more closely.  (5) Cooperation and frequent communication between implementers and evaluators is essential in a process evaluation.  (6) An on-going process evaluation requires a much more proactive USAID stance than do more traditional ""one-shot"" evaluations.

A field hospital unit was established in Puerto Lempira that is expected to treat 22,750 people during its first year.  The hospital is the only facility accessible to most of Mosquitia's population that is  capable of performing limited surgery.  The project significantly reduced the incidence of malaria by spraying houses with residual insecticide in nearly 100 communities.  To improve environmental health, the project provided training to 24 Miskitos, 11 of whom were hired to report on community health, organize health and water groups, provide TA in construction and maintenance of wells and latrines, and distribute educational health material.  With their guidance, the communities completed 2,141 of a targeted 3,200 latrines. A community-based educational radio station, called Sani Radio, was developed for the region by the International Relief Committee (IRC). The radio station, which includes 2 production studios, was ingeniously pre-assembled in the United States and shipped to Puerto Lempira at a remarkable speed.  Sani Radio is the only Honduran station that reaches the Mosquitia Region and the only station broadcasting in the Miskito language.  The station's major challenge is to find a suitable permanent institutional and financial base. The infrastructure component experienced a setback when unprecedented flooding of the region in 8/86 damaged the nearly completed principal bridge on the Rus-Rus river.  However, the bridge was redesigned and completed in 12/87 to the benefit of 3,898 people.  The project improved 13 small bridges on the region's road network - 122 km of which were also improved (more than double the project target).  Rehabilitation of the canal connecting Laguna Sirpe and the Kruta river proved difficult. A dredge purchased in the United States could not remove tree trunks and roots embedded in the canal and the material excavated severely abraded the dredge's pumping mechanism.  The dredge was used to rehabilitate 5 km of the planned 12 km of the canal, while 3 km were rehabilitated by manual labor during the dry season. Several lessons were learned.  (1) Since the Government of Honduras (GOH) commitment to the Mosquitia is far less than to more populated regions, longer lead times and training of GOH personnel might be required for projects in the area.  (2) The GOH has limited concern for the refugees in the Mosquitia, and so should not be heavily relied upon to implement projects designed to assist them.  (3) Contracting out might have lessened the administrative burden of the infrastructure component, but would not have provided employment to as many local Miskitos.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Integrated rural development|Transportation infrastructure|Community health care|Refugees|Clinics|Educational radio","Honduras","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAZ303.pdf","1,827 KB","008555 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (6/81-3/87) to improve the capacity of the Honduran National Housing Institute (INVA) to administer, through 20 intermediary organizations (e.g., PVO's, cooperatives, and government institutions), a program to provide low-interest loans to the rural poor for housing improvements. Results were impressive.  With INVA authorizing just over $5 million through signed agreements with 19 intermediaries, the project provided a source of credit for 16,196 rural families in areas that had previously been neglected by the Honduran government.  As most of these families were dependent on agriculture, loan delinquencies varied with the success or failure of the harvest.  At the end of the project, the range of delinquent loans to the PVO's averaged 22%, comparing favorably with similar programs in urban areas in Honduras.  The most active PVO, Caritas de Danli, issued 3,983 loans resulting in 6,614 rural home improvements.  When the project concluded, this PVO had dispersed $946,000 and recovered $759,800. In light of project performance, INVA secured additional funding from the Honduran Ministry of Finance for a second phase of the project. Three lessons have been learned.  (1) The project goal of making INVA financially self-sufficient by 1990 is not likely to be achvieved.  The design of programs in which self-sufficiency is a goal must be sensitive to macroeconomic factors in the host country that may impede this goal. (2) The design of projects involving new activities should allow more start-up time than of projects involving activities in which the implementing agencies are already experienced.  (3) Projects implemented by PVO's should include sufficient TA from the outset to upgrade PVO accounting procedures to A.I.D. standards.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","3/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Loans|Housing credit|Rural areas","Honduras","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAZ304.pdf","252 KB","008555 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (3/84-12/87) to provide TA/training and a loan fund to assist women's groups in rural Honduras in establishing small-scale swine production operations.  The project was implemented in cooperation with two successive local PVO's, Fundacion Horizontes de Amistad and Organizacion de Desarrollo Empresarial Feminino. Results were impressive.  Nine groups, with a total of 106 members, were targeted in nine different communities on the northern coast, directly benefiting an estimated 742 family members.  The groups marketed a total of 1,258 piglets and 1,253 fat hogs, generating L410,894 in gross income sales.  The average income received per member was L378, a substantial amount when compared with participants' annual family income of L500. The project also increased the capabilities of the group members in such areas as:  (1) general management and recordkeeping; (2) technical expertise in enterprise operations; (3) development of commercial relationships with businesses, banks, and processors; and (4) decisionmaking on both the individual and group level. Moreover, the project substantially increased the self-confidence of the participants. On the negative side, certain problems hindered project effectiveness.  (1) Two groups completed the training and technical service process, but could not receive financing due to water availability problems.  (2) Ten additional groups expressed an interest in joining the program, but were not included due to the scarcity of credit funds.  (3) Delays in project implementation occurred due to changes in the original design.  As a result, the actual output was less than expected in certain areas, including the number of beneficiaries, groups involved, and gross sales. Several lessons were learned.  (1) Initial project design for productive projects must establish targets for financial feasibility and self-sufficiency if these objectives are to be achieved.  (2) While it is difficult to work with disadvantaged groups in commercial activities, the project demonstrated that it is possible when beneficiary participation is properly conditioned and activities are pragmatically implemented.  (3) In a project of this type, staged growth in activities must take place in a manner consistent with resource availability, and be carefully managed and monitored to achieve different objectives. (4) Project design should focus more on pragmatic, operational issues and less on social benefit aspects and include participation requirements, not waiting for these to be worked out over time.  (5) Long-term viability of the project will depend on the viability of the implementing agency.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Local groups|Women in development|Animal husbandry|Small scale enterprises|Swine|Beneficiary count","Honduras","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAZ305.pdf","361 KB","008555 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (9/82-6/88) to establish block plantations as a buffer zone around one of the last two natural high altitude tropical forests in Burundi and as a source of firewood and construction timber. The goal to protect 1,400 ha of natural high altitude forest has been 90% achieved.  However, this protection has come somewhat at the expense of households surrounding the forest which normally satisfied their firewood and building needs from the forest.  It will take another 9-10 years of growth before the plantings will provide significant amounts of wood, while efforts to reduce the demand for wood had little success. For example, the project assumption that peat development would result in 60% of households utilizing peat as fuel did not materialize.  This was attributed to distribution problems and women's preference for wood, which is often gathered free of charge.  Furthermore, an activity to introduce more efficient wood stoves encountered myriad logistical problems and was abandoned. Both the TA and training components needed to be expanded. Instead of a part-time forestry advisor working 2 months per year, the project hired a long-term (2 year) advisor.  Training was augmented to include long-term U.S. training to compensate for the inexperience of the project's administrative entity, the Institut National pour la Conservation de la Nature (INCN), which early on replaced the Department of Water and Forests as the implementing agency.  The first participant completed a B.S. in Forestry/Agroforestry in 6/88. The sustainability of the project depends largely on the success of the agroforestry activity to replant deforested areas.  This aspect of the project purpose can be realized only in the long-term and only with continued support from INCN and the Government of Burundi.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","4/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Plantations|Agroforestry|Firewood|Protected environmental areas|Deforestation|Tropical rain forests","Burundi","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAZ322.pdf","446 KB","008522 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (4/82-9/86) to establish a seed farm in Kajondi, Burundi, to produce wheat, triticale, maize, and potato seeds for distribution to farm families. The planned seed farm was established and is now staffed completely with Government of Burundi (GOB) personnel trained under the project. However, of 20,000 potential beneficiary families, only about 3,000 were reached by the project due to the seed farm's financial problems.  Seed revenues were less than expected due to:  (1) low production as a result of poor soils, sporadic availability of farming inputs, and conflicting directives from GOB, USAID/B, and project managers; and (2) the sale of seeds at below market prices due to the absence of a favorable national seed pricing policy.  However, USAID/B's response to the project's economic failure may prove even more significant than outputs anticipated by the project design.  By hiring several consultants to examine the finances of the Kajondi farm and the Burundi seed sector in general, the Mission was able to develop an excellent dialogue with the Government of Burundi on seed policy reform.  The Ministry of Agriculture eventually asked USAID/B to provide seed consultants to assist in developing a National Seed Plan (NSP).  The result is a plan which relies upon existing infrastructure and facilities but develops the necessary organizational structure of coordination, and administrative and seed quality control.  A National Seed Society (NSS) established under the plan will be responsible for the multiplication, production, marketing, and distribution of both basic and certified seeds.  The NSS will be oriented towards eventually becoming a private sector enterprise. Although the Kajondi farm will become just one of numerous NSS contractors, it will be provided the opportunity to produce the majority of foundation seed for the country.  Kajondi's processing facilities will also be available for cleaning seeds from other projects on a fee basis.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","4/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Seed production|Policy dialogue|Agricultural planning|Foundation seed|Government policy|Pricing","Burundi","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAZ323.pdf","260 KB","008522 - USAID.

"PACR of an integrated rural development project (1980-1988) in Botswana.  The report focuses mainly on Phase II of the project, which began in 1983 and which funded subprojects (SP's) designed to increase rural income and employment. The project suffered from an extraordinarily complex, poorly integrated design; lack of involvement by the Government of Botswana (GOB); and, most seriously, a 6-year drought (which began in 1982). When the communal area coordinator left the project prematurely in 1987, progress slowed considerably, indicating that the managerial and TA requirements of the project had been underestimated throughout. Despite these problems, there were some notable achievements. (1) The SP to train a cadre of rural industrial officers (RIO's) was enthusiastically supported by the GOB and is probably the project's greatest success.  Currently, the cadre deals directly with developing opportunities for rural income generation. However, the amount of work done by the RIO's was not as extensive as hoped for due to the amount of time required to implement the GOB's financial assistance programs at each local level. Utilization of the Productive Employment Development Fund established under the RIO component remained low and few of the projected number of jobs were created.  (2) Some of the senior district officers trained under the district institutional development SP have moved into other positions, but those who resumed their posts appear to have improved job performance and are generally regarded as outstanding officers.  (3) The SP to establish horticultural estates was probably the least successful project component.  The drought was a major constraint, as was the number and complexity of necessary interventions (e.g., construction, agricultural extension, dam building and irrigation, transport and marketing, etc.). A major lesson learned is that project design should be preceded by complete baseline studies and economic analyses.  In this project it appears that detailed implementation plans were drawn up before the necessary analyses were even considered.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","4/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Income generation|Rural development|Management training","Botswana","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAZ324.pdf","165 KB","008516 - USAID.

"Midterm evaluation of a project to improve the capacity of Malawi's Ministry of Agriculture to increase production of traditional crops and identify the most viable crops for diversifying smallholder production. External evaluation covers the period through 1/89. The project's integrated appraoch to TA has proven highly effective and performance by the contractor, the Consortium for International Development, has been outstanding.  However, TA productivity was adversely affected by shortages of vehicles and operating funds early in the project.  In future contracts of this nature, these expenses should be a part of the TA contract. Personnel turnover, made necessary by the training program, also made it more difficult to implement research, extension, and training activities.  Management lapses have been evident in certain areas, but corrective action is being taken wherever possible.  Financial management has been plagued by differences in accounting procedures between the MOA and the Mission.  The posting of a USAID/M accountant in the MOA should help solve this problem. The Government of Malawi's Steering Committee has not fulfilled expectations in determining research, extension, and training priorities and improving linkages among the project components. While some progress has been made in developing links between research and extension, these links tend to be unsystematic, depending too much on individual initiatives rather than routine practice.  Linkages are also stronger between adaptive research and certain parts of extension than between commodity research and extension, and those between adaptive research and commodity research are not as strong as they should be. Agroforestry research conducted under the project is vigorous, practical, and technically appropriate.  Some significant results have been achieved with which preliminary extension messages and adaptive research can proceed.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural extension|Agricultural research|Small farms","Malawi","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAZ355.pdf","4,648 KB","002283 - State University of New York at Albany (SUNY Albany)","","003993 - Malawi.

"From 1973 to 1980, Jamaica underwent severe economic decline as a result of protectionist economic policies and greatly expanded social service programs.  In response, in 1981 A.I.D. initiated a cash transfer program which provided $396 million over a six-year period as support for economic stabilization and structural adjustment efforts.  The program focused on reducing government involvement in commercial enterprises and in production and investment decisions, maximizing the role of the private sector in national development, and encouraging export-led growth. According to this evaluation, the Government of Jamaica achieved many, although not all, of the policy reform goals.  Major achievements were:  (1) the development of a simplified and equitable tax system; (2) privatization of a broad array of public sector enterprises; (3) deregulation of export marketing organizations, leading to increased investments in the banana, coffee, and citrus industries; (4) reduction of subsidies and elimination of commodity price controls; (5) reduction of quantitative import restrictions; and (6) the doubling of nontraditional exports to countries outside the Caribbean Common Market. A negative result of the economic stabilization program, however, has been the deterioration of Jamaican living standards and social services. According to the report, these conditions were made even more severe by the Government of Jamaica's slowness in implementing economic stabilization policies. Serious efforts to make the exchange rate more competitive and to reduce central government expenditures were delayed until 1985, which only increased the strain on the poorest segments of the population.  Three major lessons were learned.  (1) Certain implementation requirements of structural adjustment and policy reform programs may be better addressed through project rather than program modes of assistance.  (2) Cross-conditionality between two A.I.D. programs is likely to magnify problems that arise within each program. (3) Coordination and complementarity across the A.I.D. portfolio contribute to the policy dialogue and reform process.","Appendices (AID working paper no. 120): PN-ABE-982|Summary highlights: PN-ABH-146","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","6/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Nonproject assistance|Policy dialogue|Conditionality|Equity|Cash transfers|Economic stabilization|Structural adjustment|Private sector|Policy reform","Jamaica","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAX220.pdf","163 KB","003433 - USAID.

"Evaluates Sudan's program for Control of Diarrheal Diseases (CDD). Evaluation covers the period through 1/89. CDD is a well-managed, balanced, and thoughtfully implemented program, which has achieved remarkable progress in its 3 years of existence despite political, economic, and logistic constraints. It has created an effective central unit able to develop relevant policies, training, and health educational materials. The policy of decentralization of authority and responsibility for CCD implementation and training has resulted in effective programs in most regions of Sudan. Major success has been achieved in training, especially in management training of senior staff and in paramedical, nurse, and community leader training in diarrhea case management. However, performance in training of physicians and pharmacists has been poor, reflecting some resistance by these professions to new simple techniques plus difficulties in reaching them with training courses and materials.  CDD has not yet developed a training program entirely suitable for these professions. Oral rehydration therapy (ORT) is now widely available, knowledge of and acceptance of its use is increasing among the public, and staff trained in its use are available in many health facilities. Efforts to ensure that one-litre measures are universally available have met with some success.  Although ORT is widely available, the system is not dependable or wholly effective, resulting in irregular and uncertain supplies in most areas.  The main problem appears to lie in the national medical supplies system, but some corrective action will probably be needed from CDD staff if an effective diarrhea treatment service is to be maintained. Success has been achieved in ensuring that all organizations concerned with health in Sudan are following nationally accepted guidelines.  Much valuable experience has been gained from the efforts of small, local organizations and communities to develop CDD activities. Central CDD staff have emphasised health education conducted during diarrhea consultations at health facilities and have successfully produced numerous print and visual materials to support this effort. Other communications channels, especially at the community level have remained largely unused except for many scattered experimental activities originating from regional and local initiatives. CDD has developed at the central and regional levels as a largely vertical program, with relatively little integration with other primary health care (PHC) activities.  The problem lies far more with the poor development of PHC than with any isolationist activities by CDD. Data collection and analysis and its use nationally or locally for planning is not currently effective.  As a result, it is difficult yet to measure programme impact. Problems in surveillance and supervision, which are both difficult elements in establishing a CDD programme in a country as vast as Sudan, with its communication difficulties, have not yet been adequately resolved.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","DPE-5969-Z-00-7064-00","","5/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Diarrhea|Oral rehydration therapy|Disease prevention and control|Health education|Physician education|Paramedical education","Sudan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAZ383.pdf","2,273 KB","000750 - Management Sciences for Health (MSH)","","000186 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to help the Government of Ecuador to develop more market-oriented agricultural policies and to include the private sector in policymaking. The project established a Policy Analysis Unit (PAU), located in the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA), to support MOA policy initiatives and to carry out a large research agenda.  The research strategy, which was designed to demonstrate the value of policy analysis research to policy makers, has not achieved the intended result.  While short-term TA has produced high-quality policy analysis, the overall success of the PAU has been minimal due to the limited availability of Ecuadorean economists, organizational confusion, and lack of credibility. A private sector unit, the Institute for Developing Strategies for Agriculture (IDEA), was also established by the project. IDEA, while having some organizational weaknesses, has made a creditable start. With a more focused research agenda, more collaborative efforts, and continued training, IDEA has the potential to become a reliable source of policy analysis in the macroeconomic, agricultural, and natural resource areas. In-service training activities and the development of a national agricultural information system have made notable progress, with the information collection/dissemination efforts on the whole being the most successful project component. The evaluation concludes that the project has made a reasonably good start, but that much more coordination and collaboration in design and implementation are needed.  The information component is ready to move toward institutionalization, but the policy component has not yet reached that stage. Project experience shows the importance of public and private involvement in the development of policy analysis especially when it is designed to catalyze or support policy change.  This evaluation illustrates the wide range of difficulties encountered in institutionalizing agricultural policy analysis, including the limitations of locating policy analysis units within Ministries of Agriculture, the impact of low salaries on recruitment and retention, the problems involved in sustaining such units on local resources, and tensions between a changing political process and need for continuity in capacity building.

"Start-up evaluation of the Agricultural Policy and Planning (APP) project, one in a series of activities designed to support the development of the Office of Studies and Planning (SEP) in Zaire's Department of Agriculture.  Awarded to Chemonics in 1987, the APP contract was conceived essentially as an institution building activity with major emphasis given to human resource development, TA, and primary data collection.  In the first 3 years of the project, seven long-term advisors will assist SEP to increase its analytical capabilities in the agricultural sector,. Preliminary data collection emphasizes a series of small scale studies or surveys. Due to the shift of the Government of Zaire (GOZ) and SEP priorities from commodity and regional studies to macroeconomic issues related to the agricultural sector, the evaluation team calls for a revision of the Project Paper, Project Agreement, and the Chemonics contract to more accurately reflect the real needs of the GOZ.  Other recommendations include the redefinition of various staffing positions, the development of realistic annual and quarterly work plans, and the enhancement of coordination efforts between USAID/Z, SEP, the Ministries of Planning and Finance, and donors.  The data collection component has had only marginal impact due to the almost total lack of new computer hardware and software, and the lack of a data collection advisor. It is recommended that if further delays are anticipated, short-term contracts should be used to meet the immediate data collection need. The evaluation concludes that both USAID/Z and Chemonics have significant opportunities to help the GOZ develop agricultural policy analysis during the next 2 years.  The team recommends a thorough review and revision of the project design to respond to the GOZ/SEP perceptions and priorities, and to increase the impact of the project.

"Evaluates the technical support components of A.I.D.'s PVO child survival program.  Evaluation covers the period 1985-1989. Johns Hopkins University (JHU), in close collaboration with the Bureau for Private and Voluntary Collaboration (PVC) has provided PVO's with high-quality technical support in child survival at costs that have been eminently reasonable, totalling about 3.5% of the total Child Survival Support Program budget. The PVC/JHU partnership has been close and productive and has provided a high level of technical expertise and support far beyond what PVC could acquire or maintain in-house. Deserving of special mention is the project's success in drawing expertise from a research-oriented university and interpreting this to PVO's in acceptable and practically meaningful ways.  Indeed, it was somewhat surprising to find that the more onerous professional and technical requirements of the mandatory procedures such as proposals, detailed implementation plans, health information systems, and evaluations are more strongly endorsed by PVO's than the discretionary procedures such as the largely PVO-initiated technical consultants, the orientation visits, and the like. From 1985 to the present, overall PVO technical capacity has been strengthened to the extent that the PVO's are now clearly in a position to exercise an increasingly significant influence on the reduction of infant mortality in less developed countries and therefore more effectively to meet the ultimate purpose of the whole PVO Child Survival Program. Not only have PVO capacities to develop, implement, and manage Child Survival projects specifically been strengthened, but the technical support provided by the project has improved PVOs' overall sustainability and competitiveness in ways relevant to all their health-related programs. Of particular significance for the future of the PVO Child Survival Program, this technical support has contributed to a steady movement by PVO's in the direction of readiness to assume increasing responsibility for determining their own technical support needs and for taking the initiative in securing such support from a variety of resources.

"Interim evaluation of a project to improve on-farm grain drying and storage practices in Kenya's Nyanza and Western Provinces by providing TA, training, commodities, and construction services to the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA).  The evaluation covers the period 7/83-3/89. The project has been successful in developing, testing, and demonstrating effective technological packages for reducing postharvest losses of maize.  To date, 1,764 improved grain structures have been erected in the project area, and a Grain Monitoring Unit (GMU) has been established with facilities to evaluate grain samples for damage from insects, molds, and rodents.  The project has also enhanced the capacity of Kenya's agricultural educational institutions to teach grain postharvest management, and has demonstrated the capacity to transfer the technology to small farmers.  Preliminary adoption rates make the technology appear viable as a major extension thrust in western Kenya, though much effort will be needed to achieve its general adoption. Delivery mechanisms found effective in the technology transfer process have included:  mini-clusters of neighboring farmers, demonstration structures, field days on specific postharvest practices, and a package of reference materials, films, and other teaching aids.  The technology appears feasible economically, with internal rates of return for the total management package ranging from 24% to 34% on total capital investment - a figure that the nutritional and public health benefits of improved maize quality could raise to 40%.  The projected benefit-cost ratio at 15% annual discount rate to year 2001 is 1.22, with corresponding net present value of Kshs 152 million. Major implementation constraints include the lack of mobility of extension staff, delays in filling key posts, insufficient coordination between the involved divisions of the MOA at the national level, emphasis on structures rather than management techniques, and the location of the GMU in Maseno.  Moreover, the planned program to provide B.Sc. and M.Sc. instruction to technical officers was not conducted due to delayed implementation and uncertain implementation terms. The program now needs to move from the demonstration stage to a transitional stage of sharing the costs of the improved structures with adoptor farmers.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","3/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural storage facilities|Post harvest food losses|Food storage|Maize|Agricultural technology|Agricultural extension","Kenya","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAZ405.pdf","3,139 KB","003716 - Kenya.

"Conventional wisdom considers small farmers to be tied to their land, resistant to change, and influenced as much by tradition as by reason. In the countering view of the present study, a reflective summary of unpublished studies (mostly Ph.D. dissertations) of small farmers' attitudes toward economic development, small farmers appear eager to improve their status by entering the market economy - they are the microentrepreneurs of rural areas. The small-farm household, which emerged as the proper unit of analysis, was found to be a complex and diversified economic enterprise, subsistence farming being only one of many productive activities. In making economic decisions, small farmers appear to be driven by goals which are hierarchically structured. The basic level is the establishment of their household base through subsistence production, while the highest is the securement of an independent income for all adult household members. Although tradition is important, small farmers take risks appropriate to their situation, protecting their current position in order to advance to the next level. Thus, from the perspective of the small farm householder, economic development ultimately means transcending small-farmer status, either by becoming a large farmer or, more often, by becoming a part-time farmer whose primary economic activity is elsewhere. The final section of the report makes recommendations for considering these aspirations in the design of economic development projects aimed at small farmers.","Summary: PN-ABG-027|Related bibliography: PN-ABE-979","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","6/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Small farms|Farmers|Off farm employment|Subsistence farming|Human behavior|Attitude|Farm management","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAX217.pdf","1,297 KB","003433 - USAID.

"Alemaya University of Agriculture is the primary institution of agricultural higher education in Ethiopia and the only institution offering B.S. and M.S. degrees in agriculture.  From its establishment in 1952 through 1968, the University received major institutional development assistance from A.I.D.  This report measures the impact Alemaya has made through its graduates and its research and extension activities.  The University has granted 1,629 diplomas, 2,558 B.S. degrees, and 81 M.S. degrees, and graduates are employed at all levels of administration and education in Ethiopian society.  Research results produced by Alemaya faculty are eagerly awaited by the Government and by farmers, and many plant varieties developed by the University are in use throughout the agricultural economy.  Alemaya-developed techniques in animal breeding and conversion of waste by-products have also been successfully implemented.  These accomplishments have been achieved under conditions of considerable hardship. The University is extremely understaffed, largely due to the exodus of faculty members during and after the 1974 revolution. Nevertheless, the University is not highly politicized, but rather presents the image of a technocracy, heavily oriented to achieving agricultural breakthroughs.  Although Alemaya has solid leadership and appears poised for rapid progress, neither donors nor the Ethiopian Government appear inclined to provide the University with necessary support.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","6/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural education|Agricultural colleges|Agricultural research|Agricultural extension","Ethiopia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAX219.pdf","730 KB","003433 - USAID.

"Evaluates two components of the Irrigation Management Systems project in Egypt.  One component aims to replace small- and mid-size irrigation structures and the other is to establish a project preparation unit (PPU) within the Ministry of Public Works and Water Resource (MPWWR) to carry out feasibility and prefeasibility studies of prospective investment in irrigation. External evaluation covers the period 1981-4/89. Both components have benefited from project TA and produced useful, high-quality products.  Structural replacement has resulted in more than 7,000 new small- and mid-size masonry and concrete structures to take the place of old or no longer functional structures controlling water in the Nile Basin irrigation system.  About 2,000 additional structures are currently under construction and/or scheduled to be completed by mid-1989.  The structures are functional and of satisfactory quality. This component has also increased the capability of Egyptian contractors to contribute to construction projects in rural parts of the country, and it has strengthened the supervision capacity of the MPWWR. The PPU has produced 11 high-quality reports in English and a number of reports in Arabic assessing the economic feasibility of a wide range of potential investment projects in the irrigation sector.  Some of these studies have led directly to construction and completed projects, while one helped the MPWWR avoid an uneconomic investment.  In addition, this component has resulted in substantial numbers of people better trained in feasibility analysis, a skill which needs strengthening in the MPWWR. Despite these achievements, neither component will meet all objectives by their respective completion dates.  Approximately 2,000 more irrigation structures need replacement, and the PPU is not yet considered capable of producing high-quality reports in English on its own.  These shortfalls are attributed to overly ambitious project targets, particularly regarding the time needed to institutionalize a new agency such as the PPU.  It is recommended that the structural replacement component be extended for 2 years, and that the PPU receive scaled-down TA comprised of one multidisciplinary advisor and a generous supply of short-term consultants for 3 more years.  However, before these extensions are improved the MPWWR must take steps to resolve certain key administrative constraints in such areas as staffing, salary incentives, and per diems.","ISPAN activity no. 640B|Project title: Irrigation support project for Asia and the Near|East (ISPAN)","Special Evaluation","Documents","ANE-0289-C-00-7044-00","","4/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Irrigation system construction|Institution building|Irrigation sites|Pre investment surveys","Egypt","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAZ424.pdf","1,345 KB","000333 - Camp Dresser and McKee, Inc.

"Evaluates project to help LDC's to improve their coastal resources management (CRM) by adopting integrated approaches to regional planning and resources management.  The project is implemented by the University of Rhode Island (URI), and includes pilot activities in Sri Lanka, Ecuador, and Thailand. At mid-term, the project is progressing well, and has shown that an integrated approach to CRM is indeed needed, and that U.S. experience in coastal planning is relevant to LDC's.  Working through a Cooperative Agreement with a results-oriented university has been an effective approach. Substantial accomplishments in institution building have occurred in all three pilot countries.  While there is a considerable difference among the countries, progress in all cases has been more rapid than in similar U.S. programs.  In Ecuador, the project is farthest advanced, with a national CRM program (initiated by Presidential decree in 1/89), planning and development activities in local areas underway, and strong public support.  The project approach has been mandated as the model for national natural resource planning.  Progress is least in Thailand, partly because it has been operating less than 2 years and partly because the institutional structure and operational plans are being worked out slowly in Thailand's environmental planning agency.  A notable exception to the slow progress has been the formulation and implementation of a coral protection strategy in Phi Phi National Park and the Phuket vicinity.  Sri Lanka, with the project's direct assistance, has completed and adopted the first national CRM plan in a USAID country, and possesses a well-organized institutional structure. Implementation of field activities is slow due to governmental operational gaps, inability of the Coast Conservation Department to expand its capable but small staff, widespread ethnic conflict, and a deteriorating economy. URI has emphasized sustainability by involving host country counterparts in project management, emphasizing public education to create demand for resources management, and strengthening CRM capacity through training, university strengthening, and extensive use of host country experts.  In Sri Lanka and Ecuador, sustainability has already been achieved. A.I.D. is to be commended for choosing URI to implement the project. URI appears to have made a substantial commitment to the project, but should be encouraged to meet its match requirements through funding core staff with state funds. A.I.D. funding has been below authorized levels. Current funding levels are insufficient to move the pilot projects into a substantive and more costly implementation phase.  Nor will they allow URI to carry out all planned outreach, communication, and training activities. USAID Missions strongly support the project.  USAID/Sri Lanka calls it ""one of the most successful centrally funded projects."" Follow-on efforts are being being designed in Thailand and Sri Lanka, while in Ecuador, CRM is an important component of the Mission's Natural Resources Strategy. Of particular value is A.I.D.'s initiative to invest in a project that involves long-term TA in a few countries.  A project such as this allows the testing of policy options to resolve an identified series of natural resource management issues.

"Midterm evaluation of P.L. 480 Title II program in Mauritania. External evaluation covers the period 7/83-5/89. The Government of Mauritania (GOM) has at least partially accomplished all four self-help measures:  the price of imported wheat is at import parity; a gradual and controlled liberalization is occurring in agricultural input markets; cereal markets are also being decontrolled; and free food distributions have declined.  However, the GOM's progress is primarily in less important areas and the impact of these efforts is not concrete. For example, it is difficult to find a direct causal link between the self-help measures as implemented and increases in agricultural production during the program period. Strategically, the program attempts to accomplish too much in too many sectors, and as a result, some of its objectives and policies are conflicting or ambiguous.  As an example, the use of import price parity to determine cereal prices has contributed to pricing imported wheat lower than local cereals - an unacceptable situation. The program has also contributed to institutional strengthening, and its internal operations management is extremely strong. Staff development is exceptional, management routines and procedures are in place, and data collection and monitoring information are of high quality.  However, while the program has also improved the level of policy dialogue, it has not received the analytic support it requires in this area.  In order to strengthen the processes of policy reform and negotiation initiated under the program, it is recommended that a third phase of Title II assistance be approved.  Conditions for this phase should focus on cereals planning and market development, since there is substantial potential for growth in this sector. The generation and expenditure of local currency proceeds have followed A.I.D. guidance, though bank liquidity problems seriously threaten the timely use of funds.  Also, the Donor Common Fund has failed to increase the effectiveness of local currency expenditures; considerable work is needed to create a strategy for the Fund in order to justify further U.S. contributions.  Finally, the use of sorghum, of which Mauritania has substantial surpluses, is creating several problems.  The self-targeting commodity concept has had very lttle success and should not be continued in future projects which use sorghum as a subsidy vehicle.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","3/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Food for Peace Title II|Food production|Food security|Agricultural policy|Agricultural product marketing|Policy dialogue","Mauritania","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAZ478.pdf","2,257 KB","005742 - Louis Berger International, Inc.

"PACR of a project (7/83-3/89) to develop a farming systems research and development (FSRD) program within the Caribbean Agricultural Research and Development Institute (CARDI), centered in Trinidad with small units in Jamaica and Barbados. The project was at least partially responsible for transforming CARDI into a viable, financially sound institution.  It helped build a cadre of trained CARDI staff and adapted a FSRD methodology suitable to Eastern Caribbean conditions.  The project also developed several improved technologies which were adopted at the farm level, including: propagation of yams using ""mini-sets""; the identification of a yam variety tolerant to anthracnose; evaluation and release of white and sweet potato varieties; initiation of integrated pest management controls for cabbage insect problems; adaptation and demonstration of topworking of mangoes for export markets; the identification of the causal organism of the tannia ""burning"" disease along with simple controls which will allow expanded tannia cultivation; and distribution to farmers of improved planting materials for grains and rootcrops. As a result of the project, CARDI developed and implemented a structured annual planning, budgeting, and reporting process; a microcomputer-based management system and strategic plan; a performance appraisal system; and a planning and evaluation unit. Important linkages were also established between CARDI and the South-East Consortium for International Development (SECID), a U.S. group which provided TA in research methodology, personnel management, and computerization, as well as with other regional and international entities. Several lessons were learned.  Organizational change is slow in an institution such as CARDI and support is required until these changes become a permanent part of the institutional culture.  An institution such as CARDI must develop good internal technical and administrative systems as well as external linkages with regional and international organizations and public and private entities.  Long-term TA relationships such as that between CARDI and SECID are mutually beneficial in that host country scientists gain access to TA and training opportunities and U.S. scientists are able to test their assumptions under different geographic and cultural conditions.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","3/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Farming systems research|Research methodology|Institution building|Research centers|Agricultural technology","Eastern Caribbean|Trinidad and Tobago|Barbados|Jamaica","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAZ492.pdf","98 KB","001757 - USAID.

"PACR of an OPG (6/84-12/87) to the International Eye Foundation (IEF) to train physicians, nurses, and primary health care workers in Grenada in preventive and curative eye care and blindness prevention services. The project has notably improved eye care in Grenada.  The IEF Project Director, a U.S. ophthalmologist seconded to the Ministry of Health (MOH), played a central role in providing ophthalmological services to the public, training health care workers, and promoting blindness prevention as a community concern and a focus for action.  As a result of the project, Grenada has an eye care infrastructure which includes not only tertiary-level care at the Eye Unit of the General Hospital in St. George's, but also primary- and secondary-level care in the districts.  Several resources - schools, district health centers, the media, and community groups - have been integrated into project activities.  The project provided training in ophthalmology to the nurses at the St. George's Eye Unit.  These nurses now form a core group of secondary-level eye care providers with responsibility for handling most eye cases, as well as for training and supervising the district health workers who serve as primary eye care providers.  The team of nurses will eventually be augmented by a Grenadian ophthalmologist who is currently receiving advanced training overseas, partially under IEF auspices.  An island-wide eye care referral system has also been established. The project also had a positive impact on health care policy. The MOH and the administration of the St. George's General Hospital have agreed to retain the ophthalmic nurses in the Eye Unit rather than assign them elsewhere.  This commitment to the appropriate use of nursing staff has policy implications extending beyond eye care services.  The MOH and the hospital administration are also committed to instituting a fee-for-service schedule at the Eye Unit to generate the income that will be needed to finance the continued delivery of high quality eye care.  If successful, this practice should serve to promote acceptance of fee-for-service throughout the hospital and other clinical service facilities. A key lesson learned concerns the need to plan for post-project requirements during project design.  In this project, the sustainability of some activities was jeopardized by the short time-frame of the grant and the lack of planning concerning post-project financing.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","7/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Eye care|Health professional education|Nurses|Hospitals|Institution building|Health finance|Project sustainability|Private voluntary organizations","Grenada","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAZ493.pdf","889 KB","007707 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (1981-1986) to upgrade primary education in Botswana by establishing pre-service training programs within the University of Botswana (UB) and in-service programs within the Ministry of Education (MOE). The project undoubtedly had a viable and sustainable impact on primary education in Botswana, primarily due to strong cooperation among the Mission, the MOE, the UB, and the Ohio University TA team.  A Department of Primary Education was developed at the UB to provide diploma and bachelor's programs to older students (over 25) who had taught without having had the opportunity to study beyond high school. The successful U.S. participant training program was instrumental in this effort; all ten participants completed M.Ed. degrees on schedule and returned to teach at the UB, where in 1985 19 of 22 first semester courses were conducted by Batswana.  Participants have also assumed additional professional responsibilities, including conducting teacher workshops, serving on curriculum panels, and teaching in other UB departments. To provide in-service teacher education, MOE advisors cooperated with UB staff to offer a network of workshops for about 120 teachers and education officers per year.  These workshops - covering reading, math/science, and English as a second language - proved effective and worthwhile, especially because many participants conducted follow-on workshops in their districts. The project also succeeded in integrating Batswana staff into training teams, obtaining information concerning follow-on workshops, and improving selection criteria for workshop participants. The project was constrained by the lack of an operational MOE Department of Teacher Education, which would include primary, junior secondary, and senior secondary levels under one division. The responsibility for teacher education is still dispersed among different departments, straining scarce resources.  Project design was flawed in that it did not directly address problem areas in primary school curriculum development or in Botswana's four primary teacher training centers. Several lessons were learned regarding the role of contractors. (1) The involvement of contract staff in selected non-contract activities related to project implementation can contribute effectively to the project's objectives.  (2) Contractors occupying line positions in an institution or ministry can become both an asset and a detriment.  In this project, the Chief of Party also served as the head of the Department of Primary Education.  This situation simplified resource management, but placed the Chief in a difficult position in trying to meet both project targets and UB responsibilities.  (3) A contractor under a collaborative assistance mode contract has a vested interest in ensuring that the design of the project proposal is implemented in the most efficient manner.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","3/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Primary education|Universities and colleges|Participants|Teacher education|Teacher training|Masters degrees","Botswana","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAZ494.pdf","223 KB","008516 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (3/80-3/87) to expand the network of all-weather rural trails and access roads in selected regions of Honduras and to provide equipment repair services to the Directorate General of Maintenance (DGM). The project met or exceeded all objectives in road and bridge reconstruction and maintenance equipment repair, having completed 1,510 km of roads and trails, 8 bridges, and the repair of 50 pieces of maintenance equipment.  The rural roads constructed under the project cost an average of $16,750 a kilometer.  In relative terms, the geographic area covered by the project experienced substantial increases in agricultural production, commerce, and access to education and health services.  These improvements were largely due to agricultural and other extension services which could not work in the area until road construction facilitated their entry.  Unfortunately, however, project achievements were partially nullified when many rural roads constructed under the project subsequently deteriorated due to lack of maintenance by the DGM.  Rehabilitation of maintenance equipment was not an effective solution since the repaired equipment was diverted to other roads or uses.  Voluntary community participation activities did not materialize as envisioned in the project design for two reasons:  (1) the available workforce was insufficient because rural residents placed a higher priority on working in their fields and (2) contractors found it more efficient and therefore more profitable to use their own labor. Several lessons were learned.  (1) If rural road construction works are well monitored, considerable savings can be realized by paying contractors on a unit price basis rather than an hourly basis.  (2) Contracting out with a maximum contract of $500,000 expedites implementation and allows firm control over the project.  (3) Construction projects with maximum contract awards such as $500,000 should allow smaller firms the additional time they generally need to obtain bonding and fulfill other legal requirements.  (4) Construction manuals are indispensable for standardizing work that involves numerous contractors.  (5) Effective use of a rotating fund permits timely payments to contractors.  (6) Rural road construction projects, especially those that contract out to construction firms on a unit price basis, may find it unsuccessful to rely solely on volunteer community efforts for certain phases of the project.  As has been demonstrated in the follow-on project, it is more realistic to provide community members some compensation for their labor.","Loan no. 522-T-035","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","6/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Transportation infrastructure|Road construction|Bridge construction|Road maintenance|Access roads|Farm to market roads","Honduras","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAZ495.pdf","488 KB","008555 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (6/84-9/88) to assist the Association of Honduran Managers and Entrepreneurs (GEMAH) become a self-sustaining institution capable of providing high-quality management training services to its members and Honduran managers in general. The project surpassed targets for the number of training courses offered and persons trained by wide margins (54% and 39% respectively); the expanded membership goal was also met.  GEMAH also made substantial progress towards achieving economic self-sustainability.  GEMAH's annual income has increased from $23,000 in 1984 to over $350,000, and additional income is expected to be generated by recently initiated training programs for small and micro businesses.  Financial reviews project only minor deficits for 1988-1989 and full sustainability by 1990. GEMAH succeeded in expanding and diversifying its program with 29 new course offerings, compared with a targeted 12 courses.  Of these, 14 were developed in-house, and 15 were obtained from Mexico, Brazil, or Panama.  GEMAH has also met project goals to establish:  in-plant training and consulting services, formal linkages with private sector training institutions in other countries, and a management library and a magazine for GEMAH members. TA from the American Management Association was costly, representing 60% of the total A.I.D. investment in the project. Nonetheless, this TA was a key factor in providing high-quality, marketable training programs and in the project's rapid start-up. The high level of salaries for GEMAH's executive and instructional personnel was also questioned but proved justifiable in terms of the quality of project outputs.  The evaluation notes that projects of this kind should normally run 4 years rather than, as in the present case, 3 years.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","2/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Management training|Project sustainability|Entrepreneurs|Institution building","Honduras","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAZ496.pdf","100 KB","008555 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (9/84-3/88) to establish appropriate soil and water conservation practices on demonstration farms in St. Kitts-Nevis and to strengthen the indigenous capacity to maintain and extend these practices. The project achieved all targets for training of extension agents and science teachers and published soil conservation planning guides for both St. Kitts and Nevis.  Site-specific activities on Nevis were highly successful.  Though only 6-12 demonstration subprojects were planned, more than 20 were completed because of the strong interest and collaboration of the Nevis Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) and Nevisian farmers.  Follow-up and maintenance on these activities - the vast majority of which involved water storage for agricultural purposes - were also encouraging.  On St. Kitts, however, the project was characterized by abrupt changes of personnel, equipment misuse, and policy decisions that ran counter to the intent and conditions of the project design.  For example, efforts to develop a small farmer land settlement and food crop production activity were blocked from implementation on two different sites by the MOA/St. Kitts.  A primary reason for the lack of progress on St. Kitts was that a major project participant, the National Agricultural Corporation (NACO), merged with the St. Kitts Sugar Manufacturing Corporation (SSMC) early in the project.  Although SSMC was to assume all of NACO's responsibilities, hindsight shows that the sugar business took priority. A major weakness of the project was its inability to facilitate the development of supportive conservation legislation, policies, and regulations.  As a result, the conservation activities conducted by the project lack the legislative basis for institutionalization.  Thus, while the demonstration activities may be sustained with proper maintenance, the duplication of these practices throughout the country will depend on host government priorities and financial resources. Another lesson is that decisions on project extensions with concurrent TA contract extension should be weighed carefully in the light of host government capacity.  In this case, when the PACD (but not the TA contract) was extended for 6 months, work effectively closed down with the departure of the TA team, especially on St. Kitts.  The project also showed that what is successful on Nevis will not necessarily be successful on St. Kitts.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","6/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Soil conservation|Water conservation|Water storage|Agricultural water management|Institution building|Pilot projects","Saint Kitts-Nevis","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAZ497.pdf","266 KB","001757 - USAID.

"PACR of a subproject (SP) (1/87-12/89) to help the Government of the Ivory Coast (GOIC) improve its natural resource planning and analysis through a state-of-the-art remote sensing and digital image processing system.  USAID/IC collaborated on the SP with the World Bank, UNDP/FAO, Fonds Europeen de Developpement, and the Government of France. SP objectives have been demonstrably met.  The high quality and timeliness of analytical documents produced by the national remote sensing facility have resulted in significant improvement in the design, implementation, and monitoring of natural resource-related activities. Current activities include a national forest inventory and the mapping of fallow lands, forest reserves, and geology and structure.  Moreover, the process of computer-enhancing imagery acquired under the SP largely resolved a pervasive and longstanding technical problem with satellite imagery applications in West Africa.  The SP was also a major success with respect to donor coordination.  Compared with similar A.I.D.-funded projects in Khartoum, Ouagadougou, and Nairobi, the Abidjan project was handled rapidly and successfully.  A.I.D. received tremendous publicity for the SP during the world's largest and longest-running international symposium on remote sensing held in Abidjan in 10/88. There are 3 outstanding concerns related to the continued operational viability and quality of the remote sensing facility's output:  (1) in-house hard copy production capabilities have yet to be realized; (2) expansion of the national remote sensing facility to undertake regional responsibilities should be pursued; and (3) the issue of improved access to remote sensing resources for technicians throughout the GOIC needs to be resolved. Four important lessons were learned.  (1) Remote sensing assistance can be one of the most cost-effective technical interventions in support of natural resource management.  (2) National remote sensing centers appear to have clear advantages over regional centers and have the potential to develop effective, responsive, and applied regional responsibilities. (3) National remote sensing facilities should be located within a single, strong, operational institution that has direct, immediate, and diverse needs for the technology.  (4) Even for non-industrialized countries, state-of-the-art remote sensing technology may be the most appropriate technology.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","7/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Remote sensing|Natural resource inventories|Satellites|Natural resource management","Ivory Coast","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAZ498.pdf","421 KB","008562 - USAID.

"Mid-term evaluation of a project component to expand the voluntary sterilization (VS) activities of the Indnesian Association for Secure Contraception (PKMI).  The evaluation covers the period 1984-3/89. There have been a number of accomplishments.  Some 201 district hospitals and 269 health centers in 13 provinces (including 70% of the country's population) have been renovated and equipped to support the provision of VS services.  Over 400 medical teams and 1,000 counselors have been trained, and 143 community leaders oriented  to VS.  A sterilization reversal center, located at the Raden Saleh Clinic in downtown Jakarta, has been established by the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology of the University of Indonesia, Jakarta. On the negative side, PKMI has little authority to assure that its wishes are being implemented, and it lacks a mechanism to guarantee quality assurance.  Medical supervision is not carried out by highly qualified, motivated experts.  Reporting procedures are inadequate - timely reporting of deaths and major complications among patients does not regularly occur.  Vasectomy training is not meeting targeted levels, while provincial chapters of PKMI do not possess sufficient funding/staffing for medical trainee follow-up.  Reimbursements to service units from the National Family Planning Coordinaton Board (BKKBN) are often delayed, and approximately 25% of the laparoscopes used in tubectomies are in need of repair due to a lack of maintenance funding.  Poor communications have caused strains between USAID/Indonesia and the cooperating agency, the Association for Voluntary Surgical Contraception. A total of 24 recommendations address the above-noted problems. These include:  considering the creation of sliding scale so that clients pay acording to their ability; expanding IEC; and continuing efforts to obtain more support from support of private practioners and hospitals for VS.","Companion evaluation summary: PD-AAZ-899|Project title: Population technical assistance (POPTECH)","Special Evaluation","Documents","DPE-3024-2-00-8078-00","","8/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Sterilization (birth control)|Health facilities|Health workers|Paramedical education|Laparoscopy|Tubal ligations|Vasectomies","Indonesia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAZ540.pdf","2,252 KB","006243 - Dual & Associates, Inc.|000673 - International Science and Technology Institute, Inc.

"External mid-term evaluation of a project to strengthen irrigation management in Pakistan. The project has registered considerable success with respect to Stage One activities, but has been far less successful with respect to Stage Two.  Specifically, project investment in civil works has generated considerable enthusiasm among line departments and farmers.  Although there are no quantitative impact data, government officials and farmers report that these works have improved water availability and generally increased agricultural production.  But the project has had only limited success in institutionalizing improved government procedures and capabilities, generating broad-based farmer participation, or improving the appropriateness or availability of nonwater inputs to farmers in project areas.  It has not yet demonstrated how it can build upon initial enthusiasm to promote sustained increases in agricultural productivity through improved management of water and nonwater inputs. The project's shortcomings have come about largely because of organizational and financial constraints to effective project management and meaningful farmer participation; inadequate understanding regarding the project's stated long-term development objectives; and the comparatively high level of project resources devoted to civil works. Similarly, strengthening of water use associationsr for sustainable civil works activities is constrained by low levels of organizational, technical, and managerial skills; lack of incentives for further cooperative endeavor after completion of watercourse renovation; and the preemptive position of vested interests in rural development initiatives. Given the challenges posed by these constraints, the high level of attention and staff time thus far committed to civil works has cost the project some critical time in identifying and developing interventions to address its stated long-term goals.  The limited efforts in farmer organization, water management techniques, technology transfer, input supply, credit, and marketing have yet to produce replicable models for improved management of irrigated agriculture.  The result is that both farmers and project staff view civil works as the only continuing activity.  (Author abstract)","ISPAN activity no. 624A|Contents: v. 1. Findings and recommendations -- v. 2.

"Evaluation of a cooperative agreement with the African-American Labor Center (AALC) to provide assistance to trade unions, cooperatives, and credit unions through long-term programs in 11 African countries and short-term projects in 10-15 additional African countries.  External evaluation involved site visits to Kenya, Botswana, Zaire, and Senegal and covers the period 1985-1989. AALC has managed the grant well, particularly considering the field personnel reductions and program changes that were necessitated by overall budget cuts and changing circumstances in Africa.  AALC's flexibility and responsiveness is evident in that it has expanded one program dramatically (Sudan), reduced another sharply (Ghana), and started six new country programs. Similarly, one regional program has been dropped because of budget cuts and inadequate African support and one has been expanded to reflect African unions' desires for more worker services.  The content of the AALC program has also been modified. While training is still the most important element, the types of training provided have shifted from information, communications, finances, and industrial relations to responses to the economic crisis, labor economics, and instructor training. Country program objectives have shifted from strengthening the central headquarters to strengthening regional operations and expanding services to affiliates. In response to the increase in structural adjustment programs among African nations, AALC has also begun to emphasize economic training and research. AALC has complied with A.I.D. requirements on progress reporting, but the reports are too long, lack information on overall labor trends, and are presented in a format not very useful to project officers or others interested in the program.  AALC's financial reporting also meets requirements, but does not provide information in accordance with country program objectives. Annual budget submissions have been excessive in volume and detail. Potential impact of the program has been reduced for three reasons: (1) reduction of the overall budget by about $1 million due to expansion of the Sudan program, (2) erosion of funding by inflation and the drop in the value of the dollar, and (3) habitually late A.I.D. approval of annual budgets.  The AALC perceives a lack of appreciation on the part of A.I.D./W and the Missions, while A.I.D. has the attitude that the AALC is not a legitimate development agency, but rather a creature of the State Department.  Given this antagonistic relationship and AALC's good track record, a grant agreement rather than a cooperative agreement should be used to finance the follow-on program. A follow-on is also justified by the increasing maturity of African trade unions, and their potential for playing an important role in their respective countries' economic development.  Both AALC and A.I.D. should recognize that many African unions are capable of acting as intermediaries in A.I.D. programs.","Companion evaluation summary: PD-ABJ-542","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-5317-I-03-8127-00","","6/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Trade unions|Credit unions|Cooperatives","Africa south of Sahara|Sudan|Kenya|Botswana|Congo DR|Senegal","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAZ548.pdf","2,654 KB","000436 - Development Associates, Inc.","","000004 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of a Catholic Relief Services (CRS) project to establish a women's industrial sewing cooperative in Jordan's Mafraq area.  External evaluation covers the period 1984-3/89. Implementation suffered from a substandard feasibility study which made erroneous assumptions regarding the capabilities of the participating organizations.  The entity charged with operating the sewing center, the Arab Women's Society (AWS), required assistance in marketing and in establishing a cooperative, but such assistance was never provided because the Government of Jordan, CRS, and USAID/J were inexperienced in enterprise development.  The project had persistent difficulty in recruiting and retaining appropriate marketing specialists and production technicians because of a shortage of these skills in the remote Mafraq area and in Jordan generally.  (USAID/J recognized the need for additional training, but lacked appropriate mechanisms for training rural women.)  The performance of AWS was further constrained by CRS' failure to involve AWS in the project design process.  When it seemed highly unlikely that AWS could take over the project as planned, the project was transferred in 3/89 to a private enterprise, the Noor al-Hussein Foundation. Nevertheless, the project produced several important benefits: steady, non-seasonal incomes; increased savings and investment in labor-saving devices; professional work habits; improved attitudes towards women's paid work; and increased awareness of the difficulty of implementing WID and income-generating projects.  Financially, the project's benefit-cost ratio of 5.77 indicates a good opportunity for further effective investment, and garment sales covered all production and direct plant management costs by 1986.  However, the project was never able to cover indirect management costs, and it is not clear that it will be able to cover these costs even with the support of the Noor al-Hussein Foundation.  It is recommended that USAID/J consider continued involvement with the project either by providing TA to the Foundation or by financing replication of the project by the Foundation or other organizations. Several lessons were learned.  (1) Before committing project funding, USAID should determine that accurate feasibility analyses have been undertaken and obtain commitments from all participating organizations. (2) Project approval should be made conditional on the capabilities of participating organizations and not rely on certain individuals within the organizations.  (3) The timeframe of income-generation projects should be expanded to 5 years.  (4) USAID should consider funding nontraditional income-generation activities for women, particularly in light of restrictions on the development of enterprises potentially competitive with the U.S. textile industry.","Companion project evaluation summary: PD-ABC-247","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","3/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Women in development|Income generation|Textile industry|Sewing|Employment|Cooperatives","Jordan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAZ549.pdf","889 KB","008564 - USAID.

"Interim evaluation of a project component to help the Indonesia National Family Planning Coordinating Board (BKKBN) expand family planning (FP) education and service delivery and improve contraceptive social marketing in the country's 27 largest cities.  External evaluation covers the period 1983-2/89. After initial delays, activities have gathered momentum and impressive progress has been made.  To expand private sector delivery of FP services, the project has trained and provided informational materials to more than 3,200 doctors and midwives; some 2,000 of these have also received IUD kits.  An IEC campaign, with attractive, well-designed, and tested materials, has been carried out in 11 cities with plans to include 16 more in 1989.  Social marketing campaigns were formally launched in four cities in 2/89 with citywide public relations events that included many high-level dignitaries.  Expansion to six more cities is planned in the next six months. TA provided to the BKKBN and involved nongovernmental and commercial organizations has been utilized well.  Coordination among the institutions has improved, with a substantial increase in information-sharing and a shift to the private sector of implementation responsibilities.  Another measure of progress is the growth in FP awareness and use.  According to a national survey, knowledge of contraceptive methods in urban areas increased from 90% in 1983 to 97.5% in 1987, and prevalence rose from an average of about 42% in 1983 to 54% at the end of 1987. Of urban contraceptive users, 25% now procure them from private sources as compared to 10% in 1983.

"Mid-term evaluation of a cooperative agreement with Eastern Virginia Medical School to conduct research and disseminate information on improved family planning methods for use in developing countries. External evaluation covers the period 9/86-3/89. The project has moved rapidly and successfully to initiate numerous activities in contraceptive research.  The intramural (in-house) research program is making good progress in a number of areas, such as (1) the GnRH antagonist subproject (SP), which involves suppression of gonadotropin secretion through the use of the compound Nal-Lys-GnRH antagonist, and (2) reproductive immunology efforts, which focus on identifying, characterizing, and isolating sperm- and egg-based antigens germane to fertilization.  Research on spermicide and virucide screening is also under way as part of an initiative on the prevention of the heterosexual transmission of HIV.  The project has also funded 40 extramural SP's, and held two international workshops.  An excellent technical advisory committee has been assembled, and the SP's developed seem appropriate, necessary, and scientifically feasible.  Excellent working relations have been established with other contraceptive research and development organizations, both national and international. Project weaknesses are primarily related to an overemphasis on longer-term leads in the research portfolio.  In particular, the clinical research component of the intramural program has had a slower start than anticipated, although staff and facilities are now in place to accommodate a heavier load of SP's if they can be identified. Another problem is that management has not complied with the project mandate to allocate two-thirds of project research resources for the extramural component (research with outside institutions) and one-third to the intramural. Currently, about half of the resources are supporting intramural research and the extramural component is not receiving the attention anticipated from the intramural staff. That the project has gotten somewhat off course is largely due to a lack of firm management control.  Planning of staff time and resource allocation is inadequate, and staff have not routinely attempted either to articulate goals or identify progress indicators.  Project monitoring and budgeting systems also need to be improved.","Project title: Population technical assistance (POPTECH)","Special Evaluation","Documents","DPE-3024-Z-00-8078-00","","7/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Contraceptive research|Disease research","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAZ551.pdf","2,070 KB","006243 - Dual & Associates, Inc.|000673 - International Science and Technology Institute, Inc.

"Final evaluation of a project to help Nepal's Ministry of Health (MOH) to integrate its rural health and family planning services. External evaluation covers the period 1980-2/88, with emphasis on the post-1985 period. The project made very limited progress in improving the ability of the MOH to administer an integrated health system.  As a result, the main recipient of project support, the Integrated Community Health Service Delivery Project (ICHSDP), was abandoned following a 1984 evaluation.  Problems that marred ICHSDP performance are still very much in evidence, including overcentralized planning, poor financial and information management, and a personnel system that gives little or no support to field workers. The MOH's Health Planning Division did not perform as hoped, and vertical health programs continued to do their own planning.  The village health committee component made some progress, but committee functions need to be better defined.  Field worker training proceeded fairly satisfactorily, but the drug stocking and distribution system has proved unworkable and should be abandoned.  On the positive side, some integrated facilities appear to be functioning very well. In expanding family planning/health care services, the project had its greatest success in the area of voluntary surgical contraception (VSC).  Quantitative goals were met, and VSC now accounts for 86% of all contraceptive use in Nepal.  However, the number of VSC's performed annually declined after 1985, and the adoption of temporary methods has lagged far behind VSC.  The performance of family planning field workers was negatively affected by a lack of training, and personnel turnover was high due to extremely demanding outreach responsibilities.  With regard to child survival interventions, the project primarily provided support to the expanded program of immunization and oral rehydration therapy.  Some support was also provided in the areas of acute respiratory infection control, maternal health, and nutrition. After dropping the ICHSDP, the MOH developed a new policy aimed at integrating its vertical projects nationwide.  While it is recommended that USAID/N support this new thrust, it is advised that efforts be concentrated in one region, rather than on trying to support implementation nationwide.","Project title: Population technical assistance (POPTECH)","Special Evaluation","Documents","DPE-3024-Z-00-7079-00|DPE-3024-Z-00-8078-00","","2/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Family planning services|Integrated health care|Health care administration","Nepal","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAZ552.pdf","2,968 KB","006243 - Dual & Associates, Inc.|000673 - International Science and Technology Institute, Inc.

"Interim evaluation of a project to provide training to key family planning professionals in Morocco and sub-Saharan Francophone Africa in the areas of program management, clinical practice training, and advocacy work.  The Johns Hopkins Program for International Education in Gynecology and Obstretics (JHPIEGO) implemented the program, in conjunction with the National Training Center for Reproductive Health (NTCRH) in Rabat, Morocco.  External evaluation covers the period 1988-89. The physician and nurse clinicians' courses conducted by the project rate highly in organization, trainers, and overall content and the trainees reported a positive learning environment.  The clinical content of courses was highly relevant to the trainees' work, and excellent opportunities were provided for practicing acquired skills in clinical settings.  Criticism of the nurse clinicians' course relates primarily to the management portion, which presented a great deal of new material in a short period, causing difficulty for trainees in grasping some of the concepts.  If clinical management is to be continued, more needs analysis, in-country evaluation, and course development are required. Recommendations for improving the quality of both the physician and nurse clinicians' courses center on increased availability of reference materials, individual needs assessment, and early detection of weak clinical skills. The NTCRH's organizational structure, policies, procedures, in-house expertise, and course materials support the delivery of high-quality family planning courses.  However, functions relating to needs assessment and evaluation are not yet fully institutionalized, resulting in an insufficient information base for certain course components.  The NTCRH has developed the capacity to ensure that training programs operate smoothly by effectively managing transportation, visas, lodging, meals, field practice, and support services.  To improve NTCRH's institutional capability, highest priority should be given to conducting systematic in-country follow-ups to ensure that the JHPIEGO/NTCRH program remains a relevant resource to family planning programs.","Project title: Population technical assistance (POPTECH)","Special Evaluation","Documents","DPE-3024-Z-00-8078-00","","8/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Health professional education|Nursing education|Physician education|Management training|Family planning","Morocco|French speaking Africa|Africa south of Sahara","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAZ553.pdf","679 KB","006243 - Dual & Associates, Inc.|000673 - International Science and Technology Institute, Inc.

"Evaluates project to provide overseas training and field experience in population and family planning to recent U.S. college/university graduates or mid-career professionals. full external evaluation covers the period 8/84-3/89. The project has generally been successful.  Despite the need to seek buy-in funding in 1985 due to a 33% reduction in core funding, the University of Michigan placed some 30 U.S. fellows in 17 countries.  Of the 21 fellows who have completed their field assignments, 14 are employed by A.I.D. cooperating agencies, 4 are working in LDC family planning programs supported by other agencies, 2 are taking graduate studies in population, and 1 is seeking employment.  The project has also made good use of the fellows to provide inexpensive and valuable TA to LDC family planning and population programs. At the project management level, fellow selection, logistical arrangements, and implementor-host government communication were either satisfactory or above standard.  Field site selection proceeded smoothly until the need to seek buy-ins arose.  At that point, the range of feasible placement countries narrowed significantly, the identification of host-country agencies became more difficult, and the placing of fellows began to slow.  Better background and language training for project fellows could have ameliorated some of the difficulties experienced in the first months of host-country placement. Recommendations are to:  (1) extend the project for at least 4 years; (2) permit more buy-ins and provide sufficient core funding to allow adequate program management; (3) permit external funding for host-agency strengthening activities (e.g., joint research, on-site training) without the monies counting toward project funding ceilings; (4) expand efforts to obtain buy-in support; and (5) establish closer contacts with fellows in the field - particularly during the first 6 months of placement.","Project title: Population technical assistance (POPTECH)","Special Evaluation","Documents","DPE-3024-Z-00-8078-00","","8/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Population programs|Family planning|Population education|Technical assistance","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAZ554.pdf","1,005 KB","006243 - Dual & Associates, Inc.|000673 - International Science and Technology Institute, Inc.

"PACR of a project (7/84-6/88) to provide training in cocoa production and processing to farmers at two sites in Belize - Ringtail Village and the Valley of Peace.  Hummingbird Hershey Limited (HHL), the Hershey Foods Corporation's farm near Belmopan, Belize, collaborated on the project, as did several PVO's. Farmer and extensionist training targets were met and in some cases exceeded, a methodology was developed for accelerating cocoa production under Belizean conditions, and three major technical publications were prepared.  Only 415 of a targeted 600 acres of cocoa were planted, however, partly because of fire damage to cocoa trees from slash and burn cropping.  In Ringtail Village, the shortfall was also caused by an unrealistic project design, which expected participating farmers (in addition to being full-time HHL employees) to plant 10 acres of cocoa plus subsistence crops, build a family residence, and assist with community development activities.  In the Valley of Peace, cocoa development was constrained by poor soil quality and by tensions between Belizeans and Salvadoran refugees.  The lack of a clear public policy on refugees/aliens, compounded by divided leadership in the community, should have disqualified the Valley of Peace from participating in the project. The project also assisted in the formation and start-up funding of the Toledo Cocoa Growers Assocation, and - with contributions from HHL - initiated several community activities which helped develop Ringtail Village into a dynamic, self-reliant agricultural community:  economic activities for women; construction of roads and water supply structures; development of a credit union. Significant advantages resulted from combining HHL's resources with public and PVO efforts.  HHL's corporate interests in cocoa development were compatible with the government's and the implementing PVO's were able to enhance the resources of both. HHL contributed the use of its facilities, equipment, and personnel.  The dynamic leadership of the HHL farm manager in Ringtail Village fostered a working camaraderie that immediately facilitated cooperation and mutual confidence.  The creativity allowed by the OPG mechanism was also responsible for several successful interorganizational linkages that expanded the benefits and assured project sustainability. Several lessons were learned.  (1) Seasonal training with an emphasis on practical field demonstrations is better for farmers, while intensive short courses combining cocoa technology and extension methods is most effective for extensionists.  (2) The incompatibility of permanent tree crops and annual slash and burn systems dictates that fire-free areas be established.  (3) The economic prospects for small-scale commercial cocoa production are excellent, but more study is needed in two areas - short-term cash crops (while cocoa trees are being established) and multipurpose intercrops (for long-term diversification).","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","5/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Cocoa|Agricultural extension|Cacao trees|Farmer training|Agricultural training","Belize|El Salvador","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAZ556.pdf","273 KB","008513 - USAID.

"PACR of a subproject (SP) (5/84-9/88) to improve the effectiveness of the Government of Rwanda's (GOR) forestry extension system in the 3 communes of Cyeru, Butaro, and Nyamugali in Ruhengeri Prefecture. The SP is strongly supported by the President of Rwanda, and most targets - e.g., planting 400 ha of communal woodlot and up to 2,500 ha of private farmland, and establishing 37 nurseries - were met prior to the original PACD of 9/87.  However, delays in the construction of a house for the forestry extension officer in Butaro forced 2 extensions of the PACD, while construction of a house in Nyamugali was canceled because an extension officer was never assigned to the commune.  The SP accrued unexpected expenses for both nursery workers, who originally were to be self-financed through the commercialization of nurseries, and for casual laborers.  Although the SP responded to the mid-term evaluation by reducing the use of casual labor and increasing UMUGANDA (commune self-help) efforts, the unexpected labor costs forced the elimination of short-term TA from the SP.  The TA component was further reduced when the last of 3 Peace Corps volunteers assigned to the SP resigned in 10/86.  Also in response to the mid-term evaluation, the SP established a training curriculum which emphasized on-the-job training of extension officers, who in turn instructed farmers in alley cropping, intercropping, and nursery techniques. SP evaluation was made difficult by the fact that the project lacked both a logframe and a technical management plan for self-sustainability. A proposed framework recommended in the mid-term evaluation was not adopted by USAID/R, and Mission reviews focused only on physical outputs and achievements.  On the positive side, an unplanned reforestation demonstration plot with a small nursery, established near the project office in Cyeru, provided a center for local extension activities and permitted field trials of forestry and groundcover species of proven quality without the risk of on-farm failure.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","3/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Forestry|Extension services|Reforestation","Rwanda","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAZ557.pdf","290 KB","008598 - USAID.

"Since the late 1960's, A.I.D. and much of the donor community have adopted rural-based development strategies - often deemphasizing urbanization or even considering it as a problem. This paper discusses the importance of urbanization in overall national development, with a specific focus on rural-urban linkages.  It is argued that urbanization in developing countries falls along a continuum of two extreme theoretical types:  Type I, in which urbanization contributes to national economic growth; and Type II, in which it is coincident with inadequate growth and even underdevelopment.  Generally, countries in the Near East share characteristics of Type I, sub-Saharan countries share characteristics of Type II, while Asian and Latin American nations share a mixture of both types.  Government policies affecting human settlement and economically motivated rural-to-urban migration have been two key factors influencing urbanization.  Equally important is the character of rural-urban linkages, which encompass economic, technological, spatial, infrastructural, financial, administrative, and participant (e.g., producer, processor, distributor, consumer, etc.) aspects.  An A.I.D.-funded study of Kutus Town, Kenya, is cited to illustrate these features. According to the report, rural-urban linkages in Type I urbanization actively contribute to dynamic market systems, while linkages in Type II environments fail to create opportunities for increased employment or income generation.  In reaction to the usual separation of rural and urban planning, an analytical framework for rural-urban linkage development, called ARULINKED or ""Are You Linked?,"" is developed based on A.I.D.'s 15-year experience of trying to capture and channel energies that reinforce both rural and urban development.  This framework examines patterns of migration, backward linkages, off-farm employment, urban poverty, and mega-city growth.  ARULINKED is also used to generate illustrative questions - posed in terms of macro- and sector-level analysis and planning issues - to guide project designers and Mission strategists toward a new view of urbanization.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","7/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Rural urban linkages|Economic development|Urban development|Rural urban migrations|Urban planning|Urban population growth|Urbanization","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAX221.pdf","97 KB","003433 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (FY79-9/85) to fund PVO activities in Thailand with a minimum of 25% of project financing to be provided by the PVO's. The project was effective and received full support from the Government of Thailand (GOT).  At the end of the project, 25 subprojects (SP's) had been completed, in addition to 18 SP's initiated under previous OPG procedures.  A total of 20 PVO's participated in the project, providing 39% of SP costs.  The PVO's were effective in reaching the rural poor and many worked with the poorest of the poor. SP beneficiaries, totalling about 400,000, were able to realize both monetary and non-monetary returns, including increased individual and family incomes, greater confidence among women leaders, increased motivation for development activities among villagers, improved literacy, and improved nutrition and health.  Approaches concentrated on self-help methodologies and included:  leadership training; home nutrition interventions; training in poultry raising, swine breeding, and vegetable farming for farmers and schoolchildren; development activities for schoolteachers; establishment of workgroups and clubs for community action; and vocational training.  Nine of the SP's involved working with the landless rural population, and five reached groups classified as otherwise disadvantaged or unreached. On the negative side, PVO's continue to be weak in project design and evaluation as well as project management, with indigenous PVO's particularly weak in financial management.  Some effective methodologies were not replicated because lessons learned were not adequately disseminated.  Selection criteria as well as funding criteria were not well defined and submission of progress and financial reports to USAID/T was delayed in some cases. Measures to ameliorate these problems have already been taken or are planned for the follow-on project.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","6/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Co-financing|Private voluntary organizations|Financial management|Poor","Thailand","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAZ563.pdf","263 KB","008613 - USAID.

"Interim evaluation of a project to help the Agricultural Development and Marketing Corporation (Admarc), a Malawian parastatal, restore its liquidity through the divestiture of assets valued at MK 47 million. External evaluation covers the period 1986-3/89. Divestiture has proceeded relatively rapidly, and Admarc's liquidity, as well as its ability to carry out marketing functions, has visibly improved.  Since work began about 2 years ago, 9 estates and 3 companies have been sold and sales of a further 7 estates are in progress.  The aggregate value of assets divested totaled MK 34.6 million, of which Admarc received MK 14.7 million in net cash proceeds.  These achievements have been made despite severe constraints to divestiture in Malawi, namely the lack of a developed capital market and the very small number of potential buyers with sufficient capital.  Although a commendable effort has been made to identify new buyers and involve smaller purchasers, many sales represent a continuation of the concentration of ownership, with potential for abuse of monopoly power. For example, the Press Group, Malawi's largest enterprise, has been a major purchaser of Admarc assets.  In many cases at least a partial share of these assets could have been sold to other buyers.  Moreover, a reluctance to sell to resident Asians has precluded access to an important source of capital and management expertise.  Due to the lack of conditionality, USAID/M has been limited in its ability to impose or influence divestiture objective or standards. Government of Malawi (GOM) officials are generally satisfied with the TA provided by the project and the progress to date in divestiture. Although the GOM has insisted in some cases on keeping a minority interest in properties, there is growing enthusiasm among officials for private sector growth and the prospect of other privatization projects. It is recommended that the current project be extended for a year with continued TA, provision of financial incentives (e.g., balance of payments support), and possibly additional funding from other donors to support the establishment of a unit trust or local currency liquidity line of credit.  Thus far, USAID/M has provided the GOM with $11.55 million in balance of payments support, while a further $3.45 million is expected to be disbursed before 6/89. Several lessons were learned.  (1) Strong commitment at the top of government is crucial to success.  (2) A systematic approach to the divestiture process can contribute materially to effectiveness.  (3) Divestiture can be most effective and least controversial when undertaken in the context of solving a problem (e.g., lack of liquidity).  (4) Valuation is less likely to be a problem when specific business and economic goals are the focus of a privatization program. (5) Missions can materially assist the divestiture process through provision of TA and an incentive.","Companion evaluation summary: PD-ABC-694","Special Evaluation","Documents","DPE-0008-C-00-5058-00","","4/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Privatization|Divestiture|Parastatals|Balance of payments","Malawi","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAZ568.pdf","1,070 KB","004844 - Center for Privatization","","000165 - USAID.

"A.I.D.'s Consumption Effects of Agricultural Policies (CEAP) project was designed to study the links between agricultural policies, food consumption, and nutrition. From 1977 to 1988, the project conducted research and policy studies, technical assistance, and training activities in about 30 countries. A major emphasis of these activities was to determine the impact of food policies on the poor. This assessment of the project identifies lessons drawn from CEAP country studies, which focused on producer and consumer price policies; food subsidies; input, technology, and marketing policies; and macroeconomic and trade policies. It also identifies lessons relating to research design, food policy analysis, technical assistance, training, and project management and administration. A major lesson is that accurate data on consumption parameters can dispel traditional wisdom and promote better policy design. For example, it was discovered that policies to induce coarse grain consumption by increasing rice prices are misguided, since consumers respond to the price hikes by reducing their overall grain consumption. The report concludes with recommendations for future A.I.D. activities related to food policy, with special attention to developing policies and interventions to assist groups vulnerable to the adverse impacts of structural adjustment programs. Abstracts of the 17 CEAP country studies are included.","'RSSA-BST-1171-R-AG-3125-01'","Special Evaluation","Documents","BST-1171-R-AG-3125-01|BST-1171-R-AG-3125-00","","8/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Food policy|Agricultural policy|Policy reform|Food consumption|Food consumption patterns|Human nutrition","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNABD064.pdf","2,214 KB","001038 - Resources for the Future, Inc.

"Final evaluation of a project to develop a model low-cost health delivery system in three rural areas of Ecuador.  External evaluation covers the period 7/87-3/89, when the primary goal was construction of rural water supply and sanitation systems (RWSS's). The project has succeeded in institutionalizing the concept of community ownership and management of RWSS's.  The relatively high level of community maintenance of constructed systems (50%-60%) is a good indicator of project success.  Also, the project's modular operating approach has been an efficient means of organizing construction, and has demonstrated that a team of one engineer, three promotores, and one administrator can construct six or seven systems a year.  However, achievement of construction and promotion goals were hampered by logistical problems and lack of transportation, and construction targets of 18 systems per year for each operational module proved unrealistic. Another problem is that latrines with concrete pour-flush devices are not being used because they are hard to keep clean and aesthetically unappealing.  Appropriate technology experiments yielded few results but should be continued with more organization and supervision.  Also, water tariffs have been set too low in most communities. Training provided by the Ecuadorean Institute of Sanitary Works (IEOS) to 1,200 project-related personnel was effective in manual skills, but less so in promotional skills and hygiene.  User education in sanitation also needs improvement, particularly in latrine promotion, construction, and water usage.  Too many communities do not understand the health benefits of latrine use. This is partially a result of the underrepresentation of women as IEOS promoters and on community water boards.  Health messages from male promoters are highly unlikely to win the acceptance of women.  A planned follow-on project will add elements relating to child survival.","Spanish ed.: PD-AAZ-845|Companion evaluation summary: PD-ABB-857","Special Evaluation","Documents","DPE-5942-C-00-4085-00","","6/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Water sanitation|Water supply|Outdoor toilet facilities|Community participation|Water supply structure maintenance","Ecuador","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAZ655.pdf","1,400 KB","000333 - Camp Dresser and McKee, Inc.

"Evaluates a pilot study of community participation in malaria control in West Timor. In general, the pilot project was proceeding according to plans. The provincial health authorities and the USAID direct hire personnel had done an outstanding job. It is expected that a great deal will be learned about approaches to involving villagers and the rural health delivery system in joint efforts to control malaria. The midterm status of major segments of the project is as follows: Training: Modules have been developed for Puskesmas (health center) physicians (training methods), village volunteers (recognition, treatment, and reporting of clinical malaria), and village inhabitants (malaria biology and control).  Programs have been successfully implemented at each of these levels. Village Malaria Surveillance and Treatment: Volunteers have been trained and are functioning well in the villages selected for this activity.  Support systems for this activity from the Puskesmas are working well with only minor problems in supplying drugs. Correlation of clinical symptoms and malaria parasitemias: Blood specimens are being collected from the three clinically defined groups of patients coming to selected health centers. Blood slides are being collected, stained and accurately examined. Some mid-course changes have been suggested for this part of the program, including: l) Adding two subPuskesmas to the blood specimen collecting program in order to have health center activities closer to study villages; 2) Increasing the number of subjects in the afebrile clinical group; 3) Recording parasites in positive blood smears in a more standard format; and 4) Recruiting an additional microscopist. Bed net study: Bed nets have been distributed and insecticide treatment schedules followed. Initial surveys indicate that the majority of villagers involved in this activity use the nets. Mosquito catches have been initiated in both experimental and control villages. Clearly village support for bed net use as a means of interrupting transmission can be developed and utilized. Evaluation of this effort will be difficult. Additional studies on vector identification and biology as well as evaluation technology will be required.

"Mid-term evaluation of a project to establish two entities within Nepal's Department of Irrigation - a Systems Management Division (SMD) and an Irrigation Management Center (IMC) - to help develop and sustain efficient irrigation management practices.  External evaluation covers the period 1985-5/89. Despite serious technical and staffing constraints, progress in implementing both SMD and IMC has been remarkable.  A great deal of credit belongs to certain dedicated and important staff members who are concerned with promoting participatory irrigation management. Unfortunately, the overall quality of TA support has not been commensurate with this high level of commitment. The SMD is conducting activities in two sites:  the Sirsia-Dudhaura system in the Terai and the Hande Tar system in the hills.  The first intervention will establish joint Department of Irrigation/farmer management, while the second will be completely handed over to farmers. Efforts to establish water user associations have made much progress, and the associations have developed skills in mobilizing resources and resolving conflicts.  Until now, operations and maintenance activities have concentrated on essential structural improvements due to the significant physical deterioration of the irrigation systems at both sites.  Monitoring, evaluation, and feedfack efforts were initiated only recently, and are insufficient for the project's information requirements. Initial projections for developing the IMC were unreasonably high, and the center has not yet been institutionalized.  IMC is currently located in temporary quarters at Pokhara, and construction of a permanent facility is about to begin.  Staffing problems have been constant, and the core staff needs to be strengthened considerably in order to perform as expected. Nonetheless, overall results have been encouraging.  Between 3/88 and 3/89, IMC organized 21 in-country training activities for 300 participants and provided 20 short-term overseas training activities for 64 irrigation professionals.  IMC research activities have also been ambitious, albeit constrained by insufficient staff size.  The pressure to complete the 14 committed studies has resulted in an emphasis on quantity over quality. The Government of Nepal's Sector Program and other irrigation sector developments have qualitatively changed the environment in which the project operates, as well as the demands made upon the project.  It is recommended that the project be redesigned and extended to at least 10 years to take advantage of these new opportunities.","ISPAN activity no. 646B|Project title: Irrigation support project for Asia and the Near|East (ISPAN)","Special Evaluation","Documents","ANE-0289-C-00-7044-00","","7/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Irrigation|Agricultural water management|Water supply structure maintenance|Government departments|Institution building|Irrigation system construction","Nepal","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAZ713.pdf","1,679 KB","000333 - Camp Dresser and McKee, Inc.

"Interim evaluation of a project to support the delivery of family planning (FP) services by private sector entities, both PVO's and for-profit enterprises.  External evaluation covers the period 9/85-2/89. The project is on schedule, with 62 of a targeted 80 subprojects (SP's) initiated.  Of these, 42 are service delivery SP's in which personnel seem dedicated and services appear of high quality; some SP's are quite innovative.  In many countries, project staff have established good working relationships and name recognition as well as a positive attitude toward the project concept.  Workshops have helped spread the concept and some businesses have expanded the provision of services using their own funds. In one country, a coordinating unit has been established that may serve to institutionalize the project concept at the national level. Despite these achievements, overall project impact is not likely to be significant.  First, project efforts are too diffuse.  The project has no overarching strategy for targeting key economic sectors and industries for employment-based activities. Instead, the project has tended to work only with the large companies in the organized sector that are easiest to penetrate, such as the mining industry and plantations.  Second, major increases in prevalence will probably either not be achieved or not be attributable to the project.  Only 250,000-450,000 acceptors are expected, and many of these are continuing clients of participating firms that were already providing FP services. Third, despite good work with PVO's, the financial problems of most PVO's have drained project resources away from efforts to develop new delivery approaches in the for-profit sector. It is recommended that the project consolidate activities in fewer countries, decentralize authority, and place higher priority on the systematic collection and dissemination of information on successful approaches to FP service delivery.  No new PVO activities should be aimed solely at PVO strengthening or self-sustainability.  PVO's should be used only to provide support services to participating for-profit firms in such areas as market training and public education.","Companion evaluation summary: PD-ABB-595|Project title: Population technical assistance (POPTECH)","Special Evaluation","Documents","DPE-3024-Z-00-8078-00","","8/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Family planning services|Private enterprises|Private sector|Private voluntary organizations","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAZ733.pdf","6,735 KB","006243 - Dual & Associates, Inc.|000673 - International Science and Technology Institute, Inc.

"Mid-term evaluation of a project to help public and private sector family planning programs conduct effective information, education, and communication (IEC) activities.  The project is implemented by Johns Hopkins University's Population Communication Services (JHU/PCS). External evaluation covers the period 9/86-6/89. JHU/PCS has already met and, in most cases, exceeded quantitative goals in terms of the number of country projects underway (43 compared to the 25-30 targeted), TA trips, needs assessments, development of national communication strategies, and provision of materials.  The project's innovative approaches have given renewed energy to the IEC function in family planning programs and convinced previously doubtful A.I.D. administrators, Mission personnel, and developing country policymakers and program officials of the value of large investment in IEC activities. Among the innovations that JHU/PCS has pioneered are: (1) the entertainment/education strategy for mass media communication; (2) the media/materials center at JHU/PCS, one of the largest and best in the world; (3) the concept of communication as a process which includes needs assessment, formative evaluation, message production, and impact evaluation; (4) a methodology for evaluating the impact of IEC projects on the family planning programs of which they are a part; and (5) an emphasis on interpersonal communication activities such as counseling, client-clinic staff communication, and telephone hot-lines. These achievements notwithstanding, the project needs to make improvements in several areas.  The three top individuals in project are overextended and the functional division of labor is unclear.  JHU/PCS has negotiated buy-ins over its funding ceiling, which may cause a crisis that will need to be resolved by S&T/POP.  While senior staff are highly qualified, many intermediate staff do not have advanced academic training in communication.  The JHU/PCS consultant roster is inadequate to provide the type of services expected.  Many of the print materials in the Africa region are not as innovative as those produced elsewhere, and little attention has been paid to working with journalists in the newspaper and magazine industries.  The cost of sending JHU/PCS advisors overseas - mostly for single-country visits - has been tremendous, and the use resident advisors should be considered.  The technical resources of subcontractors have not been fully exploited.","Project title: Population technical assistance (POPTECH)","Special Evaluation","Documents","DPE-3024-Z-00-8078-00","","8/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","IEC|Family planning promotion programs|Family planning education","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAZ718.pdf","2,219 KB","006243 - Dual & Associates, Inc.|000673 - International Science and Technology Institute, Inc.

"PACR of a project (12/82-3/88) to expand income opportunities for refugees in Somalia by strengthening the National Refugee Commission (NRC), supporting research on refugee issues, and funding subprojects (SP's) implemented by Save the Children Federation (SCF), Partnership for Productivity (PfP), New Transcentury Foundation (NTF), and the Experiment in International Living (EIL). Support to the NRC Planning Unit produced mixed results.  While the Unit benefited from the introduction of information and monitoring/evaluation systems, improvements in interagency communication, and out-of-country staff training, there is little evidence that the Unit is capable of coordinating activities between NRC departments to facilitate planning.  Of the 6 socioeconomic and technical studies completed under the research component, only 3 were useful in planning program and refugee settlement strategies. SP's involved farming, skills training, infrastructure improvement, and regional development.  Agricultural SP's implemented by three PVO's exceeded targets for rainfed land but fell short for irrigated land. Overall, 4,275 refugee households received land plots of 0.1 to 1 ha. Extension activities included seed, tool, and tractor distribution and on-the-job training of refugee extensionists and farmers.  Major constraints were the lack of suitable farmland, policy issues regarding land distribution and plot size, lack of a land tenure policy for refugees, delays in access to UNHCR funding and equipment and, in the case of SCF, management difficulties. Vocational skills and management training programs were developed for both refugee and indigenous beneficiaries by PfP.  The component was appropriate for local economic conditions and successful in providing business advice to new enterprises, upgrading beneficiaries' skills, and surveying local businesses' perceived needs and opportunities.  The impact of the EIL SP, which provided training to project administrative personnel, is unclear. NTF's infrastructure SP constructed or rehabilitated 240 km of roads in the northwest and Awdal regions using intensive wage labor.  This effort was well received by beneficiaries and cut transportation time in half for rations distribution between the Darayamaane, Darbi Hoore, and Tugwajaale refugee camps. Under the regional development SP, NTF found significant water sources near Borama and Baki and established an on-going metal fabrication capacity in Hargeisa town.  The SP also created employment opportunities through refugee participation in the construction of the Hargeisa drainage system. The project demonstrated that, inter alia:  refugees respond to opportunities to earn income and can adapt well to new farming techniques; PVO SP's should rely on one donor to avoid delays and conflicts; apprenticeship training of refugees by local businesses is an appropriate approach; and refugee projects should be flexible and stated in realistic terms.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Refugees|Private voluntary organizations|Agricultural development|Land development|Income generation|Employment|Beneficiary count","Somalia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAZ720.pdf","141 KB","008604 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (8/79-6/89), part of a multi-donor effort, to improve range management in Somalia's Central Highlands. Despite not having fully achieved its targets, the project leaves behind a sound technical base for future development of the Highlands and a solid cadre of trained professionals.  Little progress was made during the early years due to an overly ambitious project design, lack of coordination among donors and between project headquarters and field staffs, and security problems in some areas.  In 1984, the target area was reduced by 75% to 3 priority districts (3 additional districts were added in 1987), and implementation improved.  Shortfalls were mainly caused by external factors such as lack of fuel for field work, lack of incentives and per diem funds, and the failure of participants to return from training. An aerial survey of the entire Central Rangelands area and ground surveys for 5 districts are complete; a second aerial survey was canceled due to contracting problems.  The project developed range management plans for 23 degaans (traditional grazing areas) and established range and livestock associations for 16 degaans. Staff also collected numerous plant samples, but analysis was not performed due to delays in acquiring laboratory equipment. Only about half of the planned water development activities were accomplished, due in part to inadequate hydrogeological knowledge in the early stages, which resulted in many dry or brackish wells.  Project boreholes proved detrimental since they provide a permanent water supply,  encouraging overgrazing in surrounding areas. The soil and water conservation component established nurseries to produce seedlings for village shelterbelts and sand dune stabilization, but construction of berkets (water collection basins), water spreading activities, and shelterbelt and dune planting were hampered by lack of fuel and heavy equipment maintenance.  The use of animal traction could have alleviated these problems. Four herds of camels, sheep, and goats were selected by the animal husbandry specialist for monitoring livestock production data.  This valuable work should be continued. The project established a Botany and Range Science Department at Somali National University, from which 56 B.S. students have graduated. However, the future of the Department is uncertain due to the very low rate of return of participant trainees.  So far, only 12 of 18 range science students have returned, and none of the 7 participants trained to assume professorships has returned, though 2 are expected shortly. Expatriate and Somali personnel in the range and university components produced a wealth of scientific publications which will form the basis for much future work in the Central Highlands. Two major lessons were learned.  (1) Project design should involve critical assessment of pre-project assumptions.  (2) The difficulties of coordinating a multi-donor project can be alleviated by formation of a steering committee, but it is better if each donor be responsible for an entire project or subproject.","Title supplied by cataloger","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","8/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Range management","Somalia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAZ721.pdf","1,321 KB","008604 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (7/79-9/88) to strengthen Somali agricultural research and extension capabilities by providing training, equipment, and TA to the National Extension Services (NES) and the Farm Management Extension Training Center (FMETC). The A.I.D. project, part of a multi-donor effort, was extremely successful in upgrading NES research and extension staffs in the 33 target districts.  Whereas very little technology transfer to farmers was occurring prior to the project, NES personnel are now capable of the task.  Training consisted of in-country university courses for about 70 extension agents, overseas long-term academic training for 22 staff members (20 Master's degrees and 2 Ph.D.'s), and short-term courses for about 50 staff members. Extension agents trained under the project now plan and conduct seminars and workshops for small farmers and encourage policymakers to focus on strategies for small farmer production. In the field, extension agents use a problem-solving approach which is useful and widely accepted by farmers.  On the negative side, only half of the long-term participants returned to Somalia after training completion, and the overall return rate of participants was only 67%. Research and extension services were further strengthened by high-quality TA and the provision of commodities, equipment, and vehicles.  The TA team generated a wealth of information, including guidelines for doubling maize yield with just a few changes in management practices.  A research strategy was developed and trials are being conducted by the National Extension Training Centers at Ganale and Jowhar.  However, further progress needs to be made in establishing formal linkages between the agricultural research institutes and the NES. Several lessons were learned.  (1) Multi-donor project implementation is extremely difficult for the A.I.D. Mission and contractor and should be avoided whenever possible.  (2) Advanced solutions to crop production problems are not urgent during the initial project phase, since low-technology improvements, which can be explained by a relatively inexperienced extension staff, will have a marked impact on yields.  (3) Farmers must be involved in demonstrations of recommended production and management practices.  (4) Long-term (more than 10 years) support for agricultural research and extension is needed to increase significantly small farmer productivity.  (5) A strong research program is necessary before an extension service can be effective in the field.  (6) When attempting to identify a technology that can be recommended to farmers, one has to consider all production seasons in a given production cycle.","Title supplied by cataloger","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","8/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural research|Agricultural extension|Applied research|Technology transfer|Agricultural education","Somalia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAZ722.pdf","211 KB","008604 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (11/82-1/89) to promote reforestation and fuelwood production in and near refugee camps in Somalia.  The project was implemented by five PVO's. The project was implemented according to design, and although it did not meet all quantitative targets, it succeeded in greatly increasing awareness of forestry activities among government agencies, potential donors, and beneficiaries.  Training of refugees in shade tree plantings was very successful, as seen in a 90% survival rate for amenity plantings; the project demonstrated the value of trees to refugees and provided them needed employment as nursery and plantation workers. Extension activities in agroforestry were well received by farmers, and some 237 km of shelterbelts were planted; the introduction of live fencing in Somalia was an important contribution.  Efforts in sand dune fixation were important also, not only as a start in controlling the dunes, but also as an experiment in methods to do so.  Also, despite some deficiencies, the resource/land use survey contributed much valuable data. Fuelwood conservation was generally successful.  The fencing of fuelwood plantations allowed considerable recovery of natural vegetation (particularly grass and herb cover), leading to the sale of controlled quantities of fodder from within fenced areas. Also, the project designed a 20% more efficient woodstove, though it is not selling well due to its high price. On the negative side, large-scale woodlots and block and strip plantings on public land were unsuccessful due to the harsh climate, degraded soil, poor species selection, poor government management, and the uncertainty of woodlot ownership.  However, plantations of the correct species in such sites have grown well and have helped prevent further land degradation. Efforts to strengthen the National Range Agency (NRA) were a partial success.  Initial training of junior and forestry technical officers at the Afgoi Forestry and Wildlife Training Center proved useful, and on-the-job training and a study tour organized by PVO's for junior and mid-level staff were very successful.  However, the effects of these efforts were constrained by low salaries, lack of incentives, and poor job performance. Several lessons were learned.  (1) Local circumstances (e.g., climate and land tenure systems) must be integrated into project design. Attention to these conditions can make forestry/fuelwood projects succeed even in a relatively arid climate.  (2) Sufficient time must be programmed to achieve desired results. In arid regions with a short planting season, 36 months is insufficient for incorporating even initial findings into improved procedures.  (3) Sustainability must never be lost sight of.  In this case, improved seeds were not available after the project terminated.  (5) Expatriate staff must have relevant experience, as many technical advisors did not have appropriate background in dryland/arid zone forestry management.","Title supplied by cataloger","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","8/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Refugees|Reforestation|Firewood|Trees|Arid zone|Forestry|Natural resource conservation","Somalia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAZ723.pdf","168 KB","008604 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (8/80-5/88) to increase agricultural production in the Bay Region of Somalia by upgrading institutions, personnel, and infrastructure.  The project was a multi-donor integrated rural development project supported by A.I.D., World Bank, IFAD, African Development Fund (ADF), and the Somali government (GSDR). The project produced varied results.  Many components cannot be fully evaluated, however, since no baseline survey was conducted at the start of the project.  Delays in the arrival of the University of Wyoming TA team are primarily responsible for this problem. The project constructed a functioning crop research station and a 100-ha seed farm at Bonka.  Research efforts at these facilities failed to identify improved sorghum varieties, due in part to (a) a drought during the 2 years of TA and (b) inefficiency and a lack of dedication by the TA team leader for this activity.  The project then attempted to distribute imported sorghum varieties (Dabar and GPR 148), but these were rejected by farmers when no yield improvements where seen.  Pulse improvement activities proved more successful, however, with over 70 mungbean varieties being tested, and Filsan (an early-maturing mungbean) being accepted by farmers.  Soybeans were also field tested and identified as an alternative cash crop for the region. Because of problems in varietal identification and distribution, the use of the seed farm shifted from research and extension to that of training staff in mechanized crop production. Veterinary services were expanded in the Bay region with the establishment of 3 mobile teams, capable of vaccinating 242,000 cattle per year.  Fourteen dispensaries were also built, but not all could be fully staffed because of the shortage of veterinary assistants willing to work in remote areas. Long-term training had a return rate of only 30%.  While the project sent 16 participants to U.S. institutions, only 5 returned to Somalia, and the whereabouts of the others are unknown.  All 11 short-term training participants did return to the project, however.  Finally, the project underestimated the cost of various components, especially road construction and well drilling.  Consquently, only 300 km of the targeted 600 km of roads were constructed. Several lessons were learned.  (1) Overambitious goals and false assumptions can be avoided in the project design stage through careful research and consultations with local personnel.  (2) In a multi-donor project, donors should plan the project/components jointly but implement each component separately.  (3) Agricultural research in Somalia should conducted by a multidisciplinary TA team.  (4) To measure progress, baseline surveys must be conducted at the start of the project.  (5) Efforts should be made in agricultural development projects to communicate with the local farmers before activities begin.  (6) Training activities must address the problems of patronage in trainee selection, course relevance, low return rate, and participant failure rate.","Title supplied by cataloger","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","8/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Integrated rural development|Joint development projects|Donor coordination|Development cooperation|Agricultural production|Agricultural research","Somalia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAZ724.pdf","851 KB","008604 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (1981-1988) to help the Government of Liberia (GOL) regain control of its finances by providing the Ministry of Finance and the Bureau of the Budget with short-term TA to improve budgeting and cash management processes and long-term TA to assist with structural adjustment. Although the project failed to instill a commitment to fiscal responsibility within the GOL, it did have a positive impact in a number of areas.  GOL finances were brought into a more orderly state through establishment of an automated payroll; a chart of accounts for budgeting, revenue recording, and other financial functions; an automated cash management system; and an accounting system.  A GSA procurement system was also implemented, but its effectiveness was hampered by three factors:  the GOL's poor payment history, preference among many firms for other bidding processes, and perceived corruption in the awarding of GSA contracts. Training was provided to more than 225 employees in one or more of the following areas:  management, budgeting, government accounting, purchasing, and payroll.  The lasting impact of this training was lessened by frequent changes in key ministry personnel.  The project-established Economic and Financial Management Committee (comprised of the Ministers of Finance, Planning and Economic Affairs, and Commerce and Industry and the Director of the Bureau of the Budget) has been helpful in exploring policy issues, but has not yet achieved the expected level of influence in policy dialogue. Two key lessons were learned.  (1) Institutional changes needed to reduce expenditures must be supported by the highest levels of the host government.  In this project, advisors felt that GOL officials were removed from office when they attempted to introduce fiscal restraint. (2) Successful solutions to financial problems such as those of the GOL require careful planning, training, long-term monitoring, and management commitment.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","2/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Financial management|Fiscal policy|Structural adjustment|Economic reform","Liberia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDBBQ171.pdf","95 KB","008570 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (FY84-4/89) to assist the Government of Swaziland (GOS) in improving its capability to repair and maintain unpaved roads damaged by Cyclone Domoina and re-establish its capacity to monitor and allocate water resources. All project goals have been achieved and, in some cases, exceeded. The country's road infrastructure was repaired at a standard equivalent to or higher than that existing prior to the cyclone.  This rehabilitation has resulted in the extension of rural bus services, improved access to rural health clinics, increased availability of agricultural production inputs, and greater access to markets. A major lesson learned is that disaster relief activities need to be clearly differentiated from ordinary development projects.  In this case, the GOS continued to use normal development project procedures (i.e., for employment, procurement, budget allocations, etc.) rather than those for emergency relief activities, resulting in delays of implementation and an extension of the PACD by two years.  Additional lessons learned are:  (1) interministerial linkages are essential if more than one implementing office of the government is involved in project activities; (2) any infrastructure-related project must have clear commitment on the part of the host government for continuing maintenance throughout the project and beyond; and (3) private contractors are an effective alternative to government work forces for emergency assistance projects.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","4/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Transportation infrastructure|Disaster reconstruction|Road maintenance|Road construction|Cyclones|Emergency relief","Swaziland","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDBBQ163.pdf","54 KB","008609 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of a project to counteract environmental degradation in southwest Burkina Faso through villager sensitization, training forestry agents and villagers in forestry techniques, establishing village nurseries and plantations, developing agroforestry systems, and strengthening the provincial administrations of the Ministry of Environment and Tourism (MET). The evaluation covers the period 6/85-6/89. Despite an 18-month lapse between the official project start date and actual implementation, the project achieved its quantitative and qualitative indicators.  It developed a sound infrastructure of trained and generally motivated forestry agents with adequate office, lodging, and means of transport.  The project also increased villagers' awareness of environmental degradation as well as their understanding of methods to combat this deterioration.  These achievements are due in part to Africare's recruitment of a former Peace Corps forester familiar with the area, as well as the diligence of MET personnel.  In addition, project activities coincided with national environmental initiatives related to the continuing influx of refugees from the devastated area of northern Burkina.  The Government of Burkina Faso (GOBF) and Africare agree that there is an outstanding need to continue project activities and have begun to develop proposals for expanding on these successes. The delay in implementation was caused by disagreement between Africare and the GOBF after USAID/BF approval of the project design. The major lesson learned is that a tripartite agreement between USAID/BF, Africare, and the GOBF instead a sequence of agreements might have prevented the delay.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","686-0934-G-00-5026-00","","6/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Reforestation|Environmental degradation|Forestry","Burkina Faso","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAZ775.pdf","704 KB","000235 - Africare, Inc.","","008520 - USAID.

"Interim evaluation of a pilot subproject of the Rural Industries Project to provide credit and support services aimed at promoting income-generating enterprises among rural women in Bangladesh. External evaluation of the project, which is being implemented by the Bangladesh Small and Cottage Industries Corporation (BSCIC), covers the period 1986-6/89. The project has been generally successful in implementing a credit program managed by women for women.  The number of loans has been satisfactory, with each BSCIC centers (4 Phase I centers and 5 Phase II centers) issuing about 150 loans/year at an average size of 2,000-3,000 takas.  The overall recovery rate is around 75%, but all Phase II centers except one have reached the target recovery rate of 80%. Overhead per taka recovered was less than one taka for all but two centers.  The provision of training to clients has had mixed results: management training has been too brief (2 days) to have an impact, but skills training has helped many women initiate business activities. Project-funded enterprises have contributed to an increase in clients' incomes, though only by utilizing family labor, and it is unclear whether the additional income has been translated into improved quality of life in terms of housing, nutritional intake, and access to education and health services.  In addition, the nature of the funded enterprises (traditional cottage industries) restricts their expansion through capital reinvestments to the status of micro-enterprises.  New lines of activities, especially those that are nontraditional and involve larger asset size, should be explored and funded. Overall, identification of beneficiaries has improved significantly, and most new clients are disadvantaged rural women involved in family enterprises.  However, even though the project has provided positive role models for women by filling top management positions with qualified female staff, only a fifth of project-funded enterprises are managed by women, even in the most successful centers.  While the potential for promoting female entrepreneurship exists within the project structure, it is limited by the minimal support from headquarters.  It is therefore recommended that headquarter personnel either spend considerably more time in the field or hire two mid-level women to assist in the project's transition towards support of women entrepreneurship.","Companion project evaluation summary: PD-ABB-400","Special Evaluation","Documents","388-0042-O-00-9041-00","","6/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Women in development|Entrepreneurs|Cottage industries|Credit|Rural areas","Bangladesh","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAZ809.pdf","4,003 KB","008511 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of a CARE project in the Dominican Republic to increase rural water quality and quantity; promote latrine use; improve family health practices; and establish community-based maintenance systems.  External evaluation covers the period 8/85-8/89. Although project allocations for TA and health education and training materials were inadequate, CARE achieved considerable results through its own contributions, sound fiscal management, and the proper utilization of outside resources.  A change in project design to allow participants to choose between water technologies (i.e., piped water distribution vs. handpumps) had a positive effect on performance at all levels.  Piped water systems were generally more successful than handpump systems, however, primarily because of greater popular interest and a more adequate operations and maintenance program. While health education coverage and planning need to be improved in all communities, project health promoters gained community trust and made some progress in education.  There is evidence that the relationship between water and health is well understood and some health practices were improved.  Water committees are functioning; most actively oversee the water systems and collect funds for maintenance. However, CARE needs to develop a comprehensive operation and maintenance program to ensure that all the communities can perform maintenance tasks wholly on their own.  It is recommended that the remainder of the project be devoted to the development of such a program, especially for communities with handpumps.  Although CARE promoted latrines, only two were constructed, suggesting that promotion alone is not enough in low-income areas. It is recommended that the project be continued beyond the current PACD with increased emphasis on health education and information systems.","WASH activity no. 522|Companion project evaluation summary: PD-ABB-864","Special Evaluation","Documents","DPE-5942-C-00-4085-00","","5/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Water sanitation|Water pumps|Water management","Dominican Republic","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAZ811.pdf","6,788 KB","000333 - Camp Dresser and McKee, Inc.

"Interim evaluation of a project to stimulate agricultural growth in the Eastern Caribbean through equity financing of smaller-scale private agriculture enterprises.  External evaluation covers the period 8/86-3/89, with emphasis on 1988 activities. The project has made a number of impressive accomplishments, particularly in the past year.  Under this project, three times as many private sector investments have been funded in three years than by two predecessor projects combined in nine and six years respectively. However, emphasis now needs to shift from selecting new investments to managing the existing portfolio, and progress towards this goal is constrained by a seriously flawed project organizational structure.  The two primary implementing agencies, the Agriculture Venture Trust (AVT) and Eastern Caribbean Agricultural Development (ECAD), have often worked at cross-purposes.  ECAD has been primarily responsible for investment promotion and business plan preparation, while AVT has been in charge of screening and funding investments.  This division has confused responsibility and accountability, created unnecessary conflict between the organizations, and sometimes confused and angered investors.  The Mission has no special expertise in the venture capital field which could be used to reconcile strategic and operational differences between the adversaries.  Meanwhile, neither organization has devoted sufficient attention and personnel to the planning and execution of portfolio management, which is key to the project's basic strategy. It is recommended that a single organization, a successor to AVT, be given responsibility for the full range of project functions, including the promotion, selection, and management of project investments.  This organization should be a non-profit corporation, rather than a charitable trust such as AVT, whose format is too conservative and traditional for the purposes of the project.  ECAD's role would be to serve the successor organization.  More particular needs are to upgrade skills at every level (from AVT's Board of Directors to company operations at the grassroots) and to focus attention on marginal investments in which effective management and TA can spell the difference between success and failure. Given the time profiles and characteristics of most agricultural investments in the Eastern Caribbean, it is very doubtful that the project could become financially self-sustaining in the near future. Substantial additional donor capitalization and/or sustained support of operating expenses will be required for some time to come.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","5/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Loan administration|Investment promotion|Equity|Agribusiness|Agricultural investments","Eastern Caribbean","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAZ812.pdf","2,086 KB","000241 - Louis Berger International, Inc.

"From 1984 to 1987, USAID/Dominican Republic implemented a new, private sector-led strategy to expand and diversify the country's economic base.  This reorientation entailed a series of private sector employment-generating projects in four areas: free trade zones, agro-industry, microenterprises, and tourism.  This report analyzes the impact of these projects on the ability of the poor to obtain basic human needs (i.e., adequate education, health care, housing, and nutrition).  Overall, A.I.D.'s efforts directly contributed to the creation of 73,300 jobs and an increase in incomes by $9 million per month.  The greatest improvement appears to have been in the area of education, with 40,000 additional young people aged 6-22 enrolled in school. Those who obtained jobs also shifted from public to private sources of medical care and all but hotel employees had medical check-ups for family members more frequently.  In all sectors except tourism, workers appeared to improve their housing situation by buying or renting dwellings.  Only nominal improvements, however, were seen in nutritional status, possibly as a result of inflation (80% on foodstuffs from late 1987 to late 1988 alone). In terms of spending patterns, no major differences were indicated between male and female employees except that women appear significantly more likely to use their income to enable young family members to attend school.  According to the report, many of the benefits of job creation would have been difficult or impossible to accomplish through conventional public sector interventions.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","4/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Development strategies|Income generation|Employment|Private sector|Social impact|Poor|Basic needs","Dominican Republic","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNABD097.pdf","2,146 KB","003970 - Management Systems International, Inc.

"Rapid changes in the global economy and the world scientific community are changing the traditional role of agricultural universities in the developing world.  This study examines six problems pertinent to this changing focus and draws related lessons for A.I.D.  (1) Agricultural universities traditionally define themselves as sources of the science and technology needed to increase agricultural production. They need to surmount this narrow perspective by defining their mission more dynamically and addressing the dominant technical, institutional, and policy issues of the rural sector.  (2) Many agricultural universities have only tenuous linkages to public and private constituencies and policymakers.  This isolation deprives universities of important research and outreach resources and hinders them from attaining political and developmental relevance.  Universities need to promote strategic planning as a tool for agenda setting, management, and linkage development.  (3) Program development depends inordinately on organizational structures.  As a result, the university programs become aggregates of courses and research projects lacking focus and direction. Flexible and integrative structures fostering multidisciplinary research and problemsolving approaches are needed.  (4) University efforts to address the rural sector's systemic resource and institutional problems have had limited success due to reductionist or didactic learning models.  Major emphasis needs to be placed on active, participatory, and problemsolving approaches.  (5) University innovation is hindered by conservative, overly centralized government policies. Governments need to shift emphasis from regulating to facilitating university innovation. (6) University leaders are isolated from international developments in higher education.  Mechanisms are needed to link universities to outside sources in a way which provides the university with access to advanced innovations in education and research.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","8/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Universities and colleges|Agricultural colleges|Agricultural education|Educational administration|Rural development","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNABC900.pdf","22 KB","003433 - USAID.

"In 1985, A.I.D./PRE and ACCION International established a $1 million fund to guarantee commercial bank loans which were provided to Latin American microenterprises through local ACCION affiliates.  Results of the programs in Paraguay and Mexico are evaluated in this report.  The report outlines the country settings, describes the affiliates and their operations, reviews the disbursement of loans and their impacts on beneficiaries, and assesses the project's institutional impact.  Five major findings are detailed.  (1) Because PRE funding was added to existing credit programs, it is difficult to determine the project's specific impact on borrowers.  On the other hand, the project has positively benefited participating banks and affiliates by affording them access to funds from private financial markets. (2) The language of the model letter of credit used in the project may create difficulties with local banks; nine Paraguayan banks rejected the letter.  The situation has improved notably, however, since the letter was simplified in March, 1989.  (3) It may be necessary to waive some formal banking practices and the red tape they entail in order to reach large numbers of microenterprise borrowers.  (4) The sustainability of a microenterprise program requires charging fees and interest rates that are sufficient to cover the program's real costs.  This was not the case in Mexico.  (5) Microenterprise lending programs should include a savings component to prevent borrowers from the consequences of unforeseen expenses.  Recommendations for follow-on activities are included.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Loan administration|Commercial credit|Microenterprises|Commercial banks","Paraguay|Mexico|Latin America","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNABD137.pdf","2,192 KB","003970 - Management Systems International, Inc.

"Final evaluation of a project to decrease the reliance of small and medium-scale enterprises (SMSE's) in Turkey on short-term, variable rate loans by giving a major Turkish trade finance company initial access to U.S. capital markets.  External evaluation covers the period 1/87-1989. A.I.D. provided a $2 million co-guarantee to facilitate the borrowing of $10 million from the U.S. capital market by Ram Dis Ticaret A.S., a subsidiary of Koc Holding, A.S.  Ram was to use $4 million of the loan to finance trade transactions for SMSE's, and make its best effort to use at least half of the remaining $6 million for the same purpose. However, while the amount of trade financing provided to SMSE's probably increased as a result of the project, credit terms to SMSE's did not become more favorable.  Out of a sample of 14 borrowers representing Ram's trade finance portfolio, half were SMSE's, but the amount lent to SMSE's represented only 13% of total credit available to the sample. Moreover, with only one exception, all loans in the sample went to clients with pre-existing credit lines from Ram and most were renewals of previous credits - again in contrast to original project design. Virtually no marketing efforts were made to attract new small enterprises. The project did succeed in helping Koc obtain long-term fixed rate foreign currency credit in the U.S. capital market, thereby reducing the Koc Group's dependence on short-term, variable rate commercial bank Eurocurrency financing.  The project also played a role in the successful negotiation of a subsequent borrowing of German DM30 million through the Morgan Guaranty/International Finance Corporation. Nonetheless, the goal to create a new capital markets mechanism for Turkey was not achieved. First, the project loan was to be guaranteed by existing trade receivables, but there was no evidence that Ram's trade receivables were used as security.  Second, there were no Turkish institutions involved in guaranteeing Ram's notes nor any observable impact on other Turkish financial institutions.  There were no follow-on projects carried out to test the model through a small company. Compliance with the terms and objectives of the projects was mixed. Although Ram's sales and finance departments play major roles in trade finance operations, they were only superficially informed of the provisions of the A.I.D. agreement.  For example, Ram's finance staff was not told to segregate the project loans under the facility into separate accounts.  Measurement of the borrower impact was impossible because funds were commingled and the required sub-borrower reports were not submitted to A.I.D.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Capital markets|Loan administration|Commercial credit|International trade|Small scale enterprises|Medium scale enterprises|Financial institutions","Turkey","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAZ993.pdf","1,123 KB","003970 - Management Systems International, Inc.

"Impact indicators - which may be defined as measures of the effect of development interventions on people, economic sectors, society, and the environment - are a largely unexplored and even ambiguous topic within A.I.D.  This paper examines some basic issues affecting impact indicators for agricultural and rural development projects.  The paper lists technical and practical criteria for selecting impact indicators and argues the indispensability of these indicators in determining whether and to what extent development changes have occurred, although the use of supplementary qualitative studies is urged to develop a reasonable certainty that the changes are causally link to a given project.  Three impact areas - household income, food availability and consumption, and the natural resource base - are identified as central for providing a systematic assessment of the Agency's progress towards its agricultural and rural development goals; simple criteria for selecting sample projects on which to gather data in these three areas are presented.  A final section suggests concrete ways of reducing the costs of establishing a system for collecting and analyzing impact data.","Related document: PN-ABB-190|Impact Indicators Workshop (20-22 Jun 1988 : Arlington, VA, US)","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","8/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Development projects|Agricultural development|Rural development|Impact assessment","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNABC899.pdf","322 KB","003433 - USAID.

"An extensive study of participant training programs funded by international foundations and A.I.D. suggests that such programs have largely succeeded in building indigenous social science capabilities all over Asia. The study found that an overwhelming majority of the trainees were satisfied with the support provided by funding agencies for travel, immigration, health, family, and academic work.  However, recent trainees (i.e., those who studied after 1975) were slightly less satisfied than the earlier ones.  Most of the participants also expressed satisfaction with their training and found it to be quite useful to their work and profession. The findings indicate that participants did not encounter major reentry problems.  They adjusted easily to their home environments and work situations and did not expect or require any help from the funding sources.  Adjustment to professional work was a different matter, however.  Most participants faced difficulties in getting access to current books, professional journals, and funds for research and overseas travel and felt the need for support from both national and internatinal agencies for their professional advancement. An overwhelming majority of the trainees returned home and continued to work there.  Thus there is absolutely no evidence that overseas training contributed to migration of Asian social scientists to the United States or other industrialized countries. Many of the participants were occupying senior positions at the time of the study. They were secretaries, joint secretaries, and directors in governments; presidents, deans, and professors in universities and research organizations; chairpersons of public bodies and enterprises; and even top executives of business organizations. A majority of the foundation trainees went to universities and research institutions, and most of the A.I.D. participants to jobs in government.  Participants who joined educational institutions were involved in teaching graduate and undergraduate students, conducting field research, and consulting with national and international agencies. Even the participants who took administrative and technical jobs often taught courses and kept in touch with the academic community.  On the whole, participants have made profound contributions to the growth of various social science disciplines and the legitimization of applied research for policy formulation and decisionmaking.

"Evaluates A.I.D.'s portfolio of crop diversification/non- traditional agricultural export (CD/NTAE) projects in Central and South America and the Caribbean.  Evaluation focuses on project impact and cross-cutting issues and covers the period 1982-88. While the program has helped create positive private and public sector attitudes towards CD/NTAE, the $103 million in credit and equity funds allocated so far has not generally been made available for CD/NTAE projects due to bureaucratic complications, poorly defined loan approval and disbursement responsibilities, lack of requisite skills among bankers, and the high risk of CD/NTAE loans.  Much of the progress in CD/NTAE that has occurred in the countries studied -- e.g., in terms of increased investment and exports, technology transfer, etc. -- is occurring independently of A.I.D.'s efforts.  A major concern is the capability of, and the kind of A.I.D. support for, the host country financial institutions that are implementing the projects. To date, A.I.D. has authorized $30 million in institutional support for these institutions.  This extensive support has tempted the organizations to focus on their own internal development rather than on CD/NTAE needs. To compound the problem, long-term TA to these organizations has been less than planned and has sometimes been used for administrative support rather than for basic production and marketing development.  (ROCAP's NTAE Support Project is an exception here.)  Further, the provision of short-term, ""quick fix"" TA is questionable as a development mode for less developed countries. Training authorizations also seem low and do not include significant amounts for the long-term training of horticulturalists.  Also, some of the training, especially for bankers, has either not been carried out or has been ineffective. On the positive side, A.I.D. has mounted a policy reform program that could have a large multiplier effect given adequate production and marketing strategies. In sum, A.I.D.'s substantial inputs will not generate commensurate returns unless host country implementing agencies focus more on specific, attainable objectives as opposed to institutional growth for its own sake and unless A.I.D. provides comprehensive long-term production and marketing TA packages. CD/NTAE experience in Chile and Mexico provides the A.I.D. program several valuable lessons.  (1) At least 10 years are required to develop CD/NTAE programs.  (2) Program growth in the two countries was a direct function of macroeconomic policy and government non-intervention in the free market.  (3) In both countries, strong organizations represented producer and exporter interests in seizing opportunities and solving problems.  (4) The most effective assistance in export marketing comes from the market itself -- brokers, importers, distributors, etc.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-1406-I-00-7011-00","","3/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Crop diversification|Nontraditional agricultural exports|Agricultural product marketing|Technical assistance|Technical training|Institution building|Financial institutions","Central America|South America|Caribbean|Chile|Mexico","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAZ829.pdf","16,791 KB","000480 - Experience, Inc.","","000180 - USAID.

"Since 1980, A.I.D. has supported microenterprise development in Malawi by providing technical assistance, credit, and training through two Malawian intermediary institutions.  This report, part of major A.I.D. stock-taking of its experience with microenterprises, describes the composition and growth potential of Malawi's small enterprise sector, followed by an evaluation of the institutions - the Development of Malawi Traders Trust (DEMATT) and the Malawi Union of Savings and Credit Cooperatives (MUSCCO).  DEMATT provides technical assistance and training to traders, producers, and service businesses; in 1986/1987, DEMATT reached 545 enterprises with a total of 1,254 employees.  MUSCCO provides savings and credit services in 79 Malawian villages - many of which offer no other credit sources except through informal markets. MUSCCO loans are used to fund household expenses, including school fees and funeral costs, as well as productive investment such as fertilizer and other agricultural inputs. Unfortunately, the impact of DEMATT and MUSCCO services on their clients is impossible to determine due to the failure of both organizations to develop adequate monitoring systems. Moreover, the long-term sustainability of these organizations is endangered by inefficiency and an unwillingness to charge interest rates or service fees high enough to cover a significant portion of their operating costs.","Cover title: AID microenterprise stock-taking : Malawi field|assessment","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-1096-I-09-8043-00","","7/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Microenterprises|Loan administration|Credit|Agricultural credit","Malawi","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNABC701.pdf","60 KB","006727 - Development Alternatives, Inc.

"The A.I.D. Community and Enterprise Development (CED) Project in Senegal administers a $600,000 loan fund in the Sine Saloum region. This stocktaking report assesses the impact of the project and details the key factors influencing the performance of two components that finance loans through the fund. The performance of the small-scale enterprise (SSE) credit component has been positive. About 315 loans have been made to 241 enterprises; of the 104 loans that have come due, most were paid on time or early, or were rescheduled, and only 3% have defaulted. This performance can be traced to the fact that the component has had the flexibility to streamline its delivery structure and improve overall efficiency; has operated in a generally favorable business environment and has decentralized the lending sector, ensuring good pre-loan client knowledge, close supervision, and immediate follow-up for non-payment. The PVO component, in which indigenous PVO's provide services to village level groups, has made 136 loans, which are just now coming due. Although the overall economic impact of the loans has been negligible (due to their small size), the credit has served to increase the villagers' level of confidence. Credit has been only a small part of this component's activities; community-based PVO's have lacked the financial expertise to administer credit projects and thus required a high degree of staff training in business administration and credit management. From the SME component, it was learned that lending projects should: (1) begin with the goal of building sustainable financial institutions and work towards that goal over the long run; (2) limit and prioritize objectives to assure that objectives are congruent and not mutually exclusive; (3)  have socioeconomic impact indicators built into project design;(4) be flexible enough to allow for mid-course design changes; and (5) have simple, direct, and decentralized loan delivery systems to work closely with the small-scale borrower.  Moreover, it was found that lending projects servicing larger microenterprises tend to create more new employment while small microenterprises tend to reduce underemployment. Additional lessons can be learned from the PVO component.  (1) Group solidarity guarantees can be as effective as financial guarantees in assuring loan repayment if the group has strong social and cultural ties.  (2) If a lending project works through PVO's, final responsibility for loan approvals and monitoring must rest with the real lender. (3) PVO projects do not create new employment but rather tend to redefine or expand existing employment in the village.","Cover title: AID microenterprise stock-taking : Senegal field|assessment","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-1096-I-09-8043-00","","7/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Microenterprises|Private enterprises|Private voluntary organizations|Indigenous private voluntary organizations|Credit|Loan administration|Small scale enterprises|Impact assessment","Senegal","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNABC702.pdf","784 KB","006727 - Development Alternatives, Inc.

"While Guatemala's 356,000 microenterprises employ close to 1 million persons, they have virtually no ties to the formal financial sector and suffer all the problems generally associated with informality.  This report examines the experience of three A.I.D.-supported PVO's providing microenterprise assistance -- the Women's Development Foundation (FDM), the Small Business Assistance Foundation (FAPE), and the Foundation for the Development of Socioeconomic Programs (FUNDAP). The FDM and FAPE programs, which targeted enterprises with 1-4 employees, had dramatic employment generation impacts.  Loans averaged $1,000-$3,500 per business, were made for both working capital and fixed asset investment, and were almost all given to manufacturing and service businesses.  In general, the beneficiaries of these programs are not the poorest of the poor but moderately poor people who have a skill and a few assets. Although FUNDAP's microenterprise program has not been in operation long enough to demonstrate employment or income impacts, its sheep production subprogram has had some income generation successes. The report summarizes the key factors influencing project performance and impact. (1) Microenterprise projects are in jeopardy due the lack of clear commitment to institution building or sustainability.  (2) The creation of trade or industry-specific beneficiary groups is an effective, cost-efficient way of reaching targeted clients and leveraging resources.  (3) FUNDAP's integrated, industry-specific approach is effective when a real market exists for the improved quality and quantity of raw materials and finished products.  (4) All three loan projects operated in a sound, businesslike manner. (5) The formal financial sector either does not or cannot reach the types of enterprises that benefited from these projects.  (6) FAPE and FDM achieved relatively high rates of income and employment generation by targeting low-income skilled group enterprises that had a viable enterprise or idea for an enterprise. Lessons learned are as follows.  (1) More attention should be placed on graduating the credit institutions aiding microenterprises rather than on graduating the microenterprises themselves.  (2) The creation of new market channels for assisted enterprises is crucial.  (3) The use of group or association-based training or technology transfer is particularly effective in insular, rural communities.  (4) Greater employment and income generation impacts accrue from projects oriented towards servicing microenterprises than projects servicing the community through microenterprise development.  (5) Women-specific programs can be successful if operated in a businesslike manner by lending on the basis of economic performance and not on the basis of female ownership.  (6) Microenterprise development projects can have significant secondary impact by focusing the attention of the host government or other donors on a region or sector of economic activity.  (7) The use of umbrella agencies as channels for funding appears to have limited potential to contribute to the institutional sustainability of PVO's assisting microenterprises.","Cover title: AID microenterprise stock-taking : Guatemala field|assessment","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-1096-I-09-8043-00","","7/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Microenterprises|Private voluntary organizations|Economic development","Guatemala","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNABC703.pdf","85 KB","006727 - Development Alternatives, Inc.

"The Cameroon Cooperative Credit Union League (CamCCUL) is an example of a thriving credit movement.  This field study looks at the cooperative to assess why the movement has been so successful in mobilizing savings and the extent to which CamCCUL is involved in microenterprise lending. Several factors have influenced the successful operation of CamCCUL. (1) CamCCUL serves real market with real needs, is an appropriate fit with the local cultural and social environment, and has a sound lending philosophy.  (2) CamCCUL and the credit union movement are long-term in their nature and focus.  (3) External donors did not capitalize and have not been extensively involved with CamCCUL.  (4) CamCCUL is dedicated to providing long-term staff training and development, and has made only modest investments in non-income producing overhead assets. Nine major lessons were learned.  (1) Successful rural credit programs mobilize local financial resources and do not depend on external capitalization by one or two major donors.  (2) Credit programs should make loans at market rates or rates that can support the lending institution and should not try to direct economic activity.  (3) Strong local leadership plays an important role and is essential to the success of building a local institution.  (6) An institution has a greater chance of success if it fits well with the local cultural and social environment.  (7) Institution building programs are successful only over the long run.  (8) Rural credit unions can effectively provide credit to microenterprises.","Cover title: AID microenterprise stock-taking : Cameroon field|assessment","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-1096-I-09-8043-00","","7/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Economic development|Credit unions|Microenterprises|Credit cooperatives","Cameroon","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNABC704.pdf","1,080 KB","006727 - Development Alternatives, Inc.

"To help create productive employment for the Dominican Republic's growing urban population, A.I.D. is promoting micro- and small enterprise development.  This report assesses the microenterprise programs of two A.I.D.-funded intermediary institutions - the Asociacion Para el Desarrollo de Microempresas (ADEMI) and the Programa de Asistencia a la Pequena Empresa/Fondo para el Desarrollo (PROAPE/FONDESA).  Key findings are as follows.  (1) ADEMI's experience shows that clear institutional objectives (e.g., the separation of credit and technical assistance activities) and the autonomy to pursue them lead to improved project performance.  PROAPE/FONDESA's business development thrust is constrained by the social welfare orientation of its sponsor, the <Asociacion para el Desarrollo.  (2) Microenterprise projects should ensure equal access to project resources by women, especially by targeting the type of enterprises they operate.  (3) Financial intermediaries can be self-sustaining if, like ADEMI, they charge positive real interest rates and have decentralized organizational structure, flexibility, well-trained staff, and sophisticated management. PROAPE/FONDESA's negative real interest rates are decapitalizing its portfolio.  (4) Attempts by the intermediaries to ""graduate"" successful microenterprise clients to the formal banking system are unrealistic and, even if possible, would, undermine the intermediaries' own financial viability.  (5) Government demand management and regulation were the most important factors in microenterprise success.","Cover title: AID microenterprise stock-taking : Dominican Republic|field assessment","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","7/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Commercial credit|Microenterprises|Informal sector|Financial institutions|Business support services|Loan administration","Dominican Republic","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNABC705.pdf","74 KB","006727 - Development Alternatives, Inc.

"Operating in the Asuncion metropolitan area, the Fundacion Paraguaya de Cooperacion y Desarrollo is at present A.I.D.'s only effort in microenterprise development in Paraguay. The Fundacion has provided loans, training, and other assistance to 711 groups with a total membership of nearly 3,000 microenterprises (with some 60% of program beneficiaries women). This report summarizes the experience of the Fundacion and is divided into two parts -- the main text, which provides general findings, conclusions, and lessons learned, and a set of appendices, which contain more detailed analysis directly related to the Fundacion, brief overviews of two similar activities in Paraguay, and a description of information system improvements which need to be made by the Fundacion. The report cites a number of factors contributing to the success of the Fundacion, including: (1) strong executive leadership and broad base of managerial talent; (2) a politically neutral stance in a sensitive political environment; (3) the knowledge that there would not be long-term A.I.D. support and the absence of a large, low-cost pool of loan funds; (4) a non-charity approach by promoters and trainers; (5) the ability to mobilize resources from local and international sources, instead of being dependent on a single donor; (6) program features that have been well-suited to the needs of the beneficiaries and characteristics of the informal sector; (7) the ability to learn from program failures; (8) the role of the Peace Corps in supplying seed capital and providing much-needed skilled personnel during the formative period of the institution; (9) the fact that similar accounting, client management, and statistics systems were previously developed and could be applied to the project; and (10) the fact that beneficiaries paid positive, rather than subsidized, interest rates. However, the Fundacion also had some setbacks.  (1) The organization's small portfolio may have helped the program make realistic program and pricing decisions during its formation, but it will have to grow significantly for the Fundacion to make a major impact on the microenterprise sector in Asuncion.  (2) The Fundacion has a tendency to take on ancillary functions and activities without paying adequate attention to the effect of these on personnel and other resources and on its ability to accomplish its basic objectives.  (3) Certain donor agency demands have been detrimental to the program's long-term success. (4) Its application procedures are time- and resource-consuming for the borrower.","Cover title: AID microenterprise stock-taking : Paraguay field|assessment","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-1096-I-09-8043-00","","7/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Microenterprises|Credit cooperatives|Private organizations|Informal sector|Private enterprises","Paraguay","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNABC706.pdf","1,469 KB","006727 - Development Alternatives, Inc.

"Ecuador's microenterprise sector plays a major role in generating urban employment, accounting for about two-thirds of private sector employees. Nationwide, microenterprises (defined as non-farm firms with fewer than 10 employees) number 153,000, or 97.6% of all firms. This report evaluates the Small Enterprise Development Project (SEDP), a project to expand and improve the supply of credit, TA, and representational services to Ecuador's small enterprise sector. Although it is too early to accurately measure project performance, it is clear that progress has been hampered by a design that is extremely complex and difficult to implement without alterations. Furthermore, changes in economic and political conditions, as well as in judgments about A.I.D. project elements and contractors, has led to a number of components either not implemented or implemented in random sequence. Despite these problems, some accomplishments have been made. About 2,800 loans totalling roughly $54,000 were administered to small entrepreneurs and street vendor solidarity groups. About 575 small manufacturing enterprises have received in-depth technical assistance (TA), surpassing the target of 400. Programs consisting of shop seminars, clinics, practical courses, and individual TA are 69% completed, and 21 technical manuals have been published, far exceeding the objective of 5. The representational component and an activity to provide TA to credit guarantee corporations are not yet operational. Five lessons are drawn from this project: (1) complicated, integrated projects are difficult to implement, especially in rapidly changing environments; (2) it is easier and cheaper to implement a project through existing organizations than to create new ones; (3) project design is dependent on political and economic conditions that can change faster than project implementation; (4) financial sustainability is hard to achieve unless credit and TA components are separately funded and evaluated; and (5) graduation of clients into the formal credit sector is often very difficult to achieve.","AID microenterprise stock-taking : Ecuador field assessments","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-1096-I-09-8043-00","","7/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Microenterprises|Credit|Loan administration|Business support services","Ecuador","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNABC707.pdf","67 KB","006727 - Development Alternatives, Inc.

"Part of USAID/Bangladesh's increasing focus on private enterprise, the Women's Entrepreneurship Development Project (WEDP) provides credit, training, and business support services to women-owned and -managed microenterprises in Bangladesh's more remote and rural areas.  This assessment of WEPD, which is managed by the Bangladesh Small and Cottage Industries Corporation, finds that program impact has been appreciable; in a 1987 survey, 57% and 75% of WEPD clients reported increases in income and productivity, respectively, while 36% reported increases in employment.  On the other hand, measurement of impact is constrained by lack of data on program services and client activities.  WEPD's financial sustainability is a problem. The program does not generate any interest income to offset its operating expenses and by assisting clients with the loan approval process, WEPD is actually subsidizing the banks which provide the loans.  Further, because its clients are mainly small entrepreneurs, WEPD is unlikely to collect fees for its services and in fact sustains significant losses in providing per diem and pocket money for its client trainees.  Other factors hindering WEPD sustainability include the policy and regulatory environment governing capital markets, WEPD's cumbersome administrative practices, and the government's practice of cancelling interest payments after floods, which has has been partially responsible for a drop in the loan recovery rate from 80% to 47%.  Policy- and program-related lessons taught by the WEPD program conclude the report.","Cover title: AID microenterprise stock-taking : Bangladesh field|assessments","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-1096-I-09-8043-00","","7/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Commercial credit|Microenterprises|Loan administration|Management training|Women in development","Bangladesh","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNABC708.pdf","54 KB","006727 - Development Alternatives, Inc.

"A.I.D.'s efforts to support microenterprise development in Indonesia are assessed in this report.  Major activities consist of support to rural credit institutions; the Puskowanjati Women's Cooperative, an umbrella organization of women's cooperatives; and the Maha Bhoga Marga and Yayasan Dian Desa private voluntary organizations.  Except in the case of Yayasan Dian Desa, which concentrates on introducing appropriate technology to raise incomes and generate employment, A.I.D.'s support for these institutions has focused on strengthening their credit services. All the projects established sound business procedures, displayed moderate to high levels of financial viability, and greatly increased the poor's access to institutional resources.  In particular, the credit projects' low transaction costs and easy access are a benefit to the poor while high interest rates and a diversified portfolio ensure institutional sustainability.  The net effect is increased employment and income generation, which stimulate economic growth through broad-based linkages and multiplier effects.  In sum, the experience of these projects shows that it is possible, even in less than optimal economic and regulatory environments, to assist the poor by treating them as entrepreneurs through a decentralized, business development approach rather than through poverty-focused programs.","Cover title: AID microenterprise stock-taking : Indonesia field|assessments","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-1096-I-09-8043-00","","7/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Credit|Loan administration|Financial institutions|Informal sector|Women in development|Microenterprises|Poor","Indonesia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNABC709.pdf","147 KB","006727 - Development Alternatives, Inc.

"In the last 10 years, USAID/Egypt has supported a number of projects with modest microenterprise components.  In contrast, the current trend is to segregate microenterprise development from other initiatives. This report evaluates two projects which utilize these different approaches.  The former approach is represented by the small enterprise loan program (SELP), a tiny component of the very large Helwan urban development project, while the current strategy is represented by a microenterprise loan fund operated by the Coptic Evangelical Organization for Social Services (CEOSS).  CEOSS has been more successful in some respects.  By the end of the grant in 1986, CEOSS had made 421 loans totalling $140,000, and the fund has continued to grow. Only 14% of the outstanding balance is in arrears, and only 5 loans are in default, each because of the borrower's death.  The future of the SELP loan fund, however, is in doubt.  As of 6/87, about 19% of the outstanding balance of loan payments was in arrears by an average of 10 months, and there is little prospect for on-lending the repaid funds now that the SELP component of the project is over.  CEOSS's success can be attributed largely to local participation in project design and the effective integration of credit with technical assistance and training activities.  Both projects were inhibited by Egypt's macroeconomic policy environment and the high rate of inflation (22%-25% per annum), however, and despite the fact that some of CEOSS's loans were making returns of up to 200%, the small value of the loans has limited both activities effectiveness in generating new jobs.","Cover title: AID microenterprise stock-taking : Egypt field|assessments","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-1096-I-09-8043-00","","7/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Credit|Microenterprises|Small scale enterprises|Loan administration","Egypt","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNABC710.pdf","1,178 KB","006727 - Development Alternatives, Inc.

"Interim evaluation of a project to provide TA in support of privatization in Honduras.  Primary implementing institutions are the Corporacion Nacional de Inversiones (CONADI), the Privatization Commission, the Valuation Commission, and the Negotiation Commission. External evaluation covers the period 8/86-3/89. Although the Government of Honduras (GOH) still lacks a comprehensive privatization policy, the project has made progress towards the goal of divesting 12-15 specific parastatals. Economic benefits from the project are evident in budget gains, new jobs, additional foreign exchange, and new foreign and domestic investments resulting in more production.  An even more significant indicator of success is the value of assets divested. CONADI, the largest parastatal involved, has divested 40% of its asset portfolio. On the negative side, CONADI's poor management has been an obstacle to more efficient privatization of its assets, and COHDEFOR, another parastatal, has not assigned high priority to privatization, moving exceedingly slowly in implementing the divestiture process.  Marketing and public education activities have been insufficient, and there is a general lack of public knowledge of privatization and its economic and social benefits. While there has been little organized opposition to privatization so far, the project's plans to divest other state-owned enterprises, especially basic services, may face significant resistance from the labor sector. TA provided by the Center for Privatization has been inefficiently managed and the lack of a sustained research component, one effect of which has been an inability to determine the project's impact on women, is a critical oversight.  The Center for Privatization needs to improve significantly its relationship with and support of the TA team.  In addition, the skills required of the TA director were unsuitable; substantial public sector experience and knowledge of Latin American policies and politics should have been required.  On the credit side, the TA team has created an effective debt-for-assets swap mechanism, which has been used in privatizing three enterprises.  In addition, the TA director has successfully maintained a low profile to avoid making the impression that the project is a USAID/H initiative instead of a GOH one.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-0000-I-37-6134-00","","3/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Privatization|Parastatals|Divestiture|Policy reform","Honduras","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAZ839.pdf","3,005 KB","000673 - International Science and Technology Institute, Inc.

"Interim evaluation of a project managed by the Bishopric of Public Ecumenical and Social Services, a department of the Coptic Orthodox Church, to provide clinical services and family planning education through 43 family health care centers throughout Egypt. The project is funded through a grant from Family Planning International Assistance. External evaluation covers the period 1986-3/89. The project is reaching Christian and Moslem populations who previously received limited social services, if any at all. Beneficiaries range from rural villagers, whose only health services are provided by the project mobile units, to garbage collectors in Cairo who receive a variety of social services including clinical and family planning services.  However, while the provision of these services is impressive, the number of acceptors is less than could be achieved.  As of 1/89, there were 29,549 actual acceptors, representing only about one-fourth of a target population of 112,000 to be served.  While these low figures may be due to underreporting, there is a clear need to strengthen project management and service delivery.  The most critical shortcomings in project management are the following: (1) lack of clear lines of authority and supervisory responsibilities, (2) exclusion of field-level personnel from project planning, (3) inexperience of senior staff, and (4) insufficient monitoring of income generation activities. Constraints to service delivery include:  (1) inadequate equipment, supplies, testing, and recordkeeping at family health care centers; (2) insufficient number and training of staff members; and (3) inappropriate educational materials.

"Evaluates health education activities under the rural potable water project in Tunisia. Findings:  (1) The Regional Health Education Team (RHET) has largely carried out its planning for the school health component. (2) Sixteen of the twenty communities selected for the first year of activity have taken steps to reduce water-related diseases through health education. (The animatrices in the other four communities dropped out of the program during the year for various reasons.)  (3) The program has attracted regional, national, and international attention because of its innovative approach and record of success.  (4) Progress within the school health program, the major focus of this consultancy, has been slow, but steps to move the program along have been taken.  (5) The water user associations (WUA's) have not been made responsible for procuring funds to support the initial group of animatrices, nor have community development project funds been secured for this purpose.  (6) The major problems reported in the last consultancy, as well as some others, remain unresolved. Training of Regional Health Education Team (RHET) members in the U.S. has not yet occurred.  RHET's request for ""argent d'encouragement"" has gone unheeded.  Inadequate staffing and the lack of a vehicle are hampering RHET's work.  Funding for the project when AID support ceases in 1991 is still undetermined. Conclusions:  (1) RHET and supporting personnel should be able to carry out most of the planned activities, given additional staffing, continued training, and support.  (2) The community and individuals from the various government agencies have shown the capacity to work toward the goals of the program and ensure its viability.  (3) More frequent and closer collaboration is needed between RHET, those providing TA, and USAID/T to ensure the transfer of technical expertise, follow-through, and general support.  (4) It may have been unrealistic for USAID/T to assume that communities would be willing and able to assume responsibility for development programs after one year.  (5) Community health education programs are unlikely to be sustained if the work of the animatrices in the original sixteen communities is discontinued.

"Mid-term evaluation of a project to strengthen the Government of Togo's (GOT) child survival (CS) services by establishing a planning and coordination unit (PCU) within the Ministry of Public Health, Social Affairs, and Women's Condition (MPHSAWC), providing training in CS education to health center staff, and building a community outreach network.  The evaluation covers the period 9/87-8/89. Although interest in improved CS planning and coordination has increased within both the GOT and the donor community, the project has been blocked from achieving its objectives by several factors.  The PCU component has been hindered by unwillingness within the GOT to alter its vertical planning process.  The MPHSAWC has proven highly resistant to change at the central level, although at the regional and prefecture levels, integration of CS activities and and personnel has begun to take place.  The PCU's weakness stems from several causes:  it has no defined position within the MPHSAWC hierarchy; the planned Advisory Board and National Commission for CS have not been established by the MPHSAWC, despite a condition precedent to this effect; only one senior Togolese counterpart is working full-time with the project; its director is overburdened; and its coordinators are devoting more time to operational activities than to planning.  Although, the PCU has participated usefully in CS planning and policy seminars, it has been too weak to institutionalize integrated planning and budgeting. The health centers component is lagging because the National Health Education Service has been slow to accept project participation and develop a health education strategy. The community outreach component has a set of tried and tested procedures, good logistic field supervision, and a well-equipped and well-staffed project headquarters, but morale is very low. The director is generally absent and MPHSAWC and Mission staff have been slow to act on project matters.  A dispute over USAID/T salary supplements for the Togolese counterparts remains unresolved.  Administrative procedures are loose in certain respects, and the USAID/T and GOT local cost budgets are not well coordinated. In sum, the project will not produce results of sustainable, developmental value unless the GOT, in cooperation with USAID/T, makes a determined effort over the next few months to remove the obstacles identified in this evaluation. The major lesson learned is that no project seeking to introduce new institutional patterns can succeed without strong policy support from the host government.  Secondly, a project of this nature is difficult to launch if the advisors are not on site to work with their counterparts from the outset.  Finally, whenever a project incorporates staff from a prior project, those persons should promptly be inculcated in the new project's objectives. In many people's minds this project is a mere extension of te highly visible former water supply project.","Evaluation period: 17 Jul-7 Aug 1989","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-1406-I-00-7113-00","","8/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Institution building|Child survival activities|Health care planning|Integrated health care|Community health care|Health education","Togo","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABA023.pdf","2,337 KB","004293 - University Research Corp.

"Evaluates project to expand primary health care (PHC) in Grand Gedeh and Sinoe Counties in Liberia, and to strengthen the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (MH&SW), centrally and in the target counties.  The project agreement was signed in 8/3, the TA contract with the MEDEX Group of the University of Hawaii, John A. Burns School of Medicine was signed in 5/84, and a TA team arrived in country in 8/84.  The first phase of the project was completed in 9/89. A self-sustaining, locally controlled PHC network has been established in which communities collected money to start revolving drug funds, appointed health committees, and encouraged health activities: (1) larger towns have been assigned physician assistants and certified midwives to develop health centers/posts; (2) smaller communities have selected community health workers (CHW's), trained and supervised by physician assistant; (3) traditional midwives (TM's) have received training and supervision from the certified midwives; (4) vs. targets of 125 CHW's and 125 TM's trained per county, by the end of the project, 109 CHW's and 337 TM's had been trained. Efforts to improve planning and management have focused on both the county and central MH&SW levels.  (1) Management systems for personnel, finance, drug supplies, communications, transportation, facilities management, health information systems, and general supplies were developed in each county.  (2) Personnel have been hired and trained to implement these systems. Efforts at decentralization have begun, and a limited degree of autonomy has been given by the MH&SW to the counties to make decisions in selected areas such as finance.  (3) Because personnel are centrally paid by the MH&SW, it is expected that sufficient additional funds will be generated locally from user fees and the revolving drug funds to make each system self-supporting. A foundation has also been laid at the central level for the development of the national PHC program:  (1) manuals for each of the 8 decentralized management systems were developed and distributed to the counties and to MH&SW personnel; (2) a National Drug Service (NDS) has been organized to supply drugs and medical supplies at low cost for the nation; (3) national health training institutions have been strengthened with standardized and improved curricula to support PHC; (4) the capacity of the MH&SW to plan, and to develop health management systems, as well as to collect health statistics, has been improved; and (5) appropriate personnel at all levels have been trained to support PHC activities. This training was accomplished at the national and district levels, as well as at Liberian and U.S. training institutions. As the Project completes the first 5 years, there are a number of issues and problems which need to be addressed before the PHC system is expanded to other counties.  Provision of foreign exchange for the NDS is a major issue which jeopardizes not only the life of the NDS but also the county PHC systems.  Much has been accomplished in the area of decentralization, but major steps have yet to be taken in decentralizing the personnel and finance systems.  The counties have accomplished much in this area, and the central level needs to renew its commitment to decentralize management systems within the MH&SW. Supervision is the key to sustainability of the PHC system in the counties.  The supervisory system has been weak, but improvements have been made during the past months.  However, there is still a need for improvement, and supervision should be the major focus of the county level PHC effort.

"Evaluates ESF programs IV, V, and (to the extent it has been implemented) VI to provide budget support to the Government of Senegal (GOS) in return for policy reform.  Counterpart funds are used by the GOS to repay arrears to the private sector. The ESF program addressed several major policy reforms between 1985 and 1989:  rice import privatization/marketing liberalization; phasing out price compensation; raising the efficiency of agro-industry and reducing the fiscal burden; increasing coarse grain consumption and reducing rice imports; and maximizing receipts from wheat imports.  In addition, conditionality aimed at eliminating arrears to the GOS and bringing about transparency in financial relations with agro-industry. Of 59 policy measures, the GOS has satisfied 43, not satisfied 8, and 8 are pending.  (Appendix A shows the status of each conditionality/objective.)  The GOS has proceeded on reforms when the political consequences were considered tolerable. The program succeeded in clearing up arrears owed to the GOS, in bringing about reforms in certain parastatal operations, and in reducing the costs to the GOS of certain private companies. The program has not succeeded in introducing reforms where GOS strategic interests were affected, as with eliminating price compensation or the monopoly on broken rice imports.  However, USAID/S could not present a convincing case that its recommended reforms would bring about economic advantages. The program fully succeeded in providing a vehicle for high-level policy dialogue and for carrying out studies on difficult policy issues. Program management has been smooth and efficient. Dollar deposits helped the GOS alleviate its foreign exchange deficit, and counterpart funds have helped it reach IMF targets by paying off some arrears with the private sector. Failure to meet certain objectives (e.g., privatizing rice imports, eliminating price compensation) can be traced to the CFA franc's overvaluation.  The GOS is unlikely to change its policies while this overvaluation continues.  These 2 reforms are no longer sought by donors, although changes in peanut pricing will be sought. International price trends suggest that price compensation will be in approximate balance in 1989, vs. a loss of about CFAF 27 billion in 1988. While the program has generally succeeded, budget support through the gift of counterpart funds had the opposite effect of that desired; it has hindered structural adjustment rather than fostered reform in at least 2 areas:  reduction of the excessively large civil service payroll, and privatization of loss-making parastatals.  Civil service reduction has been a World Bank conditionality since 1984.  Budget support, however, has made it possible for the GOS to avoid or postpone these key reforms, and to maintain and even increase public expenditure patterns. ESF disbursements should be redirected to job-creating private sector activities, especially small and medium enterprises.  If counterpart funds can be utilized only for budget support, consideration should be given to terminating this program in favor of project assistance.  The USAID/GOS working group on policy reform should continue regardless.

"This paper identifies and describes several impact indicators that can be used to evaluate changes in the natural resource base over time -- changes that may be associated with development efforts. Specifically, the impact indicators include: six soil resource indicators (to measure water- and wind-caused erosion, soil productivity and degration, land use, and run- off), five water resource indicators (to measure availability of ground and surface water, upstream flooding, irrigation efficiency, surface water pollutants, and groundwater contamination), four plant resource indicators (to assess local farming practices, the carrying capacity of rangeland, and the status of forests and wetlands), and two ecosystem indicators (to evaluate general ecological deterioration, and to measure the relative productivity in calories of food produced in a soil-plant ecosystem).  The document also provides a checklist of baseline data needed to implement the indicators.  It is not feasible to use a common set of impact indicators for all interventions, the document concludes; variations in climate, soil, and vegetation in different locations and over time require different sets of indicators.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","11/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Natural resources|Environmental degradation|Environmental research|Measurement and detection|Soil resources|Water resources|Plant resources|Ecosystems","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNABC903.pdf","66 KB","003433 - USAID.

"A.I.D. is currently implementing 87 microenterprise development projects or programs, which will spend $290 million over their total project life.  This study, part of a larger stocktaking of A.I.D.'s microenterprise assistance, provides a statistical overview of the program, including information on its magnitude, composition, and organization; the various types of projects being operated; the types of agencies implementing the projects; and the types of services being provided to microentrepreneurs. The report concentrates on financial levels as a means to help explain and classify the projects and the different approaches used in different regions.  Most field projects deal with broad problems (e.g., finance, private sector development, and private voluntary organizations), with only 12% focusing exclusively on microenterprises.  While nearly every project includes an institutional development component, only 15 (representing 34% of funding) focus solely on this goal; the others concentrate on providing direct benefits and services to entrepreneurs.  Private voluntary organizations implement two-thirds of the projects, representing 52% of funding, while financial institutions implement 16%, covering 37% of funding, and host country governments directly implement projects representing only 4% of funding.  The typical A.I.D. project uses a ""full service"" approach of credit, technical assistance, and training; 55 projects, representing 57% of program funding, employ this approach.  Fifteen credit-only projects represent 37% of funding, while 17 projects representing 6% of funding provide only technical assistance and training.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","9/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Microenterprises|Credit|Institution building|Business support services|Private sector","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAX222.pdf","36 KB","003433 - USAID.

"The impact of grants provided by A.I.D. to four cooperative development organizations (CDO's) is assessed in this report. The organizations include Agricultural Cooperative Development International, the Cooperative Housing Foundation, the National Rural Electric Cooperatives Association, and the World Council of Credit Unions.  The grants have provided financial and program stability for the CDO's.  They have enabled them to hire and retain qualified staff and technicians, coordinate and provide advanced training support, maintain contact with cooperative movements in developing countries, and maintain a presence with host country officials, USAID personnel, and other donor agencies.  Without A.I.D. assistance, at least two of the CDO's would not be involved in international cooperative development. On the negative side, A.I.D. assistance to the CDO's has not been translated effectively into increased support for cooperative development at the Mission and Regional Bureau levels; overall, A.I.D. support for cooperative development appears to be declining in both absolute and relative terms.  Moreover, although A.I.D. support for the CDO's has succeeded in developing a specialized expertise in providing cooperative development services, the CDO's are facing increasing problems in marketing that expertise, due in part to the decline in cooperative-specific projects within A.I.D. and in part to an increase in competition from consulting firms.  Includes recommendations for both A.I.D. and CDO's and chapters on each of the four CDO's.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","OTR-0250-C-00-7230-00","","1/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Cooperative development organizations|Institution building","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNABD802.pdf","1,781 KB","002892 - Automation Research Systems, Ltd.","","000088 - USAID.

"In response to a severe, prolonged drought, A.I.D. and the Government of Morocco initiated a joint effort in 1983 to utilize weather modification techniques to augment rainfall.  The project uses silver iodide as a seeding agent to increase the precipitation efficiency of cold clouds in the Central High Atlas Mountains.  The silver iodide is released from aircraft, ground-based seeding generators, or both during periods when seedable clouds exist in the target area.  Field operations conducted from 1984 to 1989 resulted in the seeding of 15-25 storm events during each season, with a total of 144 seeded days during the 5 years.  This report evaluates the project in terms of its scientific design; institutional development and infrastructure; technology transfer; cloud seeding operations; scientific, hydrologic, and economic studies; and evaluation. The contributions of the Moroccan and U.S. governments are also assessed.  While the project has made significant achievements in all areas, a statistical analysis of the effect of the program on streamflow is not yet possible.  The first 2.5 years of the project must be eliminated from analysis due to low seeding efficiency, leaving only a 1.5-year sample - far less than the 6 years necessary for an accurate evaluation.","Includes bibliographical references|Companion evaluation summary: PD-ABE-143","Special Evaluation","Documents","PASA/IMA-0190-P-IW-4093-00","","9/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Weather modification|Clouds|Atmospheric condensation|Drought","Morocco","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNABD804.pdf","6,913 KB","001176 - U.S. Dept. of the Interior.

"Northeast Thailand, one of the poorest regions in Thailand, has long been a target of donor assistance.  This report summarizes the opinions of villagers in the Weeping Plains area of Northeast Thailand on the effects of donors efforts over the past 20 years. Both group interviews and in-depth individual interviews were conducted, focusing on the major categories of A.I.D. assistance: fertilizer, seed, and agricultual credit.  A contextual background study was conducted as well. Major findings included the following.  (1) Physical infrastructure improvements were by far the most highly valued changes affecting the villagers' lives.  This finding is especially noteworthy in light of A.I.D.'s withdrawal from such activities over the past two decades.  (2) Government policy regarding rice prices has affected all agricultural activities, tending to inhibit adoption of high-yielding varieties dsepite efforts by A.I.D. and other donors to promote them.  (3) Exogenous economic influences, such as the boom in cassava production, and migration to temporary employment elsewhere have been the source of most of the conspicuous wealth (e.g., automobiles and televisions) among villagers.  (4) A.I.D.'s and other donors' agricultural service projects are generally well regarded, with credit programs receiving the highest marks.  (5) Thai farmers are not passive recipients of development assistance.  Far from having to break down resistance to change, donors need to make their interventions competitive in the marketplace of available options.","Related document: PN-ABC-399","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","10/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Farmers|Development assistance|Development program evaluation|Economic impact","Thailand","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAX224.pdf","66 KB","003433 - USAID.

"Program assistance for the support of macroeconomic and sectoral policy reform has become a major element in A.I.D.'s strategy for fostering broad-based and sustainable economic growth in developing countries.  This paper identifies and discusses some of the major operational issues involved in the process of planning, designing, and negotiating policy reform programs.  It is primarily based on lessons learned from A.I.D. experience in developing sector-specific and macroeconomic policy reform programs in Central America, Asia, the Near East, and Africa since 1983.  The topics covered include:  approaches to selecting policy objectives; analytical requirements for designing programs; donor coordination; design of conditionality; use of A.I.D. resources in packaging reforms; sources of A.I.D. influence; and negotiation strategies and styles.  The study also suggests approaches to developing and promoting reform programs based on past successful experiences.  The primary conclusion is that the manner in which A.I.D. develops and negotiates policy reform programs has major implications for the degree of support, the implementation, and the sustainability of the reform program, as well as for the tenor of bilateral relations between the U.S. and host country government.  Therefore, A.I.D. efforts which emphasize collaboration, consensus-building, flexibility, cultural sensitivity, and recognition of local political and economic realities hold the most promise.

"Final evaluation of a project to strengthen democratic leadership in Central America by establishing educational and technical linkages between six Central American countries and six U.S. states.  External evaluation covers the period 9/85-7/89, and focuses on the following partnerships:  Costa Rica-Oregon, Guatemala-Alabama, Honduras-Vermont, and Panama-Delaware. The project, implemented by the National Association of Partners of the Americas (NAPA), had a positive impact on public and private democratic and community institutions in Central America. These institutions have benefited from training, access to valuable materials and professional resources, enrichment of activities and programs, and funding for administrative staff and operating expenses.  The grant also resulted in strengthened democratic leadership and participatory processes at the community level and important linkages between U.S. and Central American institutions and individuals.  These benefits accrued even though none of the leaderships of the partnerships had any knowledge of the specific objectives of the NAPA grant. Regional planning seminars provided an informal opportunity for partnership leaders to exchange information, ideas and experiences, and to develop annual plans for more efficient resource use, better programming, and improved communication between the committees. Seminars on specific topics were a useful introduction to the subject matter, but there was an expressed need for more intensive follow-up TA and training in fundraising and volunteerism. One of the partnerships reviewed successfully established a balanced geographic decentralization in the form of city-to-city linkages, resulting in broader public support, distribution of the administrative burden among several groups, and easier fundraising.  The other partnerships have been unable to solve the practical obstacles to such decentralization, though they consider it a desirable goal. While NAPA is providing a large range of technical services to the partnerships, there is a need to strengthen the quality as well as the quantity of TA, particularly in the area of organizational development. NAPA's minimum 10-day travel requirements resulted in the loss of expert TA for some projects, since many professionals cannot leave their responsibilities for that length of time. While the partnerships have made strides in raising funds for specific programs, they are not financially self-sufficient in terms of operating costs and most lack the fundraising strategies and income-generating capabilities necessary to become so.  It is recommended that future financial support for the program be conditioned on the establishment of plans for financial self-sufficiency within a certain time period.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","LAC-0003-G-SS-5125-00","","10/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","International cooperation|Democracy|Political leadership|Community leadership|Leadership training","Central America|USA|Costa Rica|Guatemala|Honduras|Panama","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABA059.pdf","5,492 KB","003970 - Management Systems International, Inc.

"Evaluates OPG to the Centro Asesor Para El Desarollo de Recursos Humanos de Honduras (CADERH, the Honduran Advisory Council on Human Resources Development) to upgrade vocational training (VT). Evaluation focuses on implementation of Amendment 4 (1987), which increased private sector involvement in VT, and consolidated project activities into 3 core components. CADERH has developed an instructional delivery system in 6 trade areas, which could be replicated in other Latin American countries. However, Amendment 4 must be revised:  objectives related to certification must be pushed back because of problems in test construction, and the target for in-plant training must be reconsidered. While the private sector has helped to define trade areas, competencies, and tasks and has assisted with programs at VT centers, it has not been willing to invest in in-plant training. CADERH's self-financing depends on its multimedia center and other self-initiated income generating activities.  Prospects for income from national employment service, certification, and industry-specific training are not immediate.  Without disbursing loans from the training fund CADERH's income will be insufficient, and employment generation expected from industry-specific training is not likely to be realized. Without an endowment fund, CADERH will be unable to continue human resource development in the VT centers serving marginal students. Lessons Learned:  (1) Amendment 4 anticipated that a key factor for self-sufficiency of CADERH and attainment of Component 2 goals would be the use of a training loan fund.  Guidelines for dispersing this fund were subsequently changed, hampering disbursements and project accomplishments.  When policy changes are clearly detrimental to project success, adjustments in the policy should be considered without disturbing the intent of the policy. (2) In developing competency-based instructional systems, validated competency tests should be in place before developing the self-instructional modules.  Competency tests are operational definitions of tasks and competencies.  As such they provide an excellent guide for curriculum development, allowing for more valid task analyses, instructional sequencing, modeling, relevant guided practice and independent practice in the curriculum and instructional procedures developed.  Without tests as a guide the curriculum tends to loose its focus and there is a mismatch between desired competencies and the program. (3) An institution that must become self-sustaining will tend to offer services to those who can pay for them rather than to marginal populations.  If current levels of high development impact through the training centers in less privileged sectors are to continue, appropriate sources of funding should be provided. (4) Technical advisors must be prepared to adapt to the culture of those they are serving; be sure they know what is needed, not just promote what they have to offer; and work with the clients, not just tell clients what to do.

"Beginning sporadically in the late 1940's, U.S. development assistance to Guatemala's highland Indian areas - the Altiplano - became a major element of A.I.D.'s country development strategy in the late 1960's.  This assistance is evaluated herein with respect to the following core development areas:  agriculture, including efforts in crop diversification, soil conservation, small-scale irrigation, rural credit and cooperatives, and marketing; basic preventive health care, potable water and sanitation, and family planning; primary education, bilingual and nonformal education, school construction, and teacher training; and complementary activities to strengthen municipal and community leadership, decisionmaking, and information systems. According to the report, A.I.D.'s core programs have been appropriate and sustained over time and have clearly had a positive, cumulative effect, especially during the last 15 years, in improving earnings, employment, life expectancy, and education on the Altiplano.  Key cross-cutting factors in this process have included institutional strengthening, training of all kinds (with a growing emphasis on the community), and policy dialogue with the Guatemalan government. However, powerful factors may retard the impact of present and future assistance efforts:  rapid population growth, environmental degradation, institutional and bureaucratic problems, and political violence.

"Interim evaluation of a project to assist Tunisia's Ministry of Health (MOH) in promoting the practice of oral rehydration therapy (ORT) through training of health professionals and public education.  The evaluation covers the period 6/86-11/88. Despite financial uncertainties, weak MOH leadership, and the lack of a long-term strategy, the program has made remarkable progress, largely due to excellent technical and management support from Catholic Relief Services (CRS).  Studies indicate that mortality due to diarrheal diseases has markedly decreased, from about half of infant deaths in 1980 to 5%-25% today. Unfortunately, however, further progress is doubtful, since the MOH lacks sufficient personnel for assuming program leadership after the closing of the CRS office (planned for 6/89). Materials developed for training health professionals appear excellent, but while some 30% of public sector physicians have received refresher training, these activities have not reached private sector physicians, who play a large role in Tunisian health care.  Moreover, diarrheal disease control education in schools of medicine and public health has been uneven. Materials for training mothers are flexible and well adapted to Tunisian realities, but they had a very limited application. Laudable efforts have been made in mass media communication, but the content of radio and television spots has not always been clear and complete.  For example, the promotion of five different home solutions is potentially confusing. A very solid evaluation program has been carried out to monitor and revise the program approach.  The MOH information system, on the other hand, should be simplified and better supervised, with increased emphasis on feedback and application to program operations. While ORT appears to be widely practiced in public health facilities, the use of inappropriate and dangerous antidiarrheals remains extensive. It is recommended that the MOH ban the importation, local production, and sale of these products, while supporting the production of oral rehydration salts by the Pharmacie Centrale de la Tunisie.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","DPE-5969-Z-00-7064-00","","6/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Oral rehydration therapy|Diarrhea|Infant mortality","Tunisia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNABD890.pdf","2,623 KB","000750 - Management Sciences for Health (MSH)","","000186 - USAID.

"U.S. program food aid is provided on a loan or grant basis and is generally sold to generate local currency for developmental purposes. In FY 1988, such commodities, totaling 5.4 million MT, accounted for half of all food aid and 16% of economic assistance.  This study, largely a synthesis of program evaluations, audits, and related studies, evaluates the development impact of this aid, with special attention to macroeconomic performance, the food sector, and program management.  In general, program food aid appears to have a positive impact on the performance of recipient countries at the macroeconomic and sectoral level.  However, the increasing emphasis on promoting policy reform has produced mixed results, with just over half of evaluations reporting an improved policy environment.  Moreover, given the current program design, food aid is unlikely to have an immediate or direct impact on its primary target - the urban and rural poor.  Serving primarily as a balance of payments support, program food aid has generally not added to the food supply available for consumption. Recommendations for program modification focus on (1) increasing the grant component to reduce the impact on future debt and maximize policy leverage and (2) encouraging the use of food aid-generated resources to alleviate the immediate negative impact of structural adjustment on the poor.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-0000-I-39-6135-00","","8/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Food aid programs|Nonproject assistance|Food for Peace Title I|Food for Peace Title II|Food for Peace Title III|Balance of payments","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNABD893.pdf","5,876 KB","000833 - Robert R.

"Evaluates the impact of three irrigation projects in the Indian state of Maharashtra:  (1) Mula, a major project in the drought- prone Ahemednagar district; (2) Chulband, a medium-scale project in the assured rainfall district of Bhandara; and (3) Sidhanath, a small-scale project in the rainfall-scarce district of Sangli. The evaluation was based on Rapid Appraisal and Comprehensive Evaluation surveys. Based on the Rapid Appraisal technique, the Mula project had the highest economic rate of return (ERR), at 19.5%, which was more than 7% above the international minimum target of 12%. Chulband's ERR of 9.77% was the lowest of the three, while Sidhanath had an intermediate ERR of 15.9%.  The most important benefit for Mula and Sidhanath, the two projects with the highest ERR's, derived from the introduction of new non-foodgrain crops under canal irrigation inside the Mula and Sidhanath commands. Foodgrain cropping and production also increased in both of the high return projects, but they accounted for only 15% of the total benefits, which suggests that foodgrain yield and area increases cannot pay for the level of investment required for these types of projects. Most of the indirect benefits of the Mula and Sidhanath projects also derived from crop diversification.  In ""Influence Areas"" (areas in close proximity to the irrigation projects) the income benefit associated with irrigation was most significant around the Sidhanath groundwater influence area.  In all three cases, the irrigation has lead to increases in indirect (non-crop) employment and landless family benefits; these impacts were much larger for new crops than for foodgrains.  The health impacts of irrigation appear to be positive, reducing the gap between ""dry landers"" and ""wet landers"" before irrigation.  Health benefits are calculated as accounting for 2-3% of the ERR's.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","386-0481-C-00-8169-00","","3/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Irrigated farming|Crop diversification|Food production|Farm income|Health aspects|Irrigation system construction|Cereal crops","India","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNABD899.pdf","1,090 KB","004920 - SRD Research Associates Inc.","","003165 - India.

"Food availability and consumption indicators can be obtained through methods varying from time-consuming, detailed analysis to rapid data collection involving rough approximations.  This report looks at food availability and consumption indicators, focusing on both direct (e.g., budget surveys, minimal data sets) and indirect (e.g., household food availability, nutritional status) indices.  These data can be used to design agricultural and rural development projects, choose a target population or appropriate interventions, or monitor and evaluate project results. National food and agricultural planning also relies on food consumption data for knowledge of the nutritional and food consumption status of the population and for forecasting future food consumption needs.  The document concludes that government policies from foreign exchange rates to fertilizer subsidies have an eventual impact on food consumption, making food consumption data a vital part of estimating the effects of present and proposed policies.  Three appendices detail food consumption considerations in the design of agricultural projects, data categories for dietary assessment, and secondary data sources for food and nutrition status indicators.

"PACR of a project (4/82-7/89) implemented by Mississippi State University (MSU) to improve the access of Thai farmers to high-quality seed by strengthening the Department of Agricultural Extension (DOAE) Seed Division (SD) and its seed centers; supporting seed development, promotion, and marketing; and encouraging private sector involvement in the seed industry. The project was successful and its results should be long-lasting. The SD expanded from 4 centers under project 4930270 in 1978 to 20 centers by the end of the present project.  Twenty SD staff members received M.S. training in seed technology, agricultural management, and agricultural economics and are now working at seed centers throughout the country.  Informal seed clubs or associations were established, helping foster relationships between the public and private sectors. Seed production increased from 165 mt in 1976 to 21,700 mt in 1987 (a 13,000% increase), but this amount was only 5.6% of the total demand of 388,687 mt.  Farmer demand for certified seed grew markedly every year, while the SD was able to increase its production just 2,000 mt annually. Nevertheless, because the project did intensify farmer demand for improved seed, several private businesses were prompted to establish operations in Thailand's seed market.  In particular, Cargill International, Pacific Seeds, Pioneer, and Bangkok Hybrid Seeds moved into maize seed production during the project period. The project's success was due primarily to the MSU and SD administration and support staff.  They provided good leadership, were flexible and cooperative, and had specific, realistic goals. Further, seed centers flourished because of their small-size and strategic location, which facilitated efficient operations and maintenance, minimum transport costs, and the ability to meet local seed needs. Continuous staff training and upgrading was also a key element of project success. Lessons learned include the following.  (1) Decentralized seed facilities expand the seed production area at minimum cost and help promote the use of improved seed as farmers see firsthand its production.  (2) For U.S. university staff to be productive and able to devote long periods of time away from their school, the university administration must be willing to advance the staff along normal career paths, as MSU did in this instance. (3) MSU's decision to specialize in a limited development agenda, i.e., seed development, was a sound idea.","Loan no. 493-T-027","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","8/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Seeds|Seed production|Seed testing|Distribution|Private sector|Private enterprises","Thailand","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABA137.pdf","195 KB","008613 - USAID.

"In December 1988, the International Training in Health (INTRAH) Program conducted a formal assessment of the impact of training and TA on the family planning (FP) activities of the Chad Ministry of Public Health (MOPH).  It was found that INTRAH training interventions played a part in changing the FP policy environment and in developing specific capabilities of MOPH and Ministry of Social Affairs and the Promotion of Women (MOSA/PW) personnel (five clinicians, 30 IEC/FP social workers and two evaluators).  Moreover, the particular combination of training, TA, and material inputs that were made appeared to have had a positive impact on the number of persons using FP services.

"PACR of a project (8/84 to 12/88) implemented by the International Executive Service Corps (IESC) to assist small and medium-sized private enterprises (SME's) in Honduras by providing short-term technical assistance through its volunteer executive program.  The project (522-ESF-0258) was funded locally by USAID/H, except that operating costs for the San Pedro Sula office, as well as U.S. recruiting costs, were financed by the Bureau for Private Enterprises' core grant to IESC. The project was successful and all outputs were accomplished, with 186 SME's receiving TA, compared to a target of 100.  IESC has provided an increasing amount of assistance to diverse sectors of the economy and in a wide variety of skill areas.  The effectiveness of the volunteer executives was evident from interviews and anecdotal evidence.  Client satisfaction was high, and in the majority of cases the clients felt they received much more assistance than they had specifically contracted.  With the end of the core grant to IESC, future recruiting costs will have to be borne by USAID/H or by clients. Four major lessons were learned.  (1) Guidelines for charging IESC clients and selection of recipients need to be established. (2) IESC must focus and expand its marketing activities, establish target numbers for projects by size and sector, and set a budget for advertising.  (3) Achievement indicators need to be developed to measure the impact of project TA on income and employment.  (4) As the opening of an office in Tegucigalpa demonstrated, field offices are necessary to expand the number of projects and the sectors served.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","6/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Business support services|Private enterprises|Small scale enterprises|Medium scale enterprises|Volunteers|Technical assistance|Management training","Honduras","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABA158.pdf","58 KB","008555 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (1981-1988) to provide a potable water supply for refugees in the area of Port Sudan, Sudan. The project was delayed by flood damage in 1983, political problems between Port Sudan residents and refugees, and design and construction defects discovered in 1985.  However, a remedial plan instituted in 1986 was implemented efficiently, and the water system is now operating as originally planned.  The system consists of a slow sand filter with a 25,000 cu m capacity, along with a storage tank and 30 standpipes installed at the UN-funded Asotriba refugee camp.  When surface flows are adequate, an additional 14,000 cu m per day of water is available for the municipal Port Sudan system. Phase I and II (through 8/84) were implemented under the direction of Sudan's Commmissioner of Refugees.  This situation created many project difficulties.  When the proper agency, the National Urban Water Corporation, was involved with the project during Phase III, implementation was smooth. Another lesson learned is that slow sand filtration for water treatment is a simple process viable for application in municipal water supply projects.  These systems can be built, operated, and maintained by Sudanese communities.  Furthermore, completed projects with design and/or construction problems can be salvaged with relatively low additional project costs.","Title supplied by cataloger","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","11/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Refugees|Water filtration|Potable water|Water treatment|Water supply engineering","Sudan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABA159.pdf","106 KB","008607 - USAID.

"A synthesis of A.I.D.'s recent stocktaking of its 32 microenterprise development projects and programs is presented. Three approaches are distinguished: enterprise formation, enterprise expansion, and enterprise transformation (i.e., graduation from the sector). Key findings include, inter alia, the following. (1) Measurement of program impacts -- both their magnitude and sustainability -- could be considerably improved. (2) Most programs focus on a limited number of beneficiaries, especially when compared to the number reached by financial institutions. The latter, however, cannot meet the long-term needs of microenterprises. (3) Microenterprise programs are well suited to integrating women into the development process and can reach members of the poor majority, but affect the poorest of the poor only indirectly, i.e., by creating jobs. (4) The programs can create productive new employment opportunities, particularly in manufacturing, and often have a significant influence on the development of financial markets. (5) Cost per beneficiary varies widely across programs, being relatively high in formation programs, often low in expansion programs, and high in transformation programs. (6) Cost per dollar loaned varied from $0.19 for a simple credit program to $7.68 for a women's enterprise formation program. In general, the available data, while limited, suggest very high returns to investments in microenterprises. (7) To be successful, the implementing agency needs honesty and good management, but not financial sustainability; some form of subsidy is usually required. (8) Programs that provide direct, short-term credit have a better record than do more ambitious transformation programs. However, the needs of the vast majority of microenterprises cannot be satisfied by small working capital loans. The question how to meet these needs remains unanswered. (9) Successful programs focus first and foremost on developing profitable businesses and on other objectives, e.g., directing resources to disadvantaged groups, only if consistent with this purpose. (10) The role played by credit is much better understood than that played by technical assistance and training. (11) When possible, transformation efforts should focus on graduating programs (from project to commercial funding sources) rather than enterprises.","Summary: PN-ABG-025","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","12/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Microenterprises|Business support services|Impact assessment|Credit","Indonesia|Latin America|Dominican Republic","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAX227.pdf","212 KB","003433 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of a grant to the Overseas Education Fund (OEF) to promote civic action in Honduras, Guatemala, and Costa Rica by providing nonformal educational (NFE) activities for grassroots groups and by distributing informational materials.  External evaluation covers the period 10/85-7/89. Despite setbacks and difficult working environments, the program fulfilled and in some cases surpassed expectations.  Some 160 grassroots organizations in more than 36 communities were strengthened through training in democratic philosophies and organizational skills.  The training focused on more than 350 promoters.  In addition, an estimated 2,500-3,000 people participated in program training sessions, seminars, conferences, and educational and cultural events.  If indirect beneficiaries are taken into account, it can be said that the project objective of training a total of 12,000 individuals was achieved. The target organizations now play a stronger role in improving their communities and in making claims on local and national governmental agencies for improved public services.  On the individual level, perhaps the greatest beneficiaries were women, who gained a more positive image of themselves through participation in community change processes. Beneficiaries in general reported increased self-confidence, ability to speak up in public, and awareness of their role in decisionmaking and the strength of collective efforts. The program's national impact is primarily in the distribution of educational materials, including slide shows, videos, educational pamphlets, and guides.  Honduran publications include a citizen's handbook on gaining access to social services and obtaining civil documents and a planning manual for community groups.  Both documents have been in great demand by governmental and non-governmental agencies and universities.  The Costa Rican program produced a guide for forming local committees, a coloring book on the importance of the environment, and a video on street children in San Jose. Project experience both positive and negative indicates a model which can and should be adapted to promote more effective grassroots citizenship in other South American and Caribbean countries.  Major elements of the model include:  employing an NFE approach geared to active participation by community groups; adopting a regional thrust for the program as a whole, together with a networking orientation on the national level; using like-minded and committed national teams; linking local self-efforts to national policies and institutions; employing staff conversant with local and indigenous cultures; maintaining flexibility in working with both mixed and single-sex groups; producing easy-to-use educational materials; and seeking a variety of funding sources.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","LAC-0003-A-00-5103-00","","8/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Democracy|Political participation|Civil and political rights|Civic action","Honduras|Guatemala|Costa Rica","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABA188.pdf","4,888 KB","003970 - Management Systems International, Inc.

"The Mid-term Assessment of the matching grant to Winrock International for the On-Farm Seed Project (OFSP) in Senegal and The Gambia primarily addresses the institutional aspects of the project. The OFSP is seen by both A.I.D. and Winrock as a pilot effort to derive useful models for bringing the essential agricultural technologies ""downstream,"" to small African farmers. The potential lessons motivated A.I.D. to support the OFSP despite the ""high risk"" nature of its collaborative design. Among the significant conclusions or lessons that can be derived from the assessment are that: (1) the OFSP is providing a valued service to small farmers; (2) the participatory process approach can be used to transfer a range of agricultural technologies to small farmers; (3) there is reason to believe the on-farm model has application elsewhere in Africa; (4) there is a strong likelihood the on-farm model will achieve sustainability in Senegal and The Gambia. The innovative and experimental nature of the OFSP extends beyond its field impact. It also is significant in the context of the changing roles of U.S. PVO's. It explores transfer of state-of-the-art technological resources from highly respected Northern institutions with minimum operational presence. Though the complex collaborative arrangement among Winrock, Mississippi State, and The PVO Center has not been without its problems, both the OFSP's success and its failures provide useful lessons. The most important is that the low-profile technology transfer design requires a preliminary phase of systematic and participatory planning involving all the potential partners in the field and in the U.S. In the long-term, such planning will result in a more integrated, efficient, and cost-effective use of the institutional resources of all participating organizations. The initial OFSP design did not adequately anticipate the need for planning. Another important lesson, based on conversations with local informants in The Gambia and Senegal, is that the OFSP and indeed PVO activities in general, must increasingly judge their work by how well and how quickly they are creating conditions where host country institutions are able to solve their own problems using their own expertise. This is the central challenge for the OFSP in the ensuing two-and-one-half years. Certain critical elements have contributed to the success OFSP has enjoyed in The Gambia and Senegal. Four appear to be essential: (1) ""on-farm"" point of entry; (2) collaborative, participatory, non-operational modality; (3) solid expertise; (4) minimal staffing. These are best summarized as minimal design. The OFSP promotes low input appropriate farming technology to the end user and makes use of existing institutional resources rather than duplicates them. It is very significant that the lean administrative structure of the model acts as a natural brake on the institutional tendency do the job rather than transfer skills. The OFSP is up and running. With judicious attention to anchoring the concept of on-farm technology transfer model organically into the development structures of the host countries, there is every reason to expect it will provide a permanent and valuable new TA resource to small farmers and their support institutions. The evolution of the project also will continue to provide important points of reference to the U.S. PVO community as it seeks to make itself more relevant and effective in a changing development environment.

"Evaluates subproject in Bangladesh to strengthen Upazila-level interest and capability in family planning (FP) by sending Upazila teams to Indonesia to study that country's program, and while there to prepare plans for FP activities at home. The subproject design has some critical weaknesses.  (1) The planning process - primarily because it takes place in Indonesia - is not producing carefully developed, detailed plans that can be readily implemented, supported and expanded in the Upazilas. (2) There is no clear provision for sustained financial support beyond the 12-month implementation plan.  (3) Explicit mechanisms have not been provided for coordination with existing (and substantial) NGO activities and for encouraging NGO participation in the project.  (4) Mechanisms have not been designed to provide maximum opportunities to learn from and share subproject experience.  (5) Project resources available for the subproject are not focused sufficiently on planning and implementation requirements in Bangladesh. There are four major weaknesses in implementation.  (1)The Ministry of Health and Family Planning MOHFP frequently has not followed the terms of the agreement regarding individuals selected to participate, and the time frame for approving participants and issuing the necessary authorizations.  (2) The area of proposed activity in some Upazilas represents a very small part of the Upazila, with the result that the subproject is not necessarily demonstrating how an Upazila's FP program can be made more effective.  (3) There has been insufficient effort to encourage and assist NGO's to participate in the subproject.  (4) Monitoring of implementation and provision of TA to Upazilas have been inadequate.

"During 1988-1989, A.I.D. undertook a major stocktaking of its microenterprise development activities to identify effective projects and programs and the factors responsible for their success.  This paper provides a conceptual overview of microenterprises to help clarify some of the issues involved in the stocktaking exercise.  After an introductory review of the exercise, Section 2 presents a brief history of microenterprise development and of A.I.D.'s involvement in it. Section 3 examines the nature and characteristics of microenterprises, locating them midway between the survival activities of the very poorest and more complex small-scale enterprises and identifying the entry barriers between these levels of economic activity. It also presents a framework for comparing programs by distinguishing three approaches to microenterprise development: (1) enterprise formation, which intregrates those in the survival-oriented economy into the microeconomy; (2) enterprise expansion, which improves the performance of existing microenterprises; and (3) enterprise transformation, which graduates firms from microenterprises to small-scale enterprises. Section 4 focuses on program performance as measured by the criteria of impact on beneficiaries, cost-effectiveness, and institutional sustainability. Section 5 outlines the major factors which influence program peformance: targeting, strategy, credit tactics, technical assistance/training tactics, and institutional factors.  An appendix profiles the 32 microenteprise assistance programs reviewed during the exercise.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","12/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Microenterprises|Business support services|Development program evaluation|Development project evaluation|Sector evaluation","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAX228.pdf","10,703 KB","003433 - USAID.

"Mid-term evaluation of a project to strengthen the education and training capability of the Department of Management Studies of University of the West Indies (UWI), Jamaica.  External evaluation covers the period 1987-6/89. The contractor, Pennsylvania State University (PSU), has performed effectively in several areas, and the project is generally on target and proceeding apace.  Nine new UWI staff members will have received MSc degrees from PSU by the end of Phase I, and 2 existing staff members have gone to PSU for short-term training and 8 for consultations.  The project has made remarkable progress in developing an Executive MBA (EMBA) program, which is scheduled to begin in 7/89, but work on upgrading the BSc, certificate, and diploma programs has progressed slowly.  The Institute of Business has been approved and must immediately focus on research, consultancies, and internships.  Building construction is complete and 70% of computer procurement has been carried out.  However, while the library list is complete, purchasing of materials awaits USAID/J's obligation of FY89 funds.  Despite its success in the areas noted above, PSU must quicken its pace if it is to meet its contractual obligations regarding the Bsc program, the introduction of instructional aids, teaching Bsc and EMBA courses, and establishing a library data base by the 9/90 PACD. UWI support is generally positive, but a sense of alienation from the project still exists among some staff members.  The project has a stronger relationship with the private sector, with many firms demonstrating a willingness to contribute human and financial resources to project activities.  The project has also held meetings and seminars to develop linkages with other management training institutions. Recommendations for Phase II are included.","Companion project evaluation summary: PD-ABA-991","Special Evaluation","Documents","532-0129-O-00-9137-00","","10/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Management training|Management education|Universities and colleges|Institution building|Higher education","Jamaica","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABA180.pdf","1,224 KB","000981 - Pragma Corp.","","008563 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (9/85-3/89) implemented by Fundacion Hondurena para la Rehabilitacion en Integracion de Limitado (FUHRIL), a Honduran umbrella PVO, to support its handicapped rehabilitation services and to strengthen its funding base. Results were mixed.  On the positive side, with the exception of the number of pamphlets printed, all the target outputs of the project's training/community education components were surpassed, including the number of member PVO's involved, the number of institutional personnel trained in awareness campaigns and special education, and the extent of awareness campaign activities, e.g., conferences, television and radio spots, and printed articles.  Additionally, FUHRIL has developed a modest source of income from its wheel chair, cane, and crutch fabrication shop, which is staffed and managed by handicapped workers, and from the shops it recently took over from World Rehabilitation for assembling hearing aids and other items. Nevertheless, FUHRIL has not become financially self-sustaining. Designed to be the major source of income, a fundraising telethon was organized under an independent committee with guidance from FUHRIL and TA contractors.  However, because it was not under direct control of FUHRIL, the committee took control of the telethon, severed ties with the PVO, and offered only a small percentage of the income raised by the telethon to FUHRIL.  The telethon commitee then proceeded with the building of three rehabilitation centers, but FUHRIL was marginalized from the management of these centers and from the committee's income. As a result, FUHRIL had to change its income-generating strategies late in the project.  New fundraising activities included establishing ties with the sponsor of the national lottery - Patronato Nacional de Infancia - and contacting the Ford and Kellogg Foundations, European donors, and the Honduran private sector.  The new funding ensured FUHRIL's survival as an institution and allowed the organization to continue training and rehabilitation services for handicapped persons. However, FUHRIL's services to its members as well as the developmental impact of its activities have been limited.  Despite these shortcomings, FUHRIL deserves special recognition for what it achieved given the project's short time period and limited funding. Two lessons were learned.  (1) Social services such as rehabilitation and training of handicapped persons cannot be transformed into net income generators; activities of this nature require continuing donor support from private or public sector sources. (2) Certain conditions precedent to the disbursement of funds for the telethon should have been included in the project agreement with FUHRIL to ensure that outside interests could not take advantage of these project investments.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Social services|Handicapped persons|Private voluntary organizations|Foundations|Institution building|Rehabilitative medicine","Honduras","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABA184.pdf","83 KB","008555 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (1980-1988) to develop the capacity of a Peruvian company, ELECTROPERU (EP), to provide reasonably priced, hydro-generated electrical energy for rural towns in the sierra and high jungle. Project goals have been attained.  Although only 5 of 10 planned power plants were completed due to economic crises and terrorism in Peru, the completed plants are operating well, and EP plans to complete construction at the remaining 5 sites by 1991. The project substantially improved the quality of life of the rural beneficiaries - about 26,000 families in 40 communities.  In addition to lighting and household uses, the provision of electricity facilitated:  the use of school facilities in two and sometimes three shifts; the installation of small and cottage industries like carpentries and cheesemaking; and increased production by several old small mining cooperative enterprises. EP's public education efforts were a key factor in project success. Some 52 communities served by the 10 project sites received information and training on the use of electricity to increase economic activities and productivity.  EP rural promoters made effective use of TV audiovisual materials to educate beneficiaries about the uses of electricity and about procedures for financing distribution systems and household connections.  These efforts were complemented by promoters from the departmental development committees. The EP's office for small hydroelectric plants was substantially strengthened, growing from a small unit with limited activities into a large directorate responsible for implementing a countrywide program. The EP institutionalized feasibility study methodologies developed under the project, although it conducted fewer than half of the target number of studies.  The project also stimulated and supported the development of a national private industry capable of manufacturing electromechanical and electrical equipment and materials for small hydroelectric plants.  It received strong governmental support, primarily because the development of hydroelectricty reduces consumption of kerosene, a fuel heavily subsidized by the GOP. As a result of project experiences, the following bottlenecks were identified:  (1) excessive delays when reviewing contractors' claims for extra earthmoving work (a unit price construction contract is recommended); (2) limitations of the counterpart agency in providing, on a timely basis, sufficient and appropriate technical personnel, transportation, secretarial support, and communication facilities (grant funds were used to overcome these difficulties, e.g., by hiring local TA, renting vehicles, etc.); (3) lack of definition of counterpart responsibilies, especially given the decentralization process EP was undergoing; (4) constant changes in personnel and procedures for supervising subprojects; (5) unrealistic estimates of the time required for the bidding process; (6) unrealistic pricing of electricity, mandated by the GOP, made it impossible for EP to provide timely counterpart funding.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","11/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Hydroelectric power plants|Hydroelectric power|Feasibility studies","Peru","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABA205.pdf","195 KB","008591 - USAID.

"Mid-term evaluation of a project to construct small-scale groundwater irrigation systems and intermediate-scale surface water systems in three eastern provinces of Indonesia -- South Sulawesi, Nusa Tenggara Barat, and Nusa Tenggara Timor.  The evaluation covers the period 8/85-8/89. The project is behind schedule by as much as two years, primarily as the result of an ineffective management structure and the lack of management planning and monitoring systems.  Unless these problems are resolved, it is unlikely that the project can be successfully implemented.  Nonetheless, some accomplishments have been made, especially in the surface water component.  Although none of these systems have been constructed, substantial progress has been made in system design.  Three projects are expected to start construction within the next 18 months, while final designs and contract documents for all 8 projects will be prepared by 9/91.  (Of the 10 proposed surface water projects, 2 were found to be technically infeasible.) The groundwater irrigation component has been less successful. Only two small demonstration systems have been constructed and, although they are of good quality and have a high level of farmer participation, coherent plans for further progress in this component are lacking.  Two potential areas for groundwater irrigation development have been identified, and the major need now is to initiate a combined exploration and development drilling program. Participant training has been well done, with 27 long-term participants now returning, while in-country training needs to be better planned and executed. A two-year extension is recommended.","ISPAN activity no. 652B|Companion project evaluation summary: PD-ABB-363|Project title: Irrigation support project for Asia and the Near|East (ISPAN)","Special Evaluation","Documents","ANE-0289-C-00-7044-00","","11/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Irrigation|Irrigation sites|Surface irrigation|Subsurface irrigation","Indonesia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABA227.pdf","1,368 KB","000333 - Camp Dresser and McKee, Inc.

"External interim (10/85-12/89) evaluation of the Family Planning Management Training (FPMT) project, which is implemented by Management Sciences for Health (MSH). FPMT clearly addresses a major need.  The project design, however, fell short of what was needed to meet the actual project objective, i.e., to strengthen leadership and management FP programs.  A primary focus on training alone, in the absence of a strategy for organizational development, is not likely to strengthen the management of FP organizations. Fortunately, MSH recognized this shortcoming and has focused instead on the organizational and management development needs of organizations conducting FP programs.  FPMT staff refer to this as ""institutional development.""  They emphasize, correctly, that formal training is but one part of improving the management of an organization.  FPMT has effectively expanded its role and, consequently, improved its capacity to enhance the performance of FP organizations. MSH is on schedule in meeting most contract deliverables.  An exception is long-term training, but that de-emphasis is appropriate. MSH's contract should be revised accordingly. FPMT has developed an effective conceptual framework that helps organize the myriad activities that a centrally funded project engages in while functioning worldwide.  The ""Stages of Program Development"" framework, which was developed by FPMT as a starting point in assessing the FP programs of countries and client organizations and for tailoring FPMT assistance to their stages of development (emergence/survival, growth, and maturity), is a useful, innovative approach.  It could benefit, however, from further refinement. Project Components:  (1) Needs Assessments and Management Development Plans have for the most part been well executed and have identified the priority management problems of the client organizations.  (2) Training - FPMT has done an excellent job in carrying out most of its short-term, LDC-based workshops and other specifically designed training activities. Other donor organizations are beginning to ask FPMT for assistance, which speaks very highly of the appropriateness of FPMT's client-tailored training.  Long-term U.S. training has been handled quite well, but MSH is correct in concluding that it is not a very effective or appropriate means for strengthening FP organizations, especially those struggling to get programs started.  (3) TA - while envisioned by AID as follow-up assistance after training, FPMT has commendably made TA (in institutional development) the central component of the project and generally done an outstanding job in this area.  (4) Materials and course development has been uneven.  Only a few of the many good starts at materials development have been completed in a way that ensures the continued usability of the materials to the client organizations or their transferability to other programs and projects. The consortium structure has not contributed greatly to the achievement of FPMT objectives.  The exception is LASPAU (the Latin American Scholarship Program of American Universities, which has a single task - placement of long-term training candidates - but even in this, LASPAU functions more as a subcontractor than a consortium partner. Finally, FPMT has developed good criteria for evaluating its training activities.  It has not, however, developed adequate criteria for evaluating its organizational development activities.

"Evaluation of a project to establish a Center for Privatization (CFP) to promote privatization and provide A.I.D. Missions with resources for helping host governments implement divestiture. External evaluation covers the period 9/85-8/89. The project's major achievements are in its promotional activities, which include seminars, efforts to stimulate multilateral dialogue, participation in international conferences, networking and marketing, studies, and reconnaissance missions to the field.  While limited direct impact on divestitures can be attributed to these promotional activities, they have changed the attitudes of many developing country officials and Missions. Through its subcontractors, the CFP has been able to provide fast access to a range of short- and long-term TA for Missions in 49 countries; this assistance was most effective when Missions and host governments maintained close supervision of and collaboration with the TA teams.  Successful long-term TA in Tunisia and Honduras has achieved 21 privatization transactions worth about $75 million.  However, the CFP has failed to fully utilize its subcontractors, relying instead primarily on its core staff, which is not technically experienced and has limited ability to support teams in the field.  This has created friction with the subcontractors and the Bureau for Private Enterprise. Moreover, reports submitted to Missions by the CFP have been of limited quality and often delayed. A major lesson learned is that privatization projects always take longer to develop than anticipated.  To be successful, four important conditions must exist:  (1) host government commitment; (2) a good working relationship between Missions and government bureaucracies; (3) identification of the timing and quality of resource needs; (4) and proper management of these resources. The project also illustrated that the mixture of buy-in assignments with a core-funded set of activities can create conflicting objectives (financial versus technical) for the contractor, which can dilute the overall project impact.  On the other hand, such arrangements can provide Missions with flexibility to explore and introduce controversial new subjects, such as privatization.  It is recommended that host countries participate in research activities when sensitive issues, such as valuation, are involved in order to promote acceptance of the often controversial results.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","DPE-0008-C-00-5058-00|PDC-1096-I-19-8043-00|PDC-1096-I-00-8043-00","","12/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Privatization|Divestiture|Technical assistance|Policy dialogue","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABA281.pdf","2,290 KB","006727 - Development Alternatives, Inc.

"PACR of a project (7/80-12/88) to improve and expand the Honduran health care system by providing TA in health technologies, logistics and maintenance, management and planning, and human resource development. The project had a dramatic impact on national health.  During the project period, the infant mortality rate decreased from 117 to 60/1000, while general mortality dropped from 14/1000 to 8/1000. Fertility rates dropped from 7.5 to about 5.6 and the national population growth rate was consequently reduced from 3.5% to under 3%.  In terms of specific diseases, the following improvements occurred:  the number of malaria cases decreased from more than 50,000 to 23,000; whooping cough dropped from 2,453 cases to 223; measles was reduced from 4,188 to 1,033 cases; and deaths from diarrheal disease dropped by 40%.  These improvements are attributed primarily to expanded immunization coverage, improved diarrhea treatment and control, and an increase in contraceptive prevalence.  These efforts were supported by numerous technical achievements in the areas of logistics, maintenance and transportation, management and planning, mass media health education, training of health personnel at all levels, and supervision of health delivery. In a few areas, the project failed to accomplish objectives. These included:  establishment of a chain of low-cost pharmacies, establishment of community-managed rotating drug funds, continuing education of health personnel, and development of manuals for medical/surgical supplies, hospital equipment, and office supplies. Several lessons were learned.  (1) Project effectiveness was aided by a design effort lasting 2 full years and undertaken in collaboration with the Ministry of Health (MOH), as well as by the MOH's policy commitment to primary health care and adequate budget support from the Government of Honduras (GOH). Health sector projects are complex and require significant allocation of personnel resources, as well as continuous and intensive monitoring by both the USAID and the TA team. These requirements are more than compensated for, however, by the flexibility of such projects in tackling problems across a broad front. (3) A.I.D. and GOH procurement procedures make delays in arrival of commodities almost inevitable.  (4) Project managers must devote considerable effort to balancing institutional and operational objectives, as well as to coordinating with other donors in order to avoid conflicting and overlapping activities.","Evaluation period: Jul 1980-Dec 1988","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","DPE-1018-C-00-5063-00","","1/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Immunizations|Health care planning|Contraceptive prevalence|Infant mortality|Morbidity","Honduras","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABA253.pdf","275 KB","000223 - Academy for Educational Development, Inc.

"PACR of a project (1978-1986) to assist the Botswana Agricultural College (BAC) in doubling its intake of students in certificate programs and establishing diploma-level programs in the areas of agriculture and animal health. Although the project succeeded by 1982 in doubling the intake of BAC certificate programs, enrollment was reduced by the Government of Botswana in 1985 due to a lack of employment opportunities for graduates.  Nonetheless, the project made noteworthy achievements, primarily as a result of the strong commitment of the South Dakota State University (SDSU) TA team. There is a general consensus that the students coming out through the new BAC curricula are much better trained than those graduated under the old system.  In addition, by strengthening the BAC the project has allowed the GOB to open degree programs in the same facility, and the BAC will soon become part of the University of Botswana. U.S. long-term training was provided to 19 BAC staff members (15 BS, 5 MS, and 1 Doctor of Veterinary Medicine; 2 students received 2 degrees each).  All participants returned to the BAC except the DVM degree holder, who was assigned elsewhere. Short-term training was provided to five BAC staff (one in Kenya, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands, and two in the United States).  In addition, USAID/B provided U.S. training to 10 MOA staff members.  Participant training was skewed towards animal science training with little emphasis on the socioeconomic sciences, genetics and biometry, or agricultural engineering - all of which are required in the BAC's diploma-level curricula. Most major inputs were provided in a timely manner and in appropriate quality and quantity.  Facility construction, although slightly delayed, was completed by 10/82 and the campus is attractive and functional. Some problems were encountered with commodity procurement because of suppliers' failure to follow specifications.  Several pieces of equipment are sitting idle or are not being properly utilized because operating manuals are not available.  The expensive air-conditioning unit in the animal health center is not operational. Several lessons were learned.  (1) The choice of a Title XII University to design and implement a project of this nature was appropriate since project services were the natural extension of staff members' day-to-day work at the home institution.  (2) SDSU's ability to assemble a TA team from its large faculty was beneficial, since each member's capabilities were known to the campus coordinator.  (3) Construction of physical facilities and commodity procurement are generally problematic and deserve more attention from the project design and implementation teams.  (4) Instead of sending all long- and short-term trainees to the United States, undergraduate students and short-term trainees could attend third-country programs, which may be less expensive, more relevant, and cause less culture shock.  (5) The project is an excellent example of donor coordination (other donors included the Overseas Development Agency, the Peace Corps, and the UN). (6) The project should have included a crops/soil laboratory, a college farm, and training of a librarian and someone to maintain BAC equipment.","Evaluation period: 1978-86","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","3/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural education|Agricultural colleges|Animal health","Botswana","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABA274.pdf","159 KB","008516 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of a project to support a nonpartisan voter education program related to the 10/88 plebiscite in Chile.  The project was implemented by the Inter-American Institute of Human Rights (IIHR). External evaluation covers the period 12/87-2/89. The project was implemented efficiently, professionally, and with the participation of Chileans from all political parties and regions of the country.  The IIHR promoted its message through the mass media, rock concerts, mock elections, debates, and public meetings.  Results far exceeded expectations.  Civic education activities were carried out peacefully without government intervention; public debates and other open activities were well attended all over the country, with people defending both sides of the plebiscite options; and most important, the Chilean people regained confidence in the democratic electoral process. Voter registration increased from 4.5 million to 7.5 million during the life of the project.  Of those registered, 97% cast their vote on the day of the plebiscite.  Many people involved in the project also participated in a ""fast-count"" activity which accurately projected the results as early as 9pm on the day of the plebiscite. A major factor in the project's success was its emphasis on nonpartisanship.  All printed materials and staff members were carefully selected to ensure the program's impartial character and prevent government interference.","Evaluation period: Dec 1987-Dec 1988","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-0086-I-00-6097-00","","2/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Voting|Political participation|Elections|Democracy|Civic education|Voter education","Chile","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABA315.pdf","1,445 KB","000356 - Checchi and Co.

"Evaluates cooperative agreement (9/85-8/90) between the S&T Bureau, Office of Population (S&T/POP) and the Centre for Development and Population Activities (CEDPA) for the purpose of delivering family planning (FP) services through subprojects (SP's) in 10 to 15 countries. CEDPA is known worldwide for its Women in Management and other training programs.  Focusing on the 2,000 alumnae in the countries targeted by the project, CEDPA elicited SP concept papers from 110 people.  Five proposal development workshops were held, and of the 55 attendees, 48 developed full proposals. After site visits and review by CEDPA and S&T/POP, 25 SP's were funded: 11 in Africa, 10 in Asia, 2 in Egypt, and 2 in Latin America. Five of the SP's have been cancelled:  the two Nigeria SP's were turned over to Family Planning International Assistance as part of USAID/N's consolidation of centrally funded activities; the Haiti SP could not continue because of local political circumstances; and the collaborating Family Planning Associations in Sierra Leone and Uganda were unable to implement planned activities.  In addition, the Sudan SP is being terminated because of a change in government. Nineteen SP's are ongoing in 11 countries.  They are being implemented by women's organizations (local and national), welfare associations, an international PVO, health projects, a credit and a dairy cooperative, a women's small business association, educational institutions, and ministries of health. This interim evaluation found that CEDPA has met all targets and has pioneered in adding FP services to existing projects in other sectors such as small enterprise, health, and other for-profit ventures. Accomplishments:  (1) The project model of including FP services in private sector programs has been successful.  Over half the implementing organizations had no prior FP experience.  (2) Some SP's achieved high use rates in communities in which FP had not been widely accepted.  This is due to frequent follow-up visits by outreach workers and CEDPA's strong emphasis on informed choice.  (3) Some SP's have influenced government policy.  A Mali SP introduced a community-based distribution system which is the prototype for new Ministry of Health and USAID/M programs.  In Nepal and Mali, it has been shown that FP services can be effectively delivered by nonmedical staff.  Laws in Mali prohibiting the delivery of FP services by non-physicians are now under review.  (4) CEDPA has been unusually successful in leveraging external resources for FP.  (5) The project has had a positive impact on women - as designers and managers of FP projects, as outreach workers, and as clients.

"PACR of a project (1984-89), follow-on to 6030006, to help Djibouti's Ministry of Labor (MOL), Adult Professional Training Center (CFPA), and National Employment Service (SNE) identify and fulfill the country's training needs. All in-country activities by International Human Assistance Programs Incorporated (IHAP), the initial implementing agency, were terminated in 12/85.  The basic reasons for this were inflexibility and a lack of coordinated project design.  When the project was designed in mid-1984, the Government of Djibouti (GROD) gave only conditional approval, but the Mission went ahead and prematurely authorized the arrival of IHAP personnel in Djibouti.  It was understood that IHAP would develop a detailed work plan to be submitted for approval in late 1984.  However, due to personality conflicts between the IHAP Chief of Party, his CFPA and MOL counterparts, and the A.I.D. representative, a plan acceptable to all parties could not be developed.  The replacement of the IHAP Chief of Party failed to improve relations.  Upon termination of IHAP activities, only the construction targets had been realized.  Although the new CFPA and SNE administrative offices were never equipped, both buildings are being used for their designated functions. In 1986, remaining project funds were reprogrammed to provide training for senior and mid-level management personnel.  The new contractors, the Harvard Institute for International Development's Health Division (HIID) and the University of Pittsburgh's International Management Development Institute (UPIMDI), conducted both in-country and U.S. seminars on various subjects (e.g., education planning and health management) for more than 300 participants.  Although no official evaluations were carried out, participants reported a general satisfaction with the training.","Evaluation period: 1984-1989","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","AFR-0017-A-00-404901","","8/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Education for development|Development project planning|Management training","Djibouti","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDBBR329.pdf","300 KB","008536 - USAID.

"The Conventional Energy Technical Assistance (CETA) project has met its objective to provide developing countries with a range of TA, including: (1) identifying and evaluating indigenous conventional energy resources; (2) developing conventional energy resources; (3) promoting utilization of these resources to reduce dependence on oil imports; (4) conducting resource assessments and surveys of conventional energy resources; (5) facilitating access to the technologies, services, and investment needed to exploit indigenous resources; and (6) providing in-country technical training required to manage the development of these resources. The contractor's performance has been of a generally high technical and managerial quality. Individual technical service orders have been staffed by very qualified individuals, and have been implemented in a cost effective manner.  The contractor has been responsive to requests for TA from the Office of Energy, Regional Bureaus, and Missions.  The outputs of specific activities have been well received, and consistent with statements of work. The project has been managed effectively by the Office of Energy according to defined program plans, and the contractor has been provided with the necessary guidance for effective implementation of project objectives.  The Office of Energy has considered the energy needs and priorities of the Missions and host countries in developing its plans and has responded to these needs effectively. Project TA has provided necessary information for making informed choices on indigenous energy development.  Specific activities in this regard include the Jamshoro feasibility studies, the Jamaica cane energy project, the Thailand natural gas study, and the Jordan oil shale project.  However, field activities have been affected by the changing international energy environment, which has been marked by a regime of lower world market prices for oil and other energy resources.  Lower oil costs have resulted in changing investment priorities at the project level throughout the world.  However, many of the original objectives established for the project remain valid, particularly in the context of increasing debt burdens and fiscal constraints.  The development of indigenous energy resources, energy efficiency, and the search for applicable new energy technologies continue to be high on the national agenda in many countries. Since the implementation of new field activities consistent with project objectives is key to the continued success of the project, the Energy Office has directed its attention to developing an effective effort to promote project activities in selected areas:  support of private power generation, applications of advanced and environmentally sound energy technologies, energy resource assessments, and practical assistance in institutional development and strengthening. We conclude that the project is of significant value in supporting AID policies and objectives.

"Evaluates the private sector development program of USAID/Kenya. The program consists of five projects -- Rural Private Enterprise (6150220), Private Enterprise Development (-0238), Informal Sector and Loan Guarantee Grant (-0227), and two Commodity Import Programs (-0213 and-0240).  External evaluation covers the period through 4/89. The program, which accounts for 43% of total Mission outlays for active projects, has undertaken a number of excellent and complementary pilot activities, some of them with substantial future potential.  These include, inter alia, support for policy studies, assistance in deregulating financial markets, and in stock market reform, small and microenterprise lending, agribusiness lending, recycling Mission funds to targeted businesses, and collaborative work with Government officials in finding practical ways to relax well-known constraints.  There are also several areas with significant potential that are not included in the program's current portfolio; these include infrastructure supportive of trade and investment promotion, business training for medium-scale entrepreneurs, and assistance in strategic planning to the Rural Enterprise Program and to local PVO's. On the other hand, several program activities appear to have reached the limits of their effectiveness in the current policy environment. For example, finance and capital market development activities will be successful and cost-effective in the long term only if the government continues to liberalize capital markets. Current capital mobilization efforts are seriously constrained by regulation of interest rates and equity markets as well as by the Government of Kenya's limited absorptive capacity for TA in this area.  High loan default rates and administrative costs have constrained the establishment of sustainable loan programs. Moreover, the program has had difficulty in undertaking investment programs that target Kenyans due to a lack of sound business proposals from indigenous entrepreneurs.  Another program constraint has been the weakness of Kenyan policy analysis capabilities.  Many agencies lack the capability to absorb policy information or to commission useful policy studies, and there are not many experienced policy analysts in universities or consulting firms. The projects have made significant institutional impacts on several intermediary institutions.  The potential for continued growth is promising in NGO's, business associations, and capital market institutions, but not very promising for the country's largest commercial banks, given current constraints in financial markets. The strategy of imposing conditions precedent to disbursement of project resources is of limited usefulness, even for the commodity import programs.  Since there is already widespread recognition in Kenya of the value of a market-driven economy, USAID/K's most important role is likely to be in policy reform management, rather than in prescribing further necessary changes. In addition to examining program level impacts, the evaluation includes detailed reports on 20 individual activities conducted under the five private enterprise projects.","Companion project evaluation summary: PD-ABB-369","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-2028-Z-00-7186-00","","12/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Private sector|Policy reform|Market economy|Financial institutions|Capital markets|Nonproject assistance|Economic reform","Kenya","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABA337.pdf","5,378 KB","003970 - Management Systems International, Inc.

"PACR of a project (6/84-3/89) to construct three hydroelectirc power plants and associated infrastructure in St. Vincent's Cumberland Valley. After several delays and a 6-month extension, all major project goals were met or exceeded.  The extension was required to allow the delivery of electrical equipment delayed by difficulties in defining technical specifications and obtaining waivers.  The main civil works contractor, CDK Contracting Company, experienced delays in the initial stages which slowed down other components and led to claims for damages from the other main contractor. CDK completed the works in 4/88, three months behind schedule, and submitted a claim for additional costs of $2 million; this claim is under review.  CDK's obligation to rehabilitate the Cumberland Valley Road was transferred to another contractor after CDK failed to agree to an acceptable cost and schedule for the work. Other contractor activities were implemented without significant problems.  These included:  supply and installation of overhead hoists in the powerhouses, supply and installation of manual and motorized gates for intake and pipeline inlet structures, construction of five staff houses, construction of measuring weirs and rain gauge and staff gauge stations and supply of hydrometric measuring equipment, and measures to protect the Cumberland Valley ecosystem, including soil conservation and preparation of environmental legislation. To reduce the negative impact on local residents, the project also constructed laundry facilities and bath houses to replace the use of the river.  Compensation payments were also made for encroachment and/or land damage, although settlement of claims was negotiated at a slow pace. A major lesson learned is that architectural and engineering consultants should be retained to supervise and certify all work undertaken under Force Account Reimbursement agreements in order to ensure speedy and efficient completion of the work.","Evaluation period: Jun 1984-Mar 1989","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","3/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Hydroelectric power plants|Electric power distribution|Electric power generation|Electrical equipment","Saint Vincent and the Grenadines","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABA332.pdf","77 KB","001757 - USAID.

"Interim evaluation of a project to promote increased production of perennial cash crops on hillside farms in Jamaica by funding subprojects (SP's) and providing TA/training and information services.  The evaluation covers the period 1987-11/89. Although it is too early to assess impact at the farm level, project operations and methods appear successful.  The use of a project coordinating committee (PCC) has been a viable means of establishing policy and involving the Ministry of Agriculture, USAID, and the Jamaica Agricultural Society in important decisionmaking questions.  The PCC initially had difficulty in preparing SP's, but it reacted well in finding ways to promote their development.  Most SP's are now active with enthusiastic personnel, and different approaches to extending technologies to the hillside farmers are in place or planned.  The project has developed and implemented a practical approach to training those involved in project activities. On the negative side, information management has been weak, and requires immediate attention in order to promote policy development for hillside agriculture.  Farmer involvement in the design of SP's has been spotty, often resulting in differing and even conflicting expectations. It is recommended that the project continue to target small-farm enterprises to ensure that improved practices and technologies are adopted.  The sustainability of the project will depend to a large extent on financial returns from the applied technologies to the individual farmer.","Project title: Development strategies for fragile lands (DESFIL)","Special Evaluation","Documents","DHR-5438-C-00-6054-00","","11/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Hills|Crop production|Cash crops|Farm income|Small farms","Jamaica","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABA390.pdf","1,058 KB","006727 - Development Alternatives, Inc.

"Interim evaluation of a project to transport humanitarian relief for war-affected Afghans and to evacuate wounded Afghans for donated medical treatment in the United States and European countries.  The evaluation covers the period FY86-FY89. The project initially faced numerous problems, both in terms of the quality of materials delivered and in overcoming the substantial workload imposed on the two relatively young implementing agencies - the Department of Defense's Office of Humanitarian Assistance (OHA) and the Office of the A.I.D. Representative for Afghanistan Affairs (O/AID/REP). Although both agencies still face considerable staffing constraints, this problem has been somewhat reduced.  To date, 71 airlift and 3 sealift missions have transported project commodities. The O/AID/REP has managed a very complicated multi-donor program to evacuate war-wounded Afghans for medical treatment.  More than 700 evacuees have received free medical care valued at $24 million.  These patients have also heightened public awareness of the plight of the Afghan people in the 16 countries in which they have been treated. Unfortunately, however, far too many patients (347 to 538) are still awaiting placement for treatment.  It is recommended that long-term planning be developed for local care of the wounded. The Soviet withdrawal has created a new environment for the program. The O/AID/REP should anticipate increased public and Congressional scrutiny as well as changes in the types of commodities needed.  It is recommended that the program continue to operate under current legislation and appropriations levels through FY90 and that the Departments of State and Defense and the O/AID/REP jointly determine the need for proposing legislative changes, if any, for the FY91 program and beyond.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","6/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Humanitarian assistance|Emergency medical care|Medical equipment|Air transportation|War","Afghanistan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABA411.pdf","998 KB","008588 - USAID.

"The analysis of the history and achievements of the business management extension program (BMEP) in Swaziland must be set within the context of several observations. (1) BMEP is very young.  While it was funded over 3 years ago, the first 7 months focused on construction of the facilities; the first staff person was hired 30 months ago; in-house training was initiated only 27 months ago; extension officers were hired in 8/88 and had 5 weeks of training.  The extension programme began in 10/88, just 7 months prior to this evaluation. (2) The program has been designed and implemented in a country with little history of small enterprise training and development. Due to the inexperience of both the applicant agency and the donor agency, the original program design had a major shortcoming in not including a full-time, experienced professional in small enterprise development. (3) While substantial and invaluable TA was provided to BMEP, the amount of TA was much less than desired and needed.  As a result, the program initially had to be run by inexperienced people; the BMEP financial controller served, in effect, as program manager. The development of the program was a learning process for the staff, and they did an outstanding job under the circumstances. Given these conditions, it is remarkable how much has been achieved: 32 persons have received intensive training, of whom 19 are operating businesses, employing 10 additional persons.  Of the 13 who are not operating businesses, at least 4 are employed. A training curriculum has been developed which includes both the usual business planning and management elements, and an innovative component focusing on achievement motivation. Trainees and extension clients have been introduced to a credit system; 24 loans have been provided.  BMEP has built the foundation for a solid credit administration system. An impressive array of extension services to individuals, groups, and agencies has been initiated:  69 extension clients have received short-term training, 6 have attended the 6-week intensive training course, and 10 individuals and 18 groups have received direct TA. Effective relationships have been developed with a network of small enterprise development organizations.  BMEP has trained the staff of 14 NGO's, assisted the Swaziland College of Technology with its enterpreneurship curriculum, and worked cooperatively with Sibakho and CARE. The design of the program has been improved. The need for a manager with field experience was recognized and acted upon. Intensive training now precedes new business starts.  The in-house businesses now operate in ways that more accurately reflect the situation they will face when they move into the community.  In addition, an effective mix of in-house and extension programs has been developed. The Swazi Assistant BMEP Director has developed a high degree of strategic and operational expertise in small enterprise development and demonstrates professional competence and technical skills. Management of BMEP is exemplary.  A sophisticated set of policies, procedures, and systems has been designed and is being implemented efficiently.

"Interim evaluation of a cooperative project with the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) and the Government of Bangladesh (GOB) to establish an Institute for Postgraduate Studies in Agriculture (IPSA) in Bangladesh.  The evaluation covers the period 4/86-7/89. In spite of some obstacles, the project has been implemented successfully with diligent efforts by personnel from all three countries.  Tripartite relationships have been good.  IPSA's research program has produced high-quality results relevant to Bangladesh's needs.  Although the Institute's academic program has not achieved the necessary flexibility to meet project targets, the quality of graduates has been improved somewhat. IPSA's relationship to other educational research institutions has been informal but productive.  The outreach program is not yet developed. Participant training, including both long-term (Ph.D.) and short- term training in both Japan and the United States, is underway. An experimental farm, a greenhouse, and other support facilities, along with sophisticated equipment and machinery have been provide by JICA, while A.I.D. has funded journals and computers.  Almost all equipment and facilities have been completed.  No maintenance problems have been encountered, except with some sophisticated equipment such as the electron microscope and submergible pump. IPSA's sustainability is questionable without continued support from the GOB and external donors.  It is recommended that a 5- year follow-on project be implemented. Specific needs include establishing an appropriate administrative structure, recruiting adequate faculty and staff, and constructing research laboratories, a library, and faculty/staff housing. Two principal lessons were learned.  (1) Introduction of a new institution with a special mandate into an existing system takes a long time when there is a lack of concurrence and acceptance on the part of existing institutions and authorities.  It is extremely difficult for the TA team to become involved in these internal issues without being distracting being from their primary purpose.  (2) Productive contributions from two or more donors in a single project require a high degree of interpersonal and professional relationships among technical support teams. Project authorizations from the donors and the host country should provide for a jointly developed operational plan to guide project implementation.","Companion evaluation summary: PD-ABB-516","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","7/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural education|Higher education|Agricultural research","Bangladesh","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABA486.pdf","4,056 KB","004898 - Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA)","","008511 - USAID.

"Mid-term evaluation of a project to establish a Science and Technology Development Board (STDB) within Thailand's Ministry for Science, Technology, and Energy to support industrial research and strengthen university competence in applied science and technology.  The evaluation covers the period through 7/89. Project start-up was delayed, primarily due to problems in establishing the STDB as a new institution, delays in providing TA, difficulty in attracting qualified senior personnel for a short-term enterprise, and the complexity of operating under the supervision of three government agencies and USAID/T. Nonetheless, STDB is operating effectively as a resource institution, identifying user needs as well as relevant science/technology resources and organizing/funding programs to address these needs. Staff shortages are being filled, and certain programs that have been delayed, especially industrial development support programs, are now being implemented. The STDB is operating in three major fields -- genetic engineering/biotechnology, materials, and applied electronics/computers. It does not (at present) itself conduct programs, but rather operates as a technical clearinghouse. Currently, there are three main types of activity:  (1) research, development, and engineering projects, most of which aim to strengthen university competence and/or solve specific problems of industry; (2) industrial support projects, including a quality control program, a technical information center, and an industrial research service; and (3) a science and technology policy program to influence policies and practices.  In addition, there are fellowships for university students in science and technology, an exchange program for industry professionals and academic researchers, and a new program to help companies access their technology needs. The STDB's mission and operations are not well understood, however, and there is a perception that its projects have had insufficient relevance to industry needs.  The STDB needs to form tighter linkages with industry in order to resolve these problems. Although originally planned to terminate in 1992, the STDB now appears to be established as a permanent institution.  A bill in the Thai legislature would expand funding by about $400 million over a five-year period.  Contingent upon this bill, the project should receive a three-year extension, with continued financial support thereafter.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","493-0340-C-00-9072-00","","7/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Industrial development|Industry|Industrial technology|Technological development|Institution building","Thailand","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABA489.pdf","2,854 KB","000431 - U.S. Dept. of the Interior.

"After 4 years of delays, false starts, and controversy over the management and role of the Human and Institutional Resources Development Project (HIRD), USAID/Zambia, and the Government of the Republic of Zambia (GRZ) reached an agreement in 6/88 that has enabled project implementation to proceed at or close to its intended pace.  More progress has been made in the 10 months following that agreement than was reallzed in the previous 4 years.  An effective management structure is now in place, the large majority of participants are being trained in ""critical shortage skill areas"" as identified by the Project Paper, the GRZ and USAID are working harmoniously together on the project, and all returned participants with whom the review team spoke expressed their satisfaction with the quality and utility of the training they received. All involved are to be commended for having made so dramatic a recovery from so difficult a beginning. Nonetheless, some significant problems remain.  The basic project documents -- the Project Paper, the Project Authorization, and the Project Grant Agreement -- have never been amended to reflect the various changes approved by USAID and the GRZ.  In particular, the level of TA described in those documents is well out of date, and the output targets for long-term, short-term, and in-country training have been rendered unrealistic by the circumstances described above.  More substantively, HIRD is not moving toward two key End of Project Status indicators:  it is not providing training to parastatal and private sector employees, nor is it augmenting the capacity of indigenous Zambian training institutions.  Further, the management structure for the in-country training program seems in immediate need of revision. To correct these deficiencies and smooth project management and implementation, this review team recommends that USAID and the GRZ take, among other actions, the following major steps.  (1) Draft a Project Paper Supplement and Project Authorization Amendment and submit these to the Regional Legal Advisor for review.  The RLA will then assist the Mission in drawing up a Grant Agreement Amendment.  (2) Establish formal, written criteria for the selection of tralnees from the parastatal and private sectors and expand efforts to provide training to employees from these sectors.  (3) Conduct at least two in-country training seminars through established Zambian training institutions. (4) Direct the prime TA contractor to assume direct responsibility for in-country training.  (5) Take steps to ease the transition back to Zambian life for returned participants. The review team believes that these measures will help HIRD continue, and expand upon, the successes achieved since June 1988.

"PACR of a subproject (1981-1989) to provide TA and training to the Office de l'Elevage et des Paturages (OEP) for the introduction of improved rangeland management systems in Central Tunisia. Project activities changed drastically after the first 3 years when it was determined that rangelands were too depleted to benefit from improved rotation and range management systems.  In order to correct this problem, the project was amended to establish a seed production/marketing unit to facilitate reseeding of the degraded rangelands.  However, the seed component never operated efficiently because of droughts, changes of sites each 3 years, and insufficient support from research and extension. The project introduced improved range and herd management systems to stock raisers on 25 sites (covering 27,000 ha).  At least three of the sites demonstrated improvements sufficient to encourage other farmers to adopt the new practices.  In total, 6,000 farmers improved range production and sheep-raising practices, and 5,000 planted forages, cactus, acacia, and shrubs. In addition, the project provided ammoniated straw to 600 farmers, nearly 50% more than originally planned, while provision of feed concentrate was less than expected due to low demand. In general, the project's high rate of farmer participation is attributed primarily to large subsidies for animal feed and concentrate, rather than a motivation to implement new technologies.  It is doubtful that farmers will continue to use the technologies once subsidies are removed.  Moreover, there is no evidence that the project resulted in an expansion of meat or wool production. The project was also constrained by land fragmentation and relatively small farm size.  On collective land, progress was limited by a lack of management leadership, both from local farmers and from the Forest Service.  Problems also arose with the short-intensity grazing management system, under which shepherds had to split flocks between theirs and the landowners'. The system failed because shepherds had double work and no immediate benefits. Applied research was successful, especially during the first three years.  Staff tested local varieties of seed and developed prototype farm equipment that was used by the project and could be produced locally at relatively low costs.  A follow-up program needs to be implemented to market this equipment. The project was successful in strengthening the OEP Range Management Unit by training to BS and MS degree level 24 of its staff members.  The Unit is capable of continuing to introduce improved range and herd management systems to stock raisers. Annexes provide technical information and detailed recommendations covering supplemental livestock feeding, forage production, forage calendar, dipping pools, genetic improvements, range improvements, water retention basins, equipment development, seeding techniques, ripping rangelands, grazing management, and establishment of cactus and acacia.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","12/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Range management|Rangeland|Grazing land|Rangeland soils","Tunisia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABA496.pdf","1,279 KB","008616 - USAID.

"The purpose of this project is to extend the coverage of child survival strategies to the ""hardest to reach"" segment of the population and increase the impact of these strategies through the active participation of family members, neighbors, and community groups.  A risk score was developed in both a peri- urban slum population and a rural high altitude population, and was used to identify the ""at risk"" families, so that interventions could be targeted to them.  Community health workers (CHW's) were elected by the communities and were trained by professionals hired by the project.  Medical professionals in the Ministry of Health were instructed in the use of the risk strategy through both seminars and technical meetings. The majority of community interventions were educational by nature, although there were a series of activities both organized and run by community leaders and community health workers with project help, such as the construction and implementation of three health posts, a health post based nutritional rehabilitation program, a community laboratory for the detection of tuberculosis, community-based oral rehydration units, a latrine installation program, a garbage collection system, and mini-immunization campaigns.  All material needs for these programs were obtained from a variety of donor sources outside the project. In this final report, we will describe in detail the methodologies used by project personnel to accomplish all project goals and objectives.  The use of the risk score card by CHW's is evaluated and the final section of the report includes a discussion of lessons learned.  One of the most important products of this project is that it has influenced the development of a risk targeting strategy for an MOH food distribution program.  This program in turn has developed at operational level a national awareness, especially in the public sector, that targeting scarce resources to the population most in need of these resources has a greater potential for impact on child survival indicators.

"PACR of a project (1983-1989) to increase the effectiveness of national agriculture extension services in six Eastern Caribbean states and Belize and to strengthen the capacity of the University of the West Indies (UWI) to support these services. The program was implemented by the Midwest Universities Consortium for International Activities (MUCIA). The overall effectiveness of national extension services was significantly strengthened through better organization, the development of more well-defined goals, and enhanced staff skills.  These services were also further integrated with those of other governmental extension and research agencies and private sector groups.  Frontline extension officers acquired a greater knowledge of appropriate agricultural practices and the ability to apply them to improve farm production. National communication units were formed or strengthened in all project countries, and are especially effective in the areas of work program planning, training, and the production of communications materials for publications.  The project also established a regional extension communications unit at UWI, institutionalized UWI outreach positions in the Windward and Leeward Islands, created a regional agricultural extension coordinating committee, and strengthened other regional linkages. The project identified demonstration districts and designed farm management activities on the basis of needs assessments.  As a result of the project, target families increased enterprise receipts, farm and family earnings, and net worth; adopted several new production and management practices; gained greater knowledge of production and marketing; and demonstrated improved attitudes toward farming and extension. Several lessons were learned.  (1) Organizational change is slow in institutions such as national extension services and therefore support is required until changes become institutionalized.  (2) Governments often do not have the ability or will to attract and retain well-qualified and motivated extension agents.  (3) Long-term technical collaboration, such as that between MUCIA and UWI, is mutually beneficial, since host country scientists gain access to a broad range of technical expertise and training opportunities, while U.S. scientists have the opportunity to adapt their systems to different geographic and cultural conditions.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","6/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural extension|Agricultural extension training|Technical cooperation","Eastern Caribbean|Belize","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABA758.pdf","70 KB","001757 - USAID.

"Interim evaluation of a project to improve global peanut production by supporting collaborative research and providing related training in semi-arid tropical Africa, Southeast Asia, and the Caribbean. External evaluation covers the period 1983- 1989. The project is on track, its success fostered by an efficient Management Entity and the superb guidance and policy advice provided by the Board of Directors and the Technical Committee. A particular strength has been the project's policy of not assigning U.S. scientists overseas for extended periods of time; this has served both to increase host scientists' confidence and experience and to enlist U.S. specialists without endangering their teaching, research, or professional careers. The project has improved research capability in host countries by providing funds, equipment, and periodic visits by the U.S. collaborators. Thirteen new cultivars with improved yield and pest tolerance have been released and other promising lines are in final testing or increase stages. Two cultivars resistant to rosette disease were reselected, seed multiplied, and distributed to farmers in Nigeria. Additional accomplishments have been made in the areas of peanut viruses, food safety (mycotoxin management), and postharvest food technology. The project has also developed linkages with numerous national, regional, and world organization which will endure long after the project ends. An example is the formation of an informal international network of scientists interested in peanut viruses, linking researchers in Georgia (U.S.), Nigeria, India, Malawi, Scotland, France, Germany, Philippines, Thailand, Indonesia, Australia, China, and Japan. The project also sponsored many conferences, workshops, and symposia and released an impressive list of publications. U.S. university training of young agricultural scientists will probably be the longest lasting, most effective project accomplishment. A total of 37 Master's degrees and 17 Ph.D.'s have been granted, and another 48 students are currently pursuing advanced degrees. U.S. nondegree training totaling 204 person- months has also been provided. Participants have come from 32 countries, with a significant number of women represented.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","DAN-4048-G-SS-2065-00","","1/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Peanuts|Agricultural research|Research collaboration|Agricultural education","Caribbean|Southeast Asia|Africa","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABA795.pdf","5,241 KB","000180 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (1980-1989) to develop a model for watershed development in Thailand's Mae Chaem watershed. The project met or exceeded all targets in terms of self-sufficiency in rice production, issuance of land use certificates, road construction/rehabilitation, bench terrace construction, development of water resources, and developing a model for watershed development.  The project's success is largely due to several innovative approaches. Administrative decentralization resulted in much more timely and appropriate responses to field requirements.  Interface teams of community development workers were invaluable in facilitating communication among villagers, project staff, and government officials. Land use certificates guaranteed villagers' rights to live and work in the watershed, thereby increasing their willingness to participate in and assume responsibility for development activities.  Subsistence in rice production (as opposed to increased cash crops) conformed exactly to the immediate needs of the highland farmers and provided the foundation for long-term sustainability.  Local detoxification of opium addicts (which was not originally planned) proved quite successful in reducing a significant barrier to project progress. On the negative side, the project encountered a number of traditional constraints, including slow and restrictive financial procedures; a slow, ill-defined, and inflexible decisionmaking process; incomplete interagency coordination; and difficulty in conceptualizing and implementing public participation.  While the project had some success in giving the residents of Mae Chaem, especially hill tribe minorities, greater ability to identify and resolve their programs, local communities do not yet possess sufficient understanding and self-development skills to ensure long-term sustainability and consolidation of project gains. The project teaches several valuable lessons.  (1) Preparation of the beneficiaries should be the first priority.  (2) Individuals (not agencies, not systems) are the key.  If this project had not had the particular Project Director or Deputy Director for Administration that it did, progress would have been far slower and several objectives would not have been achieved.  (3) Unless you're involved in a welfare program, development monies should be allocated and spent very economically.  Expensive projects are difficult to replicate, and large amounts of money will draw people's attention and participation in a project for reasons other than the project's own goals.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","12/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Pilot projects|Integrated rural development|Watersheds|Economic infrastructure|Community development|Hills|Community participation","Thailand","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABA842.pdf","2,322 KB","008613 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of a project to strengthen the institutional capacity of Guatemala's Judicial Branch through TA and short- term U.S. training.  The Harvard Law School is the implementing agency.  External evaluation covers the period 7/87-9/89. The project is meeting objectives and having a positive impact on the Guatemalan criminal justice system.  To date, 14 Guatemalan judges and prosecutors have attended five fellowship programs at Harvard.  In turn, these participants have held in-country seminars for nearly 350 Guatemalans.  Although regular TA meetings have been terminated, there have been numerous individual meetings between Harvard staff and key Guatemala officials as well as short-term research visits to Guatemala. The project has benefited in particular from a close and fruitful working relationship between Harvard and the President of the Supreme Court. The establishment of pilot courts to try out reforms and innovations has become the major project focus.  Such courts are operating in Guatemala City and the rural town of Totonicapan and are proposed to begin in two other areas.  Although the effort is viewed favorably by participants, it faces several problems: prosecutorial staff of the Ministerio Publico became involved only recently in Guatemala City and are not yet involved in rural areas; the promised cooperation of the national police is not yet effective; not all promised equipment has been supplied nor the remodeling of court facilities completed; and no concrete plan exists for improving the participation of public defense in the activity. Other activities have not achieved the degree of concreteness of the pilot courts.  A special prosecution unit created in the Ministerio Publico has been abandoned due to opposition from the Attorney General. Research and consultations have not produced concrete proposals for improving public defense, protecting witnesses, increasing the willingness of the public to use and participate in the justice system, or dealing with corruption of judicial officials.  The project has also failed to create a capacity within the court system to analyze problems and propose solutions and to bring about the participation of the Guatemalan Bar Association or the faculties of law in the project.  In addition, Harvard's staff continues to be concentrated in Cambridge, despite increasing project focus on activities in Guatemala.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","LAC-0002-C-00-9034-00","","11/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Judiciary|Judges|Courts|Administration of law","Guatemala","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABA849.pdf","4,729 KB","000356 - Checchi and Co.

"Evaluates the Government of Mauritania's diarrheal disease control program, which is receiving technical assistance from A.I.D. under project 9365969 (PRITECH project).  External evaluation covers the period 1983-12/88. After five years, the program is still in an early operational stage, and has far to go before it will have a significant impact on the health of the target population.  So far, it has established a conceptual framework and a national coordinator's office which performs planning and organization work as well as fundraising.  Coordination at the regional level exists in principle.  Educational and informational materials, including booklets, flyers, and posters, have been produced and distributed to health facilities at regional and departmental levels for use in educating mothers in oral rehydration therapy. Judging from the observations of the evaluation team, few mothers have the knowledge to give their children appropriate treatment of diarrhea, and few health workers treat children with diarrhea according to WHO protocols.  There are chronic shortages of basic materials, particularly of oral rehydration salts, and there is considerable recourse to inappropriate drugs. The modest level of achievement is primarily due to inadequate coordination of the various program components.  As a result, mothers and health workers alike receive mixed and often poorly timed messages unreinforced by necessary supportive materials. Additional problems include:  (1) insufficient program monitoring and evaluation due to internal organizational conflicts, a chronic lack of financial and material resources, and a lack of adequate information; and (2)  the program's total dependence on outside support and uncertain funding availabilities. The PRITECH project has played a key role in providing TA for management of the CCD program.  According to the CCD Coordinator, without future assistance from PRITECH, the program may have to be cut back by half.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","DPE-5969-Z-00-7064-00","","9/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Diarrhea|Oral rehydration therapy|Health education","Mauritania","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNABF006.pdf","1,045 KB","000750 - Management Sciences for Health (MSH)","","000595 - Mauritania.

"Based in part on recommendations generated at a workshop attended by 14 experts in conservation biology, ecology, systematics, and economic development, this report presents guidelines for evaluating proposed, current, and completed biodiversity projects.  The guidelines cover four kinds of projects that A.I.D. might be expected to evaluate:  ecosystems and habitats, species, habitat classification and inventory, and genetic resources.  For each kind of project, four categories of evaluation criteria are offered:  biological, social and economic, institutional capability, and linkage.  The guidelines are primarily in the form of checklist questions, with questions in each category preceded by general guidance.  The report also stresses the importance of linkages -- to other local and national programs and to international organizations -- in the evaluation process.  While not including education and training as a specific category, the report stresses their importance and recommends support for education and training projects.

"Evaluation of a project in Bolivia's Altiplano to conduct child survival (CS) activities, including nutrition education and growth monitoring, diarrheal disease control, and immunization. Foster Parents Plan International (PLAN) is the implementing agency.  External evaluation covers the period 1986-8/89. CS interventions have been about 6-12 months behind schedule due to delays in organization and staffing and the time needed to develop a collaborative relationship with the Ministry of Health (MOH). Nonetheless, PLAN has developed very good working relations with the MOH and with other private organizations in the area, and significant progress has been made.  Through regular growth monitoring, 81% of children registered under PLAN have maintained a normal weight. Vaccination coverage has also improved, with the percentage of enrolled children receiving all four vaccines before their second birthday increasing from 21% to 52%.  Knowledge of oral rehydration therapy (ORT) has increased, with 44% of mothers using ORT salts at home.  About half of the target communities now have ORT posts, but the use of these posts has been low (about 1% of estimated diarrheal episodes).  For both growth monitoring and immunizations, PLAN has been able to enroll 87% of children 12-23 months but only 49% of those under one year.  Coverage of women has been low (30%). PLAN's impact on health conditions is difficult to quantify because several other organizations have been working in the area, the project's objectives were not very well defined, and the existing information system lacks specificity regarding evaluation requirements. Several lessons have been learned.  (1) While outside organizations (such as PLAN) can effectively assume a supporting role for community participation, they must make special efforts to allow such participation to emerge from within the community and at the community's own pace.  For in the last analysis, only community action can make the program sustainable.  (2) The inadequate resources provided to the Ministry of Health in a country such as Bolivia makes it both unrealistic and irresponsible in the short and medium term for PVO's to assume that the Ministry will assume the burden of post-project funding. (3) An information system, preferably one designed at the beginning of the project, plays a crucial role in providing data for project evaluation and monitoring.  (4) Service programs are complex and require organization and management if they are to transform available resources into desired results.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","10/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Child survival activities|Oral rehydration therapy|Immunizations|Growth monitoring","Bolivia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABA862.pdf","3,036 KB","001183 - Foster Parents Plan, Inc.","","000088 - USAID.

"Evaluates CARE's New York-based Primary Health Care Unit (PHCU) in terms of its management approaches, its strategies for servicing overseas staff and projects, and its current health programming portfolio, especially in regard to child survival activities. The PHCU has been very effective in providing support and advisory services to overseas offices and staff with whom it has had direct contact.  However, overseas personnel having minimal or no contact with the Unit are relatively unaware of the quality of its work and services. In addition, several CARE personnel appeared to be frustrated regarding the role of PHC in the total CARE program. While the organizational structure in New York tends to be hierarchical, CARE's overall organizational structure is decentralized, with considerable authority vested in Country Directors.  As a result, planning mechanisms provide for consolidating country and Unit plans rather than integrating them. Child survival projects have strengthened CARE's PHC expertise due to their rigorous design, planning, and evaluation demands and by the addition of technical staff.  However, the data available from these projects, though extensive, have been underutilized for several reasons: the projects are management- intensive; research costs are not covered by grants; and the activities have failed to sufficiently involve social scientists and writers.  The PHCU must address this problem so that it can apply lessons learned from past activities to future health initiatives. The PHCU should make its services and successes more visible to others, particularly to field staff, and should also consider spending more time on donor relations and funding opportunities. The results of the questionnaire used in preparing the present evaluation could provide a basis for PHC planning.  Also, given the new emphasis on integrating population messages into CARE programs, the Program Department may wish to experiment with integrating the planning process across units (though this would require a substantial restructuring of field offices).  CARE is in a good position to consider three, mutually reinforcing options through which to carry out its PHC work in the next decade:  (1) continue to implement child survival projects as a major activity; (2) develop intersectoral health-related activities; and (3) explore the use of women as health care providers as an integrating program theme.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Primary health care|Private voluntary organizations|Health care administration","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABA863.pdf","382 KB","005553 - John Snow, Inc.

"Final evaluation of a project implemented by Project Concern International (PCI) to strengthen the capacity of the Chulamani Regional Office of Bolivia's Ministry of Health (MOH) to deliver child survival interventions in the Chulamani, Yanacachi, Coripata, and Irupano areas. The evaluation covers the period 8/86-7/89. In general, the project achieved its goal of reducing the mortality and morbidity rates in children under five, while training targets were surpassed (and in some cases doubled), with a total of 1,308 community health workers (CHW's), rural auxiliary nurses, and community members trained in a variety of child survival areas. Growth monitoring/nutrition was one of the project's strongest components.  The level of motivation was so high that CHW's purchased scales with their own money when the MOH could not supply them.  In one site, growth charting reached 83% (the program attained an overall level of 55% in 1988), breastfeeding is in excess of 40%, and 70% of babies are weaned after the first year.  However, the impact of nutrition education is limited, since the primary cause of malnutrition in the area is a lack of adequate quantity and quality of food. In other components, immunization coverage was very close to target; local people are now fully aware of the need to have their children vaccinated.  Education in oral rehydration therapy, on the other hand, produced a very high level of theoretical knowledge, but actual use is limited because the community does not yet identify diarrhea as a potentially fatal disease.  Efforts to control tuberculosis have been strikingly successful, due in good part to training of CHW's.  Project impacts on acute respiratory infections are impossible to quantify, however. Continuation of project activities will be feasible only with external support for training and transport services.  Future impact on malnutrition will also be dependent on improvements in local production capacity and establishment of a policy to sell produce only after local nutrition needs are met.  Unfortunately, MOH policymakers do not tackle the problem of malnutrition at its root cause:  insufficient availability of food.  The MOH carries on with its health and prevention campaigns, when the most crucial problem to be addressed is the chronic hunger in the majority of the population in almost all the regions of Bolivia.","Evaluation period: Aug 1986-Jul 1989","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Child survival activities|Malnutrition|Immunizations|Health education","Bolivia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABA864.pdf","2,744 KB","000989 - Project Concern International","","000088 - USAID.

"Evaluates a project implemented by Project Concern International (PCI) to establish child survival health services in Santiago de Atitlan, Guatemala.  Final evaluation covers 8/86 to 7/89. Despite difficult socio-political conditions in the project area, PCI staff were able to achieve completely or move significantly toward achievement of the goals, purposes, and most of the output targets.  The project has been successful in establishing a functional network of nearly 100 maternal and child health volunteers (MCHV) in the city of Santiago Atitlan.  These MCHV's perform a variety of outreach activities.  Through home visiting and group educational meetings, they promote changes in health behavior, including:  (1) utilizing health services; (2) participating in priority health programs, e.g., infant and child immunization; (3) recognizing dehydration due to diarrhea and using oral salts for rehydration; (4) recognizing malnutrition through routine growth monitoring and well child services; and (5) undertaking measures to reduce the risks of pregnancy, delivery, and the postnatal period.  The work of the MCHV's is in support of the Ministry of Health program called ""Channeling,"" which seeks to bring selected health services to each home as well as improve utilization of health facilities. Coverage figures for immunizations of children 0-5 in the project service area are low by national standards but are substantially the same as those obtained throughout the Department of Solola. The project had greater success in reaching pregnant women with a complete series of tetanus toxoid, with coverage rates of almost three times the national figures.  The distribution of oral rehydration salts (ORS) packets has increased markedly during the grant period and mothers show high levels of knowledge of how to mix and administer ORS.  Registration of children for growth monitoring and other well child services has increased about 25%. Finally, although still a very low prevalence, the use of family planning methods for birth spacing is steadily increasing in the service area. Some of the lessons learned in the project include the following. (1) Introducing change in traditional societies is difficult. (2) Certain child survival programs may be more difficult to introduce than others. (3) It is important to consult the community to validate educational messages and training material. (4) Projects should be coordinated with the host government health authorities. Two key recommendations include:  (1) not expanding project operations into new areas until current program activities are fully installed, tested, and operational; and (2) conducting a follow-up survey in 1990 to measure progress of a number of indicators since the 1987 baseline survey.

"APODESA (Regional Development Policy support Unit) is an original element of the Central Selva Resource Management Project (CSRM). Through its almost six years of existence the component has suffered an important institutional change, faced interinstitutional disagreements as well as acceptance, produced results and, quite likely, omitted others. This pre-evaluation report, while not intended to be a precise measure, or balance sheet, of APODESA performance, does attempt to show the achievements of this group as well as the problems that block additional successes. The report presents its information in six sections.  The first, Background:  The Origins of APODESA, is a brief restating of the institutional history of the unit.  The second section, Achievements and Successes of APODESA, identifies the several activity areas of the unit and describes its accomplishments. The following section, three, takes some of these same, and other, activities and recounts the problems that have in the past or are now blocking adequate progress. Section four, taking its cue from the recent changes in Central Selva field operations, presents some ideas for APODESA Collaboration in the Relocation Phase.  The fifth section, entitled Conclusions, Lessons Learned, presents these judgments in four subsections which parallel the substance in the previous sections.  The sixth and last section lists the writer's recommendations for improving the project. The writer's attitude toward this institution is positive but the report is objective and there are in it occasions of implied criticism. These are included for one purpose:  to enhance the performance of APODESA so that it may continue to function in order to continue contributing.

"Following reviews of the Palcazu Valley geography and social history, the origins of the Central Selva Resource Management Project are traced in their socioeconomic and political context. Originally a colonization and road building project for which road building and start up costs were funded in a 1980 grant agreement between A.I.D. and the Government of Peru (GOP), more detailed and serious redesign studies were sponsored by A.I.D. after Indian organizations, environmentalists, and human rights advocates responded critically. The objectives of the project were redefined in terms of a natural resource management project with, inter alia, natural forest management, agricultural extension, and conservation components.  A condition precedent required the titling of Indian communities' lands in the project area prior to disbursements, under the basic project agreement, signed in 1982.  Through a series of maneuvers, this process was largely avoided at first, although three Palcazu Valley communities were titled in 1983. Following GOP delays in properly executing the project, and some political considerations, the forestry and social development components were initiated in 1985.  The key element of both was the Yanesha Forestry Cooperative, which is the vehicle for the project's sustained yield natural forest management plan.  Other grass roots economic organizations and training programs were included as well as an innovative rural health program. Constraints and achievements in project implementation are described chronologically in this report in terms of policy, personnel, administrative, and other factors.  The best results were achieved in 1985-1986.  In the earlier period, there were serious policy contradictions and in the latter one, major personnel and project leadership problems.  TA played a major role in achieving project objectives. On balance, progress was substantial.  Indian community land base consolidation was essentially completed.  A national park, protection forest, and communal reserve were established.  A suitable low input agricultural and agroforestry program was developed, and in an extraordinary break with past policies, the forest management plan was organized around an Indian communities' forestry cooperative.  Advances in the implementation of this program were impressive, but much remains to be done. It is recommended that direct or indirect efforts continue in the Palcazu Valley.  Suggestions for alternative sites for a similar project are also made.

"The Committee on International Nutrition Programs (CINP) of the Food and Nutrition Board of the National Academy of Science (NAS) has been providing technical advice to the Office of Nutrition since May 1970. The present evaluation covered the period since 1983.  The reports completed by CINP under the agreements with the Office of Nutrition were reviewed primarily from the point of view of utility of the information for informed decisionmaking by both A.I.D./W and field staff. Interviews were conducted with CINP committee and subcommittee members, both former and present, as well as staff in the Office of Nutrition and other parts of A.I.D.  Each of the reports produced by CINP since 1982 for the Office of Nutrition was reviewed. CINP reports were regarded highly by the A.I.D. staff who had reviewed them.  Unfortunately the circulation of the reports was rather limited within the Agency; this was particularly true of dissemination to field personnel.  Therefore, the impact of the reports on program operations in developing countries was constrained. In general, criticisms of the CINP did not revolve around substance but style -- specifically the lack of timeliness and the cumbersome process of preparing the reports.  Over and over again, A.I.D. staff commented about the long delays in releasing the reports. In order to have a more timely report, most CINP subcommittee members were adamant about the need for a strong chairman to give clear direction to the subcommittee activities. The CINP has provided high quality, unbiased scientific and technical information.  At times however, rapid results are more important than is than a high degree of scientific rigor.  Under the circumstances, either the NAS/CINP process must be altered to produce information rapidly or the Office of Nutrition needs to examine other mechanisms for obtaining a quick turn- around time for obtaining information.  Some alternative mechanisms are discussed in this evaluation.  It is likely that the Office of Nutrition in the future will need some issues to be dealt with in the systematic, scientifically rigorous process that NAS/CINP has used in the past.  However, many CINP and A.I.D. staff also mentioned that new, fresh mechanisms for obtaining technical information would also be needed.  NAS and A.I.D. need to clarify what combination of approaches best address the priorities of the Office of Nutrition. A series of modifications to the CINP/Office of Nutrition agreements are discussed in this report.

"Mid-term evaluation of a project to provide U.S. scientific and technical textbooks at a reasonable cost for university students in the Central American countries of El Salvador, Costa Rica, Honduras, and Guatemala.  The evaluation covers the period 8/86- 11/89. The project has already exceeded life-of-project expectations for the number of books distributed.  A total of 560,728 books have been shipped to Central America and most of them have been sold; orders for the next semester total more than 220,000. Further, an unanticipated demand for social, economic, and political science books could raise the demand for books by 30%, though it would also deplete funds before project end. The project has produced four technical pamphlets which have been widely distributed.  Videotapes and a newsletter were envisioned but have not yet been implemented. The six distributors, mostly new to the business, have developed remarkably well in a short time.  Most have promoters who further the work of the publishers by providing a great deal of public relations work.  Great strides have been made in supplying books to branch universities and small universities in isolated locations, and the project also donates defective books to these universities' libraries. An additional benefit of the project is the reopening of relations between Missions and universities that were cut off a decade ago.  The Missions have been able to begin other projects with these universities, especially in developing linkages to U.S. universities.  The project has also resulted in greatly decreased photocopying and pirating of textbooks and a reduced influence of Soviet publishers (although one publisher, Mir, is now imitating this project, concentrating on technical fields that the project does not include). On the negative side, more specialized accounting training is needed, since most of the distributors' accounts are inconsistent with those of the project staff.  This is primarily due to difficulties in using the management information system, which both coordinators and distributors feel is too sophisticated and expensive.  Another problem is dissatisfaction among the distributors with the low markup on books (15% in El Salvador, Costa Rica, and Guatemala and 10% in Honduras).  A study has been commissioned to examine bookstore costs. Several lessons were learned.  (1) The project's ""demand-driven"" model has been highly successful; this demand is elastic, however, depending strongly on the price of books.  (2) Sufficient funding to allow for early, complete implementation allowed the project to operate quickly and well.  (3) The direct participation of Missions in the project operation made it possible to gain extra support and funding. (4) Including private bookstores helps assure a medium for sales after the project ends.  (5) A computerized management information system functions only as well as the interests and abilities of the users permit.","Contents: v. 1. The report -- v. 2.

It also proved to be an educational experience for the project managers who participated in the entire range of project activities from design through implementation in a 6-month period.  In the power sector, A.I.D. financed personnel and equipment to help restore damaged transmission and distribution lines on one-third of the island -- including 98% of all service in Kingston, St. Andrew, and St. Thomas parishes -- within 80 days of the hurricane.  In the shelter sector, the project financed 806 prefabricated housing units for needy and homeless families, as well as materials needed to reroof 20% of the 213,000 damaged homes.  It also provided posters and booklets demonstrating hurricane-resistant construction methods.  The project supplied 80% of pipes, fittings, pumps, and vehicles necessary for restoring potable water and sewage disposal services.  Equipment was also provided for testing and monitoring water quality.  In the telecommunications sector, the project financed equipment needed to speed restoration of service. More limited assistance was provided ino the health and agriculture sectors and for removal of bottlenecked relief goods from Kingston port. Grants were also provided to three NGO's -- the National Development Foundation to provide loans to small and micro businesses, the Kingston Restoration Project to provide relief services to residents of downtown Kingston, and CVSS/United Way of Jamaica for subgrants to other PVO's for relief activities. The project successfully taught several lessons.  (1) An early initial deadline should be set for project completion (within 150 days) should be set in projects of this kind.  (2) Assigning components to different Mission offices permits deployment of a large volume of person-hours while providing the best available expertise related to each component.  (3) A concurrent audit is desirable in a high visibility crisis situation.  (4) It is worthwhile to tailor a management information system to project management needs rather than relying solely on reports intended for other purposes.  The project also successfully showed the importance of acting early to develop an effective procurement system, although this aspect of the project could have been improved by selecting procurement specialists before signing the Pro-Ag and by increased use of local importers.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","4/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Cyclones|Emergency relief|Disaster response|Disaster reconstruction|Disaster recovery|Disaster rehabilitation","Jamaica","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABA941.pdf","674 KB","008563 - USAID.

"Evaluates program implemented by Georgetown University (GU) to conduct an experimental technical-vocational participant training program for Central American students.  External evaluation covers the period 1985-10/89. GU has introduced a new and valuable approach to A.I.D. participant training programs, demonstrating that a heretofore relatively underserved population can be provided with cost- effective U.S. training that broadens their perspective and enhances their stature back home.  To date, the program has provided training for 322 long-term and 202 short-term participants at 21 community colleges and training institutions throughout the United States.  The program has resulted in new employment opportunities for trainees, with 84% of short-term and 73% of long-term alumni currently employed.  Field sites in the Central American countries facilitated the process of recruitment, selection, and follow-up.  All this has been accomplished while keeping administrative costs to a minimum and limiting program costs to $1,000 per student per month - largely by providing the training at small community colleges and by relying extensively on volunteers and junior professionals. On the negative side, existing promotion, recruitment, and selection procedures constrain overall program quality and efficiency by encouraging a disproportionately large number of unqualified or overqualified candidates; more attention needs to be paid to the perspectives of country coordinators and local members of the selection committee.  In addition, despite the high employment rate for returned participants, many find the value of the courses limited by the generality of their content and by the heterogeneity of the trainee groups. Incoming students' ignorance of English has been a major constraint to providing quality training.  Many participating community colleges had to reduce the vocational-technical program in order to provide trainees with English-language training.  In fact, many alumni may have found work because of the English-language, rather than the vocational-technical skills, they acquired during the program. In sum, the program has made a good beginning, but now needs to mature by improving administration and program content.","Related document: PD-ABB-059","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-1109-I-07-7118-00","","10/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Education for development|Participants","Central America","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABA963.pdf","3,949 KB","000461 - Education Development Center, Inc.

"PACR of a project (1984-1988) to provide production, management, and marketing assistance to Honduran small and medium businesses through the International Executive Service Corps (IESC). Most project objectives were accomplished.  The project provided assistance to 186 businesses (against a target of 100) and in the last year had a higher level of activity (112 agreements signed) than IESC efforts in any other country.  Assistance was provided in diverse sectors of the economy and in a wide variety of skill areas.  IESC's effectiveness in terms of employment generation, productivity, sales improvement, and profit management was evident from interviews and anecdotal evidence.  Client satisfaction was high and the overwhelming majority of clients believed they received much more assistance than they had specifically contracted. Four major lessons were learned.  (1) Guidelines for selecting and charging IESC clients need to be established.  (2) IESC's marketing efforts must be more focused and expanded, with target numbers for projects and an advertising budget.  (3) The establishment of field offices is necessary to expand the number of projects and sectors served.  (4) Achievement indicators need to be developed to measure project impact.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","6/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Business support services|Management operations|Small scale enterprises|Medium scale enterprises","Honduras","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABA968.pdf","53 KB","008555 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (1983-1989) to unite Jamaica's Council of Voluntary Social Services and the United Way of Jamaica (CVSS/UWJ) as a joint mechanism for providing subgrants to Jamaican PVO's for development subprojects (SP's).  The project was revised in 1987; major new purposes were to establish an Emergency Relief Fund and make CVSS/UWJ a financially viable, fundraising entity. A final external evaluation noted the project's strengths and weaknesses.  On the positive side, CVSS/UWJ:  (1) developed an extensive network of volunteers to conduct most professional and fundraising activites; (2) created a board of prestigious, active, and mutually cooperative members; (3) generated a positive public view of the United Way in Jamaica; (4) made substantial subgrants of A.I.D. funds to PVO's for SP's benefiting the poor and monitored these SP's extensively; and (5) improved strategic planning. in the area of fund-raising.  Despite Hurricane Hugo, CVSS/UWJ's 1988 fundraising campaign created a new record, enlisting J$8.2 million against a target of J$4.5 million. Local fundraising grew impressively in terms of number of givers and average unit contributions.  Collections are expected to total 90% of pledges. As of 12/89, pledges for the 1989 campaign had reached 101% of target.  CVSS/UWJ was also successful in handling two hurricane- related grants for emergency rehabilitation. Major shortfalls were as follows.  (1) It is unlikely that the PVO activities being supported will by financially self- sustaining, and many will probably not be sustainable even at the end of A.I.D. support. (2) None of the PVO's assisted have developed a capacity to obtain funding from abroad.  (3) CVSS/UWJ fundraising and programs are still heavily concentrated in metropolitan Kingston, with almost no attention being paid to the eastern parishes and only weak programs in the central and western regions.  In addition, cost consciousness resulted in staff reduction to an insufficient size, many of the administrative improvements suggested by the 1986 external evaluation were not implemented, and impact evaluation was not effectively carried out. Also, the CVSS-UWJ relationship has not been smooth nor is it yet settled. Several lessons were learned.  (1) It may be unwise to attempt to superimpose a U.S. institutional model (i.e., that of the United Way) on a local institution, which is the outgrowth of a different social and cultural environment.  (2) Focusing on a PVO support agency may hinder new cooperative relations with existing PVO's.  (3) As a central PVO support agency grows, it needs to develop a more sophisticated management information system.  (4) PVO's need to address the development and use of overhead rates in order to assure that a core facility remains in place which can expand and contract on an ""as needed"" basis.  (5) PVO's should carry out marketing and public relations activities.  (6) PVO's need to link local efforts to foreign resource.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","7/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Private voluntary organizations|Development finance|Grants|Fundraising","Jamaica","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABB096.pdf","141 KB","008563 - USAID.

"Interim evaluation of a project to test alternative approaches to agricultural technology transfer which feature extensive farmer participation and modern communication strategies.  The evaluation covers the period 9/85-5/88 and focuses on subprojects in Honduras and Peru. The project concept and process have proved strong in many areas. Through high farmer participation in all stages, the project ensures that activities respond to concrete agricultural needs in the context of clients' current farming systems, technical knowledge, and socioeconomic realities.  The project approach also takes previously uncoordinated research and extension activities and resource-allocation decisionmaking and places them in an orderly, efficient sequence. As a result of these achievements, the self-confidence, motivation, and job performance of extensionists is markedly improved. Extensionists also applaud the effectiveness of project broadcast and print media, which reach an estimated 30%- 40% of the target population, as compared with the 5%-10% usually reached by conventional training and visit methods.  Farmer appreciation of extensionists has greatly increased, and qualitative findings suggest that the project process increases farm yields and income.  In Honduras, the project has made great strides toward institutionalization, with the Honduran Secretariat of Natural Resources officially adopting the approach for all technology transfer operations.  In Peru, institutionalization has been slowed by later project start-up, economic and political factors, and other problems. The project's shortcomings are associated primarily with funding and administration.  Total project funding has been slashed to only 36% of that originally planned.  Mission buy-ins have also been less than anticipated, perhaps due to a lack of knowledge about the project or a general reluctance to work with public sector extension. funding structure within S&T's Offices of Agriculture, Education, and Human Resources has complicated administration, while tensions between contractor and subcontractor personnel have also slowed progress.  To date, beneficiaries have been predominately male subsistence or near-subsistence farmers, with little attention paid to more commercially oriented producers, suppliers/distributors, and women.  The project also needs to improve analysis and monitoring of its impact.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","DPE-5826-C-00-5054-00","","4/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Technology transfer|Agricultural technology|Agricultural extension|Agricultural research|Farmer participation","Honduras|Peru","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABB104.pdf","1,797 KB","000223 - Academy for Educational Development, Inc.

"Interim evaluation of a project to introduce improved communication strategies in agricultural outreach services.  The evaluation covers activities in Comayagua, Honduras, during the period 2/87-12/88. The project introduced significant changes in Comayagua. Previously, extension activities were planned vertically, emphasized the farm and not the farmer, were concerned with physical outputs rather than learning objectives, and were based essentially on personal interaction with farmers.  The project increased community and farmer participation in defining extension needs; it introduced the use of flyers, newsletters, and agricultural surveys and diagnoses; and it increased emphasis on farmer training. The project also helped extension agencies to redefine their geographical priorities; as a result, new communities of basic grains producers are being served. The project had an influence on research activities, including the development of a research agenda for some agencies.  It also helped research and extension programs in the pilot region to identify and disseminate technological options. Institutionalization accomplishments are most obvious at the agency and regional levels, where support for the project is strong. National-level impact is also evident in that the project's approach was adopted as the national service delivery methodology. The project's success is largely due to strong commitment by the regional extension director in Comayagua.  Thus, future support may depend on the agenda of his replacement.  Another strength of the project has been its additive approach, whereby a few core changes were first introduced followed by larger and more comprehensive modifications. Although project activities are being expanded to new regions, much remains to be accomplished to ensure that the new methodology is universally adopted and correctly and continually applied.","Spanish ed.: PD-ABB-376","Special Evaluation","Documents","DPE-5826-C-00-5054-00","","6/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural extension|Agricultural extension training|Technology transfer|Farmer participation","Honduras","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABB105.pdf","877 KB","005034 - Applied Communication Technology|000223 - Academy for Educational Development, Inc.

"Traditionally, infants in Bangladesh are breastfed until well into the second or third year, and while supplementary foods are provided, these area generally remain insufficient to sustain normal growth.  This report evaluates the impact of nutrition education on the infant feeding practices of impoverished rural Bangladeshi mothers and on the growth of their weaning age infants.  Activities included in-home demonstrations of recipes as well as techniques to enrich foods from the family pot with energy (e.g., oil and molasses), protein (e.g., milk, fish, or legume flour), and vegetables and fruits.  Hygienic preparation of foods was stressed, and mothers were encouraged to continue breastfeeding, while at the same time frequently and persistently feeding new foods.  A total of 117 children between 4-14 months were involved in the study. Findings are very encouraging, with behavioral changes evident in many of the mothers' feeding practices.  Even after two years, the messages were still remembered by many of the mothers.  Food refusal, due to anexoria stemming from frequent infectious illnesses, was identified as a major barrier to adequate consumption; other barriers included seasonal food shortages, inability to purchase foods due to poverty, and limited time of the mothers to prepare food and attentively feed their babies.  The study concludes that, while increased intake of energy-enriched weaning foods is likely to reduce the degree of growth faltering, it cannot sustain ideal growth rates, given other economic and environmental barriers in rural Bangladesh.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-0082-O-00-8118-00","","9/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Nutritional status|Nutrition education|Nutritious recipes|Infant nutrition|Weaning practices|Child nutrition|Weaning foods","Bangladesh","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNABF428.pdf","4,185 KB","001441 - U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Services.

"Mid-term evaluation of a project to strengthen the institutional capacity of the National Council of Negro Women/International Division (NCNW/ID) to provide TA to indigenous African women's organizations. The evaluation covers the period 10/86-11/89. NCNW/ID is experiencing serious financial difficulties, including a narrow funding base, low indirect cost recovery rates from private foundation grants, excessive actual indirect costs, and unsuccessful unrestricted fundraising.  A.I.D. core funding, which has comprised a stable percentage of total funding, will soon be cut off with no immediate replacement available.  Given these problems, NCNW/ID will not be able to sustain its two offices in Africa. Toward its own institutional development, NCNW/ID has made a few notable achievements.  In 1987, the Division assembled a more experienced senior management team which has taken steps to improve staff development, including staff and benefit increases, especially for executive staff.  Personnel turnover, however, while slightly improved, continues at an average of just under two years.  NCNW/ID has done little to document lessons learned and evaluation is the weakest area of management operations. Other probems in the area of management include: lack of adequate financial skills among senior staff, the need for better defined benchmarks in NCNW/ID's goal of institutional development of African womens' organizations; and the poor quality of external and internal documents, including proposals, in both writing and graphic presentation. Assessments prepared by the project to identify appropriate sister organizations have been of marginal value.  While this is partially due to a lack of adequate and accurate data bases from which to draw information, NCNW/ID also contributed to the problem by not providing sufficient guidance to researchers. NCNW/ID's ""twinning"" concept, which involves a long-term, institutional focus (rather than a shorter-term project focus) has both advantages and disadvantages.  The twinning approach allows more flexibility, is better able to respond to local needs and environmental changes, and generates increased understanding between the two organizations.  On the other hand, such open- ended arrangements are difficult to promote among donors, and without consistent funding, NCNW/ID may fail to live up to its institutional commitments.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","AFR-0461-A-00-6025-00","","11/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Institution building|Women in development|Private voluntary organizations|Financial management|Fundraising","Africa south of Sahara","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABB132.pdf","2,770 KB","006434 - Devres, Inc.","","001554 - USAID.

"Impact evaluation of programs to provide long-term agricultural training in the United States and third countries to students from the Dominican Republic.  Evaluation covers the period 1967- 1989. During the period under review, A.I.D. provided over 400 scholarships for academic training (B.S., M.S., and Ph.D.) in agronomy, agricultural economics/agribusiness management, and other areas of agriculture.  The training has resulted in genuine benefits to both participants and institutions.  On average, graduates' real salaries have increased 5-10% upon return (except that the increases have been 30-40% for those who did not return to their sponsoring institutions.  Many former trainees have held important posts in government (three have been Secretary of Agriculture) and private enterprise.  Of the institutions employing participants, more than 90% have noted significant increases in the quality of their work and two-thirds believe they are benefitting from skills and knowledge gained through training.  Academic institutions have made the most efficient use of their graduates, as measured by retention rates and diffusion of graduate skills throughout the organization.  Of public sector institutions, those in the services sector have made the most efficient use of graduates.  Although many graduates have migrated out of public sector institutions, over 80% continue to work in the agriculture sector, primarily in agribusiness. In fact, the biggest beneficiaries of the training have been the private for-profit enterprises (both national and international corporations and firms) -- 32% of the graduates are now working in these firms, providing them with a highly skilled labor force trained at public expense. The programs have been less beneficial for women than for men. Women have made up only 12% of participants and have earned lower salaries upon return.  Moreover, women seem to have limited opportunities to change jobs and tend to remain in institutions that use their skills less efficiently, possibly due in part to a lack of an effective network of contacts. Participant support services need to be improved.  Pre-departure orientation and post-training follow-up are inadequate, and more opportunities for continuing education should be provided to help participants keep up to date with their fields of specialization.","Spanish ed.: PN-ABF-831","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","12/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural education|Agricultural training|Participants|Beneficiary count","Dominican Republic","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNABF535.pdf","2,988 KB","005762 - Ernst & Young","","005893 - USAID.

"External evaluation of a project to promote collaborative research on sorghum and millet.  External evaluation covers the period 1986-6/88. Numerous research accomplishments have been achieved in the areas of agronomy/physiology, plant breeding, entomology, food quality and nutrition, biochemistry, and pathology.  Work with Striga, a costly weed problem in Africa and Asia, has resulted in two especially noteworthy developments:  biochemical results on Striga germination by means of a sorghum root exudate and productive work on resistant strains.  The project has also developed a more streamlined approach to social science work that is generating useful information on the relevance of different kinds of sorghum and millet technologies in specific on-farm environments. The project has improved collaborators' enthusiasm, progress, and qualifications by encouraging their involvement in host country planning and priority setting and by providing extensive training.  Other accomplishments include a series of productive workshops and such publications as the food quality manual for West Africa.  Also, and most importantly, U.S. inputs overseas have been kept at levels that can probably be sustained should A.I.D. be forced to pull out. The project, which is poised to make a major contribution on both the international and domestic scenes, is now capable of initiating increases in sorghum and millet production through applied research at selected prime sites.  This strategy is a wise one, especially in the light of the budgetary shortfalls that constitute the project's principal constraint.  The project's significant accomplishments should be publicized as part of an effort to help overcome these funding constraints by building broad support for collaborative research projects in scientific, political, academic, and industrial circles. Numerous specific recommendations regarding individual areas of research are included.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","DAN-1254-G-SS-5065-00","","1/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Sorghum|Millet|Agricultural research|Research collaboration","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABB249.pdf","2,301 KB","000880 - University of Nebraska at Lincoln","","000180 - USAID.

"Interim evaluation of a project to improve national agricultural research systems (NARS) in five ecological zones in sub-Saharan Africa and to encourage coordination among donors participating in this effort. The evaluation covers the period 1982-8/89. The project is fulfilling its purpose:  13 subprojects are operational, research networks have been established, socioeconomic research is complementing technical research, and a donor group under the World Bank -- Special Programs for African Agricultural Research (SPAAR) -- is cooperating enthusiastically. Several research findings have important policy implications, e.g., that the search for off-farm employment is increasing and that cultivation is being pushed more and more onto marginal and sub-marginal lands, resulting in a transition in production and consumption from foodgrains to ""poor man's crops"" (i.e., roots, tubers, and legumes).  A key recommendation is that commodity research networks focus on the basics of crop, soil, and water use as well as on crop-specific improvements, and shift their emphasis to cropping practices sustainable on small, low-input farms. The project's most complicated problems are integrating its many facets, maintaining management efficiency, maintaining control over subproject grants, and welding this umbrella project into a sustainable package.  Management problems are mainly administrative details related to cooperative agreements and slow vouchering and reporting due primarily to external conditions. The delegation of management functions to the field has gone smoothly.  Although project networks have been effective, interactions between these networks and bilateral programs and between socioeconomic and commodity research need strengthening. While SPAAR is rated highly among donor members, African research directors in Kenya and other countries have only a hazy idea of the group and its activities. Several lessons were learned.  (1) Substantial benefits can accrue to donors and NARS through donor coordination.  (2) Commodity research networks are cost-effective investments that leverage resources of donors and participating interantional agricultural research centers and NARS.  (3) Micro and macro socioeconomic research is necessary to understand the development impact and consequences of agricultural research and provide related policy guidance.  (4) A large umbrella project with diverse purposes and activities can be effectively administered and managed if responsibilities for field activities are decentralized and clearly defined and delineated.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","8/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural research|Research collaboration|Research management|Donor coordination","Africa south of Sahara","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABB253.pdf","3,079 KB","000013 - USAID.

"Mid-term evaluation of subprojects, implemented by several international agricultural research centers, to establish commodity networks among agricultural research institutions in east and southern Africa.  The evaluation covers the period FY83- 4/89 and focuses primarily on networks operated by CIMMyT, CIP, ICRAF, and ICIPE in Kenya, by CIAT in Ethiopia, and IITA in Malawi. The networks have developed and strengthened linkages among national agricultural research systems (NARS) and between NARS and international research centers.  Particularly successful are exchanges of germplasm, sharing knowledge of methodologies, and training.  Direct contributions to national agriculture are not yet measurable, but improved bean, potato, cassava, and sweet potato cultivars are moving into advanced testing and farmer's field trials.  Improvements in cultural practices and pest control are also being widely evaluated.  Hundreds of NARS staff members have been trained and provided with information, consultation services, genetic stocks, and material support.  In addition, CIMMYT's farming systems research (FSR)  network, which focuses more on training and on-farm research than on classical FSR, is having a major impact on the attitudes and strategies of agricultural technology generation. On the negative side, there appears to be little interest on the part of the research establishment in assessing the impact of developed technologies.  This is attributed to the unreliability of the data base, lack of procedural methodologies for evaluating and quantifying such impact, and because this information is seldom included or stressed adequately among the outputs of funding grants. The networks are long-term activities which are potentially the most important investment made in Africa.  However, they must be sustained by external support for at least another 20 years to ensure a continuation of vigorous research.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","5/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Networks|Agricultural research|Research centers|Research collaboration","East Africa|Southern Africa","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABB254.pdf","1,956 KB","000013 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of three training projects in Mali -- the first (DLT) to provide U.S. development leadership training, and the second and third (SMDP-II and SHRD-III) to provide human resources development training in the United States and third countries.  The evaluation covers the period 8/80-1989. All three projects had very high training completion and repatriation rates.  DLT -- which has provided M.S. training in public administration, business administration, education, and development planning to 60 future leaders -- is clearly influencing Mali's development, since alumni now hold high positions in government ministries, international organizations operating in Mali, the A.I.D. Mission, and Mali's private sector. The DLT requirement for thesis research in Mali has been very productive, resulting in 60 original studies undertaken by the participants. SMDP-II and SHRD-III reached out to a different group.  The planned focus on academic training gave way to an emphasis on short-term technical training, and U.S. training was sharply reduced in favor of third-country institutions and in-country seminars. SMDP-II was successful, actually exceeding the number of trainees programmed, while SHRD-III has fallen short of its targets, primarily because of difficulties in designing and implementing in-country training programs. Participants were clearly well selected in terms of academic and professional background.  However, the number of women participants was unsatisfactory due to a failure to adequately publicize training opportunities.  Private sector participation was also disappointing, partly because Mali's private sector is so small. In-country English language training brought participants' TOEFL levels up to minimal academic standards, but was not sufficient for students to function well in the American environment.  In future projects, participants' first semesters should be a combination of language training and academic coursework.  Pre- departure orientation should be systematized and improved, since most participants categorized themselves as ill-prepared. U.S.-based project management was excellent, but a more active role should be taken to secure practical training opportunities for participants prior to their return to Mali.  Government of Mali planning for and paperwork on behalf of returning participants is inadequate, especially after long-term training.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-1109-I-07-7118-00","","11/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Leadership training|Personnel development|Education for development|Technical training|Participants|Needs assessments","Mali","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABB259.pdf","5,346 KB","000461 - Education Development Center, Inc.

"Mid-term evaluation of a project component to strengthen the capacity of Asociacion de Promocion y Desarrollo Socio- Economico (AVANCE), a Honduran PVO, to provide educational radio and print media programming for primary students and rural populations.  Evaluation covers the period 1987-11/89. AVANCE lacks unity and a sense of direction and the project has been constrained by management problems.  In part, these problems are due to A.I.D.'s assumption that a minor weekly newspaper operation could be expanded into a complex, multi-activity organization with little or no management TA.  Other shortfalls are attributed to poor working relationships among AVANCE's Board of Directors, its top management, and A.I.D. staff. Despite these constraints, the project has some accomplishments to its credit.  AVANCE has created Sistema de Educacion Interactivo (SEI), which has produced a good-quality interactive radio math program for grades 1 and 2 which has been used in about 2,500 classrooms.  However, SEI's productivity has been low, and no work has been done on planned efforts to provide primary-level radio instruction in Spanish.  AVANCE also took over Sani Radio in Puerto Lempira, which provides cultural and educational programming to the Miskito population in eastern Honduras. AVANCE's agricultural newspaper, El Agricultor, needs to be improved in both content and targeting.  Currently, the content is not focused on any particular audience.  Marketing is directed at students in grades 6 to 8 in urban and semi-urban areas, but only because this group is more likely to attract advertising revenues than either younger children or rural farmers. AVANCE has failed to develop new, income-generating publications; it did develop a social marketing division, but this was disbanded in 1988. AVANCE expects an operating deficit in 1989 of about 1.7 million Lempiras, though this is expected to decrease to less than 1 million by 1992.  It is recommended that AVANCE continue to be funded by A.I.D., but that it operate at a lower level than called for in the original design. Several lessons were learned.  (1) Project design should be tailored closely to the capacity of the implementing agency.  (2) The tradition of local voluntary service to agencies like AVANCE is not well established.  (3) Requiring financial self- sufficiency is very difficult for agencies delivering a ""social good."" (4) Difficulties in distributing AVANCE's products in remote rural Honduras were underestimated.","Companion evaluation summary: PD-ABC-325","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-1109-I-00-7120-00","","11/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Primary education|Radio|Rural areas|Farmers|Access to education","Honduras","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABB261.pdf","1,878 KB","000601 - Institute for International Research, Inc.

"As the result of economic crises, public health care expenditures and quality have declined in most Latin American countries.  This report presents findings on health care financing in ten countries -- Belize, Bolivia, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Ecuador, Guatemala, Peru, St. Lucia, Jamaica, and Honduras.  Background information on the countries' economies, health systems, and donor health policies is followed by research findings on three topics:  health care costs, household demand for health care, and the feasibility of alternatives to financing health care from general tax revenues (e.g., social security programs, private prepaid risk-sharing plans, and user fees). The report recommends that donors continue to emphasize public health care, but broaden their scope to include assistance to medical care programs under social security.  These two subsectors account for two-thirds or more of total health sector financing in the countries reviewed, and they have the main responsibility for serving the low- and middle-income population. Cost containment efforts should target large hospitals operated by ministries of health and social security institutions and focus on limiting personnel budgets and redirecting ambulatory care from hospitals to primary health care facilities.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","LAC-0632-C-00-5137-00","","9/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Primary health care|Health finance|Public health care|Social security|Health economics","Latin America|Belize|Bolivia|Dominican Republic|El Salvador|Ecuador|Guatemala|Peru|Saint Lucia|Jamaica|Honduras|Caribbean","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNABF596.pdf","5,799 KB","001774 - State University of New York at Stony Brook|004290 - Group Health Association of America|006958 - International Resources Group (IRG)","","001373 - USAID.

"Interim evaluation of a program to help liberalize the export of Madagascar's traditional cash crops (coffee, cloves, and peppers) and establish a liberalized foreign exchange allocation system. The evaluation covers the period 7/88-3/89. Export liberalization was officially decreed in 9/88, and information regarding this transition has been made available through an exporters' guide and newspapers. Although data are very limited, it is evident that private firms have been active in coffee purchasing and conditioning and have done reasonably well in exporting. Exporters believe that the quality of coffee is rising as the result of increased competition. However, the transition to liberalized coffee exportation has not been smooth and will take much longer than the 7-8 months originally estimated. The majority of exporters interviewed complained of the slowness of the transition and claimed that the public sector Marketing Board still controls much of the export quota as the result of previous sales agreements. Farmers are also confused about the new system and, although it appears that they are receiving increasingly higher prices, it is not clear whether these increases are the result of liberalization. Progress in liberalizing cloves exports has also been slow, partly as the result of low world market prices, but mostly because of the high export tax levied by the Marketing Board. While ten private firms are in the cloves exporting business and new firms have entered the market, no data are available on the private sector's relative share of exports. Liberalization of the pepper market has been more successful. All prior regulations have been removed, and the private sector controls an estimated 70% of total exports. Nontraditional exports have in many cases more than doubled in volume and value since 1986 (although this growth does not compensate for the losses in traditional products), and the private sector has become heavily involved in this area. The number of private marketers of lychees, for example, has increased from about 6 in 1980 to about 20 in 1988. Principal constraints appear to be insufficient local transport, excessive government regulation, and prohibitive airport/port procedures. An open general license system initiated under the program makes foreign exchange available for imports. In the majority of cases the steps required to receive foreign exchange cannot be completed within the expected 6 days. However, the system is a clear improvement over the previous one because it allows more flexibility in business and planning and encourages efficiency through reduction in inventories. Requests for foreign exchange in at least one of the three banks increased steadily throughout 1988, nearly doubling in July, when the system was expanded to all categories of imports. It is recommended that the Mission extend the terminal date for meeting conditions precedent, since performance in market liberalization has been hampered by external factors, namely, depressed world market conditions.","Evaluated project title: Madagascar agricultural export liberalization support project (MAELSP)","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","3/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Trade liberalization|Privatization|Export promotion|Imports|Foreign exchange|Exports|Nonproject assistance|Nontraditional agricultural exports","Madagascar","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABB314.pdf","1,858 KB","008572 - USAID.

"Mid-term evaluation of a project to combat immuno-preventable and diarrheal diseases in Guatemala.  The evaluation covers the period FY85-9/89. The project has significantly improved immunization coverage for children and pregnant women as well as the use of oral rehydration therapy.  Coverage rates are 53% for polio, 49% for DPT, and 59% for measles for children under one year of age.  The project has also made improvements in the cold chain, training capability, decentralized financing, and the health management information system, logistics, and administrative development. Despite these advances, the project is facing a major management crisis.  The project administrative unit (PAU), which was initially effective in managing an increase in spending and an innovative decentralization of funding, is now a major bottleneck. In the last two trimesters, it has inhibited implementation by significantly reducing spending of project- managed funds.  These problems are largely due to five separate audits, which resulted in the revision of financial control procedures and a reduction in PAU personnel.  The project has also been plagued by design problems, highly politicized conditions in Guatemala, and staff shortages. The administrative crisis has severely constricted TA by both HealthCom and Management Sciences for Health (MSH). Nevertheless, the MSH team has made advances in improving the central-level health management information system, implementing an effective self-directed training program, developing logistic systems, diagnosing donor coordination problems, improving administration, and establishing a workplan.  The MSH team has been less effective in broadening the planning process and has not participated directly in decentralization and reorganization efforts.  This is primarily due to time pressures and the lack of clearly designated counterparts. The project has supported several strategies for delivering immunizations and ORT, but considerable uncertainty exists regarding the effectiveness of many of these, some of which may be duplicative and/or competing.  The benefits and costs of the national vaccination days, channeling, mini-concentrations, and accelerated vaccination programs have not been sufficiently evaluated.  Confusion over the role of homemade solutions for ORT should also be addressed:  currently training includes a variety of homemade solutions, which if mixed improperly may be toxic. The fact that most health promoters are men has limited their effectivenss -- women are reluctant to have a man visiting their homes or to seek help in the homes of men.  Also, addressing the particular problems of the Mayan population requires attention to beliefs about ""hot"" and ""cold"" illnesses and remedies, in addition to health education messages adapted to various languages and to illiterates. Training has been one of the more effective aspects of the project. Participants have been sent for overseas training; courses in oral rehydration therapy and immunization have been provided to community volunteers and institutional health workers; and training curricula, manuals, and guides have been developed and distributed.  However, while skills and knowledge among many health providers have improved, many weaknesses remain.  Efforts to evaluate and supervise training are seriously deficient, and the appropriate means for educating mothers have not been developed.  Moreover, since the project focuses solely on oral rehydration therapy and immunizations, to the neglect of other child survival interventions, project-funded courses must be limited to these two topics or risk losing funds.","Attached to PD-ABB-566","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-1406-I-00-7113-00","","9/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Child survival activities|Maternal child health care|Immunizations","Guatemala","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDABB566A.pdf","3,042 KB","004293 - University Research Corp.

"Evaluates the impact of two A.I.D. projects (6120205 and 6120214) to support the Malawi Union of Savings and Credit Cooperatives (MUSCCO). The evaluation covers the period 9/80-2/89. Although MUSCCO has increased the number of its affiliates and the volume of loans well beyond targets, the institution has faced a number of difficulties.  Growth in individual membership in the affiliates has been lower than expected, loan delinquency is a persistent problem, the number and size of individual loans are far from meeting the demand, and women have not participated to the extent desired.  In large part, these shortfalls have occurred because targeted beneficiaries are too poor to save large amounts, are unfamiliar with financial management practices, and can absorb only limited training due to their low levels of literacy and numeracy.  Many rural people have also had adverse experiences with earlier cooperatives and are reluctant to entrust a new and untested organization (even their own) with hard-earned savings.  Other constraints include the seasonality of demand for loans and of the availability of cash for loan repayment, occasional corruption on the part of local officials and employees, and difficult communication and transportation conditions. Despite these problems, MUSCCO is helping farmers and small business people (at least those in a relatively high economic stratum) achieve improved nutrition, health, and education levels.  By its nature, MUSCCO is unable to benefit the poorest of the poor.  Further assistance should be provided to continue to expand MUSCCO's influence.","Cover title: Impact evaluation of African rural credit projects :|the Malawi Union of Savings and Credit Cooperative Organizations|project|Also known as: Development fund for Africa : impact evaluation of|Malawi Union of Savings and Credit Cooperative Organizations","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-5315-I-05-8101-00","","2/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Credit cooperatives|Credit unions|Loan administration|Poverty","Malawi","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABB570.pdf","1,274 KB","006727 - Development Alternatives, Inc.

"Interim evaluation of a project to improve a milk production and distribution network for children and women of child-bearing age in Mexico City, Mexico.  The project is implemented through CARE and Leche Industrializada CONASUPO (LICONSA). External evaluation covers the period 12/87-9/89. The objective to increase milk consumption among the marginally based population has been fulfilled.  More than 165,000 children and 64,700 mothers are being reached by the project, while the entire LICONSA program is serving more than 1.5 million families. With the inclusion of 4,080 tons of U.S. donated non-fat dried milk, the project is providing milk to an average of 206,551 families per day.  Beneficiary selection criteria have been used to ensure that the marginally poor are reached. The project has also been successful in extending the infrastructure for milk production and distribution.  Accomplishments include:  provision of bigger tanks to 19 milk distribution centers; installation  of 4 raw milk collection tanks in Tlaxcala and Puebla; operationalization of laboratory equipment in the Santa Isabel, Tlaxcala Pasteurizing and Rehydration Plant; and the procurement of 3 Mack tanker trucks and 2 vehicles for use in providing supervision and TA.  On the negative side, the project has failed to improve the milk production capabilities and facilities for the small farmer.  Although LICONSA provided imported cows to small farmers, no project funds were used for this purpose. The project's long-term sustainability is ensured by LICONSA's wide network of milk distribution and milk processing centers. Both CARE and LICONSA recommend that the project scope be expanded.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-0706-G-SS-6184-00","","9/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Milk|Child feeding programs|Dairies|Infant feeding programs|Maternal child feeding programs|Beneficiary count","Mexico","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABB561.pdf","2,296 KB","000088 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (8/81-2/89) to strengthen the capacity of the Government of the Dominican Republic (GODR) to implement soil and water conservation interventions. The project achieved its two principal objectives and most original targets.  Through project training and TA, the Secretariat of Agriculture developed the capability to develop and implement watershed management plans and began collecting baseline information on the country's resources.  A soil and water conservation model was implemented which involves the creation of watershed development committees to work with project field staff in the planning and monitoring process.  The model proved effective for identifying local concerns and priorities in terms of watershed conservation interventions. Despite these achievements, the project did not succeed in stimulating sufficient environmental awareness among GODR officials to ensure long-term support.  As a result, virtually all project-specific activities ceased as soon as direct A.I.D. assistance was terminated. Another major weakness of the project was its assumption that hillside farmers are the primary causes of soil erosion, when in fact road building, deforestation, and natural causes are more serious factors. The major lesson learned is that solving natural resource management problems requires long-term financial and administrative commitments by the participating institutions. To establish these commitments, natural resource management projects must have a minimum 7-10 year lifetime and promote the participation of nongovernmental organizations to compensate for limited political support.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","2/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Soil conservation|Water conservation|Watersheds|Natural resource management|Institution building","Dominican Republic","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABB582.pdf","520 KB","008537 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (1982-1989) to promote energy resource conservation and development in the Dominican Republic. Despite bureaucratic delays in obtaining funding from the Central Bank, almost all long-term project objectives were achieved.  (1) Assisted by a project consultant, the National Energy Policy Commission (COENER) produced a number of studies leading to a national energy investment plan, including a financial analysis of major proposed energy investment projects, an alternative analysis of electricity supply and demand for the 1985-1995 period, and a macro-economic analysis of the energy investment plan for 1985-1995.  The consultant also developed several computer programs useful in analyzing investment scenarios. (2) The project helped COENER promote industrial energy conservation. Grants financed 75% of the costs of 80 energy audits by local consultants, while COENER, though unable to provide much TA to help the firms implement audit recommendations, offered 19 courses in industrial energy management and 4 on energy auditing to a total of 700 participants.  A project-financed Industrial Energy Conservation Fund has enabled universities and educational centers to continue offering similar courses; the Fund also financed several energy conservation measures.  In other activities, COENER created a registry of authorized energy auditors, and 4 of a targeted 14 energy conservation pilot projects were completed. (3) Efforts to construct mini-hydro facilities proceeded apace, with electro-mechanical equipment supplied to about 90% of the sites selected and civil work contracts completed at about 45%. USAID/DR is currently processing a Dominican Electricity Company (CDE) request to allocate funds for completion of the Yuboa project, which was closed when the PACD was not extended. (4) To promote fuelwood as an alternative energy source, the project financed an R&D program on tree production at 20 sites and built and tested 9 brick kilns for converting wood to energy; this program produced 26 technical notes and 12 B.S. graduation theses.  A research program on native forest management resulted in 7 pilot and 30 permanent plots, 4 silvicultural trials, another 10 B.S. graduation theses, and other studies.  A credit fund was established in the Central Bank to finance energy farms and COENER signed 10 cooperation agreements with various institutions (universities, communal centers, etc.) to implement pilot energy farms.  A seminar was held to disseminate the component's research results to COENER, A.I.D., and other entities.  (5) Finally, the project provided TA to upgrade the technical, financial, and planning capabilities of the CDE. Upon project termination, the Technical Secretariat of the Presidency did not renew the contracts of the majority of COENER technicians who worked on the project.  This resulted in a standstill of almost all COENER activities and a loss of almost all expertise accumulated during the project.  While almost all project-trained technicians are working in other energy-related government agencies or private enterprises, it is recommended that future projects provide TA to government institutions only when personnel have some degree of job security.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","9/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Energy conservation|Energy planning|Energy economics|Energy resource development|Alternative energy resources","Dominican Republic","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABB583.pdf","1,247 KB","008537 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (FY81-FY89) to strengthen the capacity of Fundacion APEC de Credito Educativo (FUNDAPEC) to provide educational loans to vocational/technical students and business managers in the Dominican Republic and to provide TA and procurement services to local vocational/technical training institutions. Despite the project's complexity and difficulties, major activities and expected outputs were successfully accomplished. Educational credit -- loans were provided to 5,300 students -- significantly expanded management and vocational/technical training opportunities, especially for poorer candidates, and led to a consequent improvement in the income, productivity, and overall quality of life.  In order to finance future participants, FUNDAPEC established a revolving loan fund with the repayment funds from student loans. FUNDAPEC also established a program which provided direct credit for training to 4,366 managers and potential managers of medium and small companies as well as self-employed persons.  The three types of training offered -- short-term, university, and correspondence courses -- all had a direct impact on the management of the businesses involved. In addition, loans for procuring computer equipment were provided to 14 vocational/technical institutions, TA in institutional development was provided to 34 such institutions, and 107 faculty and administrative personnel received short-term U.S. training. FUNDAPEC staff also received short-term overseas training, covering credit management, collection, and approval; recordkeeping; and vocational/technical curriculum development. FUNDAPEC also received a computer which improved its capacity to provide educational loans. Lessons learned relate to procurement delays and equipment selection. (1) To minimize delays, future projects should place more emphasis on adequate lead-time and timely, regular monitoring during the procurement process.  (2) An education procurement consultant should be contracted to assist institutions in selecting appropriate equipment.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Vocational training|Student loans|Technical training|Management training|Institution building","Dominican Republic","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABB585.pdf","331 KB","008537 - USAID.

"Mid-term evaluation of a project to provide village-level health education and home-based rehabilitative services in the West Bank. Catholic Relief Services (CRS) is the implementing agency. The evaluation covers the period 1988-12/89. The project operates about 156 village programs throughout the West Bank, with a trained health education worker posted at each center. Project administration has been successfully transferred to six regional societies.  In the past year, these societies have increased their training capacity by organizing four training sessions for new health workers.  While the basic curriculum has not been changed since 1985, additional materials have been produced and provided to teachers for optional use. The process of combining the project's rehabilitation and health education components is generally progressing as planned.  About 47 handicapped children are visited weekly by village workers, and 30 more workers are scheduled for rehabilitation training. Upon graduation, they will add home-based rehabilitation work to their health education activities.  The new management of the project, which is headed by a Palestinian psychologist, is functioning successfully. The project is also characterized by several weaknesses, however. Health workers have had difficulty attracting mothers to the program or retaining them therein, apparently due in part to the workers' poor teaching skills.  As a result, some workers have resorted to using food aid as an incentive for mothers to participate in health education activities, despite CRS directions to provide food to all needy families, including those who do not participate in the program.  While CRS organized several in-service workshops to improve teaching skills during 1987 and 1988, none have been offered this year.  Although child growth patterns are effectively monitored, the cumulative records of mothers and children are not maintained.  No plans have been made for the transfer of financial responsibility to the regional societies, which are expected to cover 10% of health worker salaries by 1990.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","12/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Health education|Community health workers|Rehabilitative medicine|Maternal child health care","West Bank","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABB597.pdf","1,087 KB","007337 - Catholic Relief Services (CRS)","","004200 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of a project to provide training in the dairy industry to nine Jamaican farmers through 15 months of practical experience on U.S. farms and a 11-month technical course. External evaluation covers the period 3/88-9/88 and is based on interviews with returned participants, their Jamaican employers, and their U.S. hosts. All participants interviewed stated that the training left them better prepared for employment in the dairy industry, though they complained that their employers do not understand the breadth of their new knowledge and hence will not increase their salaries. Employers, for their part, reported a general satisfaction with the project and claimed that they would hire project participants over other applicants without formal training.  In particular, the employers are impressed with the participants' newly found ""work ethic."" Nearly all the U.S. host families were extremely satisfied with participants and encouraged them to take part in all aspects of farm family life.  Although some of the U.S. farmers were cautious about assigning duties that would jeopardize their operations, all felt that the participants were excellent workers and willing to learn from their experience.  All families indicated that they would like to have another trainee and would recommend the project to neighbors and friends. Land O'Lakes, the implementing agency, did an excellent job in caring for and coordinating the trainees and in mediating interpersonal problems between trainees and host families.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","9/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Dairy farms|Dairies|Agricultural training|Farmer training","Jamaica","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABB596.pdf","487 KB","003979 - WINN International","","000086 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (8/85-8/89) to strengthen the Jamaica Agricultural Development Foundation (JADF) as a mechanism for providing agricultural loans and equity financing in Jamaica. Project TA complemented local currency funding (from the sale of Title II commodities), which was used to capitalize the JADF. Project goals were achieved, and the JADF -- a private nonprofit institution -- is very successful.  JADF went from a deficit of J$865,485 in 1985 to a net operating surplus of J$3.915 million in 2/89. JADF's outstanding agricultural loan portfolio grew from J$1.75 million in 1985 to J$78.1 million in 3/90.  As of the latter date, JADF has committed funds to 242 agricultural projects and made an additional 142 loans to rehabilitate the poultry and banana sectors following Hurricane Gilbert in 1988. The project also helped JADF to develop a competent and professional staff and to acquire modern automatic data processing equipment.  In addition to its lending activities, JADF conducted and commissioned many studies and developed a market information system. JADF is now in a position not only to handle agricultural investments, but to implement other USAID/J projects. JADF was badly set back by Hurricane Gilbert, since many borrowers suffered heavy crop losses and could not meet loan payments.  However, USAID/J decided to channel significant new funding through JADF as a hurricane response, saving the institution from the negative consequences of focusing only on high-risk agricultural lending. Several lessons were learned.  (1) Venture capital activities need an environment of corporate openness and strong accounting and financial reporting standards for rapid development.  (2) Provision of TA by a financial institution to its clients is a costly exercise which must be funded by grant funds when the capital base is limited.  (3) Regularity and predictability of funding flows are critical to a financial institution's overall performance and cost-effectiveness.  (4) Similar institutions could be created to invest P.L. 480 local currency generations in other areas, such as education, the environment, etc. (5) Most businesses perceive venture capital as interest-free start-up capital and are unwilling to allow the lending institution to participate in management.  (6) Successful foundations need competent Boards of Directors.  (7) A well-timed evaluation can be critical in the development of a project.  (8) USAID/J's strategy of providing complementary grant-funded TA played a vital role in JADF's survival.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Financial institutions|Foundations|Institution building|Agricultural credit","Jamaica","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABB816.pdf","703 KB","008563 - USAID.

"PACR of a project to provide employment and emergency food assistance to Honduran families displaced from their homes along the Honduran-Nicaraguan border. The project helped about 379 families.  The employment component benefited 230 people, while food rations and/or agricultural packages were provided to 322 families.  Monitoring by Caritas -- the PVO implementing the emergency food assistance program -- indicated a significant impact on the nutrition levels of children.  Midway through the project, the percentage of displaced children suffering from moderate or severe malnutrition was 7% lower than for other El Paraiso children. Work activities were initially centered in the areas to which the displaced population had fled, but once people began returning to their villages, these activities were transferred to the home communities. The most notable of the work projects in the home communities were the construction of a potable water system in Arenales and the improvement of the 24-km road extending from Capire to Arenales.  Beneficiaries also installed culverts and dug drainage ditches along the road by hand. Construction work also improved 8 schools, a health clinic, and 4 municipal properties. Three major lessons were learned.  (1) The isolation and perceived dangers of working in the Nicaraguan border area make it difficult to attract and maintain capable promoters.  (2) Emergency projects for displaced families should avoid providing a standard of living higher than that enjoyed in the village of origin.  In the present case, the high quality of interim housing -- built prior to the inception of this project -- deterred some families from returning home.  (3) In sensitive projects such as this, a politically aware grantee with sound judgment is essential.  Numerous situations with the potential for attracting unfavorable media attention arose under this project, but were identified and resolved by the overall grantee -- Cooperative Apaguiz of Danli -- before they could become damaging.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Refugee relief|Emergency food distribution|Employment|Political aspects","Honduras","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABB826.pdf","93 KB","008547 - USAID.

"Interim evaluation of a project funded by P.L. 480 local currency generations to reduce Tunisia's unemployment rate through various work programs, including desertification control, soil and water conservation, improvement and maintenance of public works and archaeological sites, and building rehabilitation.  The evaluation covers the period 1987-1989. The project has been successful in providing a safety net for unemployed workers, having created about 40,000 jobs and given support to more than 100,000 families.  A rotation system has given most unemployed males the opportunity to work.  The level of poverty is the basic criterion for eligibility, with more than 90% of project workers being unskilled old and young people having at most a primary education. Moreover, almost 85% of rural and 70% of urban beneficiaries come from either the agriculture or industry/construction sectors -- those most affected by drought and structural adjustment programs.  In 1988, the project absorbed about 20% of total unemployment and created some 1,000 permanent jobs in the areas of forestry and soil and water conservation. The project directly supports the private sector and stimulates its participation in the project.  However, private sector hiring of project field workers has been limited so far because of relatively inflexible labor legislation and the low productivity of project laborers. Although the cost-effectiveness of the project is difficult to judge, mechanized agricultural techniques appear to be cheaper than labor-intensive techniques in most cases.  It should be noted, however, that a project designed as a safety net for the unemployed poor cannot simultaneously intend to maximize productivity. The practice of using municipal funds to pay project workers more than the market wage rate should be stopped, since it constitutes a disincentive to seek a permanent job elsewhere.  The project should also establish work programs for women.  Other recommendations are, inter alia, to improve linkages to the private sector (e.g., by giving priority to the brigades mobiles and creating small urban enterprises) and to integrate project administration with institutions in charge of employment policies. Financing of a safety net program should continue in the long term, even as the drought wanes and Tunisia's economy grows. However, the emphasis of A.I.D. support should shift to training, extension, and supervision, since the primary impediment to the creation of permanent jobs is the lack of basic skills among the unemployed.","Delivery order no. 7|Companion evaluation summary: PD-ABC-553","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-1406-I-00-7028-00","","11/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Employment|Nonskilled workers|Structural adjustment|Drought|Beneficiary targeting|Unemployment","Tunisia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNABG218.pdf","752 KB","002781 - Sigma One Corp.","","008616 - USAID.

"Presents final external evaluation of a project (FY85-8/89) to reform tax administration in Ecuador. The project's design was negotiated with the Febres Cordero administration, which came into power in 8/84; the project began in 8/85.  While the project was under a number of serious constraints, since it did not contemplate changes in the tax law (which had serious deficiencies), it was, nevertheless, a well- conceived, comprehensive, and well-planned, if overambitious initiative, which appeared to have the full support of the Minister of Finance (MOF) and the GOE.  The background and qualifications of the contractor, OMNIMAX, appeared to be ideal to provide TA in transforming the Direccion General de Rentas (DGR) into a modern tax administration agency. Within 8 months, however, the project ran into a serious problem of wavering MOF support which was to plague it throughout the 4- year period of the Febres Cordero administration.  Reorganization of the DGR, which was central to the project, was held up for a year before finally being approved by the MOF (putting the project a year behind schedule). When that problem was resolved, the GOE refused to provide duty-free customs clearance for equipment brought in under the project so that the other central project element -- computerization of tax collections, control, and follow up -- was delayed indefinitely.  Although both USAID/E and OMNIMAX worked diligently to resolve this problem, it persisted until the change of government in 8/88. In spite of these problems, OMNIMAX tried to achieve at least some of the project's objectives.  Some success was achieved in improving the collections system, and taking the first steps to separate policy from operational functions and to decentralize the system.  The greatest failures were in auditing, systems, and processing.  This was due to internal resistance to change within the DGR, lack of leadership and confidence at the subdirector level of the DGR, deficient TA from OMNIMAX, and waning commitment on the part of the MOF. The new government, which took office in 8/88, took immediate action on fundamental tax reform, promulgating a new tax law and initiating a lightening-like program of procedural changes.  It also addressed some of the project's long-standing problems -- resolving the matter of customs clearance and promptly honoring a project obligation to put 20 collection agents on the DGR payroll. The new government's tax reforms will represent a significant improvement.  If they are to succeed, the DGR must be strengthened and reoriented.  Recommendations along these lines are presented.

"Ex post impact evaluation of a 1983-86 project to strengthen the capacity of Tanzania's Agricultural Research Organization (TARO) to coordinate farming systems research (FSR) activities and to pilot test FSR in the districts of Kilosa, Dodoma, and Moshi. Evaluation is based on evidence gathered in Kilosa and Moshi. In general, farmers showed interest in FSR activities and responded positively to most of the technology packages tested on farms.  For example, in Kilosa, farmers adopted an early maturing maize variety (Kito) which had already been produced at TARO's Ilonga Research Institute but had not yet been disseminated.  The variety solved the endemic famine which occurred in Kilosa at the onset of the masika season (the main rainy season).  In Moshi, the practice of intercropping maize at optimal density with Lyamungu-85 beans gained acceptance among farmers in the intermediate altitude area.  The project's FSR teams are now better known at the village level than the conventional extension staff. On the negative side, while the project contributed significantly to the development of 19 research buildings at Ilonga, these are rarely used due to a lack of water, laboratory equipment, and furniture.  Land development was only implemented at less than half of the target, and only one full and two partial FSR teams were established, compared with the goal of three full teams. These shortcomings were primarily the result of:  (1) funding shortfalls due to cutbacks imposed by the Brooke Amendment; (2) weak management by TARO, the main executing agent; (3) transportation problems stemming from a lack of spare parts; (4) the project's short life span; and (5) limited acceptance of the FSR methodology by commodity researchers and extensionists. Overall, the project demonstrated the effectiveness of FSR in transferring the benefits of research technology to farmers.  The success achieved in the project's two ecological zones has been officially adopted in the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock Development structure, and plans are underway to expand it to more ecological zones.  The project also recognized the major role of women in Tanzanian agriculture, although it never took cognizance of their specific constraints and priorities.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","10/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Farming systems research|On farm research|Farmer participation|Agricultural technology|Technology transfer|Agricultural extension","Tanzania","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDBBT113.pdf","1,540 KB","004014 - Tanzania Industrial Studies and Consulting Organisation","","008612 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (1980-1985) to support a pig producers cooperative in Swaziland by providing training, TA, and livestock. The project assisted only 28 families, compared with the target of 75, due to serious delays in implementation.  Since no organizations existed which were capable of implementing project activities, the project had to establish, staff, and provide training to a new cooperative society before actual implementation could begin.  The project also seriously underestimated the time required for the Government of Swaziland to develop the water system and construct the piggery and other planned buildings.  By the time the piggery was finally built, construction costs were four times the original estimate. Despite these setbacks, the project was successful in teaching individual producers to construct pigpens and raise pigs, and these producers appear to have actually exceeded the target number of litters sold.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Animal husbandry|Farmer training|Swine|Livestock housing|Agricultural cooperatives","Swaziland","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABB924.pdf","45 KB","008609 - USAID.

"Angola has known civil war since its independence in 1975.  In October 1989, a team representing the U.S. Government and three U.S PVO's assessed the status of the civilian population in two extremely isolated areas of Angola, Moxico and Cuando Cubango Provinces, both of which are controlled by the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA).  The assessors covered an area of some 30,000 square miles, surveying 53 villages and interviewing more than 1,500 UNITA officials, village elders, health workers, agricultural specialists, farmers, and mothers of small children.  Nutritional examinations were performed on over 1,300 young children. This report on the assessment highlights the extreme difficulties faced by the population, which is at serious risk of death from preventable diseases  (malaria, childhood diarrhea, and vaccine preventable diseases).  Due to wartime conditions, almost nothing is available to prevent or treat these diseases, and 51% of the 1,282 mothers surveyed have lost at least one child to disease, with 25% of all conceptions lost before 10 years of age. Moreover, 42% of 1,314 children surveyed were found to be malnourished.  While the agricultural survey found adequate arable land and water for subsistence food production, seeds and farm tools are in extremely short supply, and the provinces' meager stores of grain and seed are infested with insects. The report includes logistical, technical, and political recommendations for providing specific types of humanitarian aid to the populations of the two provinces.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","12/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Civil war|War victims|Agricultural surveys|Health surveys|Food supply|Agricultural inputs|Morbidity|Child mortality|Child nutrition|Malnutrition","Angola","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNABG281.pdf","1,565 KB","002440 - International Rescue Committee (IRC)","","000624 - USAID.

"Evaluation of joint programming and cooperation between the Peace Corps (PC) and A.I.D. in Africa.  At the time of the evaluation (12/89), therewere about 900 PC volunteers assigned to 63 A.I.D.- supported projects in 24 African countries. A major finding is that there is little true partnership between A.I.D. and the PC.  Instead, the principal focus of field cooperation is on resource sharing in the form of A.I.D. financial support for PC activities and PC participation in A.I.D.-supported projects.  Moreover, there is a great deal of ambivalence in both agencies about the desirability and feasibility of increasing A.I.D.-PC collaboration. This attitude can be attributed to the following:  (1) a lack of PC experience in project design, monitoring, and evaluation; (2) limited enthusiasm among PVO's for incorporating PC volunteers in their projects; (3) a perception among Mission staff that PC volunteers lack sufficient training for A.I.D. projects; (4) the shift towards nonproject assistance within A.I.D.; and (5) a lack of awareness within A.I.D. of the potential value of PC activities as precursors or successors to Mission projects. A.I.D. financing provides the bulk of PC project funding and has helped strengthen the capabilities of PC volunteers and their host country counterparts.  Small Project Assistance (SPA) funds are widely used and appreciated, but there are some PC volunteers and Mission staff who are not pleased with PC volunteers being seen by villagers as a source of funding.  Missions are generally not consulted on the use of Participating Agency Services Agreements (PASA's), and while PC must sign an agreement with A.I.D. to obtain SPA funds, the Missions generally have minimal involvement in the program administration.  Most PC Missions are not well informed about technical PASA's and A.I.D. Mission knowledge of PASA's is even less.  On the other hand, A.I.D. unduly limits the technical fields for which it will fund SPA projects and technical PASA's. There are many untapped opportunities for collaboration that would be in the interest of both agencies and would be supportive of host countries' development efforts.  The synergistic effect of improved and expanded collaboration would be greater than the sum of benefits to each agency.  This would be reflected in the overall impact of the U.S. government development effort in the host country and in a more rational use of taxpayers' dollars.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-5371-I-00-8122-00","","12/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Donor coordination|Development organizations|Development project design|Development finance","Africa south of Sahara","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABB988.pdf","7,247 KB","003970 - Management Systems International, Inc.

"Between 1951 and 1989, A.I.D. provided over $100 million to the Royal Thai Government for some 30 separate health projects. Activities were primarily in malaria eradication and control, population and family planning, rural water and sanitation, medical education and health training, primary health care, and nutrition.  This evaluation concludes that, although there have been some failures at the project level, the impact of A.I.D. assistance has been outstanding at the policy and program levels. Highlights include:  a reduction in malaria from the primary cause of death in the 1950's to a minor cause; a significant drop in birth rates and a contraceptive prevalence rate equal to that of the industrialized nations; continued expansion of the Chiang Mai medical school; and rapid expansion of potable water and sanitary latrines.  The sustainability of these programs is largely due to the Ministry of Public Health's highly motivated and technically competent staff and strong management and planning capacities.  The Ministry has prefered an experimental, flexible approach with emphasis on community participation.  The projects also benefited from the economic stability and recent prosperity of the country, which ensured budgetary resources and increased demands for new health care interventions.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","10/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Health delivery|Development assistance|Project sustainability|Health policy","Thailand","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNABG517.pdf","1,576 KB","008613 - USAID.

"Interim evaluation of Support Module Yemen (SMY), the logistical and administrative support unit of A.I.D.'s Agricultural Development Project (ADSP), a large umbrella project in Yemen. The evaluation covers the period 1988-11/89. The theory of centralized logistic support and fiscal management was a sound and an appropriate response to the unsatisfactory managemment of the project under the ""lead university concept"" in its early years.  The Consortium for International Development (CID), the prime contractor for the overall project, was an appropriate entity to implement SMY.  The Mission is satisfied that the procedures, controls, and reporting systems established provide reasonable assurance of fiscal responsibility and avoidance of waste and abuse. However, SMY has not gained the full support and cooperation of all parties.  The project's current team leaders would still strongly prefer to phase out the SMY and undertake its responsibilities themselves.  CID supports the team leaders on this point, while Yemen government officials back the decision of the Mission.  See the abstract of PD-ABC-065 for the unexpected resolution of this question.","Attached to PD-ABC-065","Special Evaluation","Documents","279-0052-O-00-9070-00","","11/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Logistics|Financial management|Development project management","Yemen","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDABC065A.pdf","1,816 KB","006434 - Devres, Inc.","","008624 - USAID.

"In March of 1985, USAID/Guatemala signed an agreement with Camara Empresarial (CAEM) to grant $1.5 million to implement the Private Sector Development Coordination Project (520-0337). The project was designed to increase the participation of the private sector in nontraditional development programs, with the aim of increasing exports, and was structured such that CAEM had the administrative, financial, and reporting requirements under the grant.  CAEM administered the grant to two subgrantees -- Fundacion Tecnologica (FUNTEC) and Fundacion de Desarrollo (FUNDAP) -- and served as the lead organization in nontraditional export promotion development and coordination of the Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI) export and investment promotion efforts. Following some start-up difficulties, which were understandable given the very different goals and activities of the three organizations involved in the project, the structural arrangement seems to have worked well and overall, and the project was successful in many areas. However, the achievements of the implementing agencies have differed depending on the strengths and weaknesses of each. As coordinator of the overall project, CAEM organized an inter-agency steering committee to supervise the project. Representatives from FUNDAP, FUNTEC, and the International Executive Service Corps participated, although CAEM held the majority of seats on the committee. In general, this mechanism worked well to coordinate very different private sector activities under the project and CAEM was able to work cooperatively with FUNTEC and FUNDAP in administering the project.  In fact, field interviews revealed high satisfaction with the administrative role played by CAEM, particularly with the intermediation function with USAID/G. In other areas, CAEM's activities in support of exports and investment promotion were limited by a lack of resources, but contributed to an increase in both jobs and foreign exchange, resulting in significantly greater leveraging of USAlD/Guatemala's resources. The first activity initiated under the FUNDAP component was a community-based integrated development project which sought to promote the principal economic activities of the altiplano region -- ovine production and traditional artisanry.  Of the subprojects, this was the most successful in terms of institutional development and impact on the daily lives of the target group.  Nonetheless, it generated virtually no foreign exchange and had almost no multiplier effect on the economy. Of the subprojects, only those implemented by FUNTEC could be considered to have been less than optimal, although this judgment is admittedly and necessarily subjective.  Nevertheless, FUNTEC is one of the few institutions in Guatemala offering a potential channel for technology transfer.  It also offers an important source of human capital as it gathers together a number of private sector entrepreneurs with a wide range of experience in business with the purpose of facilitating the dissemination of technology. In addition to the evaluation of this project, the team was directed to analyze the effectiveness of other microenterprise projects in Guatemala in order to provide USAID/G with recommendations regarding the design of future microenterprise activities. Although it is too early to evaluate several of these projects, the Guatemalan experience reveals that many of these projects have been successful in achieving the desired objectives of income and employment generation.  In fact, recent studies have shown that microenterprises have an unrealized profit (and thus employment) potential that could be exploited with adequate credit and technical assistance programs. The evaluation team was comprised of experts in institutional private sector development, micro- and small-enterprise development, artesania, and marketing projects.  The team used a straightforward methodology, consisting of interviews with USAID/G staff, interaction and on-site visits with implementing agencies, interviews with recipients of the services, and intensive document review.  Approximately three weeks of field work were conducted in Guatemala in August, 1988.

"PACR of the water component of a project (9/81-6/89) to strengthen energy management and conservation in Jamaica. The project as a whole consisted of two phases -- the first directed at the public, the second at the private sector.  The latter phase consisted of an energy credit fund managed by local banks and aimed at improving energy efficiency in private industry.  The fund was unsuccessful, however, since the loans carried a substantially lower interest rate than regular commercial loans and thus banks were reluctant to extend them. As a result, less than 10% of credit funds were committed.  In 9/86, the project was modified to direct remaining funds toward eight energy-related water supply and sewerage subprojects. This modification of the project was found to be an appropriate change, which provided the benefit of over 23 million gallons of water per day of new capacity or enhanced delivery of existing capacity. The major project lessons concerned the fixed amount reimbursement (FAR) method of financing.  The innovations in the FAR method used by USAID/J in this project enabled expeditious and relatively trouble-free implementation of the subprojects. The project serves as an example of possibilities for future use of FAR. The following was accomplished under these subprojects:  (1) construction of a half-million gallon reservoir at Pleasant Hill in Eastern St. Thomas; (2) improvements to the Rio Cobre pipeline system to enable pumping from augmentation wells directly into the trunk main; (3) improvement of the Lucea-Negril system in Western Jamaica by installing about 11,000 feet of pipe to connect the Logwood treatment plant to the distribution main at Orange Bay; (4) preliminary engineering, cost, and feasibility studies for expansion of the Logwood treatment plant, the Negril distribution system, and a water loss management program for the Lucea-Negril area; (5) feasibility, design, and cost studies for the Negril and Ocho Rios sewerage systems; (5) preparation of a 10-year plan for the Ocho Rios/St. Ann's Bay water system; and (6) installation of bulk flow meters at 22 locations throughout Jamaica.","Loan no. 532-W-016A","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","6/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Water supply|Water supply structures|Energy conservation","Jamaica","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABC153.pdf","341 KB","008563 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (8/85-9/89) to strengthen the capacity of the Building Department of Jamaica's College of Arts, Science, and Technology (CAST) to train technicians and professionals for the construction industry. The project had a positive impact on the Building Department, providing TA, training, furniture, and equipment as well as decreasing the level of faculty turnover.  The two long-term lecturers who implemented the TA component provided valuable services, including the drafting of the curriculum for the newly established School of Architecture and the establishment of a soils and materials laboratory at the Building Department.  This lab is unlike any other in the English-speaking Caribbean and will provide valuable opportunities for research and practical experience.  On the negative side, a summer institute for construction industry professionals had only limited success, since most professionals found it impossible to leave their practices for a week to two weeks.  Additionally, plans to establish a professional services unit, which would seek opportunities for the Building Department to provide work for fees, were not fulfilled due to numerous problems, such as the lack of staff time, problems of liability,  and organizational constraints. Training activities were highly successful.  Two persons who received long-term U.S. training are now full-time lecturers at CAST.  In-service workshops for building inspectors were well supported and are continuing.  Four lecturers also attended short seminars and conferences in the United States and various Caribbean countries. Several lessons were learned.  (1) CAST has a clear vision of where it is heading and has the capacity to use foreign assistance to its best advantage in meeting its own goals.  (2) Not all activities proposed by donors and administration are perceived as being in CAST's best interests; project planning could benefit from wider involvement of CAST staff members.  (3) CAST's high-quality staff, equipment, and operational strategies provide tremendous potential to earn additional revenue from outside resources.  (4) External assistance can help an institution continue its pursuit of long-term development during a period of economic recession.  (5) Staff training programs can effectively support staff recruitment.  (6) Since the CAST staff is not totally Jamaican, A.I.D. funding conditions may reduce the effectiveness of proposed staff development programs.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","9/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Construction industry|Universities and colleges|Engineering education|Technical training|Faculty|Institution building","Jamaica","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABC182.pdf","232 KB","008563 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (7/82-9/88) to test and institutionalize a long-range management methodology for Peru's high jungle and its natural resources. The project embodied a vision of sustainable development that was innovative, idealistic, and courageous -- it dared to flout the vested interests of politicians, loggers, and resource predators and to defend the historic rights of native peoples.  As a result, development of the Palcazu Valley is underway, using technologies that maximize long-term productivity.  More than 200 ha of coffee, cacao, and papaya plantations, as well as a nursery for 460 ha of coffee were established. The Yanesha Forestry Cooperative was formed and is operating a sustained-yield natural forest management and production system based on strip cutting; the cooperative's wood processing complex is producing lumber, preserved posts, and charcoal for export as well as local consumption.  The project also:  tested 8 agroforestry and agro- silvo-pastoral systems; established 73 tropical hair-sheep modules on improved pastures; and conducted 20 experiments on low-input production systems combining annual/tree crops with grasses and legumes. To improve regional infrastructure, the project provided equipment for a road maintenance center which maintained 114 km or roads and opened logging and local roads.  A medical center and four health posts were also established.  Midwives and local health promoters were trained, and vaccination campaigns were conducted regularly.  A regional development policy support group is operating in the Oficina de Proyectos Especiales of the Instituto Nacional de Desarrollo which provides, among other services, a Geographical Information System containing data from the Palcazu and other high jungle development projects. A major project strength was its concern for appropriate development in relation to land capability.  Data gathered by aerial photography made it possible to draw up a rational land use plan, including demarcation of three protection areas:  the Yanachaga-Chemillen National Park, the San Matias Protection Forest, and the Yanesha Communal Reserve.  Despite these efforts, the project failed to discourage the construction of a highway that passes through the Palcazu Valley and jeopardizes the environmental integrity of the area by opening up to logging and random settlement land which should be devoted to watershed protection. Numerous lessons were learned.  (1) Projects of this nature must be based on reliable rainfall records covering a reasonable timespan.  (2) Project Papers must be available to host country government technicians in their own language, especially when the projects involve innovative concepts that may be easily misunderstood.  (3) Projects should stipulate proper environmental analysis prior to road building, especially when P.L. 480 funds are involved.  (4) Agreement among all participating agencies should be ensured concerning land capability evaluation criteria and their application in the field.  (5) Credit components should be preceded by a thorough logistic analysis or market study.  (6) In-depth study should be carried out before far-reaching changes in farming systems are attempted.  (7) Intensive involvement of counterpart personnel is valuable in the initial stages to ensure mutual understanding. (8) There is a need for caution in endorsing politically motivated institutional changes by newly elected governments.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","11/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural development|Land use|Plantations|Road maintenance|Protected environmental areas|Natural resource management|Jungles","Peru","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDKAR165.pdf","195 KB","008591 - USAID.

"Evaluates a multi-donor accelerated immunization project in Latin America and the Caribbean.  The Pan American Health Organization is implementing the project.  Mid-term evaluation covers period 8/86-8/89. In 1988, a provisional total of 361 confirmed cases of polio were reported in the region with 155 probable cases still pending final classification.  This provisional total represents a 61% decline from the 930 confirmed cases reported in 1986.  The impact of an intensification of surveillance activities in 1986 can be seen from the 48% increase in notification of cases of acute flaccid paralysis region-wide that occurred in 1986 compared to 1985, and the 77% increase in notification in 1988 compared to 1985.  Since surveillance was strengthened in 1986, there has been a progressive decline in the incidence of confirmed polio cases reported in the region.  It is also interesting to note that for the first time during 1988 there appeared to be a dampening or virtual disappearance of the usual seasonal pattern of polio that had existed, characterized by an increase in polio cases during weeks 10-30.  This suggests that transmission of polio has been substantially suppressed. If all subregions are combined, with Brazil and Mexico excluded, a steady increase in OPV3 (polio vaccine) coverage has occurred between 1980 and the peak in coverage in 1988.  Because of the problems that exist with the coverage data for Mexico and Brazil during 1980-84, it is reasonable to conclude that the region-wide OPV3 coverage estimate of 82% in 1988 probably represents an all- time high in OPV coverage. Region-wide coverage rates for DPT, measles, and BCG vaccines progressively increased between 1985 (when the Project Plan of Action was devised) and 1988.  Coverage rates for all of these antigens reached record high levels in 1988.  Provisionally, the estimated coverage rates for 1988 are as follows: OPV3 (82%), DPT3 (59%), measles (64%), and BCG (72%). These data suggest that the Project has influenced the improvement in coverage levels of all EPI antigens, not just with OPV, and has strengthened the overall EPI program.  Investments in  cold chain equipment and logistics as well as the surveillance and monitoring systems established nder the eradication program also support the EPI effort. However, the goal of achieving coverage levels of greater than 80% in children 0-1 for all EPI antigens is unlikely to be reached by 1990, with the exception of OPV and possibly BCG vaccine.  Following upon the improvements in delivery and monitoring infrastructure, emphasis should be placed at the country level on balancing the poliomyelitis eradication effort within the context of the EPI as a whole.  For example, poliomyelitis specific activities, such as disease surveillance, should be expanded (as envisioned in the EPI policy and strategic approaches in the Americas) to include other EPI target diseases (especially measles and neonatal tetanus).

"In 1988, approximately 21 million children were born in sub-Saharan Africa.  An estimated 4.3 million (about 20%) will die before their fifth birthdays, unless adequate health care can be provided. In 1981, A.I.D. initiated activities in 12 African countries to combat the common diseases which become fatal for children in Africa (measles, whooping cough, tetanus, diarrheal illnesses, and malaria) with the launching of the African Child Survival Initiative -- Combatting Communicable Childhood Diseases (ACSI-CCCD) project.  Another 5 countries were added in 1985.  A.I.D. activities in all 17 child survival (CS) priority countries in Africa work at three levels: (1) Immediate targeted delivery of vaccinations and oral rehydration therapy (ORT) -- it is estimated that these two simple, safe technologies alone could cut the infant and child mortality rate in half. (2) Institutionalization of short-term projects into host country health programs -- the CCCD project, for example, trains health workers to better diagnose and treat childhood diseases. (3) At the broadest level, A.I.D. continues to address the problem of poverty by supporting efforts to increase economic growth -- under the new Development Fund for Africa (DFA), there is more flexibility to address the socioeconomic factors -- poverty, illiteracy and inflation -- that contribute to under-five mortality. This report presents initial evidence of progress in reducing infant mortality rates through vaccinations, ORT, and other CS interventions. A.I.D.'s principal worldwide CS goal is to lower mortality to 75 infant deaths per 1000 live births by 1990.  It is clear that this goal will not be realized in Africa. Nevertheless, the goal remains an indicator of what the stakes are.  If the target were reached by the year 2000, it is estimated that 3.3 million children's deaths would be prevented that year alone in Africa. Kenya has already achieved the goal of 75 deaths per 1,000 live births.  Of the remaining 16 CS countries, it is expected that 6 may achieve the target by 1995: Burundi, Cote d'Ivoire, Lesotho, Senegal, Togo, and Zaire. This is good progress considering that the target presents a significant challenge to African nations.  Compared to Africa's 1980-85 rate of 118 infant deaths per 1,000 live births, Asia's rate was about 100, while Latin America and the Caribbean's was 63. Expanded immunization rates promise further gains.  Measles coverage has increased in all but two CS priority countries and has more than doubled in several cases.  Kenya, Lesotho, and Swaziland have a good chance of reaching and maintaining the Agency's immunization target of 80% coverage by 1990.  By 1995, Malawi, Senegal, Burundi, Cote d'Ivoire, and Rwanda will enter the probable category, making a total of 8 countries which could meet the 80% target by 1995. What is important to recognize, but what is not illustrated by the data on immunization target attainment, is the significant improvement in the quality of the services that is being obtained.  Data from 12 of the countries show significant changes: correct temperature storage for vaccines increased from 60% to 90% and use of a sterile needle and syringe for each injection increased from 50% to 90%.  These qualitative improvements have tremendous impact on the major objectives of CS -- reducing disease and saving lives. A.I.D.'s goal for improving CS through expanded use of ORT is for 100% of the population to have access to a trained provider of oral rehydration salts, and for 45% of diarrheal cases to be treated with ORT.  Lesotho has already achieved 100% access to ORT; ORT Units have been established in 16 of 18 hospitals (89%) and local production of ORS has doubled.  In Malawi, Swaziland and Togo, 100% of health facilities are now using ORS.  In Burundi, Cote d'Ivoire, Liberia, Rwanda, and Zaire the proportion of facilities using ORS ranges from 54% to 77%. The greatest challenge is institutionalizing such interventions. Faced with the conflict between severe budgetary pressure and the need to address basic health needs, African governments must be creative, looking at alternatives o free public health care. They must not only find ways to increase revenues, including in- creasing reliance on user fees, but also effectively reallocate revenues to services that can efficiently reduce mortality and morbidity.  To improve the survival of tomorrow's children, therefore, A.I.D. must support these efforts to improve health delivery systems as a whole as well as those interventions which reduce mortality among infants being born today.

"Evaluates a project to establish the Latin American Agribusiness Development Corporation de Centroamerica (LAAD-CA) as a vehicle for providing loans to export-oriented, nontraditional private agribusinesses in Central America.  External evaluation consists mainly of case studies of the employment and income impacts of six loans made by LAAD-CA between 1986 and 1989. Loans to four of the firms for initial, pre-production activities had a significant impact on short-term employment, creating 371-425 person-years of work for 245 individuals.  (1) The addition of infrastructure to land (e.g., irrigation systems, trellises) created more jobs than did the construction of new processing facilities; likewise, labor-intensive land clearing and cropping activities led to more jobs than did investment in equipment or imported goods. LAAD-CA investments also increased long-term, direct employment (except for one loan that provided working capital for raw materials purchases, but did not support expanded production). By the time the companies reach full production, more than 604 permanent and 374 seasonal jobs will have been added.  Women have benefitted substantially, filling 25%-75% of the new jobs.  This may be attributed to employers' preference for women workers for activities (e.g., pruning, sorting) related to quality control, because women tend to be more careful and productive than men. The principal reason for the project's success in creating jobs is that the activities assisted involved a shift in land use from low labor-intensity activities (e.g., cattle, sugar cane, or coffee) to labor-intensive activities (e.g., growing flowers and vegetables). Moreover, since these products are intended for export, large labor resources are required to maintain quality standards.  The number of jobs created was not directly related to the size of the investments, since large investments tended to involve capital-intensive construction or sophisticated equipment.  Furthermore, investments in marketing projects and loans for working capital generated relatively little direct employment. The project's overall impact on local communities was difficult to determine, but significant positive changes were observed in a few cases.  In Costa Rica, local farmers increased planting of fruits that would be purchased by a project-assisted tropical juice plant.  In Guatemala, agricultural wages have risen as the result of the development of an essential oils farm and processing plant.  And two project-financed activities in east central Guatemala have stimulated growth in small business and markets in a number of small remote towns. To maximize employment and income impacts, LAAD-CA should in future support:  (1) business start up or significant expansion rather than marginal expansion, (2) firms that combine both agricultural and processing activities, and (3) activities that bring land into production.  It should refrain, to the extent possible, from making working capital loans, especially for the purchase of agricultural raw materials.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-5315-I-10-8101-00","","4/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Employment|Agribusiness|Export promotion|Nontraditional exports|Commercial credit","Central America","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNABH066.pdf","4,220 KB","006727 - Development Alternatives, Inc.

"This impact evaluation of A.I.D.'s experience in developing rural credit projects in Cameroon concentrated on the continuing activities of the Cameroon Cooperative Credit Union League (CCCUL). The review determined that the credit union model promoted under project auspices is appropriate for Cameroon's rural development needs and presents good prospects for replication in other countries and regions. A.I.D.'s support has been timely and appropriate.  The project's impressive implementation record can be attributed in large part to the cooperating entity's strong management and to A.I.D.'s willingness to make a commitment far exceeding the traditional life of project cycle. Also contributing to the project's success has been the apparent compatibility between the credit union model and traditional Cameroonian values, institutions, and economic orientations. In providing institutional development assistance, A.I.D. has contributed to the creation of an effective financial intermediary which is bridging the gap in financial markets between rural and urban areas, and providing services complementary to those in the informal and formal sectors. The CCCUL has made an important contribution to the quality of life of its rural and market town members by:  mobilizing financial resources that might have otherwise remained outside the formal system; providing secure and interest bearing depository for mobilized savings; and financing members' production activities, health, education and housing needs, and business and consumer demands. The project has had only limited success promoting investment in agricultural technology and small enterprise development.  On the other hand, it has avoided the pitfalls of economic activities not generated by market demand. The current productive lending activities of the CCCUL and its affiliates tend to finance building activities which are a form of capital accumulation and a possible hedge against inflation. Health and education loans are an important source of demand for credit-union financed borrowing.  The continuing decline in the demand for agricultural credit may be more a function of limited technology and commodity pricing than the credit union system's ability to generate and deliver productive credit. Problems remain.  Loan delinquencies in many credit unions are at unacceptable levels.  Other unions have failed to observe credit union guidance and good commercial practices in the execution of their credit policy.  External pressures from political and economic elites to interfere with democratic policymaking within the credit unions has had a detrimental effect on certain younger institutions and those located in the French-speaking provinces. The CCCUL will be expected to improve the quality of the services its provides its affiliates while gathering new unions into itself.

"Evaluates the first year of a three-year grant to the Foundation for the Peoples of the South Pacific (FSP) to strengthen its management capacity and provide a smooth transition to a new generation of managers. FSP has done a considerable amount of valuable work during the first year of the grant.  Senior staff, in particular, display an impressive understanding of what needs to be done, and an uncommon degree of agreement on goals, strategies, and tactics to get it done.  Staff seriousness of purpose is palpable -- there is no lip-service quality to their work in changing FSP's management systems and approaches. Further, FSP has genuinely exceeded reasonable expectations in meeting the purposes of this grant. FSP has also been creative in achieving this progress. Both the strategic planning and budget/accounting workshops not only accomplished organizational management goals but also enlisted the energy, enthusiasm, and understanding of field staff.  This helped ensure that the changes are agency-wide and not limited to headquarters or to senior staff. As intended, the grant has freed FSP's founder-leaders to work on broader fundraising strategies and has allowed FSP to hire two senior staff people to professionalize the operations of the organization.  The Program Officer position proposed in the grant remains unfilled, and this position would probably benefit from more thought about its need and its potential benefit. Particular credit is due to FSP senior staff for the skill they have brought to the difficult task of balancing short- and long- term goals, needs, and priorities.  Particularly in a small agency (there are only 4 paid staff in the New York headquarters) it can be tempting to skip the often awkward, often resisted, and sometimes humdrum work of establishing credible, effective management systems.  FSP staff have avoided that error, knowing that they could not achieve the critical amalgam of program, finance, and fundraising until the basic management systems were in place.  Many of the evaluation's suggestions concern management integration, but these must be viewed with the understanding that this integration will take time. The evaluators were also impressed with how extensive the changes in FSP have been, as they are not just the generational change discussed in the grant proposal.  Equally significant to the organization and to the difficulty of the task it is undertaking is the change in the role of headquarters vis-a-vis the role of the field, and the role of field staff now vis-a-vis what it traditionally has been.  It is not a surprise that 7 of FSP's 11 paid staff have begun working since this grant was approved.

"The Kenya Agriculture Sector Loan I Project was conceived in the mid-1970s to provide Kenya with balance-of-payments support, as the country was experiencing a painful short-term deficit due to the 1973 oil shock.  The project was designed as a $13.5 million multi-objective sector loan to: (1) finance the production of wheat, maize, and selected cash crops in the 1975-76 planting seasons; and (2) test new approaches for providing smallholders comprehensive production and marketing services over the 1975-78 period. The project was plagued throughout by the serious institutional weaknesses of two of the three implementing financial institutions.  The Agricultural Finance Corporation was affected by political interference in lending decisions and by outright corruption.  It failed to collect the majority of project-financed loans, and did not develop a capacity to serve its constituency of mostly larger farmers.  The Cooperative Bank of Kenya, which was to service smallholders, was dependent on the Ministry of Agriculture for the selection of  farmers eligible for credit, and on local cooperative unions and societies for loan management and collection.  This disastrous combination also led to very low repayment rates and to a distrust of the system that continued to affect the credit and savings societies as late as 1988. By contrast, the former Kenya Farmers Association was quite successful in managing the $5.3 million of project funds that it directed to its membership of large farmers.  The institution's performance under the project is an encouraging -- but all too rare -- example of a financial institution able to maintain high operating and financial performance while dramatically increasing its lending program through access to a donor-sponsored credit fund. The economic benefits of the project were uneven.  Without doubt, the large farmers -- particularly those served by the Kenya Farmers Association -- reaped substantial benefits and were able to achieve impressive increases in agricultural production and income.  Returns from the loans extended by the Agricultural Finance Corporation were on the other hand disappointing, due to poor borrower selection and misuse of funds. The minority of smallholders who repaid their loans to the Cooperative Bank were in the most part genuinely committed to the adoption of improved agricultural practices hand-in-hand with the application of project-financed inputs.  The majority of smallholders who failed to repay their loans ended up receiving what amounted to a one-time grant from the government.  It is unclear whether this infusion of cash had a significant impact on production.  Since most of the credit was provided in kind in the form of  agricultural inputs, application of those inputs presumably led to higher yields the year they were applied.  In subsequent years, however, it is likely that most of these farmers reverted to their former practices, thereby receiving few long-term benefits from the project.  In any case, economic returns from those unpaid loans pale in comparison to the huge financial cost to the government from non-repayment and costs of managing the entire program. The project's impact on the functioning of rural financial markets was minimal, and was limited to higher income and savings levels achieved by large farmers served by the Kenya Farmers Association. Beyond project-related transactions with the Cooperative Bank, few smallholders actually participated more actively in financial transactions as a result of the project. All in all, the project appears to have in the most part succeeded in boosting short-term production of key agricultural commodities as a result of the loans extended by the Kenya Farmers Association to large farmers.  It failed to achieve its second objective, that of enhancing the socioeconomic status of smallholders through the provision of credit and other key services. The key lesson to be learned from this failure to serve smallholders is that A.I.D. should pay much closer attention to institutional capacity and performance at the time of project design.  Expectations that a financial institution will clean up its act in the process of handling large amounts of donor-sponsored funds is mere wishful thinking to be avoided at all costs.

"In June of 1988, a review team was charged with the task of assessing three aspects of Helen Keller International's (HKI's) function as it relates to matching grant funds from USAID/FVA/PVC.  Assessments were done of: (1) the HKI Headquarters' capacity to manage and support their expanding program portfolio; (2) the field program in integrated eye care/blindness prevention in the Dodoma Region of Tanzania; and (3) the field program in integrated eye care/blindness prevention in the southern provinces of Morocco. The study found substantial evidence that HKI Headquarters in New York City had, during the past 21 months, substantially upgraded its organizational structure, financial accountability, managerial systems and planning strategy.  HKI's TA capacity and expertise appears to remain intact and continues to support its role as a leader in the field of blindness prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation.  The organization maintains its avowed mission to serve as a catalyst for eye care service development and improvement through the demonstration of appropriate and innovative methods, rather than serving primarily as a deliverer of eye care services.  That posture is reflected in its field programs and its extensive involvement in the Vitamin A/nutritional blindness activities. Slippage in HKI's managerial and accountability performance during a period of rapid resource growth in the early to mid- 1980's has been substantially reversed during the past two years. The renewed stability in the organization should allow it to continue its leadership role. The most significant remaining concerns are:  (1) the implementation of a standard reporting system to gather consistent, ongoing performance data on HKI's numerous field projects and programs; and (2) the more effective inclusion of a system of incentives and rewards tied directly to the performance in the field programs. The two in-country programs observed by the review team provided an interesting contrast in sociopolitical settings.  The review team found HKI's country representatives to be highly effective agents dedicated to improvements in and development of eye care services.  In each program, HKI appeared to be demonstrating improvements that are technically appropriate. Tanzania's blindness prevention program has the potential for strong community involvement at the village level and the opportunity to train community level providers who are strongly motivated and caring.  It lacks the basic resources for supplies, facilities, and worker salaries which would be necessary to sustain an expanded capacity. Morocco's blindness prevention program is quite adequately housed, staffed, and supplied.  While it could effectively utilize more and better equipment, there is a need to change the orientation from curative services provided by highly trained physicians to preventative and curative services provided in rural settings by well-trained nurses. Recommendations have been made that might benefit both programs given their very different sociopolitical environments.

"Final evaluation of a Partnership Grant to Save the Children Federation (SCF) to create community skills centers to teach community groups to undertake projects in food production, small- scale enterprises, and community improvements. The evaluation focuses on activities in Costa Rica, Burkina Faso, and Tunisia, and covers the period 1986-7/90. SCF made numerous accomplishments, and its skills transfer strategy is appropriate and having an impact on beneficiaries. In the three focus countries, the project provided technical training to 6,500 participants and field office staff and conducted 58 workshops on training of trainers, field management, and community development. The community centers established by SCF carried out 230 projects in economic development, food production, and community improvements. SCF also significantly upgraded its field office systems for program planning, monitoring, and evaluation and expanded its home office TA capabilities and grant management procedures. Overall, more than 120 TA visits were carried out. SCF exercised adequate budget control and made a real effort to comply with the terms of the cooperative agreement. The project's most serious problems were encountered in Costa Rica, where the field office went for 3 years without firm direction, including a 10-month period without a director; this proved particularly troublesome when the food production activity did not proceed as planned and had to be redesigned. In addition, the housing program found itself in direct competition with a government-sponsored program which offered more attractive borrowing terms, and the field office was forced to redesign its agricultural strategy in response to government policy changes resulting from the Caribbean Basin Initiative. The project shows that SCF's program philosophy is concordant with that of A.I.D., which in this project invested its money in the best interests of the U.S. Government. At the same time, the evaluation notes several lessons in regard to management, primary country selection, program sustainability, program design and implementation, and skills transfer strategies which SCF should incorporate into its overall program as well as into future proposals to A.I.D.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","OTR-0250-C-00-7237-00","","1/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Technical training|Community development|Training centers|Community centers|Credit|Partnerships","Tunisia|Costa Rica|Burkina Faso","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABC304.pdf","3,998 KB","002892 - Automation Research Systems, Ltd.","","000088 - USAID.

"Ex post evaluation of a project (1980-86) to improve the capability of the Lesotho Cooperative Credit Union League (LCCUL) to provide financial and technical services to its member credit unions. After 1983, the broad goal of providing LCCUL member unions and their small farmer constituents with improved financial services was replaced with the more limited goal of improving their access to production credit and thereby improving agricultural production practices.  The increase in credit availability did not, however, have a great impact on agricultural production practices and in fact contributed to a decline in LCCUL's self- sufficiency, since most of the small farmer borrowers defaulted on their loans.  Neither did the project has a substantial effect on either income distribution or employment opportunities.  While training programs and other efforts were undertaken to improve LCCUL's administrative procedures, these were not sufficient to overcome the project's problems, and the rate of return to USAID/L's investment in the project is likely to be negative. Project planners wrongly assumed that capital constraints were the largest barrier to increasing agricultural production in the region and then created a program to meet that non-existing need. In the process, the credit union movement, whose most valuable service actually lay in providing savings rather than credit services, far from expanding, ceased to be a grassroots movement. The same misconception affected the $26 million Agricultural Production and Institutional Support Project (6320221), begun in 1986, which included a component to use LCCUL to channel production credit to small farmers. The project teaches that efforts to increase the amount of credit available to small farmers should not be linked with efforts to upgrade rural financial institutions.  Provide the credit through the project directly to the ultimate borrowers or set up a project-based entity, but do not put the savings of poor rural producers at risk by channeling massive amounts of external funds through their institutions.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-5315-I-05-8101-00","","2/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Financial institutions|Credit unions|Institution building|Agricultural production credit|Loan administration|Small farms","Lesotho","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABC297.pdf","1,763 KB","006727 - Development Alternatives, Inc.

"Interim evaluation of a project to provide TA to private cooperative insurers in selected Latin American and Caribbean countries.  The League Insurance Companies (LIC), in conjunction with other U.S. insurers, is implementing the project.  The evaluation covers the period 8/86-12/89 and focuses on assistance to insurers in Guatemala (FENACOAC), Honduras (FACACH), and Jamaica (NUCS-CIS). While activities in the three areas of project assistance (TA, technical studies, and technical seminars/training) have generally been useful, achievements in the project's four benefit areas have varied widely.  (1) The one benefit that can be clearly identified in all target groups is the generation of surplus funds.  These have been used to further cooperative development -- except in the case of FACACH, which used the funds to cover losses in other departments, resulting in the placing of project activities in Honduras on hold.  (2) Although some cooperative assets and activities are being protected with insurance in all countries, the main beneficiaries in many countries are credit unions and their members.  Also, while various types of life insurance are offered in all countries, the same is not true of other types of insurance, e.g., property insurance.  (3) Though data on the goal of expanding cooperative insurance to low-income persons are scarce, cooperative insurers, according to government regulators, are meeting a real need, since the cooperative market is of little interest to large commercial insurers.  (4) Some institutional development has occurred, as evident in the graduation of various organizations from the project and the progressive movement of others towards the eventual establishment of an insurance cooperative or company, as opposed to remaining a non-risk bearing agency or a risk bearing department of a federation.  Such progress has been slower than expected in Guatemala and Honduras. The quality of the original project documents (e.g., the proposal, the grant agreement) has not been maintained.  In addition, LIC has not implemented effective monitoring and planning, developed specific workplans in cooperation with beneficiary organizations, or reported on activities in a systematic manner (only the 1987 report provides monitoring data).  Neither A.I.D. nor the National Cooperative Business Association, the prime grantee, have provided sufficient guidance to LIC.  A.I.D. has continued to extend the project despite its slow pace and despite the absence of a mid-term evaluation. Overall, a higher intensity of assistance could have resulted in greater impact.  On the positive side, the project's strength and the validity of A.I.D.'s contribution lies in the project's ability to mobilize a variety of resources -- from assistance from Japan and Singapore for the Philippines, to reinsurance for Bolivia, to loans for Peru and Ecuador.  Argentinean insurers have been used for training events and technical studies, and the three project graduates -- Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru -- have hosted observation/training events.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","OTR-0250-C-00-7237-00","","12/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Insurance industry|Cooperatives|Credit unions","Jamaica|Guatemala|Honduras","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABC305.pdf","1,820 KB","002892 - Automation Research Systems, Ltd.","","000088 - USAID.

"The goal of the Lofa County Agricultural Development Project (LCADP) was to increase agricultural production and productivity, especially for small farmers.  Project Phases I and II were implemented between 1976 and 1987.  The Government of Liberia has been progressively retiring or absorbing the project infrastructure and staff since 6/87, and the Ministry of Agriculture was to have finished this process by the end of 1988. LCADP has had a profound impact on small farmers in Upper Lofa. Over 10,000 farmers and their households benefitted from improvements in rural infrastructure and agricultural inputs. Smallholder acreage of cocoa and coffee has increased dramatically, and improved varieties of upland and swamp rice are now widely used.  LCADP built many roads, offered health services, and improved village water  supplies with hundreds of wells. The project focused on promoting new farming techniques and service delivery to the rural communities.  The Project Management Unit -- created as an institution separate from the weak Ministry of Agriculture -- should have ultimately transferred services delivery and extension work to the regional cooperatives, but this approach was based on a false assessment of these cooperatives. The cooperatives have failed to become independent multi-functional institutions.  The size and basis for recruitment (farmers were compelled to join to receive LCADP technical inputs) robbed even pre-existing community associations of any genuine popular participation.  The project also failed to furnish the training and guidance needed to generate viable institutions.  The centralized, hierarchical administrative structure of the cooperatives did not correspond to local social organizations, patterns of authority, and small farmer interests and aspirations.  The cooperatives failed even in their most basic role of marketing their members' coffee and cocoa, although the blame is not entirely theirs. The credit component of LCADP was not central to design or implementation.  The project delivered farming inputs and associated credit based on targets, not on assessments of credit risks and likely recovery.  Farmer loan repayment was intended to create a revolving fund to sustain future cooperative lending. However, LCADP never established the management systems necessary to follow the loan portfolio properly. The low recovery rate of only 0.5 percent on the long-term ""development"" loans illustrates the failure of the credit component. External factors compounded the impact of the original weaknesses in project formulation and execution.  Negative national economic growth, sharp declines in world prices for cocoa and coffee, periodic illiquidity of institutions key to farmers (such as the Agricultural and Cooperative Development Bank and the Liberian Produce Marketing Corporation), and other factors all contributed to the failure of the credit component as well. The evaluation's major findings are as follows:  (1) The model of an area development project strengthening and developing existing cooperatives to assume the lead in agricultural development and farmer credit failed.  (2) Based on repayment rates, small-farmer lending by the LCADP Project Management Unit did not work.  (3) The model of an agricultural development project building up a sustainable revolving credit fund for meeting future small-farmer credit needs failed.  The LCADP fund proved difficult to manage as intended, and, in any case, probably represented an overestimation of the need for externally supplied credit.  (4) The model of tying credit to particular input packages failed in the sense that it did not assure precise adoption of recommended practices, nor render credit an infungible farming input. (5) Tying credit to a limited number of cropping packages failed to capitalize on other productive opportunities, especially for women.  (6) The external economic and political environment is extremely important to the functioning of rural credit projects.  (7) Since it lent without great regard to orthodox creditworthiness criteria, such as preexisting collateral, the LCADP was able to reach poorer farmers with its loans. (8) There are a variety of formal and informal deposit-taking and lending institutions in Upper Lofa County that are widely used by small farmers. The lessons learned based on the above are:  (1) Developing true farmer-serving, multifunctional cooperatives is difficult.  At least initially, farmer associations should be small community groups based on local participation and leadership.  Such groups should be analyzed to determine their capacity to serve as the basis for effective, new organizations such as marketing groups or credit unions -- before attempts are made to establish these larger, more complex entities.  (2) Small-farmer lending by multifunctional cooperatives may conflict with their other roles, such as marketing and TA and may be misunderstood by farmers.  Wiser is spinning off by farmer cooperatives, or separate establishment, of fully bank-like, deposit-taking credit cooperatives. (3) Giving a marketing cooperative a monopoly over procurement from its members disinclines it to serve its members as well as possible.  The Liberia findings suggest that free wholesale-market competition is a necessary spur to insuring that cooperatives exercise their inherent size and ownership advantages to serve all their members well, not just a dominant few. (4) Small-farmer lending by agricultural development project management units, or any other entity that is not a true financial institution, should be avoided.  The Liberia case confirms the view that farmer-borrowers at least partly condition repayment on their desire for access to future credit from, and stake in (i.e., deposits), the lending institution.  (5) Donors should think twice about undertaking major agricultural development projects where dealing with a monopoly-holding marketing parastatal cannot be avoided.  In the past decade, Liberia's coffee and cocoa parastatal has served Lofa County farmers poorly, ultimately nullifying many of the project's gains.  (6) Revolving credit funds of specially earmarked funds to service a region's future agricultural borrowing needs are unlikely to work -- particularly when the monies must flow through a number of hands -- and are best avoided. (7) Tying credit to particular input packages is unnecessary.  The Liberia study confirmed findings elsewhere that this approach does not ensure precise adoption of recommended practices, nor render production credit infungible.  Institutional credit for inputs is better given in cash.

"Mid-term evaluation of a grant to the University of the West Indies (UWI) to strengthen legal systems in the Eastern Caribbean and Belize. External evaluation covers the period 8/86-7/89. Despite the accomplishments noted below, the project has tried to do too many things with limited resources and implementation capability; it is substantially behind schedule and activities in some countries may not be completed by the PACD.  Delays can be attributed largely to the novelty of this type of project, the inexperience of UWI and A.I.D. in implementing justice sector projects, UWI inexperience in managing construction activities, and inexperience of the national justice systems in dealing with foreign donors. Specific findings are as follows.  (1) Project approvals and disbursements have been delayed, especially with respect to construction.  (2) The development of centralized law libraries has been delayed by lack of space (except in Antigua) and by the failure to enact statutes governing library management and use, and to train paraprofessional law librarians.  (3) There is considerable variation among the participating countries in the law revision component. Dominica has nearly completed the revision stage, while St. Lucia and St. Kitts have yet to identify a source of TA funding.  (4) In the court registries component, several computers have been delivered without accompanying software or necessary training, and registries are cramped for space due to inadequate disposal practices.  (5) No legal aid facilities have been established, with the exception of programs established under other auspices in Belize, St. Lucia, and Grenada.  (6) Significant advances have been made in training paralegals, with heavily subsidized programs in place.  However, progress in Dominica has been constrained due to the perception that paralegals would take clients away from professionals.  (7) TA to beneficiary countries has been commendable, especially in evaluating and identifying law library needs and conducting various training programs for judicial and court personnel. (8) Very few countries have complied with policy reform requirements.  For example, very few have established law reform committees or management and materials security regimes for libraries, made attempts to enlarge appropriations for the justice sector, or tried to improve terms of employment for court officials.

"Changes in the amount of household income as well as in the form, timing, and flow of income are important in measuring the effectiveness of agricultural interventions.  Household income is difficult to assess, however, due to problems in selecting an appropriate reference period, the possibility of severe income fluctuations in the short term, and, in some settings, the reluctance of people to discuss their income.  This report examines selected income indicators, including wealth and asset ownership, in kind and cash income, home labor and its monetary value, expenditures, consumption, and quality of life indicators (i.e., nutritional status and infant and child mortality). Various data sources for measuring income are then described, including secondary data, administrative records, project records, and primary data for evaluation purposes.  According to the report, a reliable evaluation is likely to require primary data collection, since secondary sources are unlikely to provide the necessary level of detail.  The final section of the report summarizes onsite data collection methods, including direct observation, focus groups, key informant interviews, and small- scale surveys.  The report recommends frequent, small-scale evaluations to generate data for use in program modification. Appended is a lengthy excerpt from a questionnaire from a food consumption survey conduucted in the Dominican Republic which exemplifies different approaches to estimating household income.","Related document: PN-ABB-191|Indicators for Measuring Change in Income, Food Availability and|Consumption, and the Natural Resource Base (20-22 Jun 1988 :|Arlington, VA, US)","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","10/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Income level|Income|Development program evaluation","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNABC902.pdf","44 KB","003433 - USAID.

"External evaluation of a 4-year Interactive Radio Education Project in mathematics which began operational activities in Bolivia in January 1988, a 1987 pilot project in mathematics which preceded it, and a health pilot which was added in January 1989.  The project is being implemented by Fe y Alegria, a Jesuit-run PVO, with TA from the Education Development Center (EDC). The project is broadcasting on a daily basis to an estimated 36O second-grade and 236 third-grade classes with an enrollment of approximately 20,000 in the Departments of Cochabamba, Santa Cruz, the Beni, Sucre, and Tarija.  Children in grades 4 and 5 receive lessons in the health pilot.  The schools receiving the broadcasts are a mix of public schools administered by Fe y Alegria and schools administered directly by the Ministry of Education. The plan is to produce lessons for one additional grade each year until 1991, when it is expected that lessons will have been developed and validated for grades 2-5.  Thus far, only second-graders have been tested in both experimental and control groups. Effect size was used as a measure of the comparative achievement between control and experimental groups.  For the first year of the project, an effect size of .909 was obtained in the second-grade, year-end evaluation, which indicates a gain significantly higher than in studies in other countries of the effect of radio, textbook provision, and teacher training.  For example, the effect size for second-grade mathematics in a similar project in Nicaragua, from which the Bolivian lessons were adapted, was only .55.  An effect size of .909 would mean that where the average control-group student would rank at the 50th percentile, the average radio student would rank at about the 81st percentile, a gain of 31 percentile points. The ten lessons which have been developed in the health pilot concentrate on diarrhea and dehydration, the largest cause of infant death in Bolivia, as well as on hygiene, clean water, and nutrition. Although the post-test results are not yet available, based on field observations a substantial gain in health knowledge is expected. Both the project and the evaluations conducted within it have been well designed and carried out.  Throughout the project, problems have been addressed as they occurred, and there has been very little slippage in the production schedule.  The intensive TA from EDC, which has had extensive experience with similar projects in other countries, appears basic to the development of quality lessons. The active transfer of technology, essential for sustainability, is apparent in talking with staff from the implementing organization.  Many Fe y Alegria staff members are thoroughly familiar with the project and evaluation design and are learning day-to-day operations such as the SYSTAT Program used for data analysis.  There are also many mechanisms for cost recovery which could be explored to increase sustainability of the project. Fe y Alegria staff have taken the lead in expanding the project, although they could probably do more to expand outside of Fe y Alegria administered schools.  Still, they are well on  their way toward the significant, A.I.D.-established goal of 25% coverage of enrolled children and appear to be strong enough to eventually administer the project on their own after TA has been phased out. As post-production implementation costs are only a small fraction of production costs, a reduction in A.I.D. funding should not have a significant impact on implementation at grades 2 or 3 or on the student achievement currently being realized at these grade levels.  It would, however, have an impact upon expansion and the production of lessons for grades 4 and 5. A weak point, which may need to be addressed with further TA of a more specific nature, is financial management of the project. Recommendations address specific mechanisms for cost recovery, expansion efforts, and opportunities for collaboration with other projects.

"Interim evaluation of a program component to provide credit to Malian private traders and village cooperatives for grain purchase and storage. The evaluation covers the period through 1989. As the result of the credit program, more traders have stored more grain, for longer periods, than would have happened without the loan money.  However, the final consequences of this massive storage are not yet known.  The component falsely assumed that seasonal grain shortages would cause consumer grain prices to rise enough, within the year, to cover added storage costs. Since the drought years, however, this has not always been the case, making long-term grain storage extremely risky and unwise for private traders. The component also aimed to raise producer prices by generating competition between traders who had received loans for storage and those who were buying grain for retail sale.  The credit program did have this effect, but the extra demand may have been too high, since it made the original purchase grain price so high that the traders could not sell it back to the market without losing money.  Thus, hundreds of traders are holding grain in store, waiting to see if it will turn into a profit or a loss. Judging the proper level of liquidity is especially difficult in the closed Malian market.  An export program would allow more flexibility into the equation because it would provide an additional outlet for a surplus crop, protecting local price integrity. The program faces a serious dilemma.  If the current program loans are nearly all renewed for one year, few funds will be available for new loans in 1990.  On the other hand, if the loans are not renewed, this would force traders to take losses by selling off their grain, and few would apply for loans next year. There are no signs that loan recipients perceive the loans to be a government handout that would not need to be repaid.  Banks appear to consider the loans to be non-recourse loans, which would allow the bank to seize the borrower's collateral but take no further action.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-5315-I-22-8101-00","","9/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Credit|Agricultural storage facilities|Loan administration","Mali","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABC709.pdf","999 KB","006727 - Development Alternatives, Inc.

"Final evaluation of a 1987-90 project to develop the institutional capability of World Vision Relief and Development (WVRD) to plan, implement, and manage water development programs in Senegal, Ghana, Kenya, and Malawi. WVRD has made positive progress in establishing sustainable rural water systems integrated with health education and sanitation, and over the life of the project has improved water supplies for about 400,000 persons, one-third more than expected, at a cost of about $40 per beneficiary (including administrative costs).  The project also earns high marks for sustainability:  it has had some success in redirecting what was essentially a drilling project in Ghana, added an extension and training component to the program in Senegal, helped reshape the Maasai Water Project as the Maasai People's Project in Kenya, and initiated significant activities in Malawi. Institutional objectives were only partially achieved, however, as follows.  (1) A competent, experienced staff is in place to manage and provide oversight for large projects, but their efforts are not well coordinated.  (2) Country programs of technology transfer, training, and TA for field staff are sound, but a planned comprehensive program has not materialized.  (3) Plans to strengthen the regional technical team's capabilities and establish small technical resource units within country field offices have been fairly successful.  (4) Practices for procuring materials, equipment, and TA for water projects are effective, but some projects' needs have been overlooked.  (5) Plans to develop a regionally based technical information and documentation center were abandoned. WVRD's performance in activity areas specified in the project proposals were also rated by the evaluators.  Rated good to excellent were efforts to:  use experienced technical consultants in project design/redesign, recruit experienced managers for project implementation, devise program strategies to rehabilitate non-functioning projects and maintain equipment, and devise community mobilization strategies.  Rated good or at least fair were efforts to develop a comprehensive corporate water development strategy; establish coherent linkages between headquarters, regional, and country programs; develop a fundraising and resource mobilization strategy; and hire experienced technical staff for project implementation. Rated poor or poor to fair were efforts to develop specialized training programs for regional, field office, and project staff; devise a financial management and project reporting system; and institute a monitoring and evaluation system for WVRD projects. Despite its failure to achieve many activities specified in its proposal, WVRD has made great strides in moving from a relief to a development mode of operation and has accomplished many worthwhile things in the communities in which it has worked.  Its main problem is its own organizational structure, but senior management is aware of this and attempting to address it; an external consultant might prove helpful in this regard.  For there is a definite role for WVRD to play in the development community and it should be encouraged to continue its growth in development work.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","OTR-0250-C-00-7237-00","","1/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Rural development|Water supply structures|Private voluntary organizations|Institution building|Beneficiary count","Africa|Senegal|Ghana|Malawi|Kenya","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABC831.pdf","6,996 KB","002892 - Automation Research Systems, Ltd.","","000088 - USAID.

"Evaluates joint ventures funded under the Program for Advancement of Commercial Technology (PACT) project to promote investment in commercial R&D in India.  Interim evaluation covers the period 8/85-9/89. As of 9/20/89, the project had approved 18 joint ventures and two feasibility studies.  Though most were running at least 6 months behind schedule, the joint ventures were well selected, involving companies that appear productive, committed to commercial technology development, and well managed.  Eight joint ventures were reviewed in depth, representing four distinct models of technical collaboration between Indian and U.S. companies ranging from nearly equal involvement of U.S. and Indian companies to relatively limited and specific assistance by a U.S. company. Most of the projects seemed sound in terms of business plans and technical progress.  Some had reached the point of test marketing products resulting from project-sponsored R&D, and several were seeking buyers for their products. However, several of the joint ventures were having significant difficulties in attaining commercialization, due to disputes over intellectual property transfer arrangements, problems in obtaining contracts or approval from buyers, production difficulties, poor communication between partners, difficulties in obtaining research equipment and supplies, etc.  It is estimated that 25% of the projects will end without successful commercialization.  At this point, no joint venture has sold a product developed under a PACT grant, although several are ready to begin marketing a product.  It is therefore too early to determine the profitability of any of the joint ventures, or what the rate of payback to the PACT fund will be. The joint ventures have also given both U.S. and Indian companies chances to explore business opportunities, establish contacts, and acquire expertise they probably would not otherwise have had; there is also no doubt that PACT has increased the business activity of U.S. firms in India.  The profitability of these and other such ventures will no doubt be an important factor determining the future of commercially oriented R&D in India.","Project title: Program for the advancement of commercial technology|(PACT)","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","12/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Industrial research|Joint ventures|Research grants|Product development|Industrial credit|Industrial technology|Marketing|Intellectual property","India","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABC861.pdf","1,664 KB","003970 - Management Systems International, Inc.

"Evaluates a project to upgrade the rural health system in Mauritania by (1) developing expanded and integrated community- based primary health care (PHC) systems in the Trarza, Guidimaka, and Assaba regions and (2) improving the effectiveness of the national Expanded Program of Immunization (EPI).  Interim evaluation covers the period 1987-4/89. Progress toward project objectives has been satisfactory considering the scarcity of economic and human resources, the difficult geography, and the management problems encountered. The PHC approach has been demonstrated to be both feasible and technically acceptable to the Ministry of Health and Social Affairs at all levels and popular with both the people and government officials. Specific findings are as follows.  (1) PHC services, which are delivered by community health worker (CHW) teams furnished with medical kits replenished through funds raised by village health committees or the sale of medicines, have been significantly expanded in Trarza and Guidimaka and will be operating in Assaba before the project's end, by which time more than 200 villages in the three regions will have PHC services.  (2) Supervision, though well planned, lacks complete execution due to failure of transport.  As the Bamako Initiative is adopted, a simpler and less expensive scheme of supervision may be developed.  (3) A uniform national PHC curriculum has been developed and published in individual manuals for training CHW's, traditional birth attendants, village health committees, supervisors, and trainers. Retraining programs have been developed for lower level health staff. Training is generally going as planned, but there is a continuing need for more training, retraining, and external training.  (4) The data base and information system remains incomplete, and collection of demographic and epidemiological baseline data has been only superficial.  The Health Information System is still too incomplete to provide reliable overall data. The EPI information system is much more developed and should provide more reliable data.  (5) The PHC program has been hampered by inadequate TA, in particular by the hiatus which occurred when the Chief of Party was permitted to assume the role of counselor to the Minister of Health.  (6) Cost recovery is essential to the PHC program, which in its present form is not sustainable without continued donor support. Although some studies of pharmaceutical marketing have been conducted, more intensive research is needed to test recommendations made in this regard by the evaluation team.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-1406-I-11-7152-00","","4/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Primary health care|Community health care|Immunizations|Mobile health services|Health committees","Mauritania","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABC871.pdf","3,657 KB","000981 - Pragma Corp.","","008576 - USAID.

"Interim evaluation of A.I.D./Peace Corps program to support small, grassroots development projects in the areas of agriculture, rural development, nutrition, or health.  The evaluation covers the period 1983-88 and is based on data from projects in the African, Inter-American, North African, Near East, Asian, and Pacific regions. The program is meeting its objective of promoting grassroots development.  Projects have met an average of about 75% of their objectives and obtained an 85% sustainability rate.  Specific findings about success are as follows.  (1) Projects have been most successful when they have incorporated community members in project planning and management; projects in which Peace Corps volunteers act alone have been unsuccessful.  (2) Projects that have focused on capital equipment or construction have been more successful than those involving institution building or capacity building and skills transfer.  (3) Projects requiring recurrent costs had lower success rates than those without such costs.  (4) Success was generally independent of technological complexity. Peace Corps/A.I.D. collaboration in the program has generally been good.  However, administrative difficulties have occurred at the country level concerning the movement of funds and accounting systems and procedures.  Not all country agreements fully detail the mechanisms for the disbursement to and replenishment of program funds, and for the disbursement to and accounting for individual projects.  At times, this has resulted in a slowdown or temporary halt to the replenishment of program funds. Funds for individual project have usually been disbursed in a timely manner, but delivery of the funds is sometimes delayed. Additional constraints to project funding are timeframe and cost. For example, a common restriction at the country level is that projects may not be undertaken by PCV's until they have been working at their jobs for a certain period of time (e.g., 6 months), or immediately prior to their close of service date. Projects are limited to a maximum of $10,000, but many receive only $1,000 or less.  In FY87, for example, the mean funding level was $2,057.  However, program funds are often supplemented by community funds and in-kind contributions, and generally represent less than 50% of total project costs. The program's effect on the perception of the Peace Corps by host country government agencies has been largely positive.  The Peace Corps is generally viewed as a development agency (as opposed to a donor agency) and as a source of community support complementary to local government agencies.","Contract no.

"Evaluates a project to strengthen the Sri Lankan Department of Agriculture's (DOA) capacity to develop and transfer to small farmers the improved technologies and inputs needed to produce subsidiary food crops (SFC's -- coarse grains, oilseeds, pulses). Interim evaluation covers the period 10/87-5/89. Results have been mixed.  The scope and quality of the activities undertaken to support and strengthen the DOA has been impressive. Despite the weak economic situation, the capabilities of the principal actors in the DOA have been improved considerably. Long-term training is proceeding satisfactorily despite serious earlier problems in split degree programming and management between DOA and the University of Peradeniya's Post Graduate Institute for Agriculture.  Short-term training, workshops, and seminars have been effective in supporting project objectives. Good progress has been achieved in the seed production, processing, and distribution component, and a momentum for commercialization has been established.  Social and economic research studies are underway and have had a significant impact; no whole-farm studies have been conducted, however.  Agronomic and SFC research has been extensive, though little farming systems research has been conducted. Also, on the positive side, DOA workplans have become an effective instrument for project management, and revitalization of the Regional Technical Working Group has greatly strengthened collaboration between research and extension, and helped improve the programming of both. Both the TA contractor, Development Alternatives, Inc., and the training contractor, Institute of International Education, have provided innovative and effective assistance. Achievements have been less than expected in certain areas. Procedures of the Government of Sri Lanka's (GOSL) Tender Board have slowed procurement and construction elements, and civil disturbances have caused construction targets to be reduced from 7 regional research centers (RRC's) and 5 seed farm/processing centers (SF/PC's) to 5 RRC's and 4 SF/PC's).  Also, the new crop varieties developed under the project have not been released, and research results and manuals have been written but not packaged for extension.  These problems have largely stemmed from unfulfilled assumptions concerning (1) GOSL capability for timely financial and personnel support, (2) collaboration between DOA divisions, and (3) the DOA's ability to effectively organize and program the shift to SFC.  Political instability has been a deterrent in several aspects. In sum, the project has been successfully launched, and investments made so far are on the threshold of yielding significant returns.  Given the project's unrealistically short time-frame, a 2-year extension is considered critical. Two lessons were learned.

"Final evaluation of an 8/77-10/89 project to promote decentralized government in Indonesia by improving the capacity of provincial governments and agencies in Indonesia to plan and implement rural development subprojects (SP's). The project's TA, training, and commodity inputs succeeded in increasing the capacities of the BANGDA (Directorate General of Regional Development), BAPPEDA's (Regional Development Planning Boards), and service agencies for regional development. Moreover, the entire planning implementation system was energized and employed successfully in a set of experimental SP's designed to reach the low income populations in the 8 participating provinces.  Implementation has been flexible, pragmatic, and responsive; the project has adapted to different sociocultural environments, various administrative arrangements, and diverse general approaches in the 44 districts in which it was introduced. Initially, the project concentrated on operating a vast array of SP's.  However, it became apparent that the individual SP's were not being conducted within a coherent development framework; early results in terms of central and local development goals were neither focused nor systematic.  Thus, the project's priorities were shifted -- not changed -- early in the 10-year period from direct SP's to the introduction of planning and implementing systems and the development of institutional capability. The touchstone of the project became the evolution of a comprehensive and very successful provincial planning and implementing system that incorporated various analytical and evaluative steps. Many of the project's local successes were readily transferred to other regions and districts.  For example, a credit program based in Central Java was adopted in all of the project provinces; in fact, the favorable outcome of this activity led to additional support for the credit agencies under a new USAID-sponsored project, the Financial Institutions Development project (4970341).  A striking feature of the project was the large number of persons who benefitted directly, including not only the participants from governmental agencies who received formal and informal training, but the tens of thousands of villagers who were reached through innovative subprojects ranging from skills training in ceramics and tile production to the provision of special credit programs for small market vendors and entrepreneurs. To sustain and build on the project's success, future efforts should focus on:  (1) promoting decentralization to even lower levels of government (subdistrict, village); (2) mobilizing local financing; (3) encouraging participation in development activities by PVO's and village planning boards; (4) providing training to service agency and subdistrict-level personnel; and (5) improving provincial and lower level management systems.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","PDC-0085-I-00-6095-30","","11/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Government departments|Decentralization|Rural development|Provinces|Development planning|Public administration|Institution building|Beneficiary count","Indonesia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABC993.pdf","2,783 KB","006434 - Devres, Inc.","","008558 - USAID.

"Evaluates Phase II of a project in Cameroon to strengthen the capacity of the Institute of Agronomic Research (IRA) to conduct research on maize, rice, sorghum, and millet and extend research results to farmers.  Mid-term evaluation covers the period 10/84- 7/89. Applied research has achieved a number of successes.  Breeding programs have developed and released varieties of rice, lowland upland maize, and sorghum which are 30-40% higher in yield, moderately more disease resistant, and somewhat better in grain quality than former varieties.  Agronomy programs have promoted the use of minimum and no tillage farming methods on fragile soils in the North province resulting in significant reduction in soil erosion, and the use of ""Marshal"" as a seed treatment for maize and sorghum, resulting in increased seedling establishment and yields.  Some criticisms of research efforts include: soil testing services are inefficient, due mainly to a lack of trained IRA scientists; the use of leguminous materials for fertilization has not been adequately demonstrated; agronomy programs have neglected weed control; and the rice growing program has concentrated resources in the Mbo plain instead of more important rice-growing areas in the Northern part of the country. The Testing and Liaison Units (TLU's) have been favorably accepted by their clientele and by commodity programs, extension agencies, development agencies and others as an integral part of the research system.  They have conducted diagnostic surveys to characterize the agricultural systems in their zones, and the TLU ""mini-kit"" technique has proven to be an effective tool in the transfer of IRA technologies to farmers.  Linkages established between project researchers and other development and extension agencies are contributing to the technology development and transfer process. In the long-term academic training program, 2 participants have completed M.Sc. degrees, while 9 others are pursuing M.Sc. or Ph.D. degrees, and another 5 candidates have been selected. However, the participants have encountered great difficulty in meeting the schedules laid out for them, and they have questioned the value of some of the training, especially as it relates to their career advancement.  A total of 18 participants have received short-term training at international agricultural research centers, and in-service courses have been conducted in field research techniques, intensive maize production, surveys, and computers. In general, the project has successfully built on the foundations of the Phase I effort (1979-85), making major progress towards creating a capacity to identify and develop food-production technologies adapted to farmers' needs.  Efforts are needed, however, to ensure that adoption of the higher-yielding varieties developed under the project do not significantly increase soil erosion and nutrient loss.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","7/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural research|Agricultural extension|Varietal research|Crop yield|Agronomy|Agricultural education|Participants|Research organizations|Institution building|Beneficiary count","Cameroon","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABD149.pdf","3,454 KB","006727 - Development Alternatives, Inc.

"Final evaluation of a 1983-89 project to strengthen the institutional capabilities of Sudan's National Energy Administration (NEA) and National Electricity Corporation (NEC) while increasing the short-term reliability of the latter's Blue Nile Grid (BNG) system. The project was a relative success.  The NEA's capability to conduct energy analyses in a wide range of areas has been considerably improved. The inadequate attention to skills transfer (especially in the areas of financial and economic analysis) identified in the mid-term evaluation appears to have been satisfactorily corrected by increased emphasis on short-term and on-the-job training, as well as by M.S. training for nearly all NEA section or division heads through the Conventional Energy Training Program (CETP).  Mathematical modeling tools provided by the project are being productively used except for the comprehensive integrated energy planning accounting system (RES- SUDAN), which NEA staff need but do not feel knowledgeable enough to use.  Some of the NEA's current activities include work on an updated national energy plan, evaluations of renewable energy options such as gasification and briquetting, and publication of The Sudan Energy News.  NEA is also increasing its involvement with other donor organizations. Efforts at the NEC focused on upgrading its computer center as the centerpiece for the reform of its financial system; these efforts were very successful.  The computerized billing system, which has been operating for the past 1-2 years, has shown substantial payoffs; by FY 1987-88, NEC revenues were more than 3 times the level of FY 1984-1985. Other major accomplishments include the provision of substantial amounts of formal long- and short-term training to NEC technicians, and development of a small but capable core group within middle and upper technical management.  BNG system reliability (i.e., levels of electrical shortages, outages, system failures, etc.), while greatly improved, was highly uneven and remains vulnerable to social and political turmoil. While the higher goals of institution building are fundamentally sound and have been substantially met, many of the project's near-term goals were unrealistically ambitious given the developmental challenges represented by the NEA and NEC and Sudan's economic and social instability.  Of the near term goals -- higher GNP in energy sensitive sectors, more efficient energy use, a capability to provide advice on optimal energy policies (NEA), improved organization and management structure, and a 60% improvement in revenue collection (NEC), only the last was fully achieved (and was in fact substantially exceeded). Furthermore, institutional goals such as promoting NEA as the central policy player in the energy sector invoke considerable resistance from entrenched interests, though this should not overshadow the importance of developing stronger energy sector institutions in the Sudan. A major lesson learned is that except under the most favorable circumstances, even long and expensive projects cannot entirely build a counterpart organization.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","6/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Energy planning|Energy policy|Policy analysis|Electric utilities|Institution building|Personnel development|Management development|Government departments","Sudan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDBCA321.pdf","2,197 KB","","","008607 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (1983-1988) to establish a herder organizational structure in Niger and to increase the capacity of the Government of Niger (GON) to provide services to herders. In response to the 1984 drought, the project was redesigned to focus on building up the policy analysis capacity of the Ministry of Animal Resources/Hydrology (MAR/H).  The project also continued to develop a nationwide market information collection system, a thermostable vaccine against rinderpest, and a pastoral zone early warning system.  All other activities were eliminated; this included efforts to organize new herder groups, although the project did maintain contact with the groups previously established and produced a study on their organization. The project completed the four planned studies related to livestock and grain marketing, and the marketing information system is installed in all seven department of the country. Training was provided to 110 technicians in computer use and market monitoring. The thermostable vaccine against rinderpest is being field-tested and is produced locally by the GON's veterinary laboratory.  As a result of project activities, the laboratory has a strong diagnostic capacity. The project also trained a total of 55 veterinary auxiliaries and 20 livestock service field staff, although these agents have been handicapped by transportation constraints.  Only one of the five proposed mobile vaccination parks was realized, due to budgetary constraints and delivery problems. The pastoral early warning system has been expanded from 3 to 6 departments.  Two technicians were trained in the United States for satellite data analysis and 32 in Niger for ground truthing. Several lessons were learned.  (1) Livestock projects, especially those that involve the institutionalization of new concepts, are necessarily long term in nature.  (2) Project design should involve analysis of similar projects in the same region in order to determine realistic targets.  (3) Definitions of project tasks and outputs should be specific.  (4) Host country limitations concerning personnel and funding available should be taken into account.  (5) Host country staff participating in advanced degree programs may not be assigned to the project when they return because they are in such high demand to staff higher-level positions.  (6) Sound project management systems -- including sound accounting/financial management procedures and, where needed, an adequate inventory system --  are vital to project success. (7) Counterpart training and the continuity of host country personnel are essential to project sustainability. Recommendations for Phase II of USAID's Agricultural Sector Development Grant (6830257/0265) are included.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","4/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Livestock|Herders|Agricultural cooperatives|Grazing land|Rangeland|Range management|Agricultural policy|Beneficiary count","Niger","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABD363.pdf","1,226 KB","008585 - USAID.

"Evaluates two projects, implemented by the Institute of Nutrition for Central America and Panama (INCAP), to reduce infant mortality and undernutrition in Central America:  (1) 5960115, under which INCAP provides TA in planning and implementing oral rehydration therapy (ORT), growth monitoring, and nutrition education programs (ORT project); and (2) 5960116, under which INCAP provides TA to food assistance programs (PROPAG project). Interim evaluation, which covers activities up to 5/89, also assesses INCAP's institutional performance. The ORT project is well advanced; with 19 months to the PACD, 80% of planned activities have been completed.  Fifty-four Technologies, Methodologies, and Guidelines (TMG's) have been developed, 27 of which have been transferred to El Salvador, 24 to Costa Rica, 30 to Honduras, and 37 to Guatemala.  INCAP's contributions -- in the areas of planning and strategy development, health information systems and human resource development, health education and communications, information dissemination, and operations research -- are almost universally lauded by local counterparts and are apparent throughout public and private maternal/child health activities.  INCAP has been very responsive to local and national programs, though sometimes at the expense of program coherence.  However, no quantifiable estimate is available on the project's impacts, due to:  (1) the diversity of country programs and the number of interventions; (2) INCAP's strategy of collaborating with other donors, which obscures its own contributions; and (3) insufficient time in which to evaluate individual, local activities. In the PROPAG project, an effective multidisciplinary team capable of coherently developing TMG's is in place, both at INCAP headquarters and in the field.  However, due to delays in start- up, TMG development and transfer are not as advanced as hoped for.  Efforts are most advanced in Costa Rica, followed by Guatemala and El Salvador; Honduras is trailing badly, and will require special emphasis if it is to receive its share of the project's benefits.  (In fact, it is unlikely that efforts in Honduras will be completed by the PACD, and Guatemala and El Salvador are questionable.)  Key achievements include:  the use of operations research to improve feeding (and shortly health) programs in Costa Rica, an information system in El Salvador covering 90% of the country's food programs, the overhauling of the logistics of Guatemala's central food handling agency, and the inclusion of food technology in Guatemala's school feeding program.  Impacts at the local (i.e., feeding center) level were difficult to quantify, even in Costa Rica, due to the lack of established effectiveness measures.  There is also need to better integrate the ORT and PROPAG projects, promote community participation, and apply scientific rigor to the service areas of technical cooperation, human resources, information dissemination, and management. INCAP's institutional capacities, especially its human resources, have grown significantly as a result of the two projects, and its stature has increased both in the eyes of member countries and the wider international community.  The potential demand for INCAP's expertise is such that INCAP could eventually become self-sustaining in certain areas, such as in the food assistance field, where its capacities are unique.  INCAP's organizational structure is well developed and has many strengths, but it also has a number of weaknesses, among which are the dual authority structure for the two projects, and an overly centralized administration. Lastly, the relationships among INCAP, ROCAP, and PAHO, in terms of underlying philosophy and operational methods, need to be reexamined and harmonized if future collaboration is to be productive.  INCAP should concentrate on improving the ORT and PROPAG projects, and especially on integrating them so that a positive synergy is achieved.","Food assistance programs project number incorrectly listed on title|page as 5960115","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-0262-I-00-7150-00|596-0116-G-00-5110-00","","9/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Nutrition education|Nutrition improvement|Oral rehydration therapy|Food aid programs|Technical assistance|Institution building|Development organizations|Organizational structure","Central America","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABD939.pdf","8,061 KB","005553 - John Snow, Inc.

"Evaluates as of 1/89 the activities of five PVO umbrella groups implementing USAID projects in Latin America and the Caribbean: the Costa Rican Association for Development Organizations (ACORDE), the Federation of Private Development Organizations of Honduras (FOPRIDEH), the Association of Non-Governmental Development and Service Entities of Guatemala (ASINDES), the Haitian Association of Voluntary Agencies (HAVA), and Jamaica's Council of Voluntary Social Services/United Way (CVSS/UW). All the organizations have demonstrated the ability to handle subproject (SP) financing as called for in the OPG's, and the available evidence, though limited, suggests that SP's are reaching their intended beneficiaries; however, systems for evaluating SP impact are not yet in place in most cases.  There have been criticisms of USAID's efforts to increase the amount of assistance channeled to PVO's through umbrella organizations, especially from larger and more sophisticated PVO's who do not see the utility of such an arrangement. Training and TA programs have been less successful than SP programs. They have also, except in Haiti, received less attention, although FOPRIDEH has recently increased efforts in this area in response to member demands.  Reasons for this have varied: HAVA has focused increasingly on working directly with beneficiary groups rather than PVO's; ACORDE decided to use other organizations to address training and TA objectives; and internal difficulties have undermined ASINDES' work in this area. Only FOPRIDEH and HAVA have made significant progress towards becoming representatives or coordinators of PVO's; as non-member organizations, ACORDE and CVSS/UW have not sought that responsibility, while ASINDES' membership is static, and its public role cautious. Progress has been made in institutional strengthening, especially in clarifying the purposes, basic identity, and direction of the organizations.  However, more attention is needed in the areas of planning, financial management, and program evaluation. Four of the organizations have had serious staffing problems; reasons include restrictions on levels of salaries and management support, personality conflicts, and a lack of clarity concerning the roles of the Boards of Directors and the various levels of staff. Except for CVSS/UW, which has been remarkably successful in its fundraising efforts, none of organizations have much prospect of achieving financial self-sufficiency.  While pursuing funding from other donors, they continue to depend heavily on U.S. resources for both operating expenses (except for ACORDE, which operates in a USAID-donated building) and program levels. Major conclusions are as follows.  (1) Where USAID's principal or only purpose is to fund PVO project activities, the use of a non- membership organization is more efficient; however, if objectives include creating or strengthening an organization as a representative or coordinator for PVO activities, a membership organization is preferable. If purposes include providing TA and training as well as project funding, either type of organization can be used, depending on local circumstances and the activity involved.  (2) General characteristics of effective umbrella organizations include clearly delineated internal roles and functions, established procedures and staff, and compatibility with the PVO's served.  (3) The meaning of financial sustainability, and the strategies for achieving it, need greater attention.  (4) While USAID's can conserve staff resources by using intermediary organizations to administer PVO project activities, it is unlikely that any one organization will be suitable for all types of USAID-supported activities, and thus that USAID's will able to avoid direct relationships with PVO's in all cases; in addition, savings in staff time will likely be realized over the long rather than the short-term, since USAID assistance will generally be necessary for the institutional development of effective organizations.  (5) CVSS/UW's success in domestic fundraising is such that Missions in other countries should consider asking United Way of America and CVSS/UW for help in undertaking similar efforts.","Earlier ed.: PD-AAZ-122","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-0085-I-00-6097-00","","11/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Private voluntary organizations|Comparative studies|Development projects|Development administration|Development finance|Institution building","Latin America|Caribbean|Haiti|Jamaica|Costa Rica|Guatemala|Honduras","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABE048.pdf","16,327 KB","000356 - Checchi and Co.

"PACR of a project (1980-5/88) to assist Egypt's Ministry of Agriculture in improving its capacity to collect and analyze economic data. All training activities for staff of the Agricultural Economics Research Institute (AERI) and the Undersecretary for Agricultural Economics and Statistics (U/AES) were accomplished.  The project funded four Ph.D. candidates, all of whom are expected to return to Egypt by 10/89, as well as U.S. short-term training or observational tours for some 140 persons, all of whom have returned, with the majority making use of skills and knowledge gained.  Trainees acquired technical skills in such areas as objective yield forecasting, cost of production estimation, farm income estimation, farm labor data estimation, poultry production data estimation, dairy production data estimation, channel data marketing for horticultural crops, list frame construction, and data processing.  Additionally, the project sponsored over 35 seminars, workshops, and conferences, the most impressive of which was an agricultural economic policy reform seminar attended by senior government officials and representatives of 9 Arab countries and several international organizations.  In addition, considerable TA was provided, and substantial progress made in tailoring methodologies to the Egyptian context.  The project also issued more than 20 commodity and input reports, along with 5 policy studies and other papers, and established a computer center at U/AES. Despite these achievements, only limited progress was made in developing institutional systems for generating data on a nationwide basis, due mainly to lack of cooperation and coordination between AERI and U/AES.  This failure is in turn related to the traditional bureaucratic context in Eqypt, which is not conducive to the sharing of authority.  Progress was also hindered by the apparent lack of demand for improved statistics, and by USAID/E's lack of attention to the project. Lessons learned include the following.  (1) The acquisition of new technical skills and sophisticated equipment is not sufficient to increase the output of a recipient organization. In addition, there must be an organizational capability and the desire to use those skills.  (2) Policy studies must be an integral part of project activities and they must also be desired by senior host government officials.  (3) More attention must be given to the selection of candidates and their English language skills. Ph.D. training in this project had to be extended due to poorly prepared candidates.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","9/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Data collection|Data analysis|Statistical data|Agricultural research|Agricultural economics|Research organizations|Institution building|Technical training|Management aspects|Beneficiary count","Egypt","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABE096.pdf","209 KB","008539 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (1980-89) to provide potable water and sanitation systems in rural Honduras. The targeted 430 water systems were completed, and 420 are working satisfactorily; watershed deterioration is to blame for those not functioning.  However, the water delivered by these functioning systems is rarely subjected to water-quality analysis or treatment with chlorine due to problems in procuring laboratory equipment from the United States.  This problem requires further attention by the National Autonomous Water and Sewer Authority (SANAA).  An additional 162 water systems were designed and will be built under the Health Sector II Project (5220216). In other achievements, the project built the targeted 430 aqueducts, rehabilitated 68 aqueducts (vs. a target of 50); built 38,800 pit latrines vs. a target of 20,800; and met the targets of 6 sewer systems, 49 septic tanks, and 2,000 wells.  On the negative side, the project failed to met targets for windmills (7 of 10) and water seal latrines (48,139 of 54,000) due, respectively, to (1) the Ministry of Health's (MOH) lack of time to carry out all of the necessary wind pattern studies for potential sites, and (2) the lack of SANAA promoters to guide the installation of water seal latrines.  Additionally, the target for sewer systems had to be reduced from 21 to 6 because the communities refused to deliver the required labor and materials, which had accordingly to be supplied through the Employment Generation Program. The project was the first in rural Honduras to install water seal latrines -- which proved popular with users because of their ease in cleaning and their ability to seal off odors -- and to successfully integrate water, sanitation, and health education components.  Over all, it achieved its purpose by reaching some 500,000 rural inhabitants with safer water and waste disposal systems, although 50% of the country's rural population still lacks such access.  Also, in implementing the project SANAA and the MOH gained a good deal of experience that would not have been gained in a smaller project.  Finally, CARE, the International Development Bank, and the European Economic Community have since replicated the project design and are currently implementing similarly integrated projects in Honduras. The following lessons were learned.  (1) The lack of a single overall authority greatly impeded this project's integration, which in turn led to duplication of activities and overlapping areas of responsibility. (2) Projects should not burden communities with labor or financial responsibilities that are beyond their abilities, as was the case in this project.  (3) Projects that call for community input should ensure it by beginning community education programs on project benefits well in advance of scheduled construction dates.  (4) Communities should have the responsibility for and authority and control over the management of their water and sanitation systems.  (5) The implementation delays result from the Government of Honduras' (GOH) requirement that revolving funds be liquidated annually is a generic problem affecting many USAID/H projects, showing the Mission's need to continue working with the GOH in search of an overall solution.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Water supply|Sanitation|Water supply structures|Outdoor toilet facilities|Rural areas|Beneficiary count","Honduras","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABF296.pdf","149 KB","008555 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of the Botswana Workforce and Skills Training (BWAST) project (1982-89). Project inputs were funds, continuity, TA, imagination, dedication, and trust among actors.  Its primary outputs were, first, a number of trained and educated, middle- and high-level cadre, who are assuming positions of trust and preparing the path for Botswana's future development.  Most concede that a managerial and administrative skill base is a prerequisite to the successful execution of more specific employment-generation projects.  Second, the project (with its successor, BWAST II), has produced a management system to further the development of the human resource base in Botswana.  An operative system is in place and functioning for the public sector and one is emerging in the private sector.  The total system has been 16 years in the making, which appears to be about the minimum period necessary for skills development programs to have an appreciable effect and measurable impact on broad-based national development processes. Taking into account the combined effects of previous skill-upgrading programs, the activities of the government itself, BWAST, and programs of other international donors, Botswana's system of skills development appears to be 3-5 years ahead of those of many of its neighboring countries. Most of what the project did, it did well.  However, while the project paper emphasized rural development, only 21% of courses taken by participants were related to rural or agricultural activities.  Also, the expectation of immediate direct employment impact might have been more modestly presented in the project paper; training was targeted at already-employed individuals, so that indirect effects are likely to be of much greater significance, and will not likely be realized until some time in the future.  This should not detract from project outputs, many of which have been clearly beneficial for the development outlook; rather we are suggesting that some of the rhetoric initially used to describe project objectives was overstated. We find no evidence of resource wastage in the implementation of the project, although overseas training, particularly in academic institutions, is intrinsically expensive.  Outputs exceeded targets for every category for which measurable indicators could be derived and the project has been brought in under budget. The use of operational experts (OPEXers) proved highly effective, even though linkages with participant trainees were tenuous. On-the-job training by OPEXers was less than originally envisioned as the government seemed more interested in production than training.  The TA function of the project has been particularly effective.  Lack of overlap between OPEXers and participants could have been anticipated, given the numbers and timing of this component.  This points to a larger problem of reintegrating people who are away for training for 2 to 4 years. The primary contractor, the Academy for Educational Development, managed a complex logistical problem admirably.  Field staff members have provided a further valuable source of TA, particularly with a management-of-training system.  As with all such projects, there were initial problems of implementation, but they were uncovered and, where feasible, corrected. A.I.D.'s analysis of project performance could be improved. Costs per participant should be routinely analyzed and a database developed of participant backgrounds and systematic measures of project achievements (number of jobs created, regulations improved, wage histories, etc.). It would have been useful if the data kept on participant backgrounds were such that they were more suitable for analysis and assessment.  The evaluation plan in the project paper was neither specific nor comprehensive, particularly lacking rigorous monitoring and adherence to recordkeeping benchmarks. The training system which has been developed under BWAST is sustainable.  What is not likely sustainable without additional assistance or internal financing, is funding for overseas training and TA.  Further development of the private-sector component will require further funding.  Such a commitment is well-justified by experience to date. It is recommended that in future skills development be approached as an investment decision.  Skills development should first and foremost be directed to economic growth within the context of appropriate technology.  The objective is to select one or more interventions (investments), which could maximize the employment content of economic growth, subject to constraints on fiscal and monetary policy, the international competitive situation, the human capital base, tastes and customs, the efficiency of Government operations, and the like. Interventions would then be selected either because they appear to have a high payoff, in the sense of yielding a large number of jobs directly or indirectly, or because they have low costs, in the sense that they are intrinsically inexpensive or because they can be directed at the reduction of one or two critical constraints. If such a procedure were followed and the costs and benefits of the alternatives were to be listed, it would be likely that attention would focus on:  export opportunities, the service sector, construction, and certain distributive activities (retail and wholesale trade, informal sector, transportation, communications, business services, etc.). Moreover, skill constraints would be most apparent in the areas of basic attitudinal and commercial skills and supervisory skills (foremen).  We thus urge that A.I.D. begin to move down into the heart of the skills pyramid, with less reliance on academic credentials as selection criteria.  Attention would thus shift beyond exclusive focus on white-collar jobs to encompass more blue-collar and other operative occupations. Short-term, in-country courses would be emphasized in an effort to further strengthen the private sector.  We particularly favor internships in the U.S. or in developing countries. Interventions should not be limited to skills upgrading, but should comprise a package of inputs including TA to smaller firms and aspiring entrepreneurs. Coordination of the various elements of such a package approach is essential, and a system which provides for that coordination is described in Section V. Financing is of equal importance, and we urge the introduction of cost-sharing and user charges where appropriate.  We further suggest that a levy/grant system be considered.

"Start-up evaluation of the Agricultural Policy and Planning (APP) project, one in a series of activities designed to support the development of the Office of Studies and Planning (SEP) in Zaire's Department of Agriculture.  Awarded to Chemonics in 1987, the APP contract was conceived essentially as an institution building activity with major emphasis given to human resource development, TA, and primary data collection.  In the first 3 years of the project, seven long-term advisors will help SEP to increase its analytical capabilities. Preliminary data collection will emphasize a series of small-scale studies or surveys. Due to the shift of the Government of Zaire (GOZ) and SEP priorities from commodity and regional studies to macroeconomic issues, the evaluation team calls for a revision of the Project Paper, Project Agreement, and the Chemonics contract to more accurately reflect the real needs of the GOZ.  Other recommendations include the redefinition of various staffing positions, the development of realistic annual and quarterly work plans, and the enhancement of coordination efforts between USAID/Z, SEP, the Ministries of Planning and Finance, and donors.  The data collection component has had only marginal impact due to the almost total lack of new computer hardware and software, and the lack of a data collection advisor. It is recommended that if further delays are anticipated, short-term contracts should be used to meet the immediate data collection need. The evaluation concludes that both USAID/Z and Chemonics have significant opportunities to help the GOZ to strengthen agricultural policy analysis during the next 2 years. The team recommends a thorough review and revision of the project design to respond to GOZ/SEP perceptions and priorities, and to increase the impact of the project.

"Close-out report on a project (9/81-4/88) to establish an institutional capability to conduct systematic program and sectoral evaluations in Niger's Ministry of Plan (MOP). Although implementation was slowed by organizational changes and personnel turnover, the project was a success -- providing TA and long- and short-term training to 23 participants to create a pool of evaluation technicians in the MOP; introducing a ""dossier standard"" project data and analysis system for ex-ante sectoral evaluations which was used with minimal donor TA; and developing a system of access to project evaluations conducted by other agencies and ministries.  Thanks to the project, the Directorate of Project Evaluation and Programming (DEPP), the MOP bureau in which the evaluation function was eventually institutionalized, has undertaken ex-ante evaluations in all development sectors, participated in interim and ex-post evaluations of donor projects, led annual reviews with technical ministries, and been assigned a leadership role in analyzing donor project proposals.  The DEPP also runs the MOP's documentation system, which includes a computerized socioeconomic data base for analytical work (macro and sectoral studies), a library with a computer-based information retrieval system.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","9/1/1989 12:00:00 AM","","Development project evaluation|Development program evaluation|Government departments|Institution building|Sector evaluation|Development planning","Niger","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDBBT379.pdf","872 KB","008585 - USAID.
