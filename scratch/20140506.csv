"The goal of MCHIP project in Zimbabwe was to contribute to accelerated and sustainable improvement in maternal, newborn, and child health (MNCH) through the scaling up of evidence-based, high impact, and integrated interventions. &nbsp;The project aims to contribute to reductions in maternal and child mortality and thus support Zimbabwe's progress towards Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) four and five on reducing child mortality and improving maternal health. &nbsp;The purpose of this Zimbabwe MCHIP end of project evaluation was to: (1) ascertain the extent to which the MCHIP intervention contributed to overall learning and innovation in MNCH care in Zimbabwe at national, district and health facility and community levels; (2) provide detailed analysis of determinants of program performance; and (3) provide critical information and document lessons learned for future USAID/key stakeholder project design and evaluation. &nbsp;The evaluation was carried out between October and November of 2013. &nbsp;(Excerpt, modified)","'AID-613-TO-13-00002 under Contract AID-RAN-I-00-09-00019'|Separate document containing the annexes has been appended","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","AID-613-TO-13-00002|RAN-I-00-09-00019-00","","3/1/2014 12:00:00 AM","","","Zimbabwe","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00JT22.pdf","2,834 KB","011933 - Social Impact, Inc.","","008628 - USAID.

"The poverty reduction by increasing the competitiveness of enterprises (PRICE) project was implemented between 2008 and 2013 and follows several other USAID enterprise development projects. &nbsp;The main objective of this program was to reduce poverty sustainably by increasing enterprise competitiveness across three main sectors in Bangladesh: horticulture, aquaculture, and leather. &nbsp;Specific PRICE objectives across the three sectors included improving pro-poor economic opportunities, workforce skills, social compliance practices, governance practices related to economic growth and poverty reduction, small and medium enterprise (SME) development, growth of the non-textile private sector, and the capacity and use of knowledge management systems. &nbsp;The purpose of the PRICE final performance evaluation is to assess the effectiveness of the PRICE project in achieving its program objectives, to evaluate any constraints to achieving expected results, and to provide recommendations and lessons learned for future private-sector competitiveness and value chain development programs. &nbsp;There were six&nbsp;questions guiding the evaluation process: (1) how successful has PRICE been in increasing sector competitiveness and removing constraints at the local, national, and international levels and is success limited to a few PRICE beneficiaries/enterprises and selected geographic locations; (2) as suggested in the mid-term evaluation, how has PRICE improved the value chain market linkages to complement its production focus; (3) how did the project extension and 2011 re-alignment of PRICE's focus to support horticulture in the Feed the Future region affect PRICE's effectiveness and results achievement; (4) are women more empowered across the three value chains than they otherwise would have been as a result of the PRICE interventions and what has been the impact of PRICE interventions and trainings in creating jobs for women in the value chains; (5) how effective have the SME and workforce development initiatives by PRICE been in the leather sector growth; and (6) what institutional capacity-building lessons learned from PRICE should USAID carry forward to future value chain, hunger, and poverty alleviation investments? &nbsp;The conclusion of key findings summarizes the PRICE project as an overall success, with significant improvements made in increasing competitiveness in the horticulture, aquaculture, and leather sectors in Bangladesh. &nbsp;Many goals were achieved, and future projects can build on PRICE's established practices. &nbsp;(Excerpt, modified)","Evaluated project title: Poverty reduction by increasing the competiveness of enterprises (PRICE)|Project title: Learning, evaluation, and analysis project (LEAP)","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","AID-OAA-C-11-00169","","1/1/2014 12:00:00 AM","","","Bangladesh","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00JTJJ.pdf","1,914 KB","040314 - Optimal Solutions Group, LLC","","013891 - USAID.

"<p>In June 2013, USAID commissioned the final external performance evaluation of the Reproductive Maternal Newborn Child Health /Health Systems Strengthening (RMNCH/HSS) program in Cambodia, consisting of two primary components.&nbsp; The first component is a final performance evaluation of the main RMNCH and HSS projects: 1) maternal and child health program; 2) together for good health, and 3) better health services.&nbsp; The purpose of the first component was three-fold: (1) Conduct a final performance evaluation of the RMNCH and HSS projects; (2) review capacity of local partners to manage for results and technically direct USAID programs in the field and at national level; and (3) capture lessons learned and provide recommendations that will refine mission investments in key activities that will be carried forward for the next five years.&nbsp; The second component, a more detailed assessment of USAID's family planning activities, is included as part of this final performance evaluation.&nbsp; The purpose of the second component was to evaluate whether family planning goals and objectives were met by each project by: (1) identifying strengths and weaknesses of the various USAID-funded family planning intervention in Cambodia and identify gaps and missed opportunities that need to be addressed in future USAID-supported family planning projects; and (2) identifying lessons learned and best practices that should be prioritized for scale-up to contribute to reaching the Royal Government of Cambodia's (RGC) family planning goals.&nbsp; The evaluation team&nbsp;concluded with confidence that the USAID health program goals for 2013 have been achieved.&nbsp; Given the intensive and widespread support for interventions directly targeting those goals, the contribution of the USAID program and its projects towards the achievement of the program goals has been significant. &nbsp;Several recommendations have been acted upon by USAID and the implementing partners.&nbsp; Collaboration amongst partners has markedly improved.&nbsp; Project monitoring and survey systems have further improved.&nbsp; Some less active Reproductive Health Association of Cambodia (RHAC) clinics in rural areas were closed. &nbsp;And to some extent, competency, qualifications issues and program knowledge of provincial and field staff have been addressed.&nbsp; (Excerpt, modified)</p>","Evaluated project title: Maternal and child health program|Evaluated project title: Together for good health|Evaluated project title: Better health services","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","7/1/2013 12:00:00 AM","","","Cambodia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00JTWK.pdf","2,061 KB","","","008523 - USAID.
