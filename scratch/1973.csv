"In the middle 1960's the Government of Guyana embarked on a development program. Selected for early attention was the rice industry -- farm to market. Feasibility studies confirmed the opportunity for successful development in the rice industry. As a result of those findings, the Government of Guyana and USAID negotiated AID Loan in an amount of U.S.$12,900,000 to be supplemented by the GOG in an amount of Guyana dollars equivalent to U.S. $4,600,000. A component of that loan agreement was U.S. $550,000 supplemented by Guyana dollars furnished by the GOG in an amount equal to U.S. $144,000 for technical and managerial assistance. The principle infrastructure to be added by implementation of the loan agreement is a Rice Research Center, six Dryer-Storage Centers, and transportation equipment for bulk paddy and milled rice. The rice research center construction has been started. It is currently scheduled to be completed in December 1974. The six Dryer-Storage Centers, having a capacity to handle and store about 25% of the projected annual crop, and 50% of the projected crop in their areas are under construction. Two are expected to be completed for beneficial occupancy in time for the fall crop 1973; two others may be completed by that time. All six should be beneficially occupied by the fall crop 1974, or before.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/csd-1588","","1/1/1973 12:00:00 AM","","Food processing facilities|Research facilities|Agricultural storage facilities|Management operations|Development project planning|Rice|Technical assistance","Guyana","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAA515.pdf","1,039 KB","001375 - Kansas State University","","","English","application/pdf","","","Ackels, Alden A.","Food processing","1973","","","Food grain drying, storage, handling, and transportation report,|no. 38","Technical and managerial assistance recommendations : rice modernization project, Guyana","","PN-AAA-515","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTU1Mjg4","Guyana","5040044"
"AN EVALUATION OF THE FIRST FOUR YEARS OF EL SALVADOR'S EDUCATIONAL REFORM AND INSTRUCTIONAL TELEVISION (ITV) SYSTEM. THE THREE OBJECTIVES OF THE EVALUATION WERE: 1) TO STUDY THE EFFECTS OF ITV ON EL SALVADOR'S SCHOOL SYSTEM; 2) MAKE GENERAL CONCLUSIONS FROM THE SYSTEM THAT MIGHT BE HELPFUL TO OTHER COUNTRIES INTERESTED IN INSTRUCTIONAL TECHNOLOGY; AND 3) TO MAKE A CONTRIBUTION THROUGH THIS EVALUATION TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE ITV SYSTEM ITSELF. DATA FOR THE FOUR-YEAR STUDY WILL BE DRAWN FROM THE GENERAL SETTING; STUDENT LEARNING; ATTITUDES, AND ASPIRATIONS; COMMUNITY AND CLASSROOM INFLUENCES ON STUDENTS; TEACHER ATTITUDES AND BEHAVIOR; EFFICIENCY AND COSTS OF THE NEW SYSTEM; ADMINISTRATIVE HISTORY; AND PREDICTIONS FOR THE FUTURE. AMONG THE CONCLUSIONS OF THIS STUDY WERE THAT: 1) BECAUSE OF ITV, STUDENTS LEARNED MORE EVEN WITH GREAT ENROLLMENT EXPANSION; 2) ALTHOUGH EXPENSIVE, ITV WAS LESS SO THAN TRADITIONAL METHODS WOULD HAVE BEEN WITH THIS INCREASE; 3) ITV MAGNIFIED THE NEED FOR CHANGE IN NUMEROUS OTHER EDUCATIONAL AREAS; AND 4) ITV HAS A BRIGHT FUTURE IN EL SALVADOR.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/CSD-2175","","1/1/1973 12:00:00 AM","","Educational reform|Educational materials|Educational television|Development project evaluation","El Salvador","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAB412.pdf","9,234 KB","000223 - Academy for Educational Development, Inc.

"THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES (NAS) APPLIES SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL KNOWLEDGE TO PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH UNDERDEVELOPED COUNTRIES. DURING A TEN-YEAR PERIOD ENDING IN 1971, A CONCENTRATED ATTEMPT WAS MADE BY THE NAS TO DEVELOP PROGRAMS IN AFRICA, ASIA, AND LATIN AMERICA. THESE PROGRAMS ARE REVIEWED AND ANALYZED IN THIS REPORT; THE MAJOR FOCUS IS ON ACTIVITIES RESULTING FROM WORKSHOPS THAT BEGAN IN 1964. REGIONAL ACTIVITIES WERE MULTINATIONAL EFFORTS THAT INCLUDED SOLVING COMMON PROBLEMS OF AGRICULTURE, HEALTH, AND HIGHER EDUCATION IN THE SCIENCES. BILATERAL PROGRAMS FOCUSED ON NATIONAL PRIORITIES, E.G., OCEAN RESOURCES IN INDONESIA. THE NAS WORKSHOPS BROUGHT TOGETHER PEOPLE OF VARIOUS REPRESENTATIONS TO MATCH AND COMPLEMENT EXPERTISE; COLLABORATION CENTERED ON FOUR MAIN TOPICS: MANPOWER AND EDUCATION, AGRICULTURE, NATURAL RESOURCES, AND INDUSTRIAL R & D AND MANAGEMENT. MOST WORKSHOPS EMPHASIZED THE PRIORITIES OF RESEARCH. INCLUDED IN THE REPORT ARE ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS GIVEN EACH COUNTRY ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THESE WORKSHOPS. THE PROGRAMS THEMSELVES ARE EVALUATED ACCORDING TO INSTITUTIONAL RELATIONSHIPS (WHERE THE NAS SEES ITS USEFULNESS IN ITS CATALYTIC ROLE) AND SHORT- AND LONG-TERM DEVELOPMENTS. FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF THE BILATERAL PROGRAMS ARE DETAILED. THE REPORT DESCRIBES THESE PROGRAMS (1964-1971), DESCRIBES SPECIAL PROJECTS FROM 1968-1972, AND LISTS STAFF AND INTERNATIONAL PARTICIPANTS FOR EACH PROGRAM.","'T.O. #1' [task order no. 1]","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/cds-2584","","1/1/1973 12:00:00 AM","","Scientific cooperation|Workshops|Development programs|Technical assistance","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAD107.pdf","9,497 KB","000864 - National Research Council.

"THE WEST AFRICAN RICE DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION (WARDA) IS THE AGENT OF TWELVE SOVEREIGN STATES FOR COORDINATING AND FURTHERING THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE RICE INDUSTRY IN AND AMONG THOSE COUNTRIES. THE OBJECTIVES AND PROGRAMS ELABORATED BY THE ASSOCIATION APPEAR TO BE CONSISTENT WITH ITS PURPOSES AND THE ELEMENTS OF THE PROGRAM IMPLEMENTED SO FAR HAVE MET ADEQUATE STANDARDS OF PROFESSSIONAL EXCELLENCE. WARDA IS A NEW, INNOVATIVE AND EXPANDING ORGANIZATION. IT IS UNIQUE BECAUSE OF ITS DEPENDENCY UPON A VARIETY OF DONORS, ITS FOCUS ON A SPECIFIC COMMODITY SYSTEM, THE SCALE OF ITS INTERNATIONAL RELATIONSHIPS AND INTERCULTURAL CONSTRAINTS. WARDA IS WELL-ORGANIZED AND MANAGED WITH DUE ALLOWANCES FOR FACTORS NOTED ABOVE. THE COORDINATED TRIALS PROJECT ENABLES THE MEMBER STATES TO CARRY ON A COMPLETE SCOPE OF ADAPTIVE RESEARCH IN RICE AT A VERY LOW COST.

"THE CAMPAIGN FOR THE ERADICATION OF MALARIA (CEM) HAS COMPLIED WITH THE MAJOR PART OF THE TECHNICAL RECOMMENDATIONS MADE BY THE GROUP WHICH REVIEWED THE PROGRAM IN 1971. THE PROGRAM HAS BEEN ASSIGNED PRIORITY BECAUSE OF THE IMPORTANCE WHICH MALARIA HAS AMONG THE MANY PROBLEMS OF THE COUNTRY AND EXPECIALLY IN AREAS UNDERGOING DEVELOPMENT. THE SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE IN FINANCIAL AND MORAL SUPPORT, THE RECUPERATION OF ADMINISTRATIVE FLEXIBILITY, THE CLOSER ASSOCIATION OF THE SUPERINTENDENCY WITH THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH, ITS CAPACITY TO OBTAIN SUPPORT OF OTHER INSTITUTIONS AND TO FURNISH LEADERSHIP TO PERSONNEL UNDER ITS DIRECTION HAVE RENEWED THE INTEREST AND ENTHUSIASM IN CAMPAIGN PERSONNEL AT ALL LEVELS. THIS IS NOW BEING REFLECTED IN EVIDENT IMPROVEMENT IN THE CARRYING OUT OF OPERATIONS IN QUANTITY AND QUALITY AND IN THE REDUCTION OF MALARIOMETRIC INDICES. THE EVALUATORS ANALYZED THE PROGRAMMING OF THE MALARIA ERADICATION GOALS UP TO 1980 AND CONSIDER THAT THE GOAL OF AN ANNUAL INCIDENCE OF 0.5 PER 1,000 INHABITANTS FOR 1980 IS POSSIBLE, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT PRESENT KNOWLEDGE OF MALARIA EPIDEMIOLOGY IN THE COUNTRY AND THE FAVORABLE RESPONSE TO ATTACK MEASURES.

"THE EVALUATOR'S OVERALL IMPRESSION OF THE PARAGUAYAN EDUCATIONAL EFFORT AND THE AID PROJECT IS A FAVORABLE ONE. CONSIDERING THE CONSTRAINTS OF THE NATION'S ECONOMY, THE POLITICAL PROBLEMS INHERENT IN EDUCATION, AND THE STAGE OF TECHNICAL SKILL AMONG ITS EDUCATORS, THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM IS MAKING CONSIDERABLE STRIDES IN ""TOOLING UP"" FOR EDUCATIONAL IMPROVEMENTS. IN THE FIELD, TEACHERS ARE READY TO DEVOTE CONSIDERABLE EFFORT TO ACHIEVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT. GIVEN A CONTINUITY IN THE FLOW OF LEADERSHIP, TRAINING, AND SUPPORT FOR THEIR EFFORTS, THE OUTLOOK FOR THEIR SUCCESS IS GOOD. THE NEW CURRICULUM IS AN EXCELLENT PIECE OF WORK. THE EVALUATORS MADE THREE GENERAL PROGRAM RECOMMENDATIONS: (1)A COMPREHENSIVE ASSESSMENT OF PARAGUAY'S CURRENT AND FUTURE MANPOWER NEEDS SHOULD BE UNDERTAKEN; (2)AN INTENSIVE TRAINING PROGRAM IN PLANNING FOR ALL LEVELS OF PERSONNEL SHOULD BE DESIGNED AND IMPLEMENTED; AND (3)A COMPREHENSIVE SELF-EVALUATION AND MONITORING SYSTEM SHOULD BE DESIGNED IN CONJUNCTION WITH KEY MINISTRY OF EDUCATION (MOE) PERSONNEL. THEY ALSO MADE MANY PROJECT-SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS ON SUCH MATTERS AS CURRICULUM, TRAINING OF EDUCATIONAL SPECIALISTS, TEXTBOOK PRODUCTION, AND THE ORGANIZATION AND ADMINISTRATION OF THE (1)ADMINISTRATION AND FINANCE, (2)REGIONAL EDUCATIONAL CENTERS, AND (3)COUNSELLING AND GUIDANCE DEPARTMENTS OF THE MOE.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","5/1/1973 12:00:00 AM","","Primary education|Curriculum design|Teacher training|Educational development|Textbooks|Educational planning|Educational policy|National level|Educational materials|Secondary education","Paraguay","","","002213 - Nicaragua.

"ALTHOUGH THE CENTER FOR POPULATION AND DEVELOPMENT STUDIES (CEPD) HAS ATTAINED SOME RECOGNITION AS A POPULATION RESEARCH AND PROMOTION INSTITUTION, IT HAS FAILED TO BUILD A PERMANENT HIGHLY PROFESSIONAL DEMOGRAPHIC STAFF BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF A NATIONAL POSITIVE POPULATION POLICY, OVERT LIMITATIONSON ITS ACTIVITIES, AND CHANGES IN EMPHASIS DURING ITS EIGHT -YEAR EXISTENCE. DIRECTION HAS BEEN UNSTABLE AND INDIVIDUAL STAFF MEMBERS HAVE NOT WORKED TOGETHER TOWARD A WELL-DEFINED GOAL. CEPD OFFICIALS INDICATE THAT SEVERAL CEPD PERSONNEL AND MANY OF ITS ONGOING FUNCTIONS WILL BE TERMINATED IN JULY IF AID OR OTHER EXTERNAL FINANCING IS NOT FORTHCOMING.

"Evaluates 3 African higher education programs sponsored by USAID - designed to assist African nations in meeting their needs for trained high and middle-level manpower.  These are:  African Scholarship Program of American Universities (ASPAU), African Graduate Scholarship Program (AFGRAD), and Inter-African University Scholarship Program (INTERAF). Evaluation is based on sample of program entrants thru 1971. In general, the programs contributed to achieving their purpose. There is, however, a demand for post-secondary, technical, non-degree training that is not well-addressed by existing African or donor programs. Only 35.7% of the ASPAU participants repatriated.  The undergraduates were young, impressionable, and many became ""Americanized"". The repatriated ASPAU graduate frequently has not been well-integrated back into African society. For AFGRAD, repatriation (83.3%) and continued residence in Africa has not been a problem.  For both ASPAU and AFGRAD, scholars remain outside Africa due to greater availability of jobs and higher salaries. Marriage to foreign nationals does not appear to be a primary factor associated with the decision to live outside Africa. Because INTERAF scholars do not leave Africa and university tuition is lower, the INTERAF program is the most cost-effective of the three. AID's basic costs of getting scholars into high priority development jobs are:  ASPAU $52,420; AFGRAD $29,518; INTERAF $14,432. Returned participants lack practical training.  Scholars need applied work in lieu of or along with theoretical training.  AFGRAD should be limited to short-term (1-2 year) skills acquisition including work study experience.  AFGRAD Scholars should be required to return to their home countries and future candidates should not be accepted from countries to which scholars are not returned. In general, USAID should concentrate on non-degree programs and ensure that educational priorities are relevant to development needs as perceived by African governments rather than African and US universities. Includes bibliography citing regional and country-specific papers dealing with higher education, manpower needs, and unemployment.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/csd-3375","","11/1/1973 12:00:00 AM","","Graduate education|Undergraduate education|Participants|Educational delivery|Evaluation methodology|Evaluation|Education for development","Africa","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAA576A1.pdf","57,549 KB","000980 - Practical Concepts Inc.","","","English","application/pdf","Multi country evaluation|Indepth evaluation","","MENDLESOHN, I.|POSNER, LAWRENCE D.|et al.","","23 Nov 1973","","","","EVALUATION OF ASPAU, AFGRAD, AND INTERAF : IMPACT OF REGIONAL SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAMS ON MANPOWER NEEDS IN AFRICA.","","PD-AAA-576-A1","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc1MDcw","Africa Regional","6980062|6980210|6980603"

(A SEVERE SHORTAGE OF SPECULA CONTRIBUTED TO UNSANITARY CLINICAL PRACTICES.) A VISITING FPIA PROJ OFFICER STATED THAT WHILE ORDERS HAD BEEN PLACED WITH GSA,AS FAR AS HE COULD DETERMINE THE COMMODITIES WERE NOT PURCHASED MUCH LESS SHIPPED TO PERU. UNFORTUNATELY,THE LEADERSHIP OF ATLF (WHICH BROKE AWAY FROM MFC) WAS LED TO BELIEVE THAT THEIR PROG IS SUPERIOR TO MFC. MORE UNFORTUNATE IS THE FACT THAT MFC ALSO BELIEVES IT. AUTHORS CONCLUDE THAT WHILE THE MFC IS HANDICAPPED BY ITS SMALLER STAFF & BUDGET,BOTH PROGS HAVE ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT. RECENTLY APPROVED BUDGETS COVER 10/01/73-9/1/74. AUTHORS RECOMMEND AT LEAST 5 YRS OF ASSIST. CONT'D FINANCING SHOULD NOT BE BASED ON THE NUMBER OF CONTRACEPTORS MCF/ATLF ARE ABLE TO ATTRACT. MFC & ATLF SHOULD BE ENCOURAGED TO PROMOTE GOVT FINANCING OF FP SERVICES NATION-WIDE. AUTHORS ALSO RECOMMEND ASSIST TO MFC/ATLF EDUC COMPONENTS SUPPORTING FORMAL TRNG OF OUTREACH WORKERS & PROVISION OF A/V EQUIP,PUBLICATIONS & MATERIALS. BOTH MFC & ATLF NEED TECH ASSIST IN DEFINING STATISTICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR USE IN SETTING REALISTIC TARGETS,ASSESSING CLINICAL LOAD & PERFORMANCE,DETERMINING STAFFING REQUIREMENTS & MAKING MODIFICATIONS TO PATIENT REGIMENS. DONORS SHOULD SEE THAT MFC & ATLF HAVE THE AMT & TYPES OF ORAL CONTRACEPTIVES REQUESTED. (BREAK-THROUGH & OTHER PROBLEMS OCCURRED BECAUSE OF A CHANGE IN THE TYPE OF ORALS SUPPLIED.) REPORT NOTES THAT MANY IMPROVMNTS COULD BE MADE TO THE CLINIC FACILITIES WITH RELATIVELY SMALL INVESTMNTS BY MFC & ATLF.

"EVALUATES SEMINAR OF FINANCIAL ANALYSIS AND ECONOMIC ANALYSIS CONDUCTED IN BANGUI, CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC FROM 1/12 TO 1/24/73. SEMINAR WAS FOLLOW-ON TO AN INTRODUCTORY SEMINAR ON TECHNIQUES OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT CONDUCTED AT YAOUNDE, CAMEROON, 1/24 TO 9/2/72. LIKE YAOUNDE, BANGUI WAS A FEASIBILITY TEST OF CONCEPTS WHICH MIGHT BE INCORPORATED INTO A LONG-TERM PROJECT FOR TRAINING OF GOVT OFFICIALS FROM 15 FRANCOPHONE COUNTRIES IN PROBLEMS OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT. THE EVALUATION UTILIZED INITIAL AND FINAL QUESTIONNAIRES COMPLETED BY THE PARTICIPANTS AS WELL AS PERSONAL INTERVIEWS WHERE POSSIBLE. RESULTS FROM THE PRE-SEMINAR QUESTIONNAIRE CONFIRM THAT THE YAOUNDE SEMINAR WAS SUCCESSFUL. THE PRE-SEMINAR QUESTIONNAIRE ALSO INDICATED MUCH BETTER PREPARATION OF THOSE WHO ATTENDED THE YAOUNDE SEMINAR OVER THOSE WHO HAD NOT. RESULTS OF THE POST SEMINAR QUESTIONNAIRE INDICATE THAT THE BANGUI SEMINAR WAS ALSO A SUCCESS. NO OFFICIAL DOCUMENTS REGARDING BUDGETS, COSTS OR DISBURSEMENTS WERE AVAILABLE DURING THE EVALUATION. HOWEVER, TOTAL COST WAS ESTIMATED TO BE $21,094. WITH AN AVERAGE ATTENDANCE OF 15, THE UNIT COST OF THE SEMINAR WAS $1400 PER PERSON FOR A TWO WEEK TRAINING SESSION. SEVERAL ISSUES WERE RAISED ABOUT WHICH DECISIONS MUST BE MADE TO DETERMINE OPTIMAL DESIGN FOR THE PROPOSED PROJECT, ""TRAINING FOR PROJECT DESIGN AND MANAGEMENT."" THESE ISSUES INCLUDE: 1) ATTENDANCE PROBLEMS CAUSED BY LATE ARRIVALS; 2) LOGISTICS PROBLEMS; 3) INSTITUTION BUILDING VS ""FLOATING;"" 4) LONG VS SHORT-TERM TRAINING; 5) ROTATING VS ONE-PLACE TRAINING; 6) THEORETICAL VS PRACTICAL TRAINING; 7) TRAINING OF PARTICIPANTS VS TRAINING OF TRAINERS. IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT ALTHOUGH SEVERAL OF THESE ISSUES NEED RESOLUTION, THE PROJECT SHOULD BE APPROVED AND MADE OPERATIONAL WITH A BUDGET OF ITS OWN. EVALUATIONS OF BOTH SEMINARS HAVE IDENTIFIED THE LACK OF TRAINED AFRICAN PROJECT MANAGERS AS AN OBSTACLE TO DEVELOPMENT. BOTH SEMINARS TO TEST THE FEASIBILITY OF THE INNOVATIVE CONCEPT HAVE BEEN TRIED AND HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL. FOLLOW-UP EVALUATIONS SHOULD CONTINUE TO BE MADE. HOWEVER, MORE ATTENTION SHOULD BE FOCUSED ON TRAINING AFRICANS TO DO OWN EVALS.","Evaluation period: 12 Jan 1973-24 Jan 1973","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","2/1/1973 12:00:00 AM","","Evaluation methodology|Institution building|Workshops|Development project management|Education for development|Economic analysis|Management training|Financial management|Beneficiary interviews|Sampling method","Central Africa|West Africa","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAA495A1.pdf","10,006 KB","000175 - USAID.

"Evaluates performance of Agricultural Sector Loan 514-L-064 in Colombia from 1971 to 1972.  Funds were made available to 5 agr implementing agencies to grant loans which would improve Colombia's agricultural development. Evaluation methodology is based on quarterly reports, data provided by the Ministry of Finance, other sector agencies, and on-site visits.  This summary, the first of 2 parts, covers first agricultural implementing agency and general information about loan implementation. Part II (summary #514 016400 1702) summarizes the last 4 agricultural implementing agencies. During 1971 receipts about equalled expenditures, and exports increased by 22.2%. The major problems to the financial side in 1972 were irregularity in official fund flow during the early part of the year.  Funds were only partly compensated for by Agency short term borrowing from banks or suppliers. During 1972 119 kilometers of the proposed 423.5 kilometers of road were completed under the newly organized pick and shovel access road program along with labor-intensive techniques work on 40 farm-to-market roads which provided employment for 4,000 persons, and extension services were provided to road construction areas to assist farmers use their earnings in improving farm production. In early 1973 the Agrarian Reform Law was modified to speed up the legal processes involved in land distribution and acquisition, to protect the ownership of adequately exploited land, and create a presumption land tax.  The Agricultural and livestock Finance Fund was also modified to enable the Monetary Board to better regulate funds available for loans on long-term crops and livestock, and set aside assets to small farmers including technical assistance. The Natural Resource Institute (IDERENA), one of 5 agricultural implementing agencies, either fulfilled or exceeded its programmed targets.  IDERENA successfully completed:  1) hectare inventories, 2) plot and species investigations, 3) forestry training, 4) fishery management and/or research, 5) watershed surveys, 6) pollution studies, 7) wildlife and national park studies, and 8) ranger training.","Evaluation period: 1 Jan 1971-1 Jan 1972","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","3/1/1973 12:00:00 AM","","Income distribution|Agricultural extension|Agricultural research|Agricultural credit|Agricultural management|Agricultural policy|Agricultural planning|Land tenure|EMPLOYMENT|MIGRATION|Rural development|Roads|Land taxes|CREDIT|LAND USE|Beneficiary count|Limited data plus","Colombia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAA382A1.pdf","1,361 KB","000035 - U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)","","","English","application/pdf","Sector level evaluation|Indepth evaluation|Onsite evaluation","","","","1 Mar 1973","","514-L-064","","SUMMARY OF CY1971 IMPLEMENTATION OF AGRICULTURE SECTOR LOAN 514-L-064","","PD-AAA-382-A1","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc1MjMw","Colombia","5140164"
"Evaluates Lake Shore Road (LSR) Project from 4/68 to 5/73 in Malawi. Proj purpose was to construct a 126-mile road.  Evaluatn is based on on-site observatns, econ data & interviews. Evaluator feels LSR proj was successful despite the tremendous effort involved.  Equipmt was well utilized & may be beneficial in future projs.  The benefits of on-the-job trng will not noticeably affect Govt of Malawi (GOM)'s future econ but should benefit those individuals trained. Road was uniquely constructed under a Modified Force Account Program (MFAP) in which labor, some materials & equipmt were provided by GOM with assist from TEER, a US constructn mgmt firm (CMF) & an independent US architect/engineer consultant.  Initial progress was slow since US constructn equipmt did not arrive until after the rainy season. The main proj prob was the extensive mgmt/admin burden placed on AID, TEER, GOM & TAMS with offset low constructn costs & on-the-job trng. The use of an independent contractor was rejected by GOM since it appeared 18% more expensive than the estimated MFAP.  The MFAP costs were however only 6% over the contractor's bid.  Unlike the MFAP sys, independent contractors are an advantage since they provide for the assessmt of liquidated damages for failure to complet work on time. Contracts give financial incentives to keep constructn costs down, make AID loan reimbursemt eligibility easy to determie and need not train men who will not remain on their payroll.  Consultant likewise judges that even conscientious CMF's will not always see the work is done properly. Disadvantages of unsatisfactory cooperatn between 2 firms & need for more on-site US employees during constructn caused evaluator to recommend that in similar projs only one contractor be utilized. In view of limited benefits other than possible cost savings, difficult admin probs, inherent large scale force account constructn managed by a US CMF & high risk of much poorer CMF performance than that experienced on the LSR, evaluator recommends AID not engage in similar projs unless certain host country wants that method & is capable of doing its part.","Evaluation period: 1 Apr 1968-16 Apr 1973","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/CM/AFR-C-73-18","","5/1/1973 12:00:00 AM","","Road construction|Beneficiary count|Limited data","Malawi","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAB663A1.pdf","6,104 KB","008565 - USAID.

"Special Team Eval for 1/18/68-10/15/72 period of progress of the Pathfinder Fund (PF) in achieving AID grant objs of extending & providing interim support for family planning (FP) info & services in LDC's.  Using standardized format for eval of 63 subprojs, PF-contracted team gathered data on and evaluated PF subprojs in Costa Rica, Colombia, Peru, Venezuela, Taiwan, Philippines, Indonesia, Senegal, Zaire, Dahomey. In each area served by PF, there are successful clinical programs with adequate facilities, trained personnel, & satisfactory FP acceptance & continuation rates.  Some form of outreach program has been added to most clinic programs. Some clinics have not achieved objs, as characterized by under-utilization or inappropriate usage (wrong population served), due to inadequate proj supervision. In fields of education & communication, PF is providing support for reaching new segments of population, as with workshop meetings for the press to increase news coverage of population problems (Philippines) and recruitment of women's leadership for eventual influence on public policy (Colombia).  Other educ efforts, such as radio spots & trained motivators, are directed at increasing clinic attendance. Evaluators recommend more attention by PF to program eval, tech assistance, and monitoring & review of past successful projs.  Team also recommends that PF provide professional recruiters to locate trainers; that more fellowships be provided, especially for paramed workers.  Bulk procurement of medical kits & oral contraceptives well-documented & controlled in Philippines & Taiwan, are as of greatest demand.  Eval of transfer of PF projs to other means of support not possible, due to short duration of most projs, but evidence of some transfer in Dahomey, Peru, Costa Rica, & Indonesia.  Specific recs made concerning PF's organiz & admin in areas of proj selection methods; proj extension, review & follow-up procedures; determination of viability after PF support ends; procedures for searching out new projs; & techniques to surmount problems of difficult environments.

"EVALUATES AID ASSIST TO THE EAST-WEST COMMUNICATION INSTITUTE(EWCI) TO STRENGTHEN EWIC'S CAPABILITY TO SERVE AS AN INFORMATION, EDUC & COMMUNICATION (IEC) RESOURCE FOR POPULATION PROGS-PRIMARILY IN ASIA. PROJ CONSISTED OF AN INSTITUTION-BLDG GRANT (6/22/71) & A CONTRACT (INVENTORY & ANALYSIS - 11/17/70), SPECIFICALLY FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF AN INFO SERVICE LINKING INSTITUTIONS THROUGHOUT ASIA & THE WORLD. BOTH THE GRANT & CONTRACT EXPIRE 6/30/74. A 5-MAN TEAM CONDUCTED A 2-WK ON-SITE EVAL OF EWCI. A MAJOR PROBLEM WAS THE SUCCESSION OF EWC DIRECTORS -- 3 IN LESS THAN 3 YRS. ALSO,THE SALARY STRUCTURE WAS LOW & THE INSTITUTE WAS NOT PROVIDED WITH ADEQUATE PHYSICAL SPACE TO DO ITS JOB PROPERLY. (EWCI STAFF ARE HOUSED IN DORMITORIES & TOILET ROOMS ARE USED TO STORE FILES.) EVALUATORS NOTE THAT THE FAILURE TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM COULD JEOPARDIZE FUTURE FUNDING. DESPITE THESE PROBLEMS,IEC COURSES,UNAVAILABLE ELSEWHERE,WERE CONDUCTED AT EWCI; THE FLOW OF IEC MATERIALS GREW AT AN UNEXPECTED PACE,AND IMPORTANT WORKSHOPS IN POP,EDUC,COMMERCIAL RESOURCES & COMMUNICATION WERE CONDUCTED. 96 LDC PROFESSIONALS FROM 26 COUNTRIES HAVE THUS FAR PARTICIPATED.

"Evaluates an on-going road project being financed by India in the far Western Hills section of Nepal.  India's support for the 140 km road from Dhangarhi to Dandelhura will terminate at the end of FY 73.  Before approving a loan to His Majesty's Government (HMG) for completion of the project, USAID desired this independent evaluation to properly define the project and the work remaining to be accomplished.  The report reviews present construction status, plans, cost estimates, and HMG technical capabilities.  It also evaluates a proposed 80 km road between Nepalganj and Surkhet, also located in the Western Hills sector of Nepal.  The 7-week evaluation included discussions with Mission and HMG personnel, a review of records, plus air and ground inspection. A reasonable balance between labor intensive and capital intensive construction methods has been achieved on the Western Hills road and a similar approach should be used on the Surkhet project.  The attached listing of recommended construction equipment is, superficially, rather impressive for labor intensive construction.  However, the evaluators point out the following facts which must be taken into account:  (1) 84% of the project is in difficult mountainous terrain; (2) the remoteness of the area causes difficult equipment maintenance problems such that ""down time"" is quite high, and (3) shipping damage plus transit vandalism and theft combine to greatly prolong the time interval between receipt and placing into service of new equipment (in extreme cases in excess of 1 year). Report recommends various changes in road and bridge construction specifications, and recalculates projected costs. Technical capabilities of HMG are limited by experience rather than by numbers or education.  Additional expatriate assistance is needed in bridge design, equipment utilization, operation and maintenance, and, in the case of the Surkhet Road, engineering geology.","Evaluation period: Through 1 Jun 1973","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/CSD-3419","","6/1/1973 12:00:00 AM","","Bridge construction|Roads|Transportation system design|Road construction|Labor intensive technology|Limited data plus","Nepal","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAD057A1.pdf","1,172 KB","001832 - Hoskins-Western-Sonderegger, Inc.","","","English","application/pdf","Evaluation team|Onsite evaluation","","","","1 Jun 1973","","","","ENGINEERING EVALUATION : WESTERN HILLS HIGHWAY PROJECT, WITH COMMENTS ON NEPALGANJ - SURKHET HIGHWAY (4/9/73-5/20/73)","","PD-AAD-057-A1","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc1NTcw","Nepal","3670210"
"REVIEWS DEVELOPMENT OF THE CENTRAL VETERINARY LABORATORY (CVL) PROJECT NEAR BAMAKO, MALI FROM ITS OPENING IN 1/72 THROUGH 10/73. THE OBJECTIVES OF THE CVL ARE (A) TO PRODUCE VACCINES FOR PROTECTING MALIAN CATTLE AGAINST MAJOR DISEASES AND (B) TO UNDERTAKE APPLIED RESEARCH AND TESTING PROGRAMS TO IMPROVE VACCINE QUALITY AND TO SUPPORT USAID'S MALI LIVESTOCK PROGRAM. PRODUCING VACCINES IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT FOR THE CURRENT VACCINATION CAMPAIGN BECAUSE SO MUCH OF THE NATIONAL HERD HAS BEEN WEAKENED BY THE DROUGHT AND IS PARTICULARY SU SCEPTIBLE TO DISEASE AND PARASITES. SINCE BEGINNING OPERATIONS IN 6/72, THE CVL HAS BEEN PLAGUED BY ONE BREAKDOWN AFTER ANOTHER. AT TIMES, AS WHEN THE WATER PUMPS FAILED, THE LABORATORY HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO FUNCTION AT ALL. CONSEQUENTLY, MALI HAS HAD TO CONTINUE IMPORTING SOME OF ITS VACCINE REQUIREMENTS FROM ABROAD. AT PRESENT, THE LABORATORY IS STILL IN A PRECARIOUS POSITION AS IT FACES THE 1973/74 VACCINATION CAMPAIGN. DELAYS IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF A WELL AND WATER TOWER FOR STAND-BY WATER SUPPLY CAUSE THE CVL TO BE DEPENDENT ON MUNICIPAL WATER AND VULNERABLE TO CUT-OFFS DURING DRY MONTHS. THE SAME APPLIES TO CVL'S SOURCE OF ELECTRICITY SINCE THE CVL STAND-BY GENERATOR IS IN DISREPAIR. OTHER PROBLEMS WHICH COULD INTERFERE WITH MEETING DEMANDS FOR VACCINES ARE THE ABSENCE OF ADEQUATE COLD STORAGE FOR STOCKPILING AND TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES IN THE PRODUCTION OF RINDERPEST VACCINE. USAID HAS CONTRACTED AN ENGINEERING FIRM TO CORRECT MOST OF THEMAJOR DEFECTS IN DESIGN AND INSTALLATION. THE AUTHOR RECOMMENDS THAT USAID INCREASE ITS INPUTS TO ENABLE THE CVL TO ADDRESS SOME OF ITS LONGER-TERM PROBLEMS, PARTICULARLY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FOR LABORATORY OPERATIONS AND RESEARCH, FOLLOW-ON COMMODITIES, TRAINING, AND FUNDS FOR LOCAL OPERATING COSTS. SUCH ASSISTANCE COULD TRANSFORM THE CVL FROM AN EMBARASSMENT FOR BOTH COUNTRIES TO A TRULY FUNCTIONAL INSTITUTION IN SUPPORT OF THE MALI LIVESTOCK SECTOR.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","10/1/1973 12:00:00 AM","","Veterinary medicine|Medical laboratories|RINDERPEST|Cattle|Livestock diseases|Animals|Immunizations|RESEARCH FACILITIES|Vaccines|Disease prevention and control|Animal diseases|ANIMAL HEALTH|Project change|Limited data","Mali","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAC172A1.pdf","1,146 KB","000035 - U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)","","","English","application/pdf","Onsite evaluation","","BLUMGART, JOHN D.","","1 Oct 1973","","","","NARRATIVE REPORT ON THE MALI CENTRAL VETERINARY LABORATORY PROJECT","","PD-AAC-172-A1","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc1NjQz","Mali","6880002"

"EVALUATES CONTRACT WITH THE EAST-WEST CENTER POPULATION INSTITUTE (EWCPI) TO ESTABLISH POPULATION RESEARCH, TRAINING, AND GRADUATE STUDY TO SERVE THE ASIA/PACIFIC REGION. EVALUATION COVERS THE PERIOD 6/1/68 TO 6/1/73. CONTRACT OBJECTIVES WERE ACHIEVED WITHIN THE TIME-FRAME CONTEMPLATED BY AID AND THE EAST-WEST CENTER. EWCPI PROVIDES SCHOLARSHIPS TO 50 STUDENTS A YEAR.  THE EVALUATORS NOTE THAT THEY HAD NO BASIS FOR EVALUATING THE BASIC QUALITY OF THE COURSES AT EWCPI. WHILE AS YET UNSYSTEMATIC, EWCPI DID ATTEMPT TO RELATE RESEARCH TO FIELD PROBLEMS. OF 31 RESEARCH STUDIES IN 1972, 19 WERE CONCERNED WITH COUNTRY-SPECIFIC PROBLEMS -- AND ONLY 8 OF THESE WERE PRIMARILY CONCENTRATED IN LDC'S. THE REMAINDER FOCUSES ON POPULATION PROBLEMS IN DEVELOPED COUNTRIES SUCH AS THE US OR JAPAN. EWCPI'S MOST AMBITIOUS PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM CONSISTED OF 4 WEEKS OF INTENSIVE STUDY IN SUCH AREAS AS ECONOMIC ASPECTS OF POPULATION GROWTH, EVALUATION OF FAMILY PLANNING, BASIC MEASURES OF FERTILITY, AND METHODS OF CONTRACEPTION. THE FIRST SEMINAR COVERED 39 TOPICS, TAUGHT BY A STAFF OF 14(FROM 10 DIFFERENT US INSTITUTIONS). EWCPI'S STAFF OF COMPUTER PROGRAMMERS WAS EXPERIENCED AND KNOWLEDGEABLE ABOUT DEMOGRAPHIC METHODS AND THE COMPUTER FIELD. OVERALL, THE STAFF WAS EFFECTIVE AND WELL-TRAINED, AND THE INSTITUTE WAS GIVEN HIGH MARKS FOR ITS EFFICIENT AND SKILLFUL ADMINISTRATION. COORDINATION WITH AID WAS LESS THAN SATISFACTORY. TEAM RECOMMENDED THAT PROCEDURES BE ESTABLISHED FOR REVIEW AND EVALUATION OF RESEARCH PROJECT FINDINGS AND THE EWCPI PROGRAM IN GENERAL.","Missing pages|Evaluation period: 1 Jun 1968-1 Jun 1973","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","9/1/1973 12:00:00 AM","","Population censuses|Fertility|Demographic research|Fertility surveys|Journals|Curriculum design|Population and demography|Organizations|Research centers|Population education|DEMOGRAPHY|Population policy|Population planning|Population programs|Seminars","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAK496A1.pdf","1,460 KB","000148 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to strengthen family planning programs in developing countries.  Evaluation covers the period 6/30/71-3/30/73 and is based on a review of project documents, interviews with Family Planning International Assistance (FPIA) personnel, and visits to subproject sites. FPIA's performance has been unimpressive.  The management of the central office is weak, with the selection of staff members related more to ethnic, racial, and gender considerations than to qualifications. FPAI's failure to deliver requested supplies and equipment (such as films, projects, books, and pamplets) has resulted in a loss of credibility overseas. Performance in the field has also been weak, with a limited programmatic focus; poor staffing patterns and performance; inadequate planning, coordination, and evaluation; and loose coordination with other FP organizations.  The evaluators note that the FPIA's provision of contraceptives is often redundant, and that the Information, Education, and Communication (IEC) program, which offers the greatest potential for contribution, is particularly slack. Although it was originally planned that FPIA would piggy-back with organizations such as Church World Services (CWS), this has not proven possible -- CWS is weak in many areas and is cutting back on its programs.  Despite these problems, the evaluation team emphasizes that many project objectives have been met.  The Philippine program has been particularly effective.  Recommendations include:  (1) streamlining and redeployment of personnel in the New York office; (2) assigning field representatives to each region; (3) clearly defining FPIA's organizational philosophy and objectives; (4) decentralizing staffing patterns and instituting in-service training programs; (5) shifting away from the channeling of commodities and emphasizing IEC programs; (6) focusing on a few larger projects; (7) identifying consultants with expertise in FPIA's various programs and geographical areas; (8) improving data collection, reporting, and evaluation; and (9) clearly establishing FPIA's role among the dozens of similar FP organizations operating abroad.","Evaluation period: 30 Jun 1971-1 Mar 1973","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","3/1/1973 12:00:00 AM","","FAMILY PLANNING|Family planning services|Delivery systems|Private voluntary organizations|Family planning education|Development program evaluation|Family planning promotion programs|Information storage and retrieval systems|Logistics|Contraceptive agents and devices|Contraceptive distribution|Family planning occupations|Medical education","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAH536.pdf","655 KB","","","","English","application/pdf","Evaluation team|Indepth evaluation|Onsite evaluation","","VAUGHN, JACK H.|CONNELL, ELIZABETH B.|et al.","","30 Mar 1973","","","","REPORT OF EVALUATION TEAM - FAMILY PLANNING INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE - PLANNED PARENTHOOD WORLD POPULATION","","PD-AAH-536","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc3NjA2","Population and Humanitarian Assistance","9320955"
