"Evaluates the performance of a proj contractor, Robt R Nathan Associates, Inc (RRN), from 3/64 to 9/64.  Proj was intended to strengthen the capability of several Govt of Afghanistan ministries (particularly the Min of Planning-MOP) for designing & executing developmental projects. The performance of RRN appeared highly satisfactory.  Contractor's local team established good working relations with GOA personnel; this team displayed high professional competence and, with good backstopping from its US headquarters, was able to meet its contractual commitments fully and promptly.  GOA's satisfaction with RRN is displayed by its reliance upon RRN assistance for an appraisal of current inflationary pressures, an analysis of current budgetary deficits, and an examination of the feasibility of select projects. Services (or achievements) provided by RRN during this eval period include:  1) directly assisting the MOP with the preparation of projects, eg, the enlarged rural credit program; 2) advising the Min of Agr on its revised research program and on special programs to increase wheat production, develop a dairy processing plant in Kabul, and implement an agr sample census; 3) assisting with efforts to improve the work of assembling, processing & publishing economic statistics; 4) preparing a proposal for the review of the GOA's second Five-Year Plan and presenting this proposal to the MOP; 5) assisting select GOA personnel with the development of curricula in econ planning and providing these personnel with on-the-job training; 6) conducting relevant participant training programs.","Evaluation period: 22 Mar 1964-21 Sep 1964","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","10/1/1964 12:00:00 AM","","WHEAT|Agricultural policy|Agricultural planning|Economic policy|Economic planning|Participants|Dairies|Institution building|Agricultural production|Agricultural credit|Agricultural research|Limited data","Afghanistan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAC438C1.pdf","824 KB","008504 - USAID.
