"Evaluates P.L. 480 Title II school feeding program in Haiti. Final evaluation covers the period 1978-82 and is based on results of two sample surveys in which a longitudinal research methodology (described in detail) was tested to assess the program's effectiveness and impact. Results showed that the neediest children and schools were not deliberately being targeted (i.e., by measuring and weighing) for inclusion in the program, and that rations tended to be diluted; 53% of the schools fed more children than were programmed. However, ration size was large enough to compensate for the overfeeding; children still received the intended 1/3 of the recommended daily allowance of calories.  Evidence was mixed as to whether commodities were substituting for meals or, as intended, supplementing them.  Food preparation/serving/storage facilities were inadequate, but requiring improvement might keep the poorest schools from participating.  Local contributions were minimal and children were generally required, above and beyond program guidelines, to pay a small fee to defray program costs. Recordkeeping was incomplete and inaccurate.  Finally, the program is not being run efficiently by participating schools. Some 17% of commodities were being used to subsidize program operating costs, a figure which appears to be excessive in view of the fact that a majority of participants do pay fees. Individual schools which seem to be the major contributors to this problem have been identified. Despite these problems, longitudinal analyses indicate that children who were at risk nutritionally benefited from the program, and that those most at risk benefited most.  Children attending CRS-administered school feeding programs benefited more than did those attending programs administered by other PVO's, suggesting that logistic and operational factors can be important determinants of school feeding success.  No participants were worse off in their second year, despite a deteriorating socioeconomic environment; the same cannot be said of nonparticipants. Several recommendations address the deficiencies noted above. Other key recommendations are to continue the program, expand nutrition education, and examine the effects of school feeding on student performance in school.","Title in footer: Haiti school feeding evaluation","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","3/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Child nutrition|School feeding programs|Food for Peace Title II|Beneficiary count|Sampling method","Haiti","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAP261.pdf","8,057 KB","008554 - USAID.

"Evaluates four small enterprise development (SED) projects implemented by PVO's in Sri Lanka:  the Chamber for Small Industry (CSI); the Sarvodaya Shramadana Movement (SSM); the Lanka Mahila Samiti (LMS); and the Women's Bureau (WB).  Special evaluation is based on document review, interviews with PVO staff, participant questionnaires, and group discussions.  Time frame is not clearly indicated. The evaluation reviews different PVO approaches to SED, and the context in which those approaches are carried out.  Project impacts are examined at the firm, local economy, equity, and institution building levels. CSI serves as a training and mediating organization to help small entrepreneurs begin or expand manufacturing and develop business networks.  Enterprise profitability and viability is CSI's primary objective; social benefits are expected through backward and forward linkages.  Though only 10 months old, CSI has trained nearly 100 entrepreneurs in practical courses running 2-20 weeks; courses were highly regarded and lessons are being applied. SSM aims at collective advancement through rural community retail stores.  The SSM provides training/marketing/financial support to build local SSM organizations, increase production and purchases of local products, and link barter and cash economies. Over 95% of SSM stores are in continuing operation and most are covering all costs.  The stores provide employment at higher wages, reasonably-priced goods, and resources for community health and education programs. Through training and its network of local social services groups, the LMS program helps rural poor women improve business and problem solving capacities; profits are returned to individuals. In its first 10 months, LMS has helped form 11 production groups, mostly coir.  Volunteer extensionists chosen by the groups have received 6 weeks of basic business skills training, and increased self-esteem is evident. For both LMS and WB, social and economic development are linked. WB helps develop entrepreneurial and leadership skills in poor rural women by providing training, follow-up, and direct grants to businesses. A.I.D. funding for WB ended in 1982, but WB is a good example of possible results from an injection of TA and funds.  Increases in rural women's income and use of government services are reported. Future SED project design should address:  market demand for products; the form and delivery of SED finance; some means of sharing SED experiences (e.g., topic-specific seminars); and feedback and adjustment mechanisms.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","DAN-5317-C-00-3085-00","","1/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Small scale enterprises|Private voluntary organizations|Beneficiary interviews","Sri Lanka","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAQ404.pdf","22,995 KB","002120 - Partnership for Productivity International","","000087 - USAID.

"In April 1983, A.I.D.'s Office of Evaluation convened a 4-day conference to discuss the results of a 2-year effort to evaluate the impacts of the P.L. 480 Title I program.  This report summarizes discussion by the conferees on:  (1) the varied impacts of Title I food delivery, e.g., in terms of agricultural disincentives, food self-reliance, policy reform, and structural adjustment; and (2) the various mechanisms (e.g., single-year vs. multi-year programming, self-help agreements, and commodity mix) used to administer the Title I program.  All conferees agreed that the Title I program could be improved by:  implementing multi-year programming; integrating food aid with other development assistance; making self-help agreements more specific and food delivery more timely; programming food by volume instead of value; giving recipient countries a greater say in the choice of food commodities; improving A.I.D./host country policy dialogue; accepting the inefficiency of the multi-agency structure; and promoting the involvement of the private sector.  A summary of action taken on these recommendations since the conference concludes the report. Summaries of impact studies in Sri Lanka, Peru, Egypt, Jamaica, and Bangladesh are appended.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","2/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Food for Peace Title I|Economic impact|Development project management|Case studies","Jamaica|Bangladesh|Sri Lanka|Peru|Egypt","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAL044.pdf","91 KB","003433 - USAID.

"Tanzania has long suffered from lack of an organized seed production and distribution system.  This report presents the results of an impact assessment of a project (1/70-12/82) to increase the quality and quantity of seeds produced in Tanzania. The project succeeded in enacting seed legislation and regulations and creating a system for producing high-quality seeds and distributing them to small and large farmers.  Farmers are using the seeds and increasing their crop production.  The returned recipients of long-term training have proven to be dedicated and competent. Despite these successes, Tanzania's overall crop production system is working far below its capacity.  Only 4,000 T of food crop seeds were sold in 1982, less than 5% of capacity.  Total food crop production has continued to decline since the early 1970's.  Credit and extension institutions have not cooperated with the seed project as expected. Finally, project sustainability is threatened by lack of spare parts and trained service personnel to support the project's mechanized seed production process and by the failure to institutionalize training for a second generation of project personnel. Lessons learned are that:  mechanization should be minimal and kept simple; project implementation should be flexible; distribution and marketing problems should be addressed prior to the start of production; design assumptions regarding the expected cooperation of related institutions should be carefully evaluated and diligently pursued during implementation; the design should take into account the fact that, in an economy with strong public sector control, free market mechanisms will not operate as in a market economy; exaggerated claims for potential impacts may initially create enthusiasm, but will ultimately hurt project credibility and sustainability; and design and implementation plans should seek to compensate for weak or lacking institutional support systems. Appendices include, inter alia, a 25-item bibliography (1975-83) and information on the evaluation methodology, on seed production, and on sociopolitical, agricultural, and general characteristics of Tanzania.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Seeds|Seed production","Tanzania","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAL042.pdf","85 KB","000179 - USAID.

"The impacts of two A.I.D. projects promoting integrated rural development (IRD) and new lands settlement in the subtropical lowland areas of Chane-Piray and San Julian in eastern Bolivia - a 1974 loan to the National Colonization Institute (INC) and a 1979 grant to the private Foundation for Integral Development (FIDES) - are evaluated. Physical infrastructure work, which was carried out by INC before the settlers arrived, was rated poor; technical services, which were provided by FIDES on a self-help basis, were rated excellent. Micro-level economic and social impacts were mixed at Chane-Piray but, thanks to FIDES's influence, were very positive at San Julian. Macro-level economic, social, and environmental impacts were substantial and generally positive, although the long-term impact of merging Indian and Spanish cultures and of replacing virgin forests with crop and pasture land is unknown.  IRD activities were limited to San Julian.  On the whole, the design of the projects was replicable. Regarding IRD, the projects taught the need for:  continuity of commitment, along with comprehensiveness of perspective as well as an ability to adapt individual IRD elements; proximity of implementors to beneficiaries, active participation by the latter, and close program monitoring; support systems promoting self-help and self-capitalization; and a quick-response capability (decentralized decisionmaking) on the part of implementors. Regarding resettlement, the projects taught that:  farming conditions should be evaluated (e.g., via experimental farms) before settlement; settlement proved most successful when due to a combination of self-selection and the provision of essential (but not dependency-creating) support services; the most essential infrastructure items are water, access roads, and viable community layouts; critical services must be provided until the first crop is harvested and sold; turnover of a settler's parcel of land does not necessarily reflect failure; and consolidation and growth ultimately depend on settlers' own efforts and resources.  Appendices treat project interventions, impacts, development issues, and lessons learned in detail and include a 42-item bibliography (1968-83).","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Settlement establishment|Agricultural land settlement|Colonization programs|Integrated rural development|Community self help|Community participation|Community facilities|Beneficiary interviews","Bolivia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAL043.pdf","7,748 KB","008515 - USAID.

"The impact of A.I.D.'s support for CREDICOOP, Paraguay's national agricultural credit institution, is evaluated. CREDICOOP has established a significant network, growing from 16 to 70 credit unions, doubling its membership, and evolving from a savings and loan institution to a multipurpose cooperative.  Its effectiveness, however, has only been fair to poor, being seriously hampered by a high loan delinquency rate due to unwise early lending policies, poor harvests caused by bad weather, and a wildly unpredictable crop market. Yet despite apparently steady decapitalization, CREDICOOP survives; it has developed an institutional toughness which defies logic. CREDICOOP's impact on small farmers has been mixed.  Many fell into debt and have gone back to the private traders who have no collateral requirement and a short loan process; others have graduated to seeking credit from commercial banks and the National Development Bank. The key lesson learned is that, despite several decades of public sector support for CREDICOOP and other large, formal credit institutions, the private sector credit delivery system continues to command 84% of the overall agricultural credit market and fully 98% of the small farmer market.  A.I.D. should learn from these village-level businesses and seek ways of working through them.  Other lessons learned are that:  (1) integrating farmers and non-farmers in the same credit union can level financial flows within a union and provide relatively sophisticated leadership; (2) a credit institution must take into account both its operating costs and the costs of its competitor's money if it is to develop long-term sustainability; (3) the greatest weakness in any agricultural credit program is the unpredictability of weather and market conditions; (4) determination is the key to succeeding in a free market environment; (5) the ability to lend without requiring mortgage collateral, while raising the risk of default, also raises the ability to reach small farmer borrowers; and (6) availability of a credit union tends to make other agricultural service suppliers more competitive. Appendices provide greater detail on the individual A.I.D. projects involved and discuss traditional and CREDICOOP interest rates.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Institution building|Credit unions|Agricultural cooperatives|Agricultural credit|Credit cooperatives|Farmers|Small farms|Public sector|Private sector|Socioeconomic aspects","Paraguay","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAL041.pdf","3,291 KB","000156 - USAID.

"Guanchias, Ltd., a Honduran banana-producing cooperative, has since its inception in 1965 achieved remarkable economic growth and effected considerable improvements in the lives of its members - accomplishments due in no small part to its partnership with Standard Fruit and Steamship Company, a U.S.-based multinational agribusiness firm.  This study traces the development of Guanchias and of its collaboration with Standard. Guanchias' origins lie in the failure of Honduras' agrarian reform movement to adequately address the problems of landless peasants; the promise of financial security through a guaranteed market for its bananas led the co-op - which had barely survived its first 3 years - to seek participation in Standard's independent growers program.  Over the next 15 years, benefiting from exposure to Standard's work ethic and technical and business procedures, Guanchias members learned how to become efficient managers and laborers, how to bargain as an equal with their more sophisticated partner, and how to reinvest capital earnings in productive and socially beneficial member services - potable water, sanitation, housing, health care, and education. Standard, for its part, received an assured supply of bananas at relatively low cost and low risk in an uncertain environment and enhanced its public image through its involvement with independent growers. The Guanchias-Standard partnership has been criticized as a one-sided relationship in which a paternalistic benefactor takes advantage of contracted labor, but in fact the joint venture has served both parties well and has also been good for economic, human, and institutional development in Honduras.  Although it is unclear as to how the relationship will evolve in the future, its strength was great enough to override a challenge to the contract in the early 1980's.  Moreover, Guanchias' continued reliance on Standard for materials transfers, extensive credit, and technical assistance suggests mutual acceptance of their interdependency. Implications of the Guanchias-Standard collaboration for Guanchias, the Government of Honduras, and development planners and donors are offered in conclusion.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","OTR-0085-O-00-3367-00","","3/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural cooperatives|Agribusiness|Private enterprises|Corporations|Joint ventures","Honduras","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAL046.pdf","723 KB","004099 - University of Notre Dame.

"This A.I.D. program evaluation concludes that the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) is making a significant contribution to improving the economic condition of the rural poor in developing countries. IFAD's performance has been shaped by its unique, sole focus on increasing food production and income of small farmers and the rural landless; its reliance on other development organizations to implement projects; its requirement to maximize co-financing with other donors; its relatively small staff and funding level; the broad range of countries IFAD helps; and its accountability despite limited direct project control. Over the past 7 years, IFAD has helped implement 160 integrated rural development, irrigation, credit, and agricultural production projects in 84 countries.  Despite the newness of most projects, increased yields and incomes are already apparent and IFAD is emerging as a leader in designing credit projects, promoting donor involvement in higher risk projects, and introducing improved technologies.  IFAD's most successful projects have:  focused on well-specified target groups and had clear mechanisms for reaching them; introduced quick-yielding food production techniques adapted to poor farmers or comprehensive packages of integrated services; emphasized large-scale production of low-cost foods; and fostered on-farm employment.  Less successful IFAD projects have emphasized large-scale infrastructure investments which only indirectly benefit the rural poor. IFAD needs to increase its emphasis on and range of institutions chosen for co-financing projects; improve project monitoring and evaluation; try to reach more women; increase emphasis on priority U.S. development assistance policies, especially on long-term institutionalization of project management; and focus aid in fewer countries. Three appendices give details on IFAD projects.","Evaluation period: Jun-Dec 1984","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","2/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Food production|Development organizations|Agricultural development|Poor|Small farms|Low income|Rural areas","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAL045.pdf","1,604 KB","003433 - USAID.

"With the help of technical assistance and overseas faculty training from A.I.D., the first graduate school of business administration in North Africa, l'Institut Superieur de Gestion (ISG), was founded at the University of Tunis (UT) in 1969. Initially, ISG offered only a 3rd cycle program modeled on the American M.B.A.; at the Government of Tunisia's urging, however, 1st and 2nd cycle (undergraduate) programs were added.  ISG's institutional spinoffs are quite impressive.  A Faculty of Economics and Management was founded in Sfax; its dean is a former ISG dean.  Other ISG faculty have joined the Institute of Advanced Commercial Studies and the Faculty of Law, Politics, and Economics; ISG 3rd cycle graduates are now junior faculty at UT. ISG has fostered upward social mobility - its graduates, most of whom are from low-income families and many of whom are women, have little difficulty finding good jobs.  On the other hand, ISG's popularity has created a problem, as other institutions have raided not easily replaceable doctoral faculty.  Another problem (recently resolved through policy dialogue) was the reluctance of Tunisian officials to accept the American Ph.D. as the equivalent of the French Doctorat d'Etat.  Although the goal of 25-40 3rd cycle graduates annually was reduced to 10-12, the addition of 1st and 2nd cycles, which graduate 100 and 150-200 students respectively, has increased the total number of graduates.  While A.I.D. may have withdrawn its technical assistance too soon for best results, the project was nevertheless a very successful example of institution building and technology transfer because it was appropriate to Tunisia's needs as a middle-income country with a rapidly growing economy. The project has taught several commonplace, yet important lessons: (1) a project is more likely to succeed if objectively appropriate and subjectively desired by the host country; (2) institution building is a long-term affair; (3) the renewal of cadres is indispensable in the long run; (4) competing demands for trained personnel tend to disperse that scarce resource; (5) a viable institution adapts to its environment and often diverges from its original plans; and (6) a project's spinoffs may be more significant than the project itself.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","4/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Universities and colleges|Teacher education|Management education|Graduate education|Institution building|Technology transfer|Education for development|Beneficiary interviews","Tunisia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAL050.pdf","1,415 KB","003433 - USAID.

"A.I.D.'s experience since 1981 in implementing the Private Sector Development Initiative (PSDI) is synthesized in this report. After brief reviews of the background and methodology of the study and of PSDI itself, the report provides a conceptual framework for interpreting A.I.D.'s experience in programming PS projects by identifying the distinct features and requirements of PS-led development (firms, markets, international investment, constraints) and the major parameters that shaped A.I.D. programming (resources, limitations).  Detailed discussion is then given to A.I.D. and other donor experience in the four key areas of PSDI - policy reform, project assistance to private enterprise, project assistance through private organizations, and mobilizing the Third World's PS for development.  A final section assesses implications of the study for future A.I.D. programming in this area. Key findings are that:  (1) increased emphasis on host government policy reform can further the development of competitive markets and private enterprises; (2) only 17% of A.I.D.'s FY 1982-84 development assistance budgets was targeted for PS development projects; (3) there are in the Third World both advantages to using PS delivery systems and a large, barely tapped potential for doing so, although public sector involvement is often necessary, either as a direct provider or as a regulator; and (4) A.I.D.'s current institutional strengths suggest expanding PS programming in agricultural production and services, agro-industry, small and medium enterprises, and housing and social services (but not via direct lending to or direct equity investment in individual Third World firms, or support of U.S. private organizations). The report's fundamental suggestion is that A.I.D. continue its approach of balancing private and public initiatives and seek to increase awareness of possibilities for PS development in all Agency activities.  Detailed recommendations for specific A.I.D. practices and related studies are included.  Appended are descriptions of other-donor PS programs, a synthesis of A.I.D.

"Provides final report by the Regional Forestry Advisor (RFA) for Asia on a project to assist A.I.D. Missions in developing forestry programs. Report, covering the period 1/82-2/85, includes Asian host-country forestry sector profiles. As a result of the project, Mission responsiveness to forestry issues has improved substantially as have relationships with host country forestry communities.  A.I.D.'s forestry program has expanded, and projects have been initiated in two new countries. The RFA has acted primarily as an information conduit and an interpreter of Mission forestry needs, having, inter alia: formed information linkages with groups in several countries; recommended topics to AID/W for research, TA, and programs; assisted with workshops and conferences; visited eight Missions to review forestry activities and plan or advise on new and proposed projects; and prepared several memos and reports. Some Missions still hesitate to move into the forestry sector - a resistance due to lack of funds and personnel, the suasion of previously determined priorities, and bureaucratic constraints (limited forestry expertise at the Mission level; restrictions on purchasing equipment and hiring outside experts; and poor communications and cooperation within AID/W). Overall, A.I.D. forestry projects have been about as successful as those of other donors.  Innovative programs in social forestry, agroforestry, watershed rehabilitation, and particularly wood fuel reflect the recognition (originating in Washington rather than with Missions) of the importance of forest resources.  While the success of this new generation of projects has been less than anticipated, their effectiveness can be expected to improve with time.  Still, given the legacy of long-time host-country underfunding and administrative and policy deficiencies - along with continuing funding constraints and the magnitude of effort required - inconsistent progress can be expected for many years to come. It is recommended that staff (especially Mission-level) and other donor capabilities be taken into consideration in forestry planning, that good forestry TA be made available to Missions, and that A.I.D. information networking be strengthened and its forestry goals clarified.","Missing p.20","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Development programs|USAID|Forestry|Forest resources|Development assistance|Tropical zone","Asia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAQ909.pdf","2,066 KB","000185 - USAID.

"Provides final Mission report (7/80-3/84) on a project to assess the utility of three experimental swamp vehicles to development efforts in the Sudd Swamp area of Jonglei Province in southern Sudan. The vehicles - a 32-hp marsh buggy, a 160-hp tracked cargo carrier, and a smaller industrial track vehicle - were found to be fuel inefficient and subject to special maintenance problems, thus inappropriate to the isolated Sudd Swamp area where fuel and spare parts are difficult to come by.  In addition, a labor source with sufficient education and aptitude to be trained as vehicle operators or mechanics was unavailable, and the role of the host agency, the Jonglei Executive Organ for Development Projects, in providing logistical support remained vague and undefined. The project - purportedly an accelerated impact project - required 38 months before start-up due to delays in developing specifications for, procuring, and transporting the vehicles and in recruiting a technical advisor.  The advisor - who arrived in 5/83 - was severely stung by bees 6 months later when riding in the open cab of one of the vehicles and had to leave; A.I.D. determined that no worthwhile purpose would be served by securing a replacement. The project was terminated in 3/84 due to armed insurgency in the area.  USAID/S travel there is forbidden and it has been impossible to determine the status or whereabouts of project equipment. Lessons learned are:  (1) the project design underestimated the time required for and difficulties of implementing a project in an isolated area; (2) use of Commodity Import Program (CIP) funding could have saved at least 5 months' time (via in-place CIP freight forwarding services); (3) use of on-hand lease equipment could have saved the 12 months required to fabricate new vehicles; and (4) the project was misnamed - it was an experiment (not an impact project) whose nature should have been more forthrightly and prominently discussed in project identification and approval documents. Accelerated impact projects should be thoroughly investigated in order to ensure a relative degree of implementation simplicity, an assured source of equipment or commodities, and a contracting mode making full use of specialists while conserving A.I.D. staff resources.","Attached to PD-AAQ-924-A","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Rural areas|Swamps|Motor vehicles|Limited data","Sudan","","","008607 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to develop a replicable livestock/rangeland management system in the Toulekedi/Sarre zone of Eastern Senegal, near Bakel.  Final evaluation covers the period 1974-2/85 and is based on analysis of field data collected between 11/82 and 5/84. Technical interventions did not meet expectations.  Nineteen of 30 recommended water catchment ponds have been provided, enabling cattle to graze longer on land near the ponds and postponing herders' need to draw water for cattle, but due to extensive water loss these gains disappear by the end of the dry season. Infiltration accounts for 67% of water loss (vs. an expected 35% combined loss from infiltration and evaporation); in one pond livestock used only 2.6% of total water. The project's firefighting plan has not noticeably reduced annual burning, although firebreaks were widened and the firebreak network expanded to 185 km; the 3 fire towers built under Phase I have not been used and fire education has not helped mobilize villagers against fire. However, firebreak roads have greatly increased the area's accessibility, while construction of the Mbaniou technical base has increased coverage by veterinary and extension personnel and has attracted other GOS projects. Extension activities have been largely successful since the 1980 redesign which brought agents into closer contact with local populations.  Livestock services have responded rapidly to outbreaks of bovine diseases and in larger villages have promoted supplemental feeding of lactating cows, and the literacy program for Pulaar speakers has been very well received.  However, some project interventions unintentionally challenged the traditional social order, precipitating conflict among social castes and villages. Five techniques for revegetating denuded rangeland in the Gambia Basin were tested (a combination was found to be the best approach), but villagers lack both the willingness and the resources to undertake degradation control.  Some 89 species/varieties were planted in forage trials in Mbaniou zone in 1983-84; several performed well.  Finally, a range management plan has been drafted, encompassing herd stratification, improved crop-animal interaction, village-level revegetation of denuded areas, and strengthening pastoral units. Included are detailed individual research/evaluation reports on range management, soils and water engineering, and socioeconomic factors.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","685-0202-C-00-2137-00","","2/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Water catchment|Water supply engineering|Ponds|Range management|Livestock|Crop-animal systems","Senegal","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAQ933.pdf","21,058 KB","000788 - University of Michigan.

"Five case studies - stressing self-help measures (SHM's) and local currency use - of P.L. 480 country food aid programs were prepared.  The first two studies, here presented in a single volume, were of the Tunisia Title I program and the Mali Title II, Section 206 program and were pilot efforts to test the evaluation approach.  The three later studies (see PN-AAW-192/194) examine the Titles I and III program in Haiti and the Title I programs in Pakistan and Zambia. Comparison of the Tunisia and Mali programs teaches the following lessons.  (1) In both cases, SHM's were initially sharply focused, and were later amplified or varied to include related issues.  (2) While both programs used a multi-year strategy, this strategy was formalized in Mali, consonant with a similar commitment by a multi-donor group (thus increasing U.S. leverage), whereas in Tunisia the U.S. committed itself on a yearly basis.  (3) The terms of assistance were clear and stable over time in both cases.  They also depended on the results of annual evaluations, thus reinforcing host government performance of SHM's.  (4) In Tunisia, the U.S. was the only donor to focus on a fertilizer-fueled development strategy.  In Mali, the U.S. became the last donor to support cereals market liberalization, thereby benefiting from the earlier efforts of the other donors. (5) The Tunisian program has been closely coordinated with projectized support.  In Mali, however, some of the effects of the cereals restructuring may run counter to the objectives of some A.I.D. projects.  (7) In Mali, local currency proceeds from all donors are mainly used to meet the deficits of the cereals marketing parastatal and thereby encourage host government support for higher cereals prices.  In Tunisia, they support SHM's, especially in agriculture.  Both approaches seem to be effective. (8) Both programs supported private enterprise growth; both benefited from good technical analysis prior to commitment of funds and from good personal and professional relations; and both demonstrated a sensitivity to host governments' real political and economic constraints which increased their policy impact and allowed for mid-course corrections.","Related studies: PN-AAW-191, PN-AAW-192, PN-AAW-193, PN-AAW-194","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-1406-I-02-4087-00","","1/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Food for Peace Title I|Food for Peace Title II|Local currency|Nonproject assistance|Policy dialogue|Community self help|Host country cooperation","Tunisia|Mali","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAQ969.pdf","7,110 KB","003002 - Ronco Consulting Corp.","","000087 - USAID.

"Evaluates subactivity to help Assiut University (AU) to establish the High Institute of Nursing (HIN) through TA from Project HOPE. Special evaluation covers the period 2/83-1/85; no methodology is given. Project HOPE has contributed significantly to successful establishment of the HIN, which is now fully operational.  Three classes containing a total of 145 students have been admitted, and curricula and teaching materials are being developed, implemented, and revised for the first 3 years of the 5-year program.  HIN faculty have received 36 weeks of U.S. and inservice training in such areas as pedagogy, curriculum design, and community health services delivery.  The project's Technical Advisory Committee has served as a liaison with related organizations and as a forum for discussing critical HIN development issues. It is recommended that the project be extended for at least 2 years as needed to complete the full 5-year curriculum and to allow time to promote HIN institutionalization and program upgrading; during this period HOPE can address faculty recruitment problems through development of a Master's degree program, further training, and ongoing TA. Also, the HIN should develop opportunities for faculty to receive doctoral education within AU, develop closer ties with the AU Hospital, provide students greater opportunities for English-language training, and ensure that the faculty's heavy workload and isolated lifestyle does not inhibit their enthusiasm or professional development; nursing faculty should see that student training is oriented toward community health care.  The highly successful short-term U.S. training program should be continued and Project HOPE should continue to employ two long-term consultants to provide academic support; in particular, HOPE should help to develop long- and short-term faculty recruitment strategies.

"Presents final Mission report (1977-3/85) on a multidonor project to upgrade 300 km of road in Botswana from a gravel to an asphalt surface. Road paving was successfully completed in 12/83, 3.5 years behind schedule and $18 million (120%) over budget.  Various delays occurred in the tendering process and cost overruns resulted both from cumbersome European Economic Community (EEC) procedures (the EEC was a major donor) and difficulties in coordination among donors, the U.S. engineering firm, and the European contractor, COGEFAR.  Construction itself, begun in 1/81, encountered numerous start-up problems, including labor unrest and difficulties with supplying and processing road materials. The continued political importance of the road has made the delays and extra costs acceptable to Botswana and to donors, but their satisfaction has been somewhat clouded by a number of large claims which have been submitted by COGEFAR. Politically, A.I.D.'s involvement with the project produced dividends as the Agency was able - for a relatively small contribution (less than 10% of project costs) - to share credit for a highly visible project. By using host country contracting procedures and not funding the construction component, A.I.D. has effectively removed itself from criticism for the cost overruns and unsettled claims.  Yet, aside from politics and publicity, A.I.D. has achieved few significant technical, cost, or managerial benefits.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Road construction|Asphalt|Limited data","Botswana","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAR039.pdf","140 KB","008516 - USAID.

"Evaluates program of the Policy Development Division (PDD) of A.I.D.'s Office of Population.  Special evaluation is based on the author's personal experience with the PDD program and on review of recent project reports.  No time frame is stated. The overall impact of the PDD program is difficult to assess, but there is no doubt that several individual PDD projects have produced valuable and enduring outcomes; specific projects have, for example, increased knowledge of the determinants of fertility, raised awareness among LDC officials of the development impacts of population growth, improved the technical capabilities of LDC planning units, and strengthened working relationships between scientists and policymakers. However, PDD has never produced a unifying strategy to guide project selection, nor has it clearly defined expected outcomes by which to measure project achievements.  Also, project locations have been influenced more by contractor contacts and/or the receptivity of Mission population officers than by need or feasibility considerations, while coordination among projects and implementing agencies has been inadequate. PDD is now attempting to integrate related activities and to expand program concerns (e.g., Columbia University's Development Law and Policy project), but a comprehensive, detailed strategy is still lacking. Moreover, current projects (with the possible exception of the Columbia University project) fail to address policy formulation and implementation as a holistic process, even though it is process issues which are least understood.  PDD continues to concentrate exclusively on population growth and fertility policies and to neglect issues of population distribution and composition. It is recommended that PDD:  (1) base projects on clear, detailed strategy statements and subject them to periodic review and revision; (2) integrate projects with Missions' Country Development Strategies; (3) give greater attention to the policy process, particularly to social and political determinants of policy actions; (4) stress coordination with LDC population planning units; (5) increase funding for population/demographic training of LDC personnel; and (6) develop specific measures for assessing the real effects of population assistance.","Project title: Population technical assistance (POPTECH)","Special Evaluation","Documents","DPE-3024-C-00-4063-00","","5/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Population planning|Policy analysis|Population policy|Technical assistance|Policy making|Development project planning|Limited data","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAR064.pdf","596 KB","000673 - International Science and Technology Institute, Inc.

"Evaluates project to improve irrigation systems management in Pakistan.  Interim evaluation covers the period 6/83-3/85 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with A.I.D., Government of Pakistan (GOP), Provincial Irrigation Department (PID), and contractor personnel. Although canal and drain rehabilitation projects are now well underway, delays were experienced earlier, caused mainly by lack of skills among PID personnel in preparing scheme proposals, and partly by a lengthy approval process.  Some problems have been experienced in the field, e.g., use of manual/animal labor when project-supplied machinery could have been applied; variance in operator skills; weak control functions; and a lack of proper loading equipment, maintenance, and spare parts.  PID repair workshops need both physical and management upgrading; the process of arranging repair for a piece of machinery is complicated and cumbersome. To date, no overseas training has occurred.  Recent progress in establishing an in-country training program, however, while slow in coming, is encouraging.  Considering the implementation problems associated with participant training, it may be advisable to focus project resources on institutionalizing sound in-country programs. Also, the ongoing rehabilitation schemes offer a valuable opportunity for on-the-job training and demonstation. Delays in implementation were partly due to the late arrival and subsequent poor performance of the TA contractor, PRC/Checchi. Positive steps are being taken to correct the latter. A key recommendation is to increase integration among project components, in particular to integrate the physical work aspects of the rehabilitation schemes with other project activities. Also, the project needs to improve communications between and among A.I.D., GOP, PID, and TA personnel and to begin to explore strategies for encouraging farmers to take responsibility for irrigation system operations and maintenance. TA team leaders should arrive 1-2 months before the TA teams to evaluate field conditions and establish project priorities and direction.","Attachment: PD-ABD-530|Evaluation period: Feb-Mar 1985","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","3/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Irrigation|Irrigation sites|Irrigation equipment","Pakistan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAR074.pdf","2,299 KB","","","008588 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to help industries in Central America implement energy conservation (EC) measures and reduce oil imports. External evaluation covers the period 7/83-ll/84 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with A.I.D., project, and private sector personnel. The project will probably achieve only 33-50% of its targets, but is potentially a very significant activity - it is the only truly regional EC project underway, it enjoys active private sector involvement through national associations of industries, it has actually generated revenues through fees for seminars and audits, and its institution-building activities are likely to succeed in all countries except Nicaragua, which no longer participates. The goal to improve balance of payments through reduced oil imports will not be achieved, however, due to changing economic conditions and overoptimistic cost analyses. Regarding services to industry, energy seminars have reached several hundred firms and will exceed targets; only in Panama have these been less than successful.  Some 75-85 energy audits (near target) will be completed in 1984; thus far, most are of good quality.  Demonstration projects have not yet begun; fewer than planned will be completed, given the greater importance of other activities (training, audits, follow-ups).  Only very preliminary work has been done on the 2 pilot projects. Training is far behind, with only one short course in 1983, attended by staff of the implementing Central American Technical and Industrial Research Institute (ICAITI) and by national delegates, and no training in 1984.  Performance by ICAITI engineers has been uneven. Promotion, through conferences, publications, etc., has been effective and has reached over 1,000 firms.  Less positively, little work has been done to create a regional EC data base, and the financing and policy issues component, implemented by the Secretariat for Central American Economic Integration (SIECA), has completed only one financing study (in draft) and 2 general studies; financing of industrial equipment imports is seen as a problem. Private firms have not been used to conduct EC audits, as project management remains highly centralized, project staff feel capable of carrying out all tasks, and some countries have too few specialized private firms.  Overall, project management has been weak, especially prior to a new workplan in 7/84.  The project has suffered from delays, TA problems (apparently now resolved), poor communication among central staff and between ICAITI and SIECA, and cumbersome audit management procedures.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","2/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Regional development|Energy conservation|Industry","Central America|Costa Rica|El Salvador|Guatemala|Honduras|Panama","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAR075.pdf","2,527 KB","009990 - Hagler Bailly Services, Inc.","","004295 - Central American Technical and Industrial Research Institute|002290 - USAID.

"Evaluates energy conservation (EC) component of a project to develop energy resources in Djibouti.  Special evaluation covers the period 1982-1/85 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with key officials. Achievements have included, inter alia, a manual on EC techniques in construction; a design for a model energy saving building for the National Higher Institute of Scientific and Technological Research (ISERST); a very effective 8-week consultancy that included training of counterpart staff and the transfer of metering equipment; plans to build 5-10 low-cost, energy-efficient housing units; detailed analyses of the EC potential in all sectors and development of related recommendations for the National Energy Assessment; and assistance to the private sector in manufacturing bricks (as a substitute for energy-intensive imported building materials); and promotion of waste oil as a fuel. Nonetheless, at least 25% of current consumption could be saved through simple retrofits and other EC activities.  Major constraints to EC are deficiencies in public and private sector awareness of EC, in technical ability, and in support from government institutions (except ISERST).  Only Djibouti Electricity (the national utility) and ISERST are active in EC efforts.  If the project is to have any notable impact on Djibouti's balance of payments, it should be redirected to building institutional capabilities in EC and to developing EC awareness and technical expertise; ISERST is the most appropriate organization to lead a national effort, although it is unfortunately unable to enforce energy policy. Specific recommendations are, inter alia, to:  provide short-term TA in commercial and industrial energy audit practices; implement EC projects, including demonstrations; train ISERST technicians and provide overseas training for the heads of ISERST and the Energy Service (SE); provide long-term TA to the SE after it develops an energy strategy; hold a seminar to raise EC awareness among top-level government employees, conduct a national exhibition of energy-efficient appliances, and compile a directory of these and of related services; have ISERST develop an aggressive EC program and help develop an EC program for the transportation sector; and have Public Works develop and enforce norms for EC in new construction.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","DAN-5728-C-00-3073-00","","1/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Energy conservation|Government departments","Djibouti","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAR086.pdf","460 KB","009990 - Hagler Bailly Services, Inc.","","000184 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to strengthen the training, research, and consultancy capabilities of the Eastern and Southern African Management Institute (ESAMI).  Special evaluation covers the period 4/82-4/85 and is based on document review, a site visit, and interviews with ESAMI staff and with beneficiaries. ESAMI has made considerable progress in attaining project objectives. In 1983, ESAMI conducted an assessment of management training needs in 15 countries, which resulted in significant networking with national and other regional management training institutions, culminating in ESAMI's 1984 Working Conference. Further steps in formalizing regional linkages included the founding of the Association of Management Training Institutions in Eastern and Southern Africa (AMTIESA) to promote collaboration between national and regional training institutions. Linkages have also been formed with Indian institutions. These activities have led to revisions and expansion of ESAMI's training program.  In 1984, ESAMI offered about 48 courses (either on-site or at client organizations) attended by more than 1,800 mid- to top-level managers in government and industry. ESAMI also offers consultancy services aimed at clients' specific management problems. Much less progress has been made in the development of case studies because of difficulties in recruiting long-term advisors and a lack of available ESAMI staff time, constraints which should have been recognized in designing the project.  Nine staff members have initiated case studies however, and a new approach being considered by ESAMI - in which short-term specialists will present a series of case study workshops - should enable completion of 9-13 studies. Also lagging is the formation of U.S. linkages in the area of agricultural management training.  Because of its high employment standards, ESAMI delayed recruitment of two agricultural management specialists for 2 years.  However, a course in agricultural policy analysis and formulation was developed with USDA assistance, and will be offered for the second time in 1985, following a related seminar for senior national officials. Recommendations address the problems noted above and stress the need for more supportive project management by A.I.D.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","4/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Management education|Agricultural management|Educational development|Institution building|Management training|Management development|Regional development|Beneficiary count|Beneficiary interviews","East Africa|Southern Africa","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAR110.pdf","1,138 KB","","","002575 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to expand the coverage and quality of public health care in 147 of Burma's 287 rural townships.  Final evaluation covers the period 1980-1/85 and is based on document review, discussions with GOB and USAID/B officials, and field visits to rural health centers (RHC's) involving interviews with village volunteer health workers and beneficiaries. Overall, the project was effective and most targets were achieved, although delays in all categories have required a 2-year extension to complete project expansion.  The project trained three categories of volunteer health workers:  9,418 community health workers (CHW's), 1,787 auxiliary midwives, and 4,000 traditional midwives.  The performance of the volunteers was impressive, especially since they were volunteers and labored with limited resources (still, project inputs of medical kits, though delayed, were essential); the performance of both classes of midwives was particularly impressive, reflecting the high quality of their training.  Although the absence of reliable data makes it impossible to measure health impact, coverage has clearly increased, and indicators point to a positive impact on health, particularly in the area of maternal and infant mortality and morbidity. However, several problems remain.  CHW performance was less effective than that of other volunteers and may be declining over time; their services remain more curative than preventive, and some of them are providing services for which they were not trained (although their training has been lengthened, 4 weeks is still insufficient). Supervision is the project's weakest element and needs strengthening. Finally, monitoring and evaluation are not functioning as expected; the information system is cumbersome and ineffective and evaluation, while well designed, is not comprehensive. A follow-on project is recommended.  This project should:  (1) provide medical kits at the start of training, increase medicine supplies to last 1 year, and help volunteers find ways to resupply kits; (2) upgrade the training and supervision systems; (3) develop an information system from the bottom up to exploit good RHC data; and (4) establish evaluation priorities. Recommendations for USAID/B beyond the follow-on project are included.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","2/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Health delivery|Primary health care|Rural areas|Community health workers|Volunteers|Paramedical education|Beneficiary interviews","Burma","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAR145.pdf","3,585 KB","008521 - USAID.

"Evaluates pilot project to develop, test, and extend renewable energy technologies suitable to Botswanan villages.  Final evaluation covers the period 1/84-4/85 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with project and Government of Botswana (GOB) staff and with participating villagers. Contrary to expectations, the project has demonstrated that there may be no satisfactory village-level renewable energy technologies applicable in Botswana.  Although project R&D showed that significant fuelwood savings are available from metal cook stoves, retained heat cookers, batch solar water heaters, and mud stoves, none of these technologies have been successfully extended to villagers.  Work on the mud stove was terminated due to problems with durability, quality control, and utilization, while traditional cooking and washing habits inhibited extension of retained heat cookers and solar water heaters. Metal stoves are of interest, but production, marketing, and affordability problems may be insurmountable. Renewable energy for water pumping appears more promising. Performance and cost data are being collected on wind, photovoltaic, biogas, animal and human traction, diesel, and electric pumping systems. Another 1-2 years of study will be needed to determine the economic feasibility of these options. The development of monitoring equipment for the pumping tests has been an important, unplanned project output, of potential use elsewhere in Africa. The contractor has tried to follow each recommendation in the mid-term evaluation and will meet or surpass almost all revised outputs. The most important issue still facing the project is the lack of definite plans for incorporating project activities into other GOB programs. It was learned that:  (1) renewable energy technology pilot projects should be designed more clearly around end use topics and if possible incorporated into larger projects (e.g., agricultural research, housing) that address end use; (2) the project was too ambitious and based on questionable concepts (these errors were remedied during the 1/84 evaluation); and (3) projects should be revised to reflect changing conditions, even if changes result in implementation delays. Recommendations are reflected in the action decisions of the attached PES (PD-AAR-147).","Attached to PD-AAR-147","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Renewable energy resources|Alternative energy technology|Pilot projects|Beneficiary interviews|Limited data plus","Botswana","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAR147A.pdf","453 KB","008516 - USAID.

"Evaluates health education project implemented by Catholic Relief Services (CRS) in the West Bank.  Final evaluation covers the period 10/79-10/84 and is based primarily on a questionnaire survey of 1,137 women and data from a child weight measurement program. The questionnaire survey compared child care practices in villages where health education (HE) was provided with those in nonparticipating villages.  The results indicate a definite trend toward better health in HE villages, where there were fewer infant deaths partly due to increased prenatal care and more hospital deliveries.  Longer breastfeeding was practiced in HE villages, as advocated by the program. In addition, first aid procedures (including ice or cold water applications to wounds) were used more by mothers in these villages, and there was a greater readiness to consult doctors and a more realistic understanding of the relation of cleanliness to prevention of diarrhea (a significant cause of infant death) and other diseases caused by germs. Oral rehydration therapy for diarrhea was used more in HE villages. Of the 6,524 children weighed in the HE program since 2/81, 70.4% remained at or increased to 90/100% of the Harvard Standard; 20.4% achieved 80/90% of the Standard; and 5.4% remained below 80%.  The weighing program also served as an educational tool for mothers, and provided doctors with a valuable child health history, including vaccinations and other medical information. Other indicators of the project's impact - referrals to doctors, clinics, and hospitals; mothers' health class attendance; personal observations; and feedback from villagers and other health classes participants - have also been positive. Apparently the greatest complaint is that CRS is not involved in more villages or providing services to a greater area.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/ne-G-1652","","5/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Health education|Family health care|Child health care|Beneficiary count|Beneficiary interviews|Public data|Sampling method|Limited data plus","West Bank","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAR218.pdf","1,718 KB","007337 - Catholic Relief Services (CRS)","","002062 - USAID.

"Evaluates rural development project in Niger's Niamey Department. Second interim evaluation covers the period 1983-2/85 and is based on document review, interviews with project personnel, and field visits. Although the recommendation of the 1983 evaluation that the project stress institution building rather than quantitative outputs has led to the improvements noted below, the TA team has generally adopted its own, rather than the project's priorities. As a result, the project as a whole suffers from lack of support services and poor communication and flow of information and evinces a mixed record. While the technical package extended through the farmer training centers (CPT's) has improved, graduates of the CPT program - which only began in 1983 and was hindered by lack of rain in 1984 - have been slow to adopt the package.  Project staff and CPT trainers need to better understand the various elements of the package and to support trainee efforts to apply what they have learned.  A systematic program to adapt the package to the different growing conditions in the project area should be developed. In regard to strengthening local organizations, the project has improved the credit management system notably; past accounts and loan records have been reconciled and brought up to date, and a computerized management information system is being established for the National Agricultural Credit Fund (CNCA).  The project has also established a sound input distribution and inventory management system and made progress in training cooperative managers.  Steps are being taken in both of these components to transfer management responsibility to local organizations.  Both have suffered, however, from inadequate follow-up and logistical support. The project's most obvious impact on strengthening government technical services has been the addition of the CPT's to the agricultural extension program.  The CNCA program in Niamey Department has also been strengthened considerably.  There has been no impact at all, however, on two very important institutions - the Animation Service and the National Union of Cooperatives, which has replaced the National Credit and Cooperative Union (UNCC). Numerous recommendations address these issues as the project moves into Phase III.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-0000-I-18-3078-00","","2/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Rural development|Agricultural technology|Agricultural extension|Farmer training|Training centers|Institution building|Agricultural cooperatives|Agricultural credit|Agricultural inputs|Government departments|Local level|Technical assistance","Niger","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDBAV457.pdf","6,847 KB","006727 - Development Alternatives, Inc.

"Evaluates project to provide an adequate supply of clean drinking water to the Kionzo community in Zaire.  Special final evaluation covers the period 1/83-4/85 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with key participants. Although the project was well designed, a series of setbacks during its implementation phase have made its success doubtful. The originator of the plan, a priest at Kionzo Catholic mission, left the country soon after A.I.D. had agreed to finance the project.  A local company, Ateliers de Construction Electrique de Charleroi (ACEC), agreed to install the water distribution system, although only a small sum was offered in payment and the company had very limited experience in water distribution systems.  The senior field engineer, who was extremely competent, agreed to handle the project himself; unfortunately, he died in an automobile accident before installation began.  ACEC continued, installing two hydraulic rams to pump water to seven villages and the mission. The original plan, to connect two reservoirs separately to the two hydraulic rams, was changed to join the supply pipes 800 meters before one of the reservoirs.  Larger pipes were not installed to absorb the increased quantity of water, and excess pressure during the rainy season caused the supply pipes to burst.  A number of failures followed this accident, although ACEC made - and is continuing to make - every effort to repair the system.  Funds were lacking to solve the problem by installing larger pipes or running independent pipes from each water source to the reservoir. The project should be viewed not as a failure, but as a pilot effort showing problems to avoid in future projects.  When the system was working it was of great value to the villagers, and the hydraulic rams are a simple, appropriate method of providing water with minimal cost and upkeep.  However, such a small independent activity necessarily competes with larger investments by A.I.D., absorbing more staff time than its value warrants; it would be more effectively conducted in a larger framework of technology testing, adaptation, and dissemination, carefully monitored.","Attached to PD-AAR-254","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","4/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Potable water|Rural areas|Water pumps|Water supply engineering|Limited data plus","Congo DR","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAR254A.pdf","250 KB","008626 - USAID.

"Evaluates project in the Dominican Republic to provide skills training to needy students.  Special evaluation covers the period 5/83-5/85 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with key participants. Although the project is, in general, efficiently disbursing loans to its intended target group of low-income students, there is no certainty that project-financed training is being provided in priority areas. Labor market data were to be provided by the National Institute of Professional and Technical Training (INFOTEP), which dropped out of the project at the last minute (leaving the Educational Credit Foundation (FCE) as sole implementor), and no other institution with the capacity to provide labor market analyses has yet been identified.  There is great concern as to whether the government will be able to employ the 434 (of a total of 1,934) students being trained as agricultural technicians.  As follow-up procedures are not well developed, the employment status of the 394 students who have graduated can only be inferred from the fact that their loans are being repaid. Nor is the project meeting its institutional development objectives. Neither faculty training nor institutional subloans have been been provided; the former was made financially impossible when the peso was devalued and the latter complicated both by this factor and by participating training institutions' failure to appoint advisory committees (another area in which INFOTEP was to have been involved) and/or to articulate institutional development plans.  A consultant has recently been hired by FCE to aid institutions with their development plans. Nonetheless, the project's student loans have provided significant capital to the institutions and in fact have been indispensable to the growth of small and/or new schools. Project TA was ineffective in strengthening either FCE or the training institutions.  FCE has not revised its organizational structure to reflect project activities.  However, staff have received both off-shore and in-house training, and grants to improve FCE computer capabilities were very successful. The project teaches that the quality of TA is crucial.","Attached to PD-AAR-263","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","5/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Student loans|Vocational training|Educational facilities|Labor research|Beneficiary count|Limited data plus","Dominican Republic","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAR263A.pdf","1,162 KB","008537 - USAID.

"The net economic benefits of microenterprise assistance projects in Burkina Faso, Brazil, Honduras, the Dominican Republic, and Peru are compared in order to determine the factors responsible for project success.  All except the project in Peru were designed and implemented by private voluntary organizations (PVO's). Following an overview of the microenterprise sector, the paper describes the methodology used to calculate project benefits.  Based on sales, profits, wages, and employment data, three measures of net economic benefit can be calculated:  (1) the minimum estimate, derived from the increase in value added to the firm with a deduction for the opportunity cost of labor; (2) the maximum estimate, which assumes lower labor opportunity costs; and (3) the most likely estimate, which falls in between the above two extremes by factoring in omitted variables. Separate chapters analyze each project, describing its design and implementation and presenting a step-by-step construction of the three benefit estimates.  A final chapter compares the performance of the five projects in terms of project design, the external environment, the credit delivery system, technical assistance, project costs, and PVO contribution. Numerous tables and a 12-item bibliography (1980-83) are provided.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","6/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Small scale enterprises|Development projects|Private enterprises|Private voluntary organizations|Cost benefit analysis|Commercial credit|Economic benefit|Microenterprises","Burkina Faso|Brazil|Honduras|Dominican Republic|Peru","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAL056.pdf","1,848 KB","000088 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to promote breastfeeding among urban Honduran women.  Special mid-term evaluation covers the period 1982-84 and is based on visits to the 3 project hospitals, interviews with the hospitals' medical, nursing, and Department chiefs, and informal discussions with staff and mothers. Through its education programs, two national conferences, and hospital-level impact, PROALMA (the implementing agency) has made noteworthy strides in raising awareness among health personnel of the importance of breastfeeding; results have become especially apparent in the latter half of 1984.  A PROALMA office has been established in each hospital, PROALMA personnel are known and considered dedicated by hospital staff, and these staff strongly support continuation of the project.  Counterpart committees have been formed in each hospital, and revised procedures for labor, delivery, newborn nursery, premature nursery, and pediatrics - prepared by the committees and PROALMA staff to promote and support breastfeeding, mother-infant bonding, and rooming-in - have been approved and published. Maternal milk banks with trained personnel and electric milk pumps have been established in the hospitals, and identification cards have been issued to nursing mothers, allowing them to enter the hospital to nurse at any time; as a result, most prematures are receiving mother's milk and mortality among these infants is decreasing.  Also, fewer children have been hospitalized for diarrhea, and all hospitals have realized savings through decreased purchasing of infant formulas. It is recommended that:  a 2-year project extension be considered; PROALMA staff be maintained and possibly incorporated as permanent hospital staff; physician education be continued, particularly for obstetricians (the most resistant to change); better Ministry of Health linkages be sought; increasing the number of milk banks and extending PROALMA activities to other regional hospitals be considered; educational services for women (especially prenatal) and support for working mothers be increased; committee motivation be continued; and training be provided for the PROALMA staff in data collection methodology.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/DSAN-C-0209","","3/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Breastfeeding|Hospitals|Nutrition education|Maternal child health care|Postnatal nutrition|Beneficiary interviews|Limited data plus","Honduras","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAR324.pdf","2,237 KB","000657 - Education Development Center, Inc.

"Evaluates project to help the Institute of Regional Languages (IRL) promote primary literacy instruction in the local languages of southern Sudan.  Final evaluation covers the period 7/79-12/84 and is based primarily on student performance testing. The project successfully helped develop educational materials in 7 languages and trained a number of teachers to write and utilize such materials.  Moreover, it had a limited, but nonetheless positive, impact on the development of vernacular literacy skills among children who would not otherwise have had access to such. It also produced much knowledge which can be transferred to future endeavors in preliterate rural societies. Two key non-project factors limited the success of literacy instruction:  (1) teaching methods in southern Sudan, which focused on classroom repetition of syllables, words, and sentences, rather than the reading for comprehension approach; and (2) teacher training, which was generally insufficient and did not alleviate the problems of poor teacher and student attendance, and shortages of both teachers and teachers' aides. Also, the project-developed teaching materials contained much repetition of the same words and concepts, a limited number of instructional activities, and an unacceptable number of typographical errors.  Even so, however, the availability and use of reading materials within and outside school did affect student performance positively.  Also, materials developed later in the project were more effective than were those designed initially, indicating that materials can make a difference even where teaching methods are inadequate and teachers poorly trained. The project shows that, in preliterate societies, it is necessary to create the climate for literacy in the community; reading skills must be useful and appreciated both within and outside the school to sustain literacy.  Moreover, the impact of multilingual literacy programs is dependent on cultural, economic, and political variables.  In southern Sudan, fear of dominance by Arabic-speaking northerners has led to parental support for the multilingual approach, but other sociocultural factors (e.g., the need for child labor at home) have limited actual performance. Assessments of local attitudes (via questionnaires) should be conducted prior to establishing literacy programs.","Evaluation period: 30 Jul 1979-31 Dec 1984","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/afr-G-1564","","1/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Literacy instruction|Reading instruction|Rural areas|Local languages|Primary education|Educational materials","Sudan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDBAU471.pdf","5,239 KB","002223 - Summer Institute of Linguistics, Inc.","","008607 - USAID.

"Factors contributing to the dynamic growth of a modern, private sector seed industry in Thailand over the past 9 years are reviewed. A.I.D.'s 1975 and 1981 seed development loans have been a major factor.  Implemented by the Ministry of Agriculture with excellent technical assistance from Mississippi State University, the projects have established six seed centers.  While primarily aimed at producing improved rice seed for distribution to disaster victims, the centers' ability to process improved seed of other species and their small size and location in rural areas close to producers and markets enable them to demonstrate and transfer appropriate technology to private seed producers.  A major component of the second loan has been creation of - and MSU participation in - a Seed Club composed of representatives of the Thai seed industry's public, private, and education sectors. The timing of the projects was essential; the first coincided with the development in 1975 of Suwan I, a high-yielding, downy mildew-resistant corn which demonstrated the commercial viability of varietal seed production and provided the catalyst for private sector investment.  The development of Suwan I was a crown in the Royal Thai Government's (RTG) extensive varietal research program, dating back to the 1940's, which, together with the RTG's promotion of agricultural development within the context of a free enterprise, market-based economy and its efforts to disseminate information to farmers and investors, develop an agricultural extension service, and increase private sector activity through the Board of Investment, has been a critical factor in the growth of the seed industry. The industry's growth has also been abetted by the Thai university system's contribution of several research breakthroughs and a good supply of trained scientists and technicians; A.I.D. participant training and crop development programs; other donor programs (Rockefeller Foundation, the European Economic Community, Japan); as well as a stable socioeconomic system, and good public infrastructure. Suggestions are made for ways in which the RTG and A.I.D. can continue successful private sector development.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","6/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Seed production|Private sector|Public sector|Agricultural enterprises|Agribusiness|Technology transfer|Host country cooperation","Thailand","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAL047.pdf","1,353 KB","003433 - USAID.

"With the help of A.I.D. seed capital, the public sector Corporacion Financiera Compania Nacional (CFN) and the private sector Financiera Ecuatoriana de Desarrollo, S.A. (COFIEC) were established in the mid-1960's to provide long-term financing for industrial development in Ecuador.  This study examines the relative success of these two institutions, as well as some of their shortfalls.  The study:  (1) analyzes the macroeconomic context in which the banks were created and in which they have operated, especially the industrial and financial sectors and the institutional and legal factors affecting them; (2) reviews the banks' development, management and lending procedures, portfolios, and financial performance; and (3) and analyzes a representative sample of A.I.D. subloan projects. Together, CFN and COFIEC mobilized about 25% of all the capital invested in medium- and large-scale industry between 1966 and 1982 and contributed to the creation of 45% of the new jobs in the sector during that period.  Both have also provided a training ground for financiera administrators.  CFN has been more demanding in loan evaluation and administration (only about a third of its clients seek repeat loans), but currently maintains a higher-quality loan portfolio.  The more growth-oriented COFIEC has maintained higher profitability through higher risk.  CFN has focused more heavily in larger and longer term loans, i.e., manufacturing, and has been relatively more active outside of Quito and Guayaquil, the foci of both institutions' efforts; lending by COFIEC outside these cities has been mainly for agriculture in Guaya Province. Among lessons learned are that:  both public and private development finance institutions can effectively allocate resources for industrial development, each likely to be more effective in the presence of the other; the availability of resources constrains the term structure of sublending, reflecting the influence of macroeconomic policies on financing supply as well as demand; both institutions are overly dependent on external resources, and as a result have been severely affected by recent devaluations and foreign currency exposure. Subloan and CFN/COFIEC financial data are provided in appendices.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","6/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Industrial development|Industrial credit|Industrial development banks|Private sector|Public sector|Development strategies|Beneficiary interviews","Ecuador","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAL051.pdf","2,458 KB","003433 - USAID.

"Interviews with beneficiaries provide the main basis for this impact assessment of two loan projects undertaken by A.I.D. in the 1970's to spur development among Dominican Republic small farmers. The first loan, channeled through the public-private Agricultural Bank, provided small farmers with credit, technical assistance, and vocational training and financed the construction of rural infrastructure.  The second loan was designed mostly to upgrade the Ministry of Agriculture's (MOA) capabilities to serve the small farm sector, although credit was still a notable component. The loans enabled the Government of the Dominican Republic (GODR) to increase the provision of credit to small farmers and contributed to ongoing training programs for Bank and MOA personnel and for farmers. However, there is no evidence that the increases in food crop production and in use of modern inputs during the projects' time frames were due to the higher availability of credit.  Further, the local institutions which employed the projects' trainees were and remain weak and so have been unable to use their new personnel effectively.  Finally, the MOA's provision of agricultural services was ineffective and may have inhibited the growth of the for-profit agricultural services sector. Sustainability is a major issue.  Few, if any, activities are being efficiently implemented and positive gains have not been sustained.  The loans were overambitious and highlight the difficulty of promoting development through subsidized credit and services. The main lesson learned is that human and financial resources cannot have significant impact within a non-supportive economic policy and institutional environment; as the projects unfolded, P.L. 480 Title I proceeds had to used to prevent a complete collapse of some efforts. Another lesson is that credit cannot generate agricultural development, but only facilitate investment in existing productive activities - few of which, apart from rice, are available to Dominican Republic small farmers.  A final lesson is that existing economic and development incentives must be favorable to project goals.  Since the GODR's pro-urban bias was clear at the time the loans were planned, a move to a neutral structure of incentives might have led to increased impacts.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","6/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural development|Agricultural credit|Small farms|Beneficiary interviews","Dominican Republic","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAL048.pdf","71 KB","003433 - USAID.

"The effectiveness of AID-supported efforts by the Government of Indonesia (GOI) and the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) to promote indigenous private manufacture of agricultural machinery in target areas is assessed.  Although it is too early to draw firm conclusions as to the program's direct socioeconomic benefits, the feasibility of substituting less costly and more easily maintained and repaired Indonesian-made farm machinery for imported machinery has been established. The technology being transferred under the IRRI-GOI program is easily adopted by small manufacturers because it requires little capital or equipment and relies on skills already present in many rural workshops. While firms varying in size and market orientation have participated in the program, sustained commitment is found only among smaller fabricators directly linked to farmers; IRRI-type equipment now represents an important part of the livelihood of these entrepreneurs. Program efforts have also successfully turned around GOI policy toward locally manufactured farm equipment; import bans have been imposed and credit made more available to both manufacturers and buyers of small farm equipment. Indigenous manufacture has already spread spontaneously beyond target areas, and it appears that the program is replicable in other Indonesian provinces, or, with some modifications, in other countries with a suitable policy environment and sufficient sophistication in metal fabrication.  Replication with respect to nonagricultural manufacturing, however, is less likely to be successful - only in agricultural manufacturing is fabrication so closely linked to service and so dependent on local adaptation of design.  Also, the fact that much of the program's success is due to the enormous dedication and enthusiasm of the IRRI project officer and his Indonesian counterparts creates further doubts about replication on a broader scale. Lessons learned are:  the overall business environment for fabricators must be favorable; developing country commitment to a clearly articulated policy and program for farm mechanization must exist; and coordination among and within the principal involved ministries is essential.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","6/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Business enterprises|Small scale enterprises|Manufacturing|Agricultural equipment|Technology transfer","Indonesia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAL052.pdf","4,017 KB","003433 - USAID.

"Evaluates Housing Guaranty (HG) project to fund low-cost housing and community facilities in Gaborone West and a related project to provide TA and training to Botswanan housing agencies. Special evaluation covers the period 9/82-3/85; no methodology is given. Development of Gaborone West has been hindered by various - mostly institutional - factors.  Construction of community facilities (schools, municipal offices, health and commercial facilities) is behind schedule, partly because of a water shortage which led to a temporary ban on water connections. Allocation of residential plots by the Gaborone Self-Help Housing Agency (SHHA) began in 4/84 after the ban was lifted; 80.5% of plots have been allocated to 1,398 beneficiaries, of whom 1,115 have received a land certificate.  Verification of applicant eligibility has been virtually ignored by the SHHA, however. Also, only 33% of allottees have received TA in house design and construction and only 15% have received building material loans; regular inspection of homes under construction has been lacking, due partly to problems in establishing regular work hours for SHHA staff. The SHHA's performance has deteriorated over the past few years due in large part to weak leadership and to confusion as to whether the SHHA is primarily a regulatory or a development agency.  Staff morale is low. The advisor assigned to the SHHA has received little support from his superior as to personnel management and community development matters and as a result has focused on technical improvements.  On the positive side, the advisor has been assigned a very capable counterpart and the Ministry of Local Government and Lands (MLGL) is aware of the SHHA's problems and endeavoring to correct them. Two project advisors (along with a third from the World Bank) have been assigned to the MLGL's Housing Section (established in 1983) where, despite difficulties generic to new undertakings, they are contributing to housing policy development and making progress in helping to define administrative procedures for the Section. Training has included attendance at a Zimbabwean workshop by 21 central and local government officials; inservice training by advisors have been minimal.  Numerous recommendations - among them to provide additional training to the SHHA - are made.","Attached to PD-AAR-390","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","3/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Housing administration|Housing investment guaranty|Urban areas|Housing policy|Government departments|Beneficiary count|Limited data plus","Botswana","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAR390A.pdf","2,007 KB","","","008516 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to increase fruit crop production in Haiti's Central Plateau region.  Final special evaluation covers the period 6/83-3/85 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with key personnel and beneficiaries. Due to the diligent efforts of the implementing Societe Haitienne d'Etude et d'Execution des Projets Agricole (SHEEPA), and effective support by USAID/H, most project objectives have been attained.  Three nurseries were established, horticulture courses were provided to 25 monitors, considerable progress was made in extension and varietal research, and sophisticated techniques such as grafting were introduced. The project fell short, however, in seedling production and distribution, primarily due to drought and pest infestations; possibly objectives in these areas were overambitious.  Nonetheless, 283,000-324,000 seedlings were produced and 160,000 outplanted, mostly by individual farmers; 50,000 of the plantings were of economically valuable Francis mango trees, with a 95% survival rate. environmental effects cannot be judged with certainty, the outplantings should help to stabilize the Plateau region's erosion and deforestation problems. Overall, 829-1,192 farmers were reached; there is potential for substantial economic returns to these farmers and to the region as a whole - mostly from distribution of mango seedlings - in the not-too-distant future. Lack of TA was a serious constraint after the first 6 months, when the principal expatriate advisor resigned unexpectedly.  The USAID/H project manager was unable to fully substitute for him, and the lack of professional TA for the remainder of the project affected both project outcomes and the ability of SHEEPA, a relatively young organization, to establish firm technical capabilities.  In addition, interventions by the possibly envious Ministry of Agriculture slowed the importation of valuable plant propagation materials, and forced emphasis in seed production in favor of cashews, despite serious disease problems with these trees.  Almost all the cashew nut trees will probably be lost; cashew cultivation should be halted immediately until disease-resistant seed can be obtained from Brazil.","Attached to PD-AAR-398","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","6/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Fruit crops|Mangoes|Tropical fruits|Agroforestry|Beneficiary count|Beneficiary interviews","Haiti","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAR398A.pdf","2,430 KB","008554 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to develop a fish culture extension service in Rwanda.  Special evaluation covers the period 9/81-12/84 and is based on document review, site visits, and personal and group interviews. Although poor management has caused delays in extension, construction, and training, as well as inefficient control of the local cost budget with resulting delinquent salary payments to some moniteurs and support staff, progress has been made towards attaining quantifiable targets.  A total of 1,458 fish farmers, owners of 525 ponds, are being reached, and appropriate fish culture techniques are being applied.  The introduction of improved fish transport techniques, the use of holding tanks, and the extension methodology have already had a positive effect. Training of moniteurs has been especially effective; the 33 moniteurs (13 project-trained) currently working in project zones are proving motivated and knowledgeable.  In 1984, 58 new fish ponds were built, and 89 were under construction in 1/85. Less positively, however, of the six fish stations in project zones only two are fully operational, and station management is very poor, characterized by inadequate recordkeeping, high fish mortality, and general lack of planning. Commercial production is, at best, at one-half to one-third of its potential. Overall project management has suffered from breakdown of communications among the project director, the Auburn University team (which is technically very competent and has managed its operations adequately), the Ministry of Agriculture, and the Office of the A.I.D. Representative/R (which cannot provide intensive monitoring due to staffing problems).  These parties have been using different documents (project paper, PROAG, TA contract) as the basis of implementation, and both confusion and outright disagreement have resulted. Forty recommendations are made, among them to:  (1) limit extension services to six geographic zones within five prefectures, instead of all 10 prefectures as originally planned; (2) schedule another evaluation before 1/86 to determine if collaboration among the interested parties has been established and management improvements realized; (3) strengthen the training of agronomes, responsible for station management.","Attached to PD-AAR-411|French ed.: XD-AAT-912-A","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Fish culture|Fishery development|Agricultural extension|Beneficiary count","Rwanda","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAR411A.pdf","2,636 KB","008598 - USAID.

"Evaluates P.L. 480 Title II program implemented by Caritas in Honduras.  Special evaluation, prepared under project 9361406, covers the period 1984-5/85 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with project volunteers and beneficiaries and with Catholic Relief Services (CRS), Caritas, and USAID/H staff. Following a 1984 audit, Caritas improved program management considerably by placing a full-time employee in charge and by decentralizing administration to reduce friction between national and diocesean priorities.  Improvements in administration have led to better reporting and better coordination of plans and food distribution, although reporting is still delayed and the overall program is still inadequately supervised.  Unfortunately, the program was disrupted by a misunderstanding that left Caritas unaware of an A.I.D. delay in the 1985 third-quarter call forward, and it is probable that not all FY85 approved food can be used; however, the resulting emptying of warehouses encouraged better inventory management. The Caritas program still falls short of formal A.I.D. and CRS standards, especially for operations (weighing, supervision, storage) that cost money.  However, through the network of volunteers from community groups who distribute the food, the program successfully reaches the most disadvantaged - 15,600 through maternal child feeding (called Vaso Nutricional - VN) and 7,462 through Food for Work (FFW) vs. respective approvals of 19,250 and 5,500.  While Caritas priorities for VN differ from A.I.D.'s by focusing on feeding the poor rather than on strict nutritional improvement, VN does so at a cost low enough to justify its continued existence despite nutritional gains more modest than those of more sophisticated programs.  The FFW program links well with host government agencies, shows few disincentive effects, and strengthens the Caritas housewife clubs in food production and social development programs. With help from CRS, which has appointed a new country representative to support the program, Caritas should generate the added financial support it needs to alleviate long-standing supervision, transport, and facility problems.  The current program merits a gradual increase in tonnage and in beneficiary allocations.","Work order no. 80|Companion project evaluation summary: PD-AAR-841","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-1406-I-00-4061-00","","5/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Food for Peace Title II|Food for Work|Maternal child feeding programs|Private voluntary organizations|Beneficiary count|Beneficiary interviews","Honduras","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAR364.pdf","3,415 KB","002615 - John Snow Public Health Group, Inc.","","008555 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to help the Tonga Cooperative Foundation (TCF) achieve solvency and financial independence, enabling it to provide member cooperatives with marketing services.  Special evaluation covers the period 1/82-5/85 and is based on site visits and interviews with key personnel. TCF has been very successful in consumer goods wholesaling; channels, structures, and procedures for this activity are now well established. TCF's vanilla and fish marketing endeavors are less well developed, however.  The vanilla industry in Tonga has for the most part been based on cooperatives' sales to American buyers.  Recently, serious competition for vanilla beans has come from the Government of Tonga's (GOT) Commodities Marketing Board and a few sole proprietors, who export to Australia and New Zealand.  For the first time, vanilla producers believe that they could have received more money for their crop by not selling through their cooperative.  An improperly cured vanilla crop in 1984 further damaged TCF's competitive position, but a new GOT quality assurance program should alleviate this problem. TCF has begun developing market channels for the new domestic fish industry, which is being promoted by GOT projects such as subsidized fishing boats and fisherman training.  TCF provides a ready market for the fish at a fair price by freezing and shipping them to Tongatapu. Unfortunately, other GOT programs tend to destabilize the market, as does GOT ambivalence about continuing aid for freezing and transportation. TCF will apparently be split, with the wholesale business retaining the TCF name and a new organization responsible for vanilla and fish marketing, as well as handicrafts, fishery supplies, and farm produce marketing.  This division would ease the burden on the Management Committee, but there is much doubt as to whether the new organization will be able to survive independently.  It is hoped that A.I.D. or another donor will provide assistance. Recommendations for the current grant are to strengthen TCF's position in vanilla and fish marketing by constructing a 3-ton capacity central vanilla curing shed in Vavau and establishing a retail fish market in Nukualofa.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/879-0251-G-00-1013-00","","7/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Cooperatives|Business enterprises|Consumer goods|Wholesale marketing|Agricultural product marketing|Limited data","Tonga","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAR437.pdf","1,897 KB","000238 - Agricultural Cooperative Development International (ACDI)","","000039 - USAID.

"Evaluates the Industrial Management Program, a project component to provide in-country training to public sector employees of Egyptian companies under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Industry.  Special evaluation covers the period 9/82-6/85 and is based on document review and interviews with project, Government of Egypt, and USAID/E personnel. The program was generally successful in providing training opportunities to public company and public institution employees. Tailored training courses in economics and business management, industrial project operation and implementation, and environmental protection were provided to 458 persons; approximately 75 percent of the eligible companies from almost all industrial sectors enrolled employees in the tailored program.  Trainees' course evaluations and self-assessments indicated a high degree of satisfaction with the program. In addition to the tailored program, the American University of Cairo (AUC) identified 18 standard courses in its curriculum which responded to training needs which had been revealed in a survey of industrial firms.  Approximately 450 trainees have enrolled in the AUC courses. Although the program has successfully increased the skills of individual trainees, it has not yet been possible to assess the on-the-job impacts of the training or the willingness of senior management to allow trainees to use their new skills.  Also, to ensure impacts at the company level, a critical mass would have to be developed within the firm.  The latter has been partially constrained by the General Organization for Industry's desire to maximize the number of firms participating in the program. It is recommended that the project be extended, but modified to: include training for private sector employees; institute closer coordination with related projects; employ a sector focus when selecting participant companies; familiarize senior managers with the range of available assistance to industry; and expand existing reporting systems to include follow-up assessments.  The Near East abstract (on which this abstract is based) notes that USAID/E has decided not to extend the program, but rather to focus on assistance to private industry.","Attached to PD-AAR-408","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","6/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Mid level managers|Management development|Management education|Management training|Industrial management|Public sector|Beneficiary count","Egypt","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAR408A.pdf","582 KB","000394 - Coopers and Lybrand Associates, Ltd.","","008539 - USAID.

"Evaluates OPG to International Human Assistance Programs, Inc. (IHAP) to conduct a community-based integrated rural development project in the Maldives' Raa Atoll.  Special final evaluation covers the period through 1/85 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with Government of the Maldives (GRM) and project personnel and with beneficiaries. Due mostly to its managers' enthusiasm and technical competence, the project has been successful in a number of areas.  Activities which affect small segments of the population (e.g., a loan program) were temporarily deferred in order to first address infrastructural priorities with broader social ramifications. Schools have been constructed using local materials and labor, and staffed.  A hospital and water tanks have also been built, and sanitation has been improved significantly through construction and adoption of Maldive Ash Toilets. Most training programs for health workers and traditional birth assistants and island committees (in decisionmaking) have been successful although health trainees will continue to need supervision, and committee members will require follow-up support from the GRM.  A pilot project for marking trees may result in better conservation techniques, and a rat control program has led to a 60% drop in coconut crop losses.  The income generation loan program is providing valuable experience with credit, but to date is mostly benefiting the wealthy. The high level of community involvement in the project has kept costs low and increased local confidence in the principle of self-help; the latter suggests that project activities will be sustained. On the negative side, the project proposal was too ambitious and the role of the project managers as administrative supervisors never clearly defined.  This led to a misunderstanding by the GRM about self-help projects and division between the GRM and the project managers.  Also, because the proposal gave inadequate guidance regarding the priorities and sequencing of activities, an inordinate amount of energy and expertise has been spent on health activities.  Agricultural and women in development efforts have been neglected, in part, due to the poor institutional framework of the GRM and a lack of interest and experience on the part of the project managers. A list of 17 recommendations is included.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","ASB-0251-G-SS-1056-00","","2/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Integrated rural development|Community participation|Community self help|Beneficiary interviews","Maldives","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAR451.pdf","5,469 KB","001370 - International Human Assistance Programs, Inc.","","000043 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to strengthen the Government of Bangladesh's (BDG) agricultural research (AR) capacity.  External evaluation covers the period 1983-4/85 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with involved personnel. The project has made significant strides.  A number of new high-yielding varieties have been developed, and excellent work is being done in analyzing how these fit into traditional cropping systems. Research, extension, and farmer linkages have been developed through on-farm cropping systems research; plans are maturing for incorporating non-crop activities into the field program to achieve a full farming systems approach.  Many farmers have adopted new varieties and improved cropping patterns, but monitoring is weak and a major effort is needed to expand farmer adoption of new technologies; researchers must ""package"" their results, particularly at moderate input levels, and get them into the national extension program. The performance of the contractor, International Agricultural Development Service (IADS), has improved substantially.  More improvements are planned, and with a full complement of qualified personnel now in place, good management should become routine. Research management by the Bangladesh Agricultural Research Council (BARC) has also improved, but remains constrained by inadequate scientific staffing and by the BDG's disinclination to allow the BARC authority to make budgetary and personnel decisions. The BARC's role will be enhanced, however, when as planned, it becomes more involved in reviewing the long-range and annual plans of the BDG's national AR institutes.  A National AR Plan, which has been prepared by BARC with IADS assistance, will provide criteria to guide BARC reviews. Research productivity has been constrained by insufficient BDG funding for AR operating expenses.  A.I.D. has relieved the problem temporarily with P.L. 480 Title II funds, but a permanent solution is essential.  This will require changes in BDG philosophy and procedure. Decentralization of AR activities has progressed substantially, abetted at the regional level by IADS production agronomists. There are critical personnel shortages throughout the AR system, but particularly at the field level.  The number of trainees sent for degree work overseas has been limited due to delays in choosing candidates, while short-term out-of-country training has been stifled by the cumbersome BDG approval process.","Companion project evaluation summary: PD-CAP-768","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","5/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Research organizations|Agricultural research|Research planning|Institution building|Research management|Beneficiary interviews","Bangladesh","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAR452.pdf","7,216 KB","001067 - Bangladesh Agricultural Research Council (BARC)|004127 - International Agricultural Development Service","","008511 - USAID.

"Evaluates Combatting Childhood Communicable Diseases (CCCD) project in Zaire.  Special mid-term evaluation covers the period 8/82-2/85 and is based on document review, field visits, questionnaire interviews of health workers, and interviews with project staff. With few exceptions, the project is well organized and well run; substantial progress has been made in integrating CCCD services into primary health care (PHC) and in distributing support supplies and equipment.  The number of health zones with access to CCCD services has increased from 17 to 25 in urban areas and from 14 to 105 in rural areas.  Training has been provided, in-country and abroad, to doctors, nurses, technicians, village health workers, and PCV's. The goal of reducing child mortality by 50% in 4 years seems unrealistic - vaccination and access goals are being reached, but reducing diarrhea and malaria (the latter the main cause of child mortality in Zaire) will take longer.  Vaccination coverage is especially good in the more well developed health zones, but in newer rural zones coverage dropped slightly when fixed vaccine centers replaced mobile ones; the vaccination program is self-supporting in 9 of 13 zones visited, a very encouraging finding.  Although use of oral rehydration salts (ORS) has risen rapidly, ORS acceptance by both health workers and clients has been far slower than expected due primarily to delayed health education campaigns.  Regarding malaria, presumptive chloroquine treatment of fever in children is widespread, but prophylaxis for pregnant women is less so, partly because women wait until the 8th or 9th month for prenatal care; also, mothers are more willing to pay for ORS or chloroquine for a sick child than for prophylaxis for themselves. Much remains to be done to make CCCD services more widely used. The project's failure to support regional vaccination infrastructure has been a major constraint on CCCD-PHC integration.  The most serious concern at this point, however, is financial.  It does not appear - given the level of Zairian funding provided thus far - that the host government will assume full funding of operating costs in 12/86, the planned completion date.  Some 46 recommendations are made, key among them to provide additional funding and to extend the project so that its goals can be met.","Attached to PD-AAR-461|Main text in English","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Communicable diseases|Disease prevention and control|Child health care|Vaccinations|Diarrhea|Malaria|Oral rehydration therapy","Congo DR","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAR461A.pdf","7,535 KB","004415 - Zaire.

"Evaluates project to execute marketing strategies aimed at opening new export markets for Caribbean products in the United States. Mid-term external evaluation covers the period 9/83-12/84 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with involved officials and committees. Over the past year, the project management team has done an excellent job in turning a poorly designed, managed, and implemented project into one that has begun to yield the results expected at its inception.  A 6/84 redefinition of the project recognized a number of factors not considered originally, mainly: (1) the project's complexity; (2) the need to develop a viable management structure by hiring local coordinators to monitor program activities rather than relying on volunteer participation, which has been proven unsatisfactory; and (3) a more realistic appraisal of the export potential of the majority of Caribbean small businesses and of the need for extensive training in marketing techniques.  The varying levels of development of the three territories chosen (Barbados, Saint Lucia, and Dominica) have caused a difference in focus in each one. The Partnership mechanism includes both advantages and constraints to project implementation.  Major advantages are: (1) ready access to U.S. markets; (2) ability of local sub-committees to attract business community members involved in marketing, export promotion, trade, and development; (3) access of the Partners Economic Development Sub-Committees (EDS) to human and financial resources outside the Partnership and to the national Partners financial resources. Constraints include:  (1) inability of the Partnership to ensure ready access to the U.S. market for Caribbean products; (2) difficulty in rapid and easy communication among EDS; (3) limited resources; and (4) EDS difficulty through the partnership mechanism in utilizing shared resources.  While some constraints have been resolved, a major problem still is the lack of any clearly defined plan for project continuity; without a built-in mechanism for continuity within a Partnership structure, the project is not entirely suited to the Partnership plan.","Attached to PD-AAR-462","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","2/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Regional development|Marketing|Exports|Development administration|Technical assistance|Project sustainability","Eastern Caribbean|Barbados|Dominica|Saint Lucia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAR462A.pdf","4,026 KB","","","001757 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to help the Jamaican Board of Revenue (BOR) reform its tax system.  Special evaluation covers the period 6/83-3/85 and is based on interviews with BOR and other Government of Jamaica (GOJ) officials and with staff of Syracuse University (SU) and USAID/J. The project has gone smoothly and successfully to date.  SU, working in close collaboration with GOJ economists, has completed planned analyses of the personal income tax; tax and investment incentives; and foreign trade and domestic indirect, property, and bauxite/alumina taxation and is currently pursuing studies of public enterprises, taxation of corporations and financial institutions, the incidence of taxation, and tax burdens on low-income families.  SU has also helped the BOR make substantial progress in tax administration training, revenue forecasting, and collections computerization, although progress has been slowed by delays in passing the Revenue Administration Bill and by procurement problems.  An SU working paper on tax reform - presented at a 1/85 conference and revised in light of GOJ remarks - is currently before the Prime Minister, however, and it is expected that the GOJ's program for comprehensive tax reform will be submitted to Parliament for passage in 6/86. Passing the Revenue Administration Bill and ensuring BOR capability to administer it effectively will be the more difficult phase, however, particularly given increased fiscal pressures (recent economic setbacks have included substantial currency depreciation, gasoline price increases with related civic discontent and resulting tourism losses, closings in the alumina industry, and International Monetary Fund adjustments, and revenue losses projected for FY1985-86 may necessitate non-bauxite/alumina and non-tourism tax increases), which have in turn generated political pressure from the opposition. A key project strength has been a close SU/BOR working relationship. SU must remain flexible to respond to BOR's needs (particularly strengthening revenue forecasting capability) which are expected to change with the political process.  It is recommended that SU hold a workshop with GOJ personnel in 5/85 to develop a work plan for the remainder of the project.","Attached to PD-AAR-463-A","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","3/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Tax reforms|Taxation|Policy analysis|Economic studies|Economic legislation","Jamaica","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAR463A.pdf","1,563 KB","","","008563 - USAID.

"Evaluates program (funded with P.L. 480 Title II proceeds) to create a community credit and capitalization system in rural Bolivia.  Special mid-term evaluation covers the period 7/84-6/85 and is based on review of USAID/B and FINCA/Bolivia (Fomento Integral Campesino - a nonprofit organization) documents and interviews with FINCA personnel and 522 members of 12 participating communities. While FINCA has distributed credit rapidly and widely - some $b 2,066.6 million has been lent through 433 community revolving credit funds (FRC's), benefiting 24,289 rural families (some 87% of which would not have received credit otherwise), vs. goals of 630 communities and 31,000 individuals - it has been less successful in meeting the needs of these communities and families.  Only 7% of communities have used the FRC's for group projects; the remainder have used them to make small individual loans. However, 81% of loan recipients feel the amount was too small and only 26.4% said the loan enabled them to increase production; most do not see the program as a means of future benefit to the community or to themselves. In its haste to get the program underway, FINCA included several communities which did not need the credit (these tend to be the most dissatisfied) and it did not do enough to educate communities about the program.  Decapitalization is a serious danger both for FINCA and for the FRC's.  Since only about 50% of recipients want to borrow again, it is likely that many communities will repay FINCA without capitalizing their FRC. FINCA itself has no mechanism to cover losses from delinquency (56% of communities are in arrears), or from inflation (although all loans were indexed to a specific product, repayment being made in this product, inflation has exceeded the increases in the prices of these indexed goods), losses involved in marketing the indexed products, and operating costs (which have been high despite the program's low-cost decentralized structure) and must rely on donor support.  Also, while loans do involve nominal interest costs, real interest has been negative. Recommendations to correct these defects and enable the program to achieve eventual self-sufficiency are made.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","511-0000-C-00-5083-00","","8/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Revolving fund|Community development|Capital formation|Rural areas|Credit|Village group loans|Personal loans|Financial institutions|Nonprofit organizations|Beneficiary count|Beneficiary interviews|Sampling method","Bolivia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAR473.pdf","3,195 KB","","","008515 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to establish an Urban Development Fund (UDF) within the Industrial Bank of Peru (BIP) to provide loans and TA to small businesses in urban slums.  Special evaluation covers the period 1982-4/85 and is based on document review and client surveys and interviews. The UDF has provided credit and TA to small urban enterprises that previously had no access to these services and in so doing has generated substantial economic growth and new employment in urban slums while creating a strong base within the BIP for future small business lending. Under both maximum and minimum case assumptions, the project has a high cost-benefit ratio.  A survey of 84 firms indicates that the average industrial borrower created 2 new jobs at an average loan cost of $2,000 (vs. a cost of $36,500 to create a job in Peru's modern industrial sector); service borrowers created 1.3 jobs per loan (at $4,500 cost), and commercial firms only 0.4 jobs (at $7,800).  Borrowers' net worth increased at an average yearly compounded rate of 34% and sales at a 38% rate.  However, despite impressive gains by some firms, ratio of profitability to sales declined sharply for service firms and somewhat for industrial firms since loan receipt. Fifty BIP training courses were provided to 1,250 existing or potential UDF sub-borrowers in 1984.  The project has also enabled BIP to offer savings programs in slum areas. The most serious problem is that rapid decapitalization of the UDF is occurring due to negative effective interest rates.  BIP has not made any contributions to compensate for losses in fund value nor is it in a position to do so in the near future. Also, although 75% of borrowers are able to make interest payments, 54% have high or unacceptable debt repayment burdens. Although BIP management of the UDF has been good overall, staff training has been practically nil.  Loan processing is often inefficient, certain branches have a poor collection record, and internal analysis and monitoring are inadequate.  During the first year, lending was far below target and was concentrated heavily in the Lima area; these faults have been corrected. Recommendations include a waiver of BIP's obligation to recapitalize the UDF on a yearly basis, balanced by an increase in interest rates and improved efficiency in loan processing, disbursement, and collection.","Spanish ed.: PN-AAR-476","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-1406-I-22-1097-00","","4/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Industrial credit|Commercial credit|Industrial development banks|Small scale enterprises|Slum areas|Business support services|Beneficiary count|Beneficiary interviews","Peru","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAR475.pdf","2,334 KB","006727 - Development Alternatives, Inc.

"Evaluates general support grant to help Africare promote long-term development and provide emergency relief throughout rural Africa. Special evaluation covers the period 7/82-3/85 and is based on document review, interviews with Africare and AID/W staff, and correspondence with six Missions. Africare's institutional development through 12 years of general support grants has been very successful; the latest grant (1982-85) has enabled the PVO to improve its financial management and expand both field operations and its private funding base - the latter to 30% of total support, satisfying the requirements of the Foreign Assistance Act. Over the life of the grant, Africare designed 128 projects in 17 African countries, only 14 of which were AID-funded.  While the large A.I.D. projects generate more overhead revenue and are probably less costly to administer than smaller, privately-funded projects, Africare has a comparative advantage over other PVO's in implementing the latter; a mixture is advisable. Missions have positive impressions of Africare programs - particularly the good relationships between Africare field staff and host country officials, and the competence of TA.  Most successful of Africare's new field programs is the Village Development Program (VDP); 9 VDP's have been begun in 4 countries and funding received from 3 donors for more.  Other programs initiated under the grant were less successful:  only one field technician was posted and his position was discontinued after 2 years; the planned joint venture involving a U.S. corporation and an African economic unit was never launched (nor does Africare have the specialized skills required for such a venture); and no full-time senior planners have been assigned to African ministries. Africare's program management and project monitoring are effective overall, and its proposals are generally of good quality (although often weak in specifying management responsibilities and in concern for sustainability).  Financial management is also good and much progress has been made in computerization (with more planned); reporting, though improved, remains chronically behind.  Africare's Development Resources Center expanded its acquisitions and overall use during the grant period. Recommendations are included.","Duplicate record of XD-AAS-310-A","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-1406-I-23-1097-00","","4/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Private voluntary organizations|Development programs|Development projects|Private sector|Development finance|Limited data","Africa south of Sahara","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAR482.pdf","1,702 KB","006727 - Development Alternatives, Inc.

"Evaluates project to improve the Government of Honduras' (GOH's) administrative and financial management capacities.  Special evaluation covers 1982-5/85 and is based on document review and interviews with consultants, officials of the Ministry of Finance and Public Credit (MHCP), and the Controller General. The project was overambitious in its objectives and unrealistic in its time frame.  While numerous improvements have been made in tax administration and certain treasury management functions, other outputs have little chance of being achieved in the time remaining.  Activities in procurement administration, public employee bonding, integrated accounting, franchises and exemptions, and MHCP/donor coordination are all behind schedule, in many cases because of MHCP slowness in implementing advisors' recommendations.  The computer activity has or will have completed planned outputs, but has failed to develop the specific applications on which many other project activities will depend. On the positive side, time savings are evident in the few areas in which partial implementation is taking place (although budget savings are unlikely to be achieved due to the GOH's overwhelming financial problems), and the project has notably increased awareness of administrative needs among top MHCP officials. Sustainability is in question, due partly to the project's dependence on short-term TA (often, advisors are not around long enough to support implementation of their recommendations), its legalistic approach to institutional reform (viewing change in terms of developing procedures, forms, regulations, manuals, etc.), and, most seriously, its failure to encourage counterpart participation in problem analysis and problem solving functions. Also, project activities have and will continue to be affected by factors intrinsic to the GOH - bureaucratic slowness; job security and personnel systems which engender high turnover and low morale; active resistance to change on the part of some officials; and the absence of effective informal coordination among MHCP offices. Despite these problems, the project, when fully implemented, might be successful if officials are properly trained and if a mechanism exists to follow through implementation of activities begun under the project. Extension, with redesign to increase counterpart responsibilities, is recommended.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-0000-I-20-3078-00","","5/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Management development|Government departments|Institution building|Project sustainability|Financial management|Taxation|Public administration","Honduras","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAR485.pdf","1,947 KB","006727 - Development Alternatives, Inc.

"Evaluates project to increase income and employment in Botswana through training programs in specific skill areas.  Mid-term evaluation covers the period 7/82-4/85 and is based on document review and interviews with training coordinators, Government of Botswana officials, TA personnel, and trainees. The project has made reasonable progress in providing training and TA.  To date, 104 GOB and private sector participants in long-term training have been funded, with four in short-term training overseas, and 487 participants in local training. Long-term TA has been provided by 45 operational experts (OPEXers), and consultants have provided 58 person-months of short-term TA.  Overall improvements have been made in focusing TA on key institutions, in project administration, and in funding more relevant and timely training programs.  In-country training increased sharply in 1984. To be more effective, the program needs improved communication and coordination of activities, closer linkages between training and TA, and strengthening of the local training capacity.  On the strategy level, the project should be extended and a major study made of its impact; there is also a need to identify priority skill areas.  Also, a training specialist is needed to help the Directorate of Personnel (DOP) with training plans and in-country training programs.  The DOP should coordinate the activities of key participating organizations, making selection criteria more specific and determining individual key disciplines and priority areas.  Overseas trainees require more monitoring and assistance by the contractor.  The length of U.S. short-term training should be increased. Selection criteria for TA are inadequate for individual organizational needs, and short-term TA should be task-oriented. USAID/B should encourage the provision of counterparts for all OPEXers.  A system to evaluate the performance of TA personnel is needed. In regard to management, the DOP Training and Recruitment Units need further personnel and skills to carry out their roles in coordinating training and TA efforts, monitoring project components, and formulating national plans.  There is also a need to overcome delays in document processing, reimbursements for TA personnel and allowances for overseas trainees, and other difficulties.","Attached to PD-AAR-511","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","5/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Vocational training|Participants|Technical training|Government departments|Technical assistance|Beneficiary count|Project change","Botswana","","","","","008516 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to help Nepal's Agricultural Development Council (ADC) strengthen institutional capacity in the agricultural sector. Special evaluation covers the period 1982-3/85 and is based on interviews with ADC, Government of Nepal (GON), and USAID/N personnel. Although the ADC has made great strides in agricultural research and education, it is uncertain whether these gains will be translated into improved policy analysis and decisionmaking at the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) and allied agencies.  More than 40 research grants - several dealing with policy issues - have been made to individuals and agencies, and Ph.D. and M.S. training at institutions outside Nepal are proceeding very well; 20 fellowships (4 Ph.D., 16 M.S.) have been awarded during the current project.  The training is rigorous and appropriate to Nepal's special agricultural concerns, and the fellows have been of high calibre.  However, excessive administrative duties have prevented returned fellows from using their skills on a daily basis, a problem which ADC is addressing by providing seminars, individual research grants, and support for professional activities. Other educational activities have included study tours and travel awards to observe programs in other Asian countries and 43 person-months of nondegree training. As for MOA institutional development, one crucial element seems to be lacking - a desire at the top levels to use research and analysis to develop and implement realistic agricultural policies.  Progress in policy analysis has also been impeded by understaffing and frequent personnel turnovers within the MOA. Extension of the project should require evidence that the GON is genuinely committed to improving MOA management decisions and policy analysis.  Recommendations include:  strengthening organizations responsible for providing agricultural data; involving private sector and academic researchers; selecting fellows from more diverse geographic and academic areas, and especially from policymaking organizations; and providing management training for mid-career technical staff, additional professional training for returned fellows, and short-term policy research and analysis training for mid- and top-level MOA officials.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","3/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural management|Institution building|Agricultural research|Agricultural education|Agricultural policy|Agricultural planning|Limited data plus","Nepal","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAR513.pdf","633 KB","004444 - No-Frills Development Consultants","","008583 - USAID.

"Evaluates Integrated Improvement Program for the Urban Poor (IIPUP) activity to provide TA and training to Thailand's National Housing Authority (NHA) during Phase I of a Housing Guaranty aimed at helping the Royal Thai Government (RTG) provide low-income housing in regional cities.  Final evaluation covers the period 8/80-3/85 and is based on document review and interviews with A.I.D. and RTG personnel. On the positive side, IIPUP provided NHA with staff training, primarily the A.I.D. shelter workshops, and TA which positively influenced national housing policy (but see below).  The project also helped NHA use improved procedures to acquire land needed for sites and services projects (although NHA acquired only about 50% of the land needed) and installed three microcomputers which, while not yet fully operational, have improved NHA's program management. Other activities were less successful.  Training at the University of California at Berkeley failed to address Thai institutions' operations and research needs, and research skills of returned trainees have been insufficiently utilized.  Further, the project failed to improve the delivery of socioeconomic services to low-income families, a primary project purpose, mainly because this IIPUP objective was incompatible with RTG objectives to promote cost-recovery schemes and to make the NHA self-sufficient.  Inadequacy in monitoring and in following-up on IIPUP activities were among the secondary causes of this failure. Finally, NHA continues to suffer from previously identified institutional problems such as poor coordination and cooperation with other agencies and within NHA itself, as evident in the Chiang Mai sites and services project. It is recommended that USAID/T:  (1) improve monitoring and evaluation systems; (2) incorporate lessons learned in future project designs; (3) not provide TA to similar projects unless specifically needed to serve low income groups; (4) require Thai institutions to have accurate cost allocation systems for expenditures or provide the TA needed to establish such systems; and (5) improve counterpart training. Specific recommendations are given to help the NHA improve its microcomputer systems and sites and services management.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Urban populations|Low cost housing|Housing investment guaranty|Technical assistance|Technical training|Housing policy|Institution building|Government departments|Secondary cities","Thailand","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAR514.pdf","4,381 KB","","","002960 - USAID.

"Evaluates Housing Guaranty (HG) to develop the institutional viability of the Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC), a private Indian firm.  Special evaluation covers FY's 81-84 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with USAID/I, World Bank, and HFDC personnel and with consultants. HDFC has substantially increased resource mobilization via deposits, term borrowings, and bonds, and is currently developing new methods based on taking a small equity position in housing finance institutions in underserved areas.  By the end of FY 84 HDFC was 150% larger than forecasted; had increased financing through term borrowings from 34% to 42%, against a target of 45%; and had raised 25% more resources in local markets than had been targeted.  It has also cautiously avoided unnecessary risk exposure.  While HDFC is not likely to achieve the target of directly raising $400 million within 5 years of HG disbursement, this is not necessarily a desirable goal. HDFC has promoted regulatory change, e.g., a shift in the allocation of funds from commercial banks which has enabled the latter to become involved in housing finance.  HDFC has also made a good faith effort to develop a policy for low-income applicants and allocated 30% of all its loans to them during FY's 82-84. HDFC is cautiously preparing to initiate a plan in which low-income persons who make deposits over a 2-7 year period at low interest rates will be permitted to borrow at the same rates. HDFC has subsidized a corporate loan program which enables companies to provide quality housing for their workers by making loans both available and affordable.  Since this effort directly benefits low-income households, it constitutes an appropriate use of HG funds. The $100,000 in TA has been used for training which has provided a framework for improving nonfinancial management procedures and personnel practices. It is recommended that the HDFC:  (1) strongly pursue its policy of expanding its base of individual deposits; and (2) focus on increasing loan affordability through loan term modification and by expanding the supply of market rate mortgage credit.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","4/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Housing finance|Financial institutions|Housing investment guaranty|Institution building|Low cost housing|Private sector|Financial resources","India","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAR528.pdf","4,953 KB","","","002960 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to assist the Government of Indonesia (GOI) National Family Planning Coordinating Board (BKKBN) to plan, coordinate, supervise, and evaluate national family planning (FP) activities, both public and private.  Special evaluation, focusing on the project's institutional aspects, covers the period 1980-84 and is based on field visits and interviews with key personnel. The project has successfully institutionalized within the BKKBN the critical management processes of contraceptive supply, logistics, information systems, and manpower development program management, but the BKKBN's rapid growth and expanded local activities endanger its organizational attributes of flexibility, innovation, and action-based goal orientation.  BKKBN delivers FP services efficiently - its production, procurement, and distribution activities have provided a wide variety of contraceptive options.  Its good working relationships with local government have helped legitimize FP, spreading information and influence to the level of individual acceptor couples, a rapport which becomes more important as the number of acceptors increases and non-acceptors become harder to reach.  Delegation of authority to provincial and, to some degree, lower levels is effective within the constraints of GOI planning and budget systems. However, while the current village FP model provides a successful framework for program extension to the more developed outer islands, it is less cost-effective in remote, thinly-populated areas.  Also, the BKKBN has not yet clearly defined an urban FP strategy.  The future will require broader ability to address the challenges of social marketing in areas that are not receptive to traditional service delivery. In spite of a somewhat flawed output, BKKBN's monthly service statistics provide a reliable base for performance measurement, but are not fully utilized, especially at lower levels.  Finally, manpower development programs have had a major impact on BKKBN staff and field implementation, although the skills of some returning participants are not effectively used. Among the recommendations presented for future implementation is to increase the availability of permanent contraceptive methods (e.g., voluntary sterilization).","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","5/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Family planning services|Institution building|Social marketing|Family planning policy","Indonesia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAR546.pdf","1,204 KB","006727 - Development Alternatives, Inc.

"Evaluates project to assist the Government of Jordan (GOJ) in monitoring and containing the incidence of urinary schistosomiasis (bilharzia).  Special evaluation covers the period 1980-4/85 and is based on document review and interviews with representatives of the University of Jordan (UJ), the Ministry of Health (MOH), and USAID/J. The GOJ is strongly committed to schistosomiasis control, and there is excellent interaction among the MOH, UJ (the grantee), USAID/J, WHO, and the two U.S. subcontractors, the Universities of Michigan and of Lowell.  Achievements at UJ include: identification of snail species in freshwaters in Jordan and their medical and veterinary importance; snail cultivation; studies in snail (Bulinus truncatus) susceptibilty to infection with Schistosoma haematobium; establishment of parasite and snail files; cytotaxonomic studies; electrophoretic studies of Jordanian B. truncatus and the same species from neighboring countries; and determination of the susceptibility of snails to Bayluscide (a molluscicide).  UJ has also trained graduate students in the fields of parasitology, malacology, and ecology and has contributed (as have the MOH and the U.S. universities) to a ""Handbook on Schistosomiasis and other Snail-Mediated Diseases in Jordan.""  Results of some UJ studies have already been published. At the MOH, the surveillance and control of B. truncatus and diagnosis and treatment of foreign migrant agricultural laborers (among whom incidence of schistosomiasis is particularly high) is in general adequate, though modifications in the control procedures may lead to greater cost effectiveness. The project has been inadequate only in the cancellation of a training program scheduled for 4/83, and in the handbook, which was intended to be a field manual but, except for the section on identifying freshwater snails, is of too high a standard for use by field workers and also includes material not pertinent to Jordan.  USAID/J should assist the MOH and the UJ in publishing a small handbook in Arabic for use by MOH technicians.  It is also recommended that the grant to UJ be extended 3 years and that USAID/J consider providing equipment, training, and/or TA to the MInistry of Health.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/DPE-5927-C-00-3083-00","","6/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Disease prevention and control|Parasitic diseases|Disease transmission|Water related diseases|Schistosomiasis|Snails|Disease research","Jordan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAR642.pdf","1,221 KB","000750 - Management Sciences for Health (MSH)","","000186 - USAID.

"Evaluates subproject to increase the fresh water supply in the Ha'apai Islands of Tonga.  Final special evaluation covers the period 6/81-5/85 and is based on site visits and beneficiary interviews. Implemented by the Foundation for the Peoples of the South Pacific, the Peace Corps, and the Tongan Ministries of Health and Works (MOH and MOW), the project constructed 786 water tanks (most used for household roof catchment) with a total capacity of 1,421,250 gallons and one well-water pumping system. Approximately 5,600 people in 22 villages on 16 islands have benefited directly from the increase in the fresh water supply and related improvements in sanitation.  An unexpected project outcome was community participation; the project became village-oriented through the Niuola Women in Development Association, which trained Ha'apai villagers who themselves constructed 473 2250-gallon ferrocement tanks. During the evaluation, 776 of the 786 tanks were visited.  Of 289 zincalume tanks (built by the MOW) surveyed, 80% were leaking (mostly minor leaks in the middle and bottom seams) because of substandard workmanship.  About 80% of the Niuola tanks also had minor leaks, mostly caused by the lack of a plastic moisture barrier underneath the tank floor, insufficient building materials, and poor construction design; also, many of these tanks did not have proper lids and/or water taps. Five modular ferrocement tanks designed by the World Health Organization were found to be inappropriate because of the sophisticated equipment and excess supervision needed for construction, and the problem of transporting these heavy items to the outer islands.  Of eleven larger (5,000-gallon) ferrocement community tanks constructed by the MOW, 82% remain full because villagers are now using their individual home tanks. Guttering has been completed on 80% of tanks constructed in the project, but improper hanging continues to be a problem.  The pumping system constructed in Fangale'ounga village is administered by a newly established and successful village water committee. Recommendations are to extend the project for one year to repair the leaking tanks, upgrade the guttering, install water taps, make tanks mosquito/debris-proof, and train villagers to install and maintain these systems.  The MOH should provide information on proper tank maintenance, possibly through radio.","Evaluation period: 30 Jun 1981-31 May 1985","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","879-0251-G-SS-1005-00","","5/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Private voluntary organizations|Water catchment|Water storage|Freshwater|Water supply|Beneficiary count|Beneficiary interviews","Tonga","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAR660.pdf","1,551 KB","001354 - Foundation for the Peoples of the South Pacific, Inc.","","000039 - USAID.

"Evaluates Bicol River Basin Development Program (BRBDP), a complex integrated area development (IAD) effort in the Philippines.  Special evaluation covers the period 1974-85 and is based on document review, interviews with officials and beneficiaries, and field visits. As a test case in refining and applying an IAD strategy, the BRBDP has accomplished much, but a large agenda remains to be addressed. BRBDP irrigation, flood control, and land consolidation projects have increased cropping area, total crop production, and agricultural productivity (the latter to 3 tons/ha vs. a targeted 7 - not yet enough to influence region-wide agricultural indicators).  The program has contributed to maternal and child health, and to a lesser extent, to improved nutrition, and it has assisted considerably in providing public water systems and sanitation facilities; more attention is needed to family planning and control of communicable diseases.  Road construction has increased mobility and access to goods and services, but it has not induced much new economic activity and it may have hurt some local agribusinesses. While significant increases in average household income and in labor force participation (including that of women) seem positively related to BRBDP efforts, interhousehold income inequalities have also increased, and serious underemployment is still evident.  Bicol remains in the depressed region category; in fact, its per capita domestic product declined during 1982-83. With continued support, however, the positive effects of BRBDP infrastructure projects (irrigation, flood control, roads) should burgeon.  Recommendations are made regarding BRBDP content, management, organization, and the broader institutional and political context. The BRBDP teaches that IAD programming requires, inter alia: flexible management arrangements (which focus on development rather than ""ownership"" issues and avoid complex coordinating mechanisms), deliberate capacity-building strategies, and commitment to see the program through.  Ultimately, project/program sustainability requires political, as well as administrative and technical, resources.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","5/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Bicol River|Integrated regional development|River basins|Integrated rural development|Economic development|Industrial development|Beneficiary interviews","Philippines","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAR787.pdf","21,294 KB","","","008592 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to promote breastfeeding among women in Tegucigalpa and San Pedro Sula, Honduras.  Special summative evaluation covers the period 1982-5/85 and is based in part on comparison of data from pre-project and recent surveys of health personnel and mothers. The project has accomplished quite a bit.  It has worked closely with the Honduran Ministry of Health (MOH) in developing a national breastfeeding policy, established three breast milk banks, and trained about 1,000 professional and auxiliary nurses and other health personnel in child nutrition and breastfeeding principles, techniques, and promotion.  More than 25,000 pamphlets on breastfeeding have been prepared and distributed to health workers (and some materials prepared for the general public as well); 11 seminars were held in 1984 for medical personnel (including 109 physicians and 260 nurses) as well as two national seminars (in 1983 and 1984) for general, pediatric, and gynecologic practitioners.  Although many health personnel still lack adequate training in breastfeeding promotion, the project has contributed to several positive changes in health workers' knowledge and attitudes which are reflected in the recommendations they make to mothers regarding breastfeeding. Participating hospitals have changed their birthing practices to encourage mother-child bonding as soon as possible after birth; some hospitals have hired breastfeeding promoters.  Procedural norms which will further institutionalize breastfeeding promotion have been developed and are in process of review and approval. Also, a breastfeeding documentation and information center has been established, comprising over 70 books and nearly 500 scientific articles. It is essential that a second phase be funded.  It is recommended that during Phase II the project be expanded to the national level, allied more closely with the MOH, and strengthened administratively. Emphasis should be put on implementing breastfeeding norms at health facilities of all levels; training of health personnel, especially nurses, who in turn can train midwives and community health workers; and development of educational materials.","Spanish ed.: PD-AAS-049","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/DSAN-C-0209","","8/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Breastfeeding|Hospitals|Medical education|Health policy|Limited data plus","Honduras","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAR788.pdf","16,553 KB","000657 - Education Development Center, Inc.

"An analysis of 263 evaluation and of 45 Inspector General audit reports provides the basis for this review of the lessons learned from A.I.D.'s FY84 program experience. Both evaluation and audit reports focused on five issues.  Key finding are as follows.  (1) Most projects have been responsive to host government, country development, and U.S. needs. However, some have been incompatible with cultural and ethnic factors (factors sometimes unseen even by host governments); thus projects with national scope may be ineffective in important geocultural regions of a country.  (2) Institution building is widely viewed by USAID personnel and increasingly by contractors as A.I.D.'s core function, and A.I.D. staff have become skilled in developing host country capabilities.  (3) Project design and monitoring systems are highly professional and in many respects effective, but have impeded full realization of institution building and timely goal achievement; management and administrative problems from overall direction to logistics and finance have impeded project objectives.  (4) Sustainability has been inadequately emphasized. (5) The effectiveness of technology transfer has been mixed. Agriculture has posed the most serious problem, as many projects to raise small farm productivity are falling short of goals, in most cases because input delivery systems have not reached the great majority of rural families, but in some cases because farmers have rejected the new technologies.  Delivery capabilities, technology acceptance, and community participation have been greater in health projects, but securing an acceptance of preventive medicine equivalent to that of curative services has proven difficult.  Also, in each case where the installation of potable water systems was the project objective, successfully achieved, water consumption failed to increase.  In a number of countries, family planning is enjoying levels of acceptance and participation similar to primary health services.  Despite the superiority of new fuel-efficient stoves over traditional models, the new stoves have not yet been accepted, especially in African countries. Employment generation has not resulted from rural regional agro-industrial projects as expected.","Revised ed.: PN-ACA-375|Work order no. 22","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-0000-I-22-3077-00","","8/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Impact assessment|Development administration|Development project design|Development project implementation|Rural areas","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAR863.pdf","4,135 KB","000436 - Development Associates, Inc.","","003433 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to support the Indonesian Family Planning (FP) Program, particularly its Village FP program in Java, Bali, and the outer islands, and a more recent urban effort.  Final special evaluation covers the period 1980-84 and is based on document review, analysis of demographic data, field visits, and interviews with staff of the National FP Coordinating Board (BKKBN). The project met or exceeded most targets.  Since 1978, contraceptive use by married women of reproductive age has risen from 30% to 60%, to a total of 15 million users, and the crude birth rate has dropped from 36 to 29 births per 1,000 population; the number of FP service points increased from 65,000 to over 200,000.  The 13,000 BKKBN workers and uncounted village volunteers have fulfilled critical motivation and information functions, recruited acceptors and supervised acceptor groups, and provided a major logistic link for contraceptive resupply and program data.  BKKBN has successfully institutionalized key operations (e.g., contraceptive supply, logistics, information services, and training) previously dependent on A.I.D. support, and it has incorporated local governments into its training and motivation agenda, resulting in good working relationships and an expanded information and influence network which becomes increasingly important as more acceptors are maintained and non-acceptors become harder to reach. Success of the FP program is due in large part to A.I.D.'s support of the Village FP program, its facilitation of decentralization through flexible direct supplemental funding of local activities, and its domestic and overseas training programs.  A.I.D. should continue to give high priority to Indonesia's FP program, especially to local cost programming and to continuing effective USAID/I-BKKBN collaboration. Sources of concern for the future include the reduced cost-effectiveness of expanding the highly successful Village FP program to thinly populated outer islands, the fact that BKKBN still lacks a viable urban strategy (despite some innovative urban experiments), a trend toward increased BKKBN bureaucratization, and overtaxing of available facilities by the increased number of acceptors. Included is an analysis of the program's effect on public health and education expenditures.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","6/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Family planning services|Contraceptive prevalence|Family planning promotion programs|Beneficiary count|Public data","Indonesia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAR868.pdf","4,857 KB","008558 - USAID.

"Evaluates the Lesotho Distance Teaching Centre's (LDTC's) Assistance Fund (AF), which provides financial assistance and training to rural women's income-generating groups.  Internal LDTC evaluation covers the period 9/83-1/85 and is based on document review, interviews with members of five groups, and performance tests (of four groups) in AF training areas - bookkeeping, group functioning, and program planning. Ten groups are being assisted by LDTC - eight income-generating groups and two training centers - and assistance to another ten groups is currently in process of approval.  While individual group members have found LDTC training useful and have learned new concepts, actual income-generating practices have lagged behind.  Members of three of the four test groups performed well on the tests and attempted to transfer LDTC training to other functions - at home, in other groups, and on the job.  Still, with few exceptions, the members responsible for financial recordkeeping do not keep the books accurately, make them available to others in the group, or report regularly to the group as a whole.  Also, there is little evidence that members use their training to advance group activities. It is concluded that by focusing on income management and group dynamics, LDTC training does not address group concerns as to technical skill development, market identification, and profitmaking.  As a result of this evaluation a new training model, which will focus on training of group leaders and extension workers rather than all group members, is being proposed to lower costs and reach more rural groups. Four action recommendations for AF planners are:  (1) formulate specific objectives for the AF; (2) review training modules for appropriateness and amount of time required; (3) document group practices in bookkeeping, group work, and program planning; and (4) distribute materials that will complement distance education. Other recommendations are made regarding AF training, the distance education component of that training, and evaluation of future AF groups.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Small scale enterprises|Rural areas|Cooperatives|Management training|Nonformal education|Beneficiary interviews|Sampling method|Limited data","Lesotho","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAR871.pdf","1,534 KB","001963 - Lesotho Distance Teaching Centre","","000182 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to establish a system for titling rural lands in Honduras.  Mid-term evaluation covers the period 1982-8/85 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with project officials and beneficiaries. After a slow start, the pace and quality of work improved in 1984. The project has delivered more than the planned number of delineated parcels and nearly the planned number of titles in Santa Barbara, but has issued very few titles in Comayagua, where small parcels predominate and less coffee is grown.  (By law, such small parcels are eligible for titling only if coffee is grown on them.)  The low rate of titling in Comayagua may be partly due to the lack of an effective public relations and information campaign; the Santa Barbara model of direct communication between promoters and farmers is preferable to the Comayagua method of relying on media advertising and cadastral teams. In general, as a methodology for delivering titles, the project has achieved significant results.  However, many of the titles issued, especially in Santa Barbara, lack reference to the cadastral map and cadastral identification number and are not precisely tied to a geographic grid. been experienced in differentiating rural and urban parcels (the latter are not addressed by the project) and in setting administrative boundaries between Departamentos and Municipios. The project's complicated management command structure, in which the National Agrarian Institute (INA) - which is responsible for project management - depends for cadastral surveying on the National Cadaster Office (CN) has led to misunderstandings and delays in the titling process.  Also, the project has been criticized for ""institutionalizing minifundia"" through the issuance of property titles to small holdings. Although farmers generally value the INA titles, they object to paying for land they have considered theirs for years.  A further problem is that the low value at which INA assesses the property, while lessening beneficiaries' ""debt"" to the INA, also serves to reduce its value as collateral for bank loans (access to which, despite the project's promotional claims, is not guaranteed by the title).  Finally, although the project is making the acquisition of property titles easier and less expensive, it appears that the future costs of keeping titles in the Property Registry up to date may be prohibitively high, presenting risk that the lands may pass again into an untitled state.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","8/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Land tenure|Land ownership|Public land records|Land reform|Cadasters|Beneficiary interviews|Sampling method","Honduras","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAR874.pdf","1,329 KB","008555 - USAID.

"Although non-project assistance plays an increasingly important part of A.I.D.'s overall development program, the relative emphasis accorded its two principal components differs notably, with cash transfer programs increasing sharply and Commodity Import Programs (CIP's) declining.  This report evaluates the effectiveness of CIP's on the basis of a review of four CIP's -- one each in Zimbabwe and Somalia and two in Egypt.  Areas covered in detail include policy reform, beneficiary targeting, foreign exchange rates, and local currency programming. Major findings are as follows.  (1) The linkage between CIP's and policy reform has been weak, the CIP's in both Egypt and Zimbabwe lacking policy conditionality.  On the positive side, the Somali CIP did have policy conditions and the government initiated a package of reforms.  (2) In all three nations, there has been difficulty in gearing CIP's to specific target groups.  Faced with a trade-off between targeting and rapid disbursements, CIP's usually were designed to meet the disbursement objective.  (3) In all cases, CIP imports were offered to importers at an ""official"" exchange rate, 30-100% below the free market rate, providing an opportunity for a windfall profit. Nevertheless, for most developing country importers, a CIP was not as desirable as free foreign exchange.  (4) A.I.D. involvement in regard to local currency programming varied widely, being minimal in Egypt and heavy in Zimbabwe, where local currency programming has been used as a major development tool and has demonstrated the potential effectiveness of counterpart funds in affecting host government budget allocations and sectoral priorities.  Policy implications of these findings are detailed in conclusion.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","3/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Nonproject assistance|Commodity import programs|Policy reform|Beneficiary targeting|Foreign exchange rates|Local currency|Counterpart fund|Conditionality","Zimbabwe|Somalia|Egypt","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAT505.pdf","26 KB","003433 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to help Women's World Banking (WWB) provide credit and TA to low-income LDC female entrepreneurs.  Special evaluation covers the period 1982-7/85 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with WWB staff and board members. The most valuable service that WWB provides is aiding national affiliates in establishing themselves - 22 affiliates are legally chartered (not all in LDC's) and another 18 are being formed. Four affiliates - in Colombia, the Dominican Republic, Haiti, and India - are providing loans to entrepreneurs (either directly or through loan guarantees to local banks); the first three named provide TA as well (both lending procedures and level and nature of TA vary among affiliates).  To date, WWB loan guarantees of $175,000 have resulted in 626 loans totaling $243,000, which have in turn increased clients' profits some 40% per year and have led to the creation of some 730 new jobs.  Overall, a 268% annual return on WWB guarantees is predicted. The loans have not yet, however, enabled a significant number of clients to become independent banking customers. WWB headquarters staff are devoted and hard-working, but too much responsibility falls on the president; management chain of command, staff specialists, and financial and legal control over affiliates (except through loan agreements) are lacking.  WWB also notably lacks a satisfactory system for communicating with affiliates; workshops have been the best single communicating device to date.  On the other hand, WWB's prospects for financial self-sufficiency look very good indeed if a fee-for-service policy is adopted. WWB's Dominican Republic affiliate is close to the WWB ideal; it is financially self-sufficient and able to remain so.  However, its two greatest problems are lack of professional staff and of bank liquidity. The Colombian affiliate, also very active, focuses on lending to solidarity groups of market women (two programs for microenterprise clients are being phased out).  This strategy - specialized, training-intensive intervention with just one (traditionally poor-risk) type of client - can be dangerous over the long-run.  In Haiti, the WWB loan program is small and fundraising difficult. A key recommendation is that WWB suspend its plans to provide marketing services to loan recipients.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-0002-C-00-4179-00","","7/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Women in development|International organizations|Small scale enterprises|Commercial credit|Private organizations","Dominican Republic|Colombia|Haiti","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAR927.pdf","919 KB","004492 - Trade and Development International Corp.|000673 - International Science and Technology Institute, Inc.

"The design of A.I.D. projects providing agricultural credit, input, and marketing services has been too supply-side oriented, relying on criteria established by economists and scientists rather than on what will be adopted by farmers, and this orientation has carried over to the implementation stage.  Thus concludes this A.I.D. evaluation study based on review of 203 projects, 44 of which were closely examined and 5 of which were selected for field-level impact evaluation, and discussion of findings at an international conference. The majority of A.I.D. agricultural service projects fell short of their potential because they failed to meet three essential conditions - the user must find the service technologically and financially desirable, its delivery compatible and timely, and its utilization profitable.  Credit projects typically fell short because they were tied to unproven technologies, implemented in a hostile policy environment, or included complicated application procedures or interest rates which were arbitrary and not dictated by the marketplace.  Input projects often promoted technologies that, while scientifically sound, were judged inappropriate by farmers.  A common mistake in marketing projects was failure to collect produce from farmers in a timely fashion; lack of market price stability was a problem in some projects. The evaluation also assessed the relative advantages and disadvantages of public sector, private sector, and mixed delivery systems.  Public sector delivery mechanisms were clearly superior for very general projects (e.g., infrastructure) and for those either focused on policy (e.g., price or exchange rate policies) or aimed at social transfers (e.g., price supports or input subsidies).  Mixed public/private entities were most effective when projects required political support along with flexible and responsive management, while private delivery systems worked best in projects requiring both flexible management and individual farmer contact.  Retailing of credit and inputs and purchasing at the farm gate were two tasks best performed by private sector entities such as PVO's, co-ops, and for-profit businesses.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","8/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural inputs|Delivery systems|Agricultural credit|Agricultural product marketing|Private sector|Public sector|Development project design","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAL079.pdf","109 KB","000156 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to help the Government of Niger (GON) strengthen rural health delivery.  Special joint evaluation covers the period 6/78-7/85 and is based on document review, field visits, and interviews with Ministry of Health (MOH) and other officials, village health workers (VHW's), and villagers. The project has increased rural coverage to 45% and will achieve or exceed most training outputs - 10,759 VHW's and traditional birth attendants have been trained (143% of target), 80% of them with project funds, and 17,032 have been retrained, some of them several times (126% of target).  Scholarships have been provided to 519 nursing students, 125 sanitation students, and 30 laboratory technicians; 18 national and 37 departmental seminars were held, with over 1,100 attendees; third-country training has been provided to 70 persons, of whom 34 have returned. Although management problems continue to be a major constraint, attention is now being paid to major shortcomings (e.g., in village supervision, community participation, and supply management).  Support to immunization services has been minimal, as the MOH has only recently defined an Expanded Program of Immunization.  Health facility renovations and sanitation improvements (e.g., latrines, water filters) have not met targets, but 7 dispensaries and a warehouse have been completed as planned and 2 other new facilities await only water and electrical hook-ups.  The majority of the MOH garages and vehicles are in good working order; project-provided by the mopeds did not prove suitable in rural areas.  TA from Africare and Tulane University has generally been excellent. The project's overly optimistic design underestimated start-up time and funding delays.  Inadequate information flow between USAID/N and the MOH has been a problem, but computerized data bases are being installed in both units.  Operations research is only now getting underway. Lessons are to make the GON a full partner in the design process, ensure continuity among short-term consultants, prioritize operations research, increase implementation flexibility, consider coordination with other GON development activities and ensure coordination with other donors, and keep in mind that the dichotomy between rural and urban health care is not absolute.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","8/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Rural areas|Health care|Community health care|Medical education|Community health workers|Beneficiary interviews","Niger","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAR941.pdf","22,537 KB","008585 - USAID.

"Performance disbursement (PD) is a recently developed mechanism whereby A.I.D. disburses program funds in a series of tranches, each conditioned by host country attainment of pre-established benchmarks in implementing policy and institutional reforms. This paper reviews limited applications of PD in the Philippines, Bangladesh, and Niger in order to evaluate the practice in light of possible wider use. PD's major advantage is that it softens the adverse effects of policy reforms by lengthening the reform process over time and by providing monetary compensation for losses incurred by the reforms.  Among other advantages are that it gives A.I.D. greater control over disbursement and promotes mutual agreement on project activity between A.I.D. and the host government. Outstanding issues concerning PD discussed in the report include, inter alia, that:  the conditions making PD an appropriate funding mechanism, as well as PD's compatibility with U.S. Government regulations, are unclear; the use of PD is largely a matter of judgment and host country circumstances; PD constitutes for both A.I.D. and the host country a high-risk and staff-intensive activity; and finally, PD does not ensure long-term institutional development. Sixteen guidelines for the further use of PD conclude the study.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","7/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Development program design|Development finance|Government policy|Policy making|Host country cooperation|USAID","Philippines|Bangladesh|Niger","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAT608.pdf","54 KB","003433 - USAID.

"The role of private voluntary organizations (PVO's) in developing small-scale enterprises (SSE's) is reviewed in this report, prepared for an A.I.D. workshop on the subject. The literature shows that SSE's can be successfully promoted through credit, technical assistance, and short-term training. However, it is small- or medium-sized manufacturing firms rather than microenterprises and trading businesses that seem to generate new employment and establish links to other economic sectors.  For this reason, critics question the cost-effectiveness of SSE projects by PVO's, which focus increasingly on generating empowerment and equity among the poor. Such questions indicate the need for a systems approach to SSE development, i.e., one that embraces all relevant factors and institutions. Several AID-sponsored SSE projects conducted by PVO's are enlightening in this regard.  Two evaluations of entrepreneurship training programs of Opportunities Industrialization Centers International (OICI) indicate the value of a comprehensive institution-building effort.  OICI's extensive efforts in establishing public and private sector advisory and policymaking bodies ensure the availability of expert advice and facilitate working relationships with the government, thus increasing the policy voice of local OIC's. Other organizations, such as the Sarvodaya Shramadana in Sri Lanka, the Northeast Union of Assistance to Small Business (UNO) project in Brazil, the Partnership for Productivity project in Burkina Faso, and Manila Community Services, Inc. in the Philippines, are even more insistent on the importance of the social and political and not merely the economic concerns of SSE projects, both as outcomes to be pursued and as causes of project success.  Rather than adopting a conventional, narrowly conceived cost-benefit approach, these organizations suit a project to the local situation in order to effect sustainable change benefiting the largest possible public.  Such systems projects can be small and simple.  The key factor is the entrepreneurial spirit that successful PVO's increasingly seem to be displaying in their SSE projects.  A 5-page bibliography (1965-83) is appended.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","7/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Entrepreneurs|Small scale enterprises|Private voluntary organizations|Microenterprises","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAL055.pdf","2,905 KB","000088 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to reduce childhood morbidity and mortality in sub-Saharan Africa through expanded immunization programs and simple treatment of diarrheal disease and malaria.  Special evaluation covers the period 9/81-3/85 and is based on document review and interviews with Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and field staff. The project approach continues to be sound.  Bilateral subprojects (SP's) are underway in 9 (soon to be 11) countries; most are on schedule, delays, where they exist, being due to procurement problems and sometimes to difficulties in coordinating with A.I.D. regional and Mission personnel. Generally, immunization efforts are furthest along, with diarrhea control progressing somewhat more slowly; malaria control has been concentrated in 2 countries.  Fee-for-service financing of oral rehydration therapy and chloroquine treatment has been surprising successful, and good integration has been achieved with national primary health care systems.  The most serious problems have been the complexities of dealing with malaria control and of finding a reliable, accurate, and cost-effective means of assessing SP impacts - prototype Mortality and Utilization of Health Services surveys, field-tested in 3 countries, have proven quite expensive.  Although overall costs for many SP's are a little under budget, at least one country is unlikely to be able to assume recurrent cost financing as planned. Regionally, good progress has been made in approving small research grants for Eastern and Southern Africa (although reorientation toward broader studies is advisable), and in health education and promotion (marked improvement since the 10/83 evaluation); the Peace Corps has demonstrated its ability to recruit and train professionals and volunteers in health education work.  Mid-level training is almost on schedule, but senior management training is behind; considerable time has gone into helping SP countries develop health information systems. A key recommendation is to extend the SP timeframe from 4 to 5 years. Numerous other recommendations address the above functional areas as well as overall project management and the feasibility of adding new health interventions, e.g., in yaws, child spacing, and acute respiratory infections.","Project title: Africa child survival initiative-Combatting|childhood communicable diseases (ACSI-CCCD)","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-0000-I-21-3083","","3/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Child health care|Disease prevention and control|Communicable diseases","Africa south of Sahara","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAS048.pdf","1,082 KB","000673 - International Science and Technology Institute, Inc.

"Evaluates project to improve financial management and accounting capabilities in the Sahel, especially regarding A.I.D. projects. Special evaluation covers the period 8/82-9/84 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with involved officials. Overall, results are positive.  Through workshops, on-the-job training, preparation of accounting manuals, etc., the project has strengthened the financial management capabilities of Sahelian personnel involved in A.I.D. projects and of many Mission project officers (although much remains to be done).  The project has also has recently begun to address the broader need of upgrading host country financial management per se. Institutionalization efforts have had mixed success, ranging from The Gambia, where the project team has been integrated into a government entity due to strong government and USAID support for such a move, to Mali, where a likely entity is yet to be identified.  Given the weak nature of Sahelian institutions, any institutionalization must be slow. The decision to use both a PASA with USDA and a cooperative agreement with Virginia Polytechnic Institute created a top-heavy bureaucracy which has only recently begun working together well. In the field, working relations have not always been smooth (e.g., Niger), but have varied according to the relationships among USAID's, project headquarters and field personnel, and host country ministries. Other weaknesses have included:  (1) dilution of project team resources in Senegal by assignment of additional responsibilities in Mauritania, Cape Verde, and The Gambia; (2) an impractical management information system; (3) insufficient coordination of some activities (e.g., 3 of the 5 countries visited had independently developed basically similar accounting manuals); (4) weak file and documentation management practices in all countries except Niger; (5) ineffective use of short-term consultants; and (6) inadequate preparation of team leaders for country assignments. It is recommended, inter alia, that a regional approach be maintained, even if some bilateral projects are enacted by individual USAID's, that training in financial management of P.L. 480 and ESF counterpart funds be considered, and that the project be extended 2-3 years.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","4/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Regional development|Financial management|Institution building|Project sustainability|Accounting|Development project management","Sahel|West Africa|Senegal|Gambia|Mali|Niger|Burkina Faso|Cape Verde|Mauritania|Chad","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDBBR493.pdf","3,847 KB","004517 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to provide technical and managerial training to Sahelian personnel.  Special evaluation covers 6/83-4/85 and is based on interviews with Mission, host agency, and local institution personnel and with returned participants of this and other projects. Implementation is lagging in most countries (only 33% of funds have been programmed, and only 13% of planned training completed), apparently because of a lack of appreciation for the role of training in development.  Mission planning is often haphazard, with participant processing taking a low priority. The project's attempt to improve the planning of participant training through use of long-term country training strategies and annual training plans has proved helpful, but many improvements are needed. Mission training officers lack the skills required to implement programs and in some cases lack support from Mission top management. Although no viable mechanism for third- and in-country training (strongly encouraged under the project) has yet been found, Missions have greatly increased their country training activities; these have not been without problems (requiring, as they do, considerable Mission management capacity), but they do indicate the acceptance of alternatives to U.S. training.  The emphasis on in- and third-country training has put to rest the notion of developing regional English-language training (ELT) centers. The training provided has been generally satisfactory and most participants are able to use the skills they have gained. Sahelian budget limitations are the chief constraint to utilization of training. Short-term training focused on specific skills seems most likely to lead to the development of new systems and programs.  Missions have made good progress in, e.g., private sector training, women's training, and local management training. Recommendations are to:  not increase funding without a concurrent increase in AID/W and Africa Bureau administrative support; address policy issues (e.g., equivalency, promotions) in agreements with host countries; consider suspending funding to Missions with large unexpended pipelines; explore the possibility of private sector ELT; and upgrade participant orientation and follow-up systems.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-1406-I-03-4055","","9/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Education for development|Participants|Management training|Technical training|Beneficiary interviews","Sahel","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAS054.pdf","3,487 KB","001341 - Creative Associates International, Inc.

"Evaluates project to promote contraceptive usage through 75 family planning (FP) units in 14 urban areas of Zaire.  Special midterm evaluation covers the period 10/82-6/85 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with project, USAID/Z, and National Committee for Desired Births (CNND) staff. The project faces several concerns, of which the most serious is probably institutional.  Administration and coordination was to have been CNND's responsibility; however, as this proved infeasible, an independent project structure was created.  The resulting confusion as to roles and responsibilities has weakened CNND and led to much duplication of effort.  It is uncertain whether these two implementing arms possess the good will needed to agree upon formal arrangements for specifying their respective roles. Activities are behind schedule, mostly due to delays in procuring contraceptives and TA.  To date, 33 hospitals, clinics, and dispensaries are participating, but not all are fully operational, and contraceptive prevalence at these sites is estimated at less than 1%.  Constraints include:  failure to prepare communities to receive FP services; the limited number of service sites (some do not collect statistical data, and may or may not provide FP services); eligibility criteria in some cases restricting services to married women; lack of follow-up, resulting in poor continuation rates; and the medical community's failure to integrate FP with health care.  Design assumptions as to unmet demand for FP and the availability of informational methods and adequate infrastructure appear unfounded. In other areas, project training is providing a much needed service and is exceeding targets (emphasis, however, has been on developing a basic contraceptive technology curriculum, with little attention to curricula for the nursing and medical schools); supervision of FP sites is not yet routine; and data collection is inconsistent, and there are no national-level consolidation and analysis of FP data.  Financial management is good, but numerous personnel issues need attention. Success will depend upon resolving current deficiencies in such a way as to produce a strong and independent CNND with a narrower and more focused program.  For key recommendations, see the attached PES (PD-BAX-424).","Attached to PD-BAX-424","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","6/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Urban areas|Family planning services|Family planning education|Contraceptive distribution","Congo DR","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDBAX424A.pdf","2,176 KB","","","008626 - USAID.

"Evaluates pilot project to mobilize rural savings in the Dominican Republic and to promote reform among financial institutions.  Special evaluation covers the period 8/83-11/84 and is based on document review and on interviews with 37 persons. The project's Agricultural Bank (BAGRICOLA) and research components have achieved remarkable results.  Workshops of 10/82 and 10/83 were instrumental in initiating thinking among senior BAGRICOLA officials about the benefits of savings mobilization, and the extent and rapidity of BAGRICOLA's savings development has clearly outrun targets:  20 branches have taken $RD2,827,000 in deposits; this level of performance, however, raises the issue of whether BAGRICOLA has been too successful - there may be serious risks in encouraging extensive deposits and lending before the institution is fully capable of handling the operation. Eight research studies on Dominican financial markets are underway and research workshops were conducted in 11/83 and 10/84; while research quality is uneven, much of it is good and very relevant to the project. Less positively, the credit union (CU) component got off to a slow start (problems in selecting pilot CU's, weak FEDOCOOP support, and the extent of work needed to prepare the CU's to mobilize savings) and still suffers the lack of an institutional base. However, an accounting system has been developed and 2 Dominicans trained (and 1 partially trained) to provide TA to cooperatives; one of the four participating CU's - which have mobilized a total of $RD227,158 - has reached an adequate level of competence. The project has been exceptionally effective as an instrument of policy dialogue - expanding its rural focus to generate a reexamination of nationwide financial policy concerns - and as a process model for preparing CU's for savings mobilization. has also attracted considerable participation by individual Dominican professionals in research, policy dialogue, and operational areas, as well as strong institutional commitment, especially from the Central Bank and BAGRICOLA.  TA from Ohio State University has been excellent. Recommendations address both the project's current needs and follow-on plans.","Attached to PD-AAS-061","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","2/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Rural areas|Pilot projects|Credit unions|Institution building|Financial institutions|Savings","Dominican Republic","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAS061A.pdf","2,810 KB","","","008537 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to strengthen farm cooperatives and enterprises in El Salvador, particularly those within the agrarian reform sector. Special evaluation covers the period 9/82-8/85 and is based on document review, site visits and interviews with Technoserve, Inc. (TNS), Salvadoran Federation of Agrarian Reform Cooperatives (FESACORA), and co-op personnel. TNS has been very successful both in directly assisting primary level co-ops and in strengthening FESACORA.  TNS has increased the productivity of most of the 18 primary co-ops it has aided, improved their efficiency, and converted operating losses into net gains.  On the national level, TNS has strengthened FESACORA's organizational structure and directed its resources toward providing affiliated co-ops (200-plus) with a variety of services such as intermediation, management assistance, and legal aid. Every project target but one was exceeded by 4/85; by 10/85 all will have been exceeded, some very substantially. TNS' major strengths are its programs for co-op member education, which are participatory in nature, with well-designed teaching materials; and its methodologies for diagnostic and feasibility studies and planning. The members of many of FESACORA's affiliated co-ops have achieved significant social benefits (housing, water, education, health care) since the founding of the co-ops and their affiliation with FESACORA. There appears to be growing support for FESACORA; 77% of affiliated co-ops are satisfied with FESACORA services. FESACORA's weakest areas are farm management, planning, and financial management.  FESACORA personnel, while young and enthusiastic, lack experience and will require guidance and advice for some time.  It is too early to assess FESACORA's economic strength, as very few income-producing activities have yet been developed. Four regional cooperatives, formed between 12/84-2/85, compete with FESACORA, but are at a lower level of development (comparable to that of FESACORA 2 years ago).  Though some co-ops resigned from FESACORA to join one of the regionals, a number of them later returned.  The regional cooperatives appear to have been created largely for political ends, and should not receive A.I.D. assistance unless they begin to demonstrate a service mentality toward their affiliates.","Work order no. 60|Companion evaluation summary: PD-ABQ-129","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-0100-I-00-2067-00","","8/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Rural development|Agricultural enterprises|Institution building|Private organizations|Agrarian reform|Agricultural cooperatives|Beneficiary interviews|Sampling method","El Salvador","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAS079.pdf","14,760 KB","000238 - Agricultural Cooperative Development International (ACDI)","","008540 - USAID.

"Evaluates multi-donor project to strengthen the institutional capability of the Niger River Commission  - renamed the Niger Basin Authority (NBA) in 1980 - to carry out an effective, coordinated, and rational development program for the Niger River Basin.  Final evaluation covers the period 8/77-11/84 and is based on firsthand observations, document review, and interviews with NBA staff and other donors. See abstract of PD-AAS-064 for a summary of evaluation findings. It is recommended that A.I.D. support the already proposed follow-on project (6250944), but at a reduced level and perhaps making the project conditional on development of an NBA unit to reflect the planning/coordination activities which should be its primary activity. Also recommended is a redesign of the follow-on project. Specifically, the new project should:  (1) conduct an institutional and management analysis of the NBA; (2) upgrade the NBA's data storage and retrieval unit; (3) develop the proposed water-sediment routing model as already planned; (4) reduce the scope of proposed environmental and socioeconomic studies; (5) provide the NBA's planning unit with long-term TA in river basin planning and perhaps other long- and short-term TA; (6) seek outside expertise to reexamine the terms of reference for follow-up project activities; (7) closely monitor the execution of said terms; (8) commit sufficient time and TA personnel to ensure proper project management; (9) oblige contractors to conduct participant training; (10) have each expatriate technician assigned an NBA counterpart so as to ensure technology transfer; (11) request the NBA to provide an annual report; (12) consider helping the NBA acquire additional office space; and (13) convoke a formal donor coordinating meeting in late 1985.","Attached to PD-AAS-064","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","12/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","River basins|Niger river|Institution building|Regional development|Development organizations","Sahel","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAS064A.pdf","3,030 KB","008585 - USAID.

"Evaluates OPG to two Dominican Republic PVO's - the Animal Research and Production Improvement Center (CIMPA) and Agricultural Improvement Farm (GRAMA) - to help replenish small farmer and cooperative swine stocks destroyed by African Swine Fever.  Final evaluation covers the period through 2/85 and is based on document and activity review. The project has successfully implemented its planned activities: two breeding facilities - one for 100 sows at the CIMPA in Santiago, a second for 50 sows at the GRAMA in Moca - have been constructed; CIMPA and GRAMA have distributed swine breeding stock to 50 and 30 small farmer groups, respectively; and CIMPA has trained all 80 groups in swine production and management, animal health, and financial and organizational management. Finally, CIMPA and GRAMA have assisted the swine repopulation efforts of the Salesina Agricultural School in La Vegas, a private religious institute, and the Higher Institute of Agriculture in Santiago, an institution under the auspices of the Association for the Development of Santiago. The projected swine population figure of 500,000 was attained by the end of 1984, 2 years ahead of schedule.  Estimated project beneficiaries total a minimum of 3,810 farmers. On the negative side, this increase in the swine population has placed a strain on feed supply resources, creating a feed shortage and increasing the price of concentrate feed. The resulting high production and pork meat costs have been detrimental to the Dominican swine industry. No recommendations are pending.","Attached to PD-AAS-074","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","2/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Swine|Small farms|Animal breeding|Agricultural cooperatives|Beneficiary count|Limited data","Dominican Republic","","","008537 - USAID.

"Evaluates non-family planning (non-FP) activities of a family planning/population project in Jamaica.  Special evaluation is based on review of project documents and demographic data and on interviews with USAID/J and implementing agency personnel. The project has been most successful in the area of demographic data collection:  the performance of the Government of Jamaica's (GOJ) Registrar General's Department (RGD) and the Statistical Institute of Jamaica (STATIN) have improved appreciably, in no small part due to A.I.D. assistance, and the University of the West Indies (UWI) has produced 2 population studies.  Training at UWI has been less successful, as only 12 students matriculated during the first 2 years of the Population Studies program. Little progress has been made in the crucial area of disseminating information on population and demographic matters to as wide an audience as possible.  The Planning Institute of Jamaica's (PIOJ) Population Unit is the only agency which has information dissemination as an explicit goal, and its performance has been disappointing. Administrative shortcomings at the implementing National Family Planning Board (NFPB) apparently curtail its effectiveness in handling non-FP activities, although the Board has shown considerable interest in increased dissemination of population policy information. While non-FP activities remain important and should be supported, Jamaica, with a population growth rate of only 1.2% a year, has reached the stage where FP and contraceptive delivery programs should be emphasized; these should be complemented insofar as possible by information dissemination, data gathering and analysis, and research and training.  It is recommended, inter alia, that the GOJ give independent status to the NFPB for greater prominence and reorganize project components into an entity to deal directly with USAID/J; as the leader in information dissemination, the PIOJ should develop a program for schoolchildren, hiring an advisor and short-term TA as needed; the results of STATIN and RGD studies should be made more accessible; UWI's program for demographers must be made more attractive; and funding should be considered for short-term U.S. training for Jamaican population officials and for a Caribbean-wide training program.","Evaluation period: 2-29 Sep 1985|Project title: Population technical assistance (POPTECH)","Special Evaluation","Documents","DPE-3024-C-00-4063-00","","11/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Population policy|Population programs|Demographic data collection|Public data|Limited data plus","Jamaica","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAS078.pdf","2,951 KB","000673 - International Science and Technology Institute, Inc.

"Evaluates cooperative project between Isreal's Hebrew University and Egypt's Ain Shams Universty to conduct research on the epidemiology and control of 3 arthropod-borne diseases - malaria, Rift Valley fever, and leishmaniasis.  External evaluation covers the period 1981-9/85 and is based on document review, interviews with scientists, and site visits. Research has evolved over the 4 years with steady improvement in facilities, scientific quality, and cooperation, and, relative to other activities in each country, is strong.  Leishmaniasis research has been outstanding, notably in the discovery of foci of visceral and cutaneous disease and the discovery of Leishmania major infection in dogs and rodents.  Malaria research in Israel has also been strong, focusing on the development of diagnostic tools, immunity studies, and parasite physiology, as malaria occurs there only when introduced.  No cases of Rift Valley fever have been detected in Egypt since 1981, but surveillance has identified other viral illnesses, such as sandfly fever.  Sandfly biology and ecology studies have been excellent, reflecting a high level of entomological competence. Filariasis research was added in 1984.  Positive project results are partly attibutable to the use of cost reimbursement, which has allowed close monitoring of project activities. Weak points include slow progress in Egyptian efforts to develop longitudinal epidemiological malaria studies and lack of promise in Israeli studies to define the mosquito fauna and its biology in the Negev. Both Egyptian and Israeli students working with the project (6 at the Ph.D., 38 at the M.Sc., and 9 at the undergraduate and technical levels) are bright and enthusiastic and the training environment is excellent (several Ph.D. students have made significant publications).  Six meetings have taken place among scientists, but students have played a small part in regional cooperation. It is recommended that the project be renewed, with (1) additional U.S. personnel assigned in parasite immunodiagnosis and in the biohazard aspects of virology and (2) emphasis on leishmaniasis and rapid diagnostic procedures.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","11/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Disease vectors|Malaria|Leishmaniasis|Arthropods|Scientific cooperation|Universities and colleges|Epidemiology|Disease research","Egypt|Israel","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAS103.pdf","18,025 KB","004200 - USAID.

"Evaluates project in Lesotho to prevent childhood communicable diseases through immunizations, diarrheal disease control, training, health education, health information systems, and operational research. Special evaluation covers the period 1984-7/85 and is based on interviews with Ministry of Health (MOH), A.I.D., and Combating Childhood Communicable Diseases (CCCD) project staff. Overall, management of the CCCD/Lesotho project has been effective, especially in its use of TA for training, health education, project administration, and computer programming. Coordination among host country, major multilateral, and bilateral donors is excellent, and project funding is on schedule. Good progress has been made in development of the Health Information Service (HIS), particularly in the areas of computerization, general data collection, and analysis.  Training outputs have exceeded first year expectations:  (1) seven continuing education seminars for all levels of health care providers in immunizations, diarrheal diseases, health information systems, and health education; (2) a Training of Trainers Workshop for two participants from each Health Service Area utilizing adapted mid-level management modules; and (3) development of an 18-month training plan.  An estimated 300 health care providers have been trained in CCCD-related interventions and support components. Health education activities have been successfully integrated into the CCCD-related interventions - training modules, printed materials, and formulation of training plans and curriculum. Recommendations are, inter alia, that a formal review of the training component be conducted to avoid excess and duplicate training; and that 5-Year Plans for diarrheal disease control and for the Expanded Program for Immunization (EPI) be developed and adopted.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","7/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Child health care|Communicable diseases|Immunizations|Health education|Health professional education|Institution building|Project sustainability|Disease prevention and control|Limited data","Lesotho","","","000013 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to improve primary health care and maternal/child health and family planning (MCH/FP) service delivery in Sudan.  Special evaluation covers the period 10/80-1984 and is based on document review, interviews with project and Government of Sudan (GOS) officials, and site visits in the Kordofan region. An increase in A.I.D. resources is merited given the project's importance to development and drought relief efforts in Sudan. However, the GOS cannot support the project and many problems have been experienced, such as:  28- and 20-month respective contracting delays in the North and South; design problems from inadequate field work and failure to address constraints in the implementation plan (e.g., transport problems were ignored); and the lack of strategy governing implementation and sequencing of the 100-plus activities (e.g., decisionmakers in the South and in Kordofan adopted a top-down rather than the project's bottom-up orientation).  In the South, implementation has been impeded by security problems (and has essentially ceased in Upper Nile and Bahr El Ghazal areas). MCH/FP institutionalization has been severely hampered by lack of national guidance, and in Kordofan by the division of preventive and curative services.  The little progress made in the North in developing regional health management capabilities has come through informal on-the-job training, oriented toward service delivery rather than management; local government redivision in the South has diffused personnel and complicated administration. Supervision has been a major problem, and the project's failure to devise manpower development plans is of real concern given cost and staffing constraints. A ""brain drain"" among trained health workers has also handicapped the project, especially in training village health workers and developing curricula and training materials. Although little progress has been made toward community participation or development in the North, considerable efforts have been made in the South, and with good results.  Also in the South, formal and informal training have contributed to good progress in drug supply and distribution; the 3 pharmacies in the North, however, are not serving rural areas, and though several studies were completed, few attempts have been made to address Kordofan's specific drug distribution problems. Detailed recommendations are provided.","PIO/T no. 650-0030-3-20140A1|Related document: PD-AAS-311","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-1406-I-00-4061-00","","4/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Primary health care|Maternal child health care|Family planning services|Health delivery|Regional development|Health care administration","Sudan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDBAW097.pdf","2,763 KB","002615 - John Snow Public Health Group, Inc.","","008607 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to establish the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Agricultural Development Planning Center (ADPC) in Thailand.  Special evaluation covers the period 1981-1985 and is based on document review and interviews with faculty from Kasetsart University and project, USAID/T, and Government of Thailand (GOT) personnel. The training component has been highly successful, cost-effective, and well regarded by trainees.  Over 200 persons (vs. 105 planned) have been trained through:  micro group management training (focused on project planning, monitoring, and evaluation) for 111 mid-level government personnel; special group highly technical training for 39 senior government technicians; leader group training for 11 senior government officials; and Master's degree training in agricultural economics for 48 mid-level professionals.  The success of the latter program has been due to excellent instruction at Kasetsart University and the requirement of an M.S. thesis; however, some M.S. students had difficulty passing the comprehensive examination, maintaining an acceptable grade point average, completing the thesis on time, and gaining adequate English-language proficiency.  In addition, this program suffers from a weak nomination/selection process for trainees and a limited curriculum. ADPC's research and planning branch (RPB) has been moderately successful.  Although the RPB has produced a number of technically proficient agricultural studies and workshops, its research rationale was not clearly defined in the project design and it suffers from a lack of focus.  Also, planning and data bank activities have been well designed and executed, but their costs far outstrip ADPC's current capabilities. Overall, project administration has been weak, owing to poor project design; ADPC was established with no reference to similar organizations, no A.I.D. or ASEAN review of operating policies/procedures, and no effort to obtain outside funding. There has been little coordination among ADPC, the Board of Planners, and USAID/T.  Also, ADPC suffers from poor recruiting and/or retaining of senior personnel because of low salaries, as well as low visibility in the ASEAN region. Eighteen recommendations to address the above issues are given.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural planning|Agricultural research|Research planning|Training centers|Research organizations|Regional development|Beneficiary count|Beneficiary interviews","Southeast Asia|Thailand","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAS122.pdf","1,937 KB","004533 - Association of Southeast Asian Nations.

"Evaluates three projects to help the Government of Sri Lanka (GSL) implement its Accelerated Mahaweli Program (AMP) to develop the Mahaweli River Basin through irrigation construction, settlement establishment, and provision of support infrastructure.  Special evaluation covers the period 6/80-6/85 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with GSL and USAID/SL personnel and with beneficiaries. Although progress has been slower and costs higher than expected, implementation compares favorably with similar complex undertakings elsewhere in the region.  While the GSL continues to give high priority to the AMP, the program remains heavily dependent on continued donor support. Construction of main and branch canals in System B of the AMP is on target, with adequate funds available for these activities; claim and arbitration demands by the contractor, due to civil strife, may deplete these resources, however.  Downstream infrastructure development in System B is falling short of target, with logistics, rather than funds, the main constraint; it is unlikely that distribution and drainage canals will be in place when the main and branch canals are completed. Also, the need to establish an appropriate settler recruitment policy before introducing large numbers of new arrivals, and to review development approaches on the more marginal soils of System B, may require adjustment of the rate of development.  Most settlers in Zones 1 and 5 are living at subsistence level, with less than 20% of irrigable paddy area cultivated and less than 10% irrigated. The Sector Support Loan (3830078) has contributed significantly to AMP downstream activities, but would have had greater impact on increasing U.S. exports if more information had been available to the GSL on U.S. products and marketing procedures.  The reimbursement rate under the loan was slowed initially by a number of factors, most of which are remediable. More attention needs to be given to consolidating gains in all AMP systems in order to accelerate crop production and income benefits through improved operation and maintenance of infrastructure and improved pricing, storage, marketing, and related facilities for farmers.  These and other issues are addressed in recommendations.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-0000-I-30-3083-00","","6/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","River basins|Irrigated farming|Irrigated land|Irrigation system construction|Land improvement|Land tenancy|Settlement establishment|Beneficiary interviews","Sri Lanka","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAS125.pdf","6,090 KB","000673 - International Science and Technology Institute, Inc.

"In Spring 1973, A.I.D. reviewed its small farmer credit (SFC) programs to determine why so many had recently failed and to set conditions to improve future SFC programs.  The effect of the Spring Review is analyzed in this study, which is based on an examination of 150 evaluations of 80 SFC projects undertaken between 1973 and 1985 and on indepth analyses of 50 of those projects. The study found that since credit is typically a very small part of farm production costs, its absence is seldom a major constraint and its presence, even when highly subsidized, cannot offset other constraints. Specifically, the roughly one-third of the projects that proved successful were those that recognized three factors.  (1) Farmers can invest credit productively only when appropriate technology and supporting services such as inputs, extension, and marketing are available.  (2) Developing country policies (price controls, taxes) and economic conditions (inflation, interest rates) often need reform if agricultural development efforts are to succeed.  (3) Mechanisms for credit delivery/recovery (assessment of creditworthiness, loan disbursements, loan monitoring, loan recovery) are best handled on a local level.  Farmer groups, when well organized and committed to development, were positive factors in this regard. The thoroughness of a loan application form and of the loan review process had little relationship to repayment rates.  The key factors were the local loan officer's ability to judge character and creditworthiness, and good accounting, recordkeeping, and control practices in the local loan institution.  Projects that worked with an existing rather than a new institution succeeded best, as did projects that provided technical assistance and training to improve institutional capacity.  The study also found that provision of an interest subsidy to borrowers undid a large number of projects and that cheap credit can create resource misallocations by encouraging inappropriate technology and inappropriate investment - lenders that provided cheap credit were not financially viable, whereas those that set lending rates high enough to cover their cost of capital were successful.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","10/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural credit|Small|Farmers|Appropriate technology|Financial institutions|Agricultural inputs|Financial management|Government policy|Economic conditions|Local level|Loans|Interest rates|Agricultural investments","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAL074.pdf","130 KB","000156 - USAID.

"Evaluates Title III Food for Development program.  Special evaluation covers the period 7/83-9/85; methodology is not stated. The Government of Bangladesh (BDG) displayed great ability in anticipating and preparing for the potential crisis in food supply resulting from a drought and subsequent flooding in 1984. Responsible management of the Public Food Distribution Service (PFDS) probably averted a serious situation.  Consumer prices were constrained and supply was sufficient.  Contributing significantly to this success were recent additions to public storage capacity; local transport improvements; improvements in the Food Ministry management and logistical capacity; effective coordination of interministerial relief activities; and targeting of relief operations using a quantitative index of flood damage. However, these effective measures, while avoiding a 1984 famine, ironically now form the base of an excessive supply in 1985. Problems in procurement and storage have developed, resulting in a revival of Marketing Operations (MO) and a rather dormant Open Market Sales (OMS) program.  Progress toward restructuring of the PFDS to remove unwarranted subsidies has been incremental, but full elimination of such subsidies through removal of rice in the ration system is a political decision of the highest level, unlikely to be made before the upcoming presidential election. As record local production has tended to keep market prices below OMS trigger prices, OMS offtakes have declined sharply, slowing the generation of local currency.  In addition, most of the projects previously financed, in part, by taka generated under the program have now been successfully completed, and the overall rate of taka disbursement has therefore fallen sharply.  The Mission and BDG are planning more productive mechanisms for generating local currency by sale of Title III commodities and additional eligible projects. Development of an early-warning mathematical model for agroclimatic forecasting of crop yields has been delayed by computer unavailability. Recommendations address in particular: (1) BDG procurement, management, and distribution of food reserves; and (2) use of local currency generations.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","10/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Food for Peace Title III|Food marketing|Crop prices|Food prices|Retail prices|Price regulation|Food reserves","Bangladesh","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAS127.pdf","1,860 KB","008511 - USAID.

"Evaluates effectiveness of A.I.D. strategy to channel term credit and other services to small and medium scale rural enterprises (SME's) through commercial banks.  Comparative study is based on mid-term evaluations of projects in Kenya and Thailand. The projects have been successful, reaching target groups at low cost to A.I.D. and already serving as catalysts for further private enterprise development (USAID/K has developed a large follow-on project, and USAID/T a major rural SME industrial strategy).  Both projects, however, have suffered from implementation problems resulting mainly from three factors: understaffing at the AID/PRE Office of Investment, delays in the Business Advisory Services (BAS) function, and problems within participating banks (e.g., organizational problems, uncertainty as to BAS activities).  These difficulties contributed to a slow draw down of loan funds in Kenya and late or limited use of grant funds in both countries. Approaches to implementation have differed in the two countries. The Kenya Commercial Finance Company (KCFC) has tried to focus on the lower end of the target group, making 38 loans averaging $43,000, and has been able to draw down only $1.8 million (m) of the $5m credit line.  The KCFC has charged the maximum allowable interest rate, including a 1% fee to insure against foreign exchange risk; in many cases KCFC failed to make reliable judgments as to its clients' creditworthiness.  The Siam Commercial Bank (SCB), on the other hand, made larger loans (15 averaging $266,747) which had more immediate impact, but tended to reach well-established medium scale enterprises; the SCB lent at below market rates, passing on the exchange risk to borrowers, and managed its portfolio professionally. The key lesson is that a good preliminary understanding of the objectives and policy limitations (i.e., risk-avoidance) of the commercial institution involved is required, and that it cannot be assumed that an institution is fully capable of implementing a loan or grant agreement.  Other lessons:  A.I.D. can and should encourage more LDC commercial lenders to undertake SME term lending; and frequent monitoring and continous management are necessary due to the experimental nature of the projects. Recommendations, particularly concerning the BAS, are provided.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","6/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Small scale enterprises|Medium scale enterprises|Rural areas|Commercial banks|Long term credit|Limited data","Thailand|Kenya","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAS129.pdf","149 KB","000165 - USAID.

"Evaluates pilot project to assist small- and medium-scale rural enterprises in Thailand by providing commercially priced term credit and other services through the Siam Commercial Bank (SCB). Special evaluation covers the period 9/82-10/84 and is based on site visits, review of loan files, and interviews with SCB, other bank, USAID/T, and U.S. Embassy Economic personnel. The project's development impact is evident.  SCB has disbursed all $4 million in A.I.D. and matching loan funds, reaching 15 enterprises, 5 of which were start-up ventures and 8 small-scale; the average loan was $266,747 and net assets per borrower after the loan were $660,714.  (One borrower, medium in size at the time of the loan, now has net assets of over $10 million.)  A total of 817 new jobs have been created at an average loan cost of $4,775 (and average total cost of $8,905).  Women are the managers of 3 of the firms, participate in the management of at least 3 others, and constitute a significant portion of borrowers' workforces.  SCB's flexible and thorough loan management has been commendable; the only major drawback in loan operations is that the firms have had to assume foreign exchange risk.  SCB plans to continue the loan program with its own resources. Less successful, however, has been the project's grant component to establish an SCB Business Advisory Service (BAS).  SCB has been uncertain as to what function the BAS should have and which activities should be financed under the grant.  To date, grant funds have been used only for training of staff members.  SCB feels that A.I.D. should add more resources to BAS so that funds will be available to assist borrowers throughout their loan periods. Project cost to the U.S. has been low because the interest rate charged by A.I.D. is only 1% percent below the U.S. Treasury rate. The project has shown that commercial lending is a viable means of private enterprise development, although when dealing with commercial banks, it is critical to understand at the outset their ojectives - especially as related to project objectives - and operational limitations.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","4/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Commercial banks|Pilot projects|Long term credit|Commercial credit|Small scale enterprises|Medium scale enterprises|Rural areas","Thailand","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAS130.pdf","937 KB","000165 - USAID.

"Evaluates pilot project to assist small- and medium-scale rural enterprises in Kenya by providing commercially priced term credit and other services through the Kenya Commercial Finance Company, Ltd. (KCFC).  Special evaluation covers the period 1/83-10/84 and is based on analysis of the KCFC loan portfolio and interviews with USAID/K and KCFC personnel and with subborrowers. The project's development impact is evident.  KCFC has made 38 loans (averaging $43,000), 37 of them to small enterprises, and over half to very small (fewer than 10 employees) enterprises; 74% of the loans have been made to first time entrepreneurs and the remaining loans have helped existing firms expand operations, diversify product lines, and/or replace equipment.  Women are either sole owners or (more typically) partial owners of 35% of the firms to which loans were made.  Loan recipients represent a cross-section of Kenya's ethnic and racial groups; the majority (71%) are involved in food processing activities. Draw down of A.I.D. loan funds is behind schedule, however, primarily due to KCFC's limited marketing efforts, the high interest rate charged (19%, the maximum allowable in Kenya), and cumbersome A.I.D. procurement regulations.  KCFC loan management is equal to or better than the general level of bank performance in Africa; there has been excessive dependence on collateral, however. The project's Business Advisory Services (BAS) component - to be funded through a grant to KCFC's parent firm, the Kenya Commercial Bank (KCB) - has not been implemented partly because of insufficient management attention by the understaffed AID/PRE Office of Investment, but also due to organizational problems at the KCB, and to unrealistic expectations regarding BAS. While it is important that A.I.D. realize the limitations of commercial banks, this experimental project has proven that term lending to small- and medium-scale rural enterprises through the commercial banking system is a viable development strategy; replication in other countries is suggested.  Other recommendations are to hire a local project manager; implement BAS as soon as possible; try to reduce the interest rate charged; and permit lending to agribusiness operations that include agricultural production.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","4/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Commercial banks|Long term credit|Pilot projects|Rural areas|Commercial credit|Small scale enterprises|Medium scale enterprises|Beneficiary interviews","Kenya","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAS132.pdf","896 KB","000165 - USAID.

"Evaluates component of watershed management project in Cape Verde to establish a pilot agricultural extension service directed at the small farmer. Final internal report covers the period 1981-84; methodology is not given. Under the project, both dryland and irrigated land farmers have been able to improve their situations. The number of farmers receiving instruction or assistance has clearly exceeded the projected 1,500-2,000; specifically, the project has: trained 192 farmers in various aspects of vegetable production; provided 1,320 fruit trees (grown at Flamengos under project supervision) to 227 irrigated land farmers; cultivated 67,000 trees in nurseries during 1984 and 1985, which were either provided to 3,766 farm families for reforestation (mostly acacia americana) or used to plant arid land slopes in contour ditches; and assisted 917 farm families plant pigeon peas on steep, dryland slopes. The 4 extensionists and their coordinator have been trained in vegetable and fruit tree production, crop protection, reforestation, biological soil erosion control, and extension methods; they also received training on farmer interviews and farm surveys through participation in a mid-1984 farm survey, and in late 1984 began animal production training in Trinidad. The Program Director has undergone extension training at U.S. universities, and another Verdean has begun U.S. B.S. studies. While selecting young extensionist candidates from the valleys in which they are to work has preempted housing, transportation, and adjustment problems, the lack of formal agricultural training and relatively low level of education of these same has been a negative factor. The project has also developed linkages between extension and related units, particularly the Center for Agrarian Studies. However, the project could be improved by: recruiting women extensionists to promote cottage industry and nutrition among the 33% of households in the project area headed by women; marketing fresh produce more widely and over the course of the year; holding quarterly meetings among involved agencies; providing B.S. or M.S. training for the Director and increased training for extensionists on monitoring cultivated areas and crop yields. Several recommendations for follow on activities are given.","Attachment : XD-BAV-351-A","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","4/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Pilot projects|Agricultural extension|Agricultural extension agents|Agricultural extension training|Farmer training|Agricultural production|Beneficiary count","Cape Verde","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDBAV351.pdf","14,583 KB","008525 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to provide scholarships at regional institutions to health professionals from ASEAN-member countries. Joint TROPMED/USAID evaluation covers the period 1981-9/85 and is based on document review and extensive interviews. The ASEAN Governing Body has effectively allocated scholarships, granting 417 to date for diploma and Master's degree programs at national training centers belonging to TROPMED, a consortium of medical schools coordinated by SEAMEO.  The project target of 500 scholarships will probably be exceeded by 5-10%.  Highly flexible implementation guidelines, in which the sole restriction limits the number of scholars attending their home country institution to 25% of the total, have allowed training to address national needs while expanding regional cooperation and institutional linkages; in allocating scholarships, ASEAN has demonstrated a commitment to regional cooperation over and above national and institutional loyalties.  During the past 2 years scholarships have been used less frequently to reward senior personnel, and an increasing number have been awarded to scholars from regional (i.e., subnational) and provincial institutions. The training has been relevant to the region's health research and delivery systems and seems to be meeting a strong demand; a recent questionnaire shows that most alumni return home to continue public health work - primarily in academic teaching positions and government health programs - and generally in a higher or more technical position. Moreover, the scholarships have proved 60% less costly than U.S. training and have provided needed operations funding for the training centers. It is recommended that:  A.I.D. continue to support health scholarships; ASEAN and SEAMEO continue to support linkages within and among ASEAN countries to maximize health resources; and a design team begin work on a follow-on project, giving additional consideration to simplifying the approval process for scholarship recipients.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","9/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Scholarships|Health professional education|Regional development|Cooperation|Tropical medicine|Beneficiary count|Beneficiary interviews","Southeast Asia|Thailand|Singapore|Indonesia|Malaysia|Philippines","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAS185.pdf","2,475 KB","","","004200 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to strengthen the capability of governments of Philippine cities chartered as rural service centers (RSC's) to serve the needs of the poor.  Special evaluation covers 1978-84; no methodology is given. The project seems to be making headway in redressing poverty. Training and TA have been effective in developing RSCs' development capabilities, as demonstrated in the growth in the number of subprojects (SP's) from the initial 16 to 246, with 212 still in operation (city development staff, however, see a need for continued training in community organization and project preparation, management, and supervision).  In addition, SP orientation has shifted from infrastructure to income generation. Individually implemented SP's appear to have greater income and employment impact and chance of success, while group-implemented SP's develop a stronger sense of community; prior community preparation, design factors such as market access and the existence of prior skills, and the effectiveness of monitoring have also been factors critical to SP success. Due to budget difficulties, SP authorization has virtually ceased since 1983.  However, a financial management system has been developed, tested, and, now introduced in 10 local governments (LG's), shows potential in some cases for enabling LG's to respond early to financial difficulties.  Also, preliminary experience in 4 cities in mobilizing private groups' involvement in SP's has been encouraging. Two of three cycles of training for project devolution (planned to begin in 2/85) have been completed in Ministry of LG offices in pilot regions, and these offices are ready to assume project management.  The project is not ready for nationwide replication, however, lacking in particular a monitoring system to examine the impacts of departures from planned procedures; also, an MLG Central Office capability for managing the program will be needed, devolution notwithstanding. The project should be extended for 3 years, to evaluate and revise the project in year 1 and introduce changes, expand the project, and test replicability in years 2 and 3.  Linkage with the ongoing Local Resource Management (LRM) project is both desirable and necessary, but until a form of institutional linkage can be agreed upon, piecemeal efforts to limit project expansion in areas not covered by LRM and to coordinate RSC and LRM activites are recommended.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Local level|Cities and towns|Secondary cities|Pilot projects|Community development|Community self help|Government departments|Institution building","Philippines","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAS186.pdf","2,556 KB","","","008592 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to establish the Haitian Development Finance Corporation (SOFHIDES) to provide credit and technical and financial support services to industrial projects.  Special evaluation covers the period through 8/85 and is based on a review of SOFHIDES systems, procedures, and reports. SOFHIDES has successfully tailored its loan portfolio to its many and often conflicting development objectives - generating capital through loans to larger, more experienced companies in industrial areas, providing a mix of long- and medium-term loans in several industrial sectors, and providing loans to both medium- and high-risk companies. SOFHIDES' procedures for identifying projects and evaluating potential and existing loans are well conceived and are being implemented. SOFHIDES has hired a competent General Manager and established a strong Board of Directors with effective operating committees, although a shortage of local managers has made SOFHIDES rely on expatriates in this area.  SOFHIDES has also recruited a small, but capable and well respected staff and is planning an offsite staff training program with the help of USAID/H funding. Nonetheless, continual recruitment of local staff to meet the needs of its growing portfolio is an important task facing SOFHIDES. Despite several tangible market constraints, sound management has enabled SOFHIDES to become financially sound in a relatively short period of time; profitability is expected during FY86. Since, however, these same constraints preclude maintenance of SOFHIDES' current high level of portfolio growth, SOFHIDES intends over the next 5 years to spread risk factors over its various project categories and limit working capital loans to project-related loans.  Continued USAID financial and technical support is recommended. In regard to economic impact, over 2,000 jobs have been created through SOFHIDES' 27 projects, and its projects are expected to provide an average of $4.5 million in foreign exchange per year; the average value added has been 58%.  Also, SOFHIDES' loan preparation and appraisal process has helped introduce new analytical techniques, improved management skills, and shown the advantage of long-term financing.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","8/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Development banks|Industrial credit|Institution building|Limited data","Haiti","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAS187.pdf","472 KB","003972 - First Washington Associates, Ltd.

"Evaluates project to establish the Caribbean Financial Services Corporation (CFSC) to provide credit to private businesses in the English-speaking Caribbean.  Special evaluation covers the period 6/83-6/85 and is based on document review and interviews with A.I.D. and CFSC personnel, CFSC shareholders, and members of the Caribbean business community. CFSC has been extremely successful in its first year of operations. The combination of a very small (3 persons) but competent staff and a supportive board of directors has provided the CFSC with effective management; the staff will be expanded by 1-3 persons over the next 3 years.  CFSC's marketing strategy, aimed at developing high visibility and consisting of personal and public relations within the financial sector and direct mailings of brochures and annual reports to potential clients, has generated a solid flow of loan projects in a wide range of industrial sectors and countries.  A somewhat more aggressive marketing program is needed however, as commercial and development banks have not directed many worthwhile loan projects to CFSC. To date, CFSC has committed $3,400,000 (of which $1,920,000 has been disbursed) in loans to 14 companies distributed among the tourism, manufacturing, and agribusiness sectors in Barbados, Antigua, St. Lucia, St. Kitts, and Guyana (the latter not financed with A.I.D. funds).  Most loans have been for plant expansion and/or equipment purchases, but one start-up venture has been financed.  Loans for start-up programs have purposely been limited in order to gain lending experience with the minimum amount of risk; new venture financing will be expanded in the future.  Credit evaluation and risk control policies have been thorough, but kept simple in order to burden neither bank nor borrowers with unnecessary paperwork.  Loan projects are evaluated with respect to their risk and their consistency with CFSC's development objectives. CFSC has also been extremely diligent in complying with its project agreements with A.I.D. Based on conservative estimates, demand for CFSC credit (by firms meeting A.I.D. requirements) will far exceed A.I.D.'s current commitment. Recommendations include specific suggestions for using A.I.D. grant funds in the areas of marketing, training, new business development, and operations management.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","6/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Institution building|Commercial credit|Financial institutions|Loans|Private enterprises|Industrial credit|Limited data plus","Eastern Caribbean","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAS188.pdf","4,779 KB","000743 - Arthur D.

"Evaluates grant to Winrock International (WI) to provide technical backstopping to PVO's and LDC agencies involved in improving livestock production.  Special evaluation covers the period 8/81-3/85 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with and/or questionnaire responses from project and USAID personnel and beneficiaries. WI's program has been well designed and supportive of A.I.D.'s technology transfer policy.  WI has helped PVO's and host country agencies keep up with developments in animal agriculture through its information service, including a computerized data base of 12,000 references (possibly the largest block of references on goats and sheep in the world, although the size of the computer system exceeds WI's needs) and mailings of its BULLETIN and TECHNOTES to 2,022 organizations.  WI has also developed and published region-specific training aids, books, manuals, and slide and videotape presentations. Two-week workshops on sheep and goat production have been conducted in the Philippines, Honduras, and Indonesia for 127 participants (including instructors).  The workshops have incorporated practical experience and animal demonstrations.  The key to effective workshops has been selecting a local leader to organize the workshop, find instructors, and arrange field demonstrations.  Training trainers in technology transfer is a slow way of producing change, however, and A.I.D. must make a long-term commitment if it expects results. WI has only limited capacity to provide TA (which is done only on a cost reimbursement basis).  WI has responded to a total of 21 requests for TA, of which 6 were for on-site TA (in Dominica, Kenya, Panama, and the Dominican Republic).  Agencies in the Dominican Republic, Haiti, Peru, Colombia, Costa Rica, India, Nigeria, Zaire, and the United States have also benefited from WI services. It is recommended that A.I.D. continue to support WI activities by priority of (1) workshops, (2) information services, (3) technical services, and (4) BULLETIN and TECHNOTES publication; and that A.I.D. consider interim funding while WI prepares a follow-up multiyear matching grant proposal.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-0182-G-SS-1086-00","","3/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Private voluntary organizations|Animal husbandry|Livestock|Technology transfer|Technical assistance|Beneficiary interviews|Limited data plus","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAS195.pdf","7,169 KB","004307 - Winrock International.

"Evaluates project to assist the Royal Thai Government's (RTG) nationwide malaria control (MC) program.  Ex post evaluation is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with regional officials, volunteers, and field workers. During the project's 5-year life (1979-84), the MC program made substantial progress, the project assisting all levels of the RTG's Malaria Division, with primary emphasis on interventions at the first point of contact in the MC delivery system.  TA was more than adequate, while training, especially inservice and pre-service training, and facility construction and renovation resulted in a tremendous expansion of the malaria clinic and malaria village volunteer network.  The provision of commodities, health education materials, and motorcycles also benefited the program, although the vehicle overhaul effort proved disappointing.  Of 8 operational research projects, anti-malaria drug studies and a study of an MC early warning system had immediate or potential value, but the rest were of minimal value. Greater benefit might have been derived from the use of more short-term consultants, especially in the areas of applied field research and the use of supplementary and alternative vector control measures. Despite progress, population migration and the persistent resistance to drugs of P. falciparum retard MC effectiveness; the malaria transmission rate remains high in certain control areas.  Several program areas require attention.  These include, inter alia:  (1) a weak residual house spraying program (due for the most part to shortage of insecticides); (2) the need to improve operational entomology, with special attention to monitoring vector susceptibility to DDT and fenitrothion and studying malaria foci in regard to time and place; (4) the need for academically trained malariologists; and (5) the need to replace unfit vehicles and to provide zone and sector offices with permanent buildings.  Stress is laid on strengthening research capabilities, especially of the Field Applied Research Station. Recommendations address these and other areas and stress the need to develop an overall plan to improve the program.","Revised ed.: PD-AAV-481","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","7/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Malaria|Disease prevention and control|Disease detection|Disease research|Paramedical education|Health education|Clinics|Mosquitoes","Thailand","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAS198.pdf","1,645 KB","008613 - USAID.

"Evaluates pilot project in Peru's Junin and Cajamarca departments to strengthen decentralized regional planning and implement market town/rural area subprojects.  Final special evaluation covers the period 1979-6/85 and is based on site visits and interviews with involved personnel and beneficiaries. Despite many obstacles, the project made substantial, albeit uneven, progress toward its objectives.  Regional planning, focused on urban-rural linkages, was improved through the establishment of PRODERINS (departmental organizations created to implement the project, which became models of efficiency and dedication).  Although practical applications were less than desired, public works projects implemented by the PRODERINS - many with self-help labor - have increased employment and income opportunities (e.g., roads from market towns to farm areas improved marketing opportunities for farmers and created commerce and food processing jobs in the towns).  However, the process of integrating the PRODERINS into Departmental Development Corporations (CORDES), ongoing since 1983, is proving a delicate business at best. Following, also in 1983, establishment of the National Institute for Municipal Development and of a project TA unit aimed at strengthening CORDES' ability to assist municipalities through training and TA, reasonable progress has been made in involving municipalities in Peruvian decentralization. The Key Market Town Development Fund, intended for a variety of market town investments, was implemented inflexibly by the Housing Bank and used only to fund electrification and one slaughterhouse/trout processing facility. The project generated a wealth of information on decentralization in Peru, e.g.:  despite promising new legislative empowerment to municipalities, Peru's budgetary and administrative processes are antithetical to decentralization; trainable human resources for development are available at the departmental level; strengthening market town/farm area linkages is a viable development concept; municipalities are a critical potential source of capital, intellect, and labor for development; and local participation is vastly underutilized in rural areas. There is a strong rationale for continued A.I.D. assistance to decentralized development in Peru.  Recommendations for closing out the project and beginning a new decentralization program are provided.","Companion project evaluation summary: PD-AAT-876","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","6/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Integrated regional development|Rural development|Development planning|Decentralization|Pilot projects|Institution building|Cities and towns|Rural urban linkages|Market towns|Beneficiary interviews","Peru","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAS200.pdf","5,121 KB","008591 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to provide education in nutrition and agriculture to children in the primary school system of Zaire. Special evaluation covers the period 1984-85 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with project staff and students (beneficiaries). The curriculum devised by the staff of the National Center for Human Nutrition Planning (CEPLANUT) is far more innovative and participatory than the curriculum guide provided by the government, and marks the first attempt to introduce such a detailed course into the public school system.  The curriculum, 300 lessons in agriculture and 300 lessons in nutrition/health, will cover grades one to six, and is being pilot-tested in four representative rural schools.  After preliminary evaluations and revisions, project staff plan to print the curriculum and expand the project to include several hundred schools in the Kikwit subregion during the 1986-87 school year. Because the curriculum was developed before any evaluation activities began, important preliminary research was not undertaken; hence the medium- and long-term effects of the project will not be clearly documented.  However, during the two remaining years of the project's life, a number of evaluation activities will be conducted:  bimonthly monitoring in each of the pilot schools; four separate attitudes/practices surveys for grades three through six; a test of teachers' knowledge; a curriculum-based test of student knowledge for grades three through six; and an observational study in the pilot villages to document changes in attitudes and practices.  A thorough curriculum revision/review will be made to ensure that the material is not overwhelming to untrained teachers; and a final assessment will be made of the project's impact on the knowledge, attitudes, and practices of the target children.  Because these activities will overburden the present staff, it is recommended that an additional Zairian staff member join the nutrition education/monitoring team, at least from 1/1/86-7/1/86.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/DSAN-C-0209","","12/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural education|Basic education|Primary education|Rural areas|Curriculum design|Nutrition education|Beneficiary interviews","Congo DR","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAS204.pdf","581 KB","000657 - Education Development Center, Inc.

"Food for Work (FFW) programs are a valuable development instrument and should be strengthened, particularly given their increasing importance in the face of declining levels of financial aid, yet as currently operated FFW does not perform to its potential.  Such is the conclusion of this report, which - based on an examination of field data from 18 FFW programs - suggests ways in which A.I.D. can improve policies structuring the FFW environment and in which PVO's can improve FFW design and management.  It is recommended, specifically, that A.I.D.:  (1) establish FFW as a development-oriented rather than mainly humanitarian program; (2) dedicate at least 25% of FFW funds for complementary, non-food inputs; (3) focus PVO incentives on development impacts rather than commodity management; (4) improve FFW programs that evolve from emergency relief; (5) reconsider the role of self-help labor contributions; (6) assess FFW impacts on food production; and (7) ensure that food wages are high enough to benefit the poor.  Guidelines for PVO's in designing future FFW programs (i.e., analyzing the program environment, defining a specific strategy, then creating an appropriate management structure) are discussed in detail.  Lastly, issues relevant to the future of FFW - its effectiveness in Africa, appropriate monitoring and evaluation practices, integration with other programs, and innovative use of FFW - are addressed. Provided are 7 pages of references (1971-84) and 12 tables.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","10/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Food for Work|Development assistance|Development project design|Private voluntary organizations|USAID","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAT862.pdf","1,392 KB","000553 - Harvard University.

"Evaluates project to strengthen agrometeorological, hydrological, and meteorological (AGRHYMET) services in the Sahel.  External evaluation covers 1982-9/85 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with project, counterpart, and donor personnel. Both the project and the overall AGRHYMET program have produced several positive achievements, but neither has progressed as quickly as expected.  Logistic and technical problems - attributable to the contractor, the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), which has in particular failed to provide sufficient technical staff - have slowed procurement of computer and telecommunications (TC) equipment; 8 of 10 planned computer systems are operational at the AGRHYMET Regional Center (ARC) and at three National AGRHYMET Centers (NAC's), while TC equipment is in place at 6 NAC's.  TC for both data collection and transmission is inadequate, and the computer system neither adapted to nor large enough for the region.  Lack of a method to collect crop and pasture data has been another key constraint. Nonetheless, decadal bulletins of fair to good quality are being produced by NAC's, as are both decadal and monthly bulletins by the ARC. Two key achievements of this Phase II project have been the creation of multidisciplinary working groups and implementation of a pilot project (""Haute Vallee"") in Mali in which use of AGRHYMET data has increased millet, sorghum, and arachide yields by up to 45%; similar pilots are being launched elsewhere in the Sahel by other donors. ARC training (300 graduates) has quickly developed a trained cadre for NAC's, but U.S. computer training has been insufficiently practical and also troubled by lengthy delays, high costs, and attrition (7 participants).  Only 9 of the 31 participants have thus far returned to NAC posts (where, as a result, computer maintenance has been inadequate).  Key NAC and ARC positions are still held by expatriates, which has not only put a strain on donor funding (virtually frozen for the last 4 years), but has added to administrative difficulties at the ARC, and most importantly, hindered attempts to institutionalize the program. Three prior, other-donor evaluation teams lacked technical skills and failed to note NOAA's inadequate performance.  USAID technical oversight has also been remiss, monitoring personnel have been inexperienced and/or overworked, and recordkeeping and reporting poor.","Companion project evaluation summary: PD-BBA-843","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","9/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Agrometeorology|Meteorology|Hydrology|Information services|Agricultural planning|Computer networks","Sahel","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAS216.pdf","3,029 KB","000981 - Pragma Corp.","","000032 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to support nutrition education and promote improved infant feeding practices.  Special evaluation covers the period 9/79-9/85 and is based on site visits, document review, and interviews with Mission, AID/W, and International Nutrition Communications Services (INCS) personnel. Most targets have been met.  INCS has provided TA in 35 countries, held 30 conferences and training workshops, provided about 120 person-months of training, and designed, initiated, expanded, or improved at least 20 nutrition education projects, of which at least 10 have shown preliminary indications of sustained changes.  In addition, INCS has initiated, expanded, or improved breastfeeding promotion projects in about 12 countries (2 of these projects have demonstrated increased breastfeeding prevalence and decreased diarrheal morbidity) and has collected and analyzed improved information on infant feeding practices in four countries.  As a result of these activities, new methodologies and techniques have emerged:  a social marketing methodology appropriate for changing nutrition behavior, use of growth monitoring to strengthen behavioral change, and sensitization of hospital personnel to the advantages of breastfeeding. Three factors have prevented the project from having a greater impact:  lack of continuity or follow-up regarding TA (due to unavailability of experienced consultants, poor communication with clients, inadequate promotion by A.I.D., and insufficient resources); inadequate knowledge among USAID's and PVO's regarding nutrition programming; and insufficient use of subcontractor and consultant expertise, e.g., for setting priorities and developing conceptual models and strategies.  Due to inadequate funding for clearinghouse functions, INCS could only minimally support field needs in this area. The project should be continued, with greater flexibility to provide seed funding and longer-term TA, and priority given to (1) activities most likely to improve child survival and nutritional status (i.e., breastfeeding, growth monitoring, infant feeding during infections); (2) communications approaches (i.e., social marketing with strong monitoring mechanisms); and (3) program situations possessing sufficient commitment, resources, and infrastructure to sustain activities.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Nutrition education|Nutritionist education|Maternal nutrition|Infant nutrition|Breastfeeding","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAS227.pdf","3,517 KB","000189 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to increase regional cooperation between Egypt and Israel in a joint marine technology program.  Mid-term external evaluation covers the period 10/83-4/85 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with senior project personnel in Egypt and Israel. Progress has been steady; the scientific research is generally outstanding, and regional cooperation is good in view of the existing political climate.  The program's annual meeting provides a friendly and open exchange of information with little concern for national affiliations.  However, in some areas constraints still limit technical collaboration.  More progress might have been made had other institutions, (e.g., the Egyptian Ministry of Agriculture), participated. Major problems are:  (1) the reluctance of Egyptians to travel to Israel (Israeli scientists have traveled to Egypt twice in a group and two individual trips have also been made); (2) slow administrative procedures delaying fund disbursements; and (3) the absence of a unified logical framework.  (A logframe developed by the evaluation team to replace the 11 original subproject (SP) logframes is appended.) Four SP's are underway.  Under the Coastal Management and Shore Processes SP, both Egyptian and Israeli scientists cite the increasing reliability of the cassette acquisition system for collecting ocean wave energy data.  As a result of the technology transfer effort begun during Phase I, valuable information is being accumulated on beach profiling, currents, and nearshore wave climate.  Outputs of the Biological Productivity SP are above expectations:  an ""oceanographic baseline"" for the southeastern Mediterranean; progress toward a ""total picture"" of primary productivity; and exposure of many participants, especially Egyptian students, to modern oceanography.  The Monosex Tilapia SP is also performing well, with acquisition of basic data and more experience in breeding techniques.  While the Fish Culture and Nutrition SP is, unfortunately, being phased out, substantial outputs have been generated. Successful and promising as the research is, the project has demonstrated that political differences can inhibit certain professional interactions.  Additional cooperative work, now under consideration, should prove scientifically valuable and help to normalize Egyptian-Israeli relations.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-1096-I-01-4164-00","","5/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Regional development|Technical cooperation|Scientific cooperation|Oceanography research|Marine resources|Agricultural research","Egypt|Israel","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAS254.pdf","3,826 KB","003002 - Ronco Consulting Corp.","","002062 - USAID.

"A.I.D.'s experience with special self-help (SSH) projects is synthesized in this airgram from AID/W to African diplomatic posts, and guidance in selecting and overseeing SSH projects is provided. Dollar for dollar, no other program has produced as much goodwill or visible results.  Successful SSH projects:  stress local initiative and involvement; maximize the number of beneficiaries; improve economic and social conditions; are implemented within a year; and consider local maintenance capabilities in technology choice.  Likewise, good SSH projects do not:  directly support religious, police, or military activities; replace or supplement activities normally supplied by governments; cost over $25,000; continue former USAID projects; use SSH funds for administrative or operating costs; or require ongoing funding. SSH management, a labor-intensive activity, is usually delegated to an SSH officer.  Staff continuity is a key concern, 2 years being the minimum recommended assignment.  Conversely, overly long assignments can threaten program flexibility.  Full- or part-time employment of indigenous or third-country personnel or of Mission spouses are other staffing options.  While PCV's have been key contributors to SSH, care must be taken not to become dependent on them.  Advisory groups of Mission staff are often beneficial, but overall program guidance should be established by an Ambassador's written policy. Methods of project selection depend on local circumstances.  The most effective SSH programs fund several small rather than a few large projects (although an SSH officer cannot manage more than 25-30 activities a year); limiting project funds to $1,000-10,000 promotes activities that are distributed geographically and by economic sector and increases publicity for U.S. Government development support.  To ensure community participation, some Missions require 25% local contribution. Whenever possible, a General Agreement should be signed with the host country to minimize the latter's involvement in project selection. Posts which have never negotiated a General Agreement should consider doing so, taking, however, a low-key approach so as to avoid raising expectations for expanded assistance. Given the inconstancy of the budget process, most SSH funds should be obligated between February and July, and all agreements signed by August 15.  Good recordkeeping and reporting are likely to lead to a larger share of future SSH funds.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","12/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Development administration|Community self help|Small|Development projects|Development strategies","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAS266.pdf","283 KB","000004 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to strengthen the Government of Zambia's (GOZ's) small farm sector agricultural research and extension services. Mid-term (10/83-3/85) outside evaluation is based on document review and extensive interviews. The project has made excellent progress in supporting the G0Z's agricultural research and extension (R/E) program - the unplanned success of which has, in fact, posed logistic problems (which are, however, resolved as they occur).  The project's commodity research teams (CRT's) have developed two new early-maturing maize varieties with high yield potential and disease tolerance, which will be used on-farm in 1985/86, and 2 free-nodulating soybean varieties, which have prompted the planting of soybeans on small farms.  The soil microbiologist purified the local inoculum and introduced 2 more efficient indigenous strains, and it is expected that Zaire will be self-sufficient in inoculum for 1985/86.  Some strains of sunflowers with higher - up to 40% - oil content have been identified, but seed demand has been low; major constraints to the mostly small-farm production of sunflowers have been agronomic practices. The Adaptive Research Planning Teams (ARPT) concept has been very successful in bridging the gap between the CRT's and adaptive farming systems R/E.  ARPT's are operational in several provinces, and the Research Extension Liaison Officer (RELO) in Central Province has shown the concept to be viable for linking commodity research and R/E (so successful that the design team has recommended allowing extension specialists to work more closely with other ARPT members on a regular basis).  While extension has not yet been emphasized, all project staff have been involved in some manner. Successful implementation is in part due to well-qualified project staff and their outstanding success in working with Ministry of Agriculture and Water Development counterparts.  All 34 participants have departed and will complete training during the project; short-term training is on schedule and has been as successful. Recommendations for the remainder of Phase I and for Phase II are provided.","Attached to PD-AAS-309","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural research|Agricultural extension|Small farms|Institution building","Zambia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAS309A.pdf","2,459 KB","","","008627 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to help the Government of Nepal (GON) develop an integrated watershed management program.  Joint AID/GON/external evaluation covers the period 1980-10/85 and is based on site visits, document review, and interviews with project, GON, and donor agency personnel. Activities in two of three project areas (i.e., establishing an Institute of Renewable Natural Resources (IRNR) and conducting participant and on-the-job training, and the construction of field facilities) have been successful.  The IRNR will serve as an important training center for natural resource management in the future.  The construction activity - often carried out under difficult conditions with little or no road access - has completed 174 field buildings, including 12 Department of Soil Conservation and Watershed Management field centers in 3 districts; this activity also has helped to strengthen private sector construction capacities. Although the project has made many significant contributions in the areas of natural resource conservation and agricultural development, it has failed to develop a model for integrated watershed management. Beginning with project design and continuing to the present, the concept of a watershed as an integrating unit has not been used; rather, line agency programs are being implemented within designated basins with only minimal integration.  Another reason integration has not been achieved is that too many (17) diverse and complicated components were tried over too large an area (nearly 5,000 sq. km) too quickly. The project has contributed substantially to increasing popular awareness of and concern for natural resource conservation.  A good start has been made in developing a structure for people's participation, but it has not always been used effectively; there is no synthesis of this experience. monitoring system has been established, but monitoring of physical accomplishments is less advanced.  Progress has been made in developing GON and local level organizational structures upon which a major follow-on project can be built. Lessons learned are enumerated in the areas of design, implementation, personnel development, and construction.  Some recurring themes are the needs to provide increased technical support and coordination and to demonstrate near-term benefits to local populations. Recommendations include to begin integrated management programs in selected very small watersheds and to design separate follow-on projects to support the IRNR and GON watershed capabilities.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-0000-I-03-4105-00","","10/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Natural resource conservation|Natural resource management|Watersheds","Nepal","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAS327.pdf","3,329 KB","000673 - International Science and Technology Institute, Inc.

"Evaluates project to assist the Peoples' Republic of Bangladesh (BDG) in the use of agroclimatic and other remote sensing data to manage natural resources, especially in agriculture and water development. External evaluation covers the period 1980-85 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with personnel of the BDG's Space Research and Remote Sensing Organization (SPARRSO) and a special maintenance task force. The project has made significant progress in providing the BDG with the technical capability to acquire and utilize satellite data for meteorological and land use studies.  The five primary direct outputs have been obtained:  (1) construction and staffing of the SPARRSO facility; (2) installation of the advanced meteorological groundstation; (3) deployment of 11 data collection platforms (DCP's); (4) training of six SPARRSO personnel in the operation and maintenance of the equipment; and (5) routine provision of timely imagery and DCP data to the BDG's Meteorology Department and Water Development Board. However, due to delays in equipment procurement and installation, several institution-building goals have not been realized. SPARRSO has not accepted responsibility for the daily operation and maintenance of the equipment, as it must do if the project is to achieve its secondary goals of routinely providing services to various BDG user agencies. This and other issues are addressed in recommendations. Among lessons learned is the need to address the total systems aspects of high technology transfer - not only equipment and associated personnel needs but also institutional structure.  An institution does not always fully realize the implications of a sudden infusion of technology, or prepare adequately for the additional resources required. Although this project was envisioned as institution building, the facility management aspects were neglected; there were no SPARRSO management personnel trained in similar facilities, nor has SPARRSO recognized the organizational structure required for the management of such a facility on a routine basis.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-1406-I-02-4116-01","","12/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Environmental monitoring|Agrometeorology|Satellites|Space sciences|Remote sensing|Equipment maintenance|Institution building","Bangladesh","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAS328.pdf","1,021 KB","000475 - Environmental Research Institute of Michigan (ERIM)","","008511 - USAID.

"The role played by foreign aid in the Republic of Korea's economic recovery after World War II and the Korean War is examined in this admittedly personal study.  The author believes that although some reasons for the recovery, e.g., linguistic unity, are exclusively Korean, the Korean experience offers some general lessons in achieving sustainable economic growth. At first, Korea pursued a policy of import substitution, discouraging exports and stressing donor support, chiefly from the United States. After 1961, however, the government recognized import substitution's failure to ensure long-term economic growth and initiated an export promotion program while shifting the focus of donor support away from excessive reliance on the United States.  The government used its administrative, political, and social power to control the economy by allocating institutional credit, setting and enforcing export targets, and promoting foreign investment.  The Korean GNP, exports, overseas construction earnings, and manufacturing capacity grew accordingly, despite rising energy prices, a worldwide recession, and a large defense burden. The creation of employment opportunities - a process aided significantly by donors, especially via training and human resource development - has lowered the poverty percentage from 40% to 10% and greatly enhanced equity.  Nevertheless, notable rural and urban income disparities and regional income differences still exist, and women are denied equal status in the development process.  This is largely due to the elimination of pricing subsidies and to the government's control of institutional credit, which limits marketplace access to major industrial and trading conglomerates. While Korea could not have experienced even moderate economic growth after 1953 without substantial donor support, a successful export program, commercial lending, and foreign investment have lessened the amount of concessional aid.  Donor policy advice was generally followed if it was seen as serving Korean interests and supporting national directions already determined by the government.  While multilateral donors have greater prestige and flexibility than bilateral donors, both types have their limitations.","Cover date: Dec 1985|Draft ed.: PN-AAR-550","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","10/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Foreign assistance|Economic growth","Korea R","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAL075.pdf","5,768 KB","000156 - USAID.

Special internal evaluation covers the period 7/84-6/85 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with host country personnel. Program accomplishments have been satisfactory.  A significant amount of program funding (18%) has been allocated to contract research activities; the research projects are progressing well and the contract research program is seen as a powerful tool for institutional development.  In the area of professional development, 14 individuals have pursued Ph.D. and M.Sc. degree programs in irrigation and water management, and 10 short-term water management training courses for 183 individuals have been organized as of 6/85.  A workshop and seminar plan was implemented.  The program has produced many publications on water management research activities and has initiated an annotated bibliography.  In regard to strengthening research/extension linkages, the project has trained 25 subject matter specialists and subject matter officers of the Department of Agricultural Extension, and has encouraged farmers' participation in the Bamboo Tubewell and Command Area Development Projects. Successful water management research requires extensive equipment and trained manpower, components not available to most of the research institutes under the BARC umbrella; there is an urgent need to fill these requirements.  BARC should reappropriate some of the funds assigned to contract research and 6-month overseas training in favor of Ph.D. training and in-country short courses; an in-country internship for Irrigation and Management graduates of the Bangladesh Agricultural University is also urged.  The potential of groundwater resources is far greater than that being currently utilized; many irrigation wells are either not functioning or are producing below their capacity.  The issue of fund release is critical, adversely affecting many projects. Finally, no provision has been made for supplying necessary vehicles to research institutes.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","4/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural research|Agricultural water management|Agricultural technology|Irrigation|Beneficiary count","Bangladesh","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAS363.pdf","1,524 KB","001067 - Bangladesh Agricultural Research Council (BARC)|004307 - Winrock International.

"Evaluates program in Kenya to improve fertilizer distribution, involving the private sector, and increase fertilizer use by small farmers.  First external evaluation covers the period 9/84-7/85 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with distributors, consultants, Government of Kenya (GOK) planners, and farmers. One program objective, to obtain private sector involvement in fertilizer distribution, has already been fully achieved.  During March and April 1985, 20,800 tons of diammonimum phosphate (DAP) were imported and distributed through 16 private firms to the major maize and wheat producing areas. Outside of this, however, little progress has been made in improving fertilizer management and distribution.  Three GOK committees - formed to allocate USAID fertilizers to distributors and to make other decisions on fertilizer matters - have marginally met covenants of the program (although without private sector participation), but committee members do not have sufficient understanding of the role of fertilizers to make timely marketing decisions; the import plan for 1985 was not complete, quantities were not indicated by time frame; tabulations were incorrect; and documentation was late and/or inadequate. Educational programs to improve fertilizer marketing and use are virtually nonexistent, and distribution and pricing systems still favor large over small farmers.  For example, the GOK receives a margin of about 12% on the sale of USAID DAP to wholesale distributors, distributors receive about 8%, but the stockists who directly serve small farmers receive only 1%.  Also, many farmers cannot afford the 50 kg bag of DAP currently available. To correct these problems, a pricing study is being conducted and USAID has proposed introducing 10 kg bags. In sum, an integrated fertilizer marketing system does not at present exist in Kenya:  the GOK chooses products, quantities, and price, while distributors decide only which customers will be supplied and margins to be served.  A long-term master plan is needed to develop a marketing system which is centrally managed by an autonomous organization which has profit and loss responsibility, is self-sustaining, and makes all marketing decisions, e.g., as to product type, product quality, prices, promotional activities, and distribution.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","7/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Nonproject assistance|Private sector|Fertilizer distribution|Beneficiary interviews","Kenya","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDBAW809.pdf","1,848 KB","000630 - International Fertilizer Development Center (IFDC)","","008565 - USAID.

"Evaluates integrated rural development project in the Upper Niger River Valley area administered by the Government of Mali's (GOM's) Operation Haute Vallee (OHV).  Joint U.S./GOM end-of-project evaluation covers the period 1981-8/84, emphasizing progress since a 7/83 redesign, and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews. As the application of A.I.D.'s new Sahel financial certification requirement interrupted disbursements for 6-12 months or more, some project components are significantly behind schedule, and some GOM agencies have yet to resume project activities. Nevertheless, since the project redesign, which stressed strengthening of OHV, significant progress has been made in improving OHV management, integrating poorly-used TA more thoroughly into the system, and initiating medium-term planning. The credit system is being computerized and is reasonably efficient (the number of village groups receiving credit is on the rise) and should be tested with increased funds during the next agricultural campaign.  OHV financial controls are being exercised and procurement controls improved.  Marketing continues to operate fairly well, and some improvements have been made in vehicle maintenance.  Road construction, while behind, is under budget with better than expected standards. Problems remain, however, due mostly to OHV's preeminent concern over maintaining cotton revenues, which provide most of its operating costs. On-farm research has not improved; agricultural extension, incompetent and unsupervised, has had little impact; the credit system is available almost solely to cotton producers; and agricultural technology (except for cotton production and some attempts to introduce a new maize variety) has stagnated, as have functional literacy efforts - the latter crucial to the OHV group lending approach.  Also, the GOM continues to view Bancoumana rice irrigation as part of the project, although A.I.D. deleted this component in 7/83. As a Phase II cannot yet be recommended, extension to 6/86 is suggested.  OHV still needs improved planning, training, and personnel management systems and changes in organizational structure; most importantly, OHV needs willingness to focus on whole-farm systems, not just cotton.","Work order no. 16","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-0000-I-00-3081-00","","1/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Integrated rural development|Crop production|Institution building|Government departments|Beneficiary interviews","Mali","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDBAX163.pdf","8,330 KB","003002 - Ronco Consulting Corp.","","008575 - USAID.

"Presents final Mission report (10/79-9/84) on a project to institutionalize a planning and analysis capability within the Botswana Ministry of Agriculture's (MOA) Division of Planning and Statistics (DPS). Despite its successes, the project did not achieve its institution building objective.  On the one hand, the project trained 29 Batswana in agricultural economics and rural development (against a target of 16-20) and thereby almost completely localized the DPS.  On the other hand, the level of training was considerably lower than expected (six students obtained diplomas, six completed Masters' degrees, and 17 studied for the Bachelor's).  In addition, most of the trainees who returned to the DPS failed to receive proper on-the-job training due to a lack of overlap between some U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) advisors and the returnees.  As a result of these problems, the DPS remains without a sufficient number of Batswana trained to carry on rural development research, planning, implementation, and evaluation at the level provided by their expatriate advisors.  Finally, although USDA staff improved DPS performance in a number of areas, they failed to conduct a sector analysis acceptable to the MOA or to develop policy or a discussion of basic issues as part of preparation for a 1982-87 National Development Plan. Several lessons were learned.  (1) A more realistic appraisal at the outset that only a few DPS staff could directly be trained to the Master's level could have led to a more thorough evaluation of the credentials needed for sustained analytical work within the DPS after the departure of the advisors.  (2) The project would have benefited from more focused on the job training with longer overlapping advisory periods and from a longer training program focusing on a training a selected number of Ph.D.'s.  (4) Advisors, especially the Chief of Party, should have laid greater emphasis on conducting analytical work and policy formulation in order to develop trainees' skills in these areas.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","4/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Institution building|Indigenization|Government departments|Agricultural planning|Statistical analysis|Management development|Participants|Personnel development|Limited data","Botswana","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDBAW922.pdf","243 KB","008516 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to help the Government of Djibouti (GRD) develop the institutional capacity to conduct research and to develop and implement projects in energy conservation.  Midterm evaluation covers the period through 12/84 and is based on interviews with personnel from VITA, the Institute Superieur d'Etudes et de Recherche Scientifique (ISERST), GRD, other-donor and indigenous groups, and trade and local industry. The project has been successful in a number of areas, in particular in having helped lay the foundation for a program of energy conservation and increased energy efficiency worth millions of dollars in foreign exchange over the next decade. The contractor and VITA have met or surpassed their responsibilities despite contradictions in the project paper and differing perceptions of the project from the English and French points of view.  The project has also:  helped develop ISERST to the point that it is recognized as the leading Djiboutian organization for energy research and conservation; attracted the interest of donors, GRD officials, and private sector individuals in the provision and conservation of energy; and cast light on energy provision, end-use models, and the interventions suggested in the project's national energy evaluation and special consultations.  The contribution of the expert in energy auditing has been notably helpful.  The project has educated the counterpart chief of party and the ISERST director in the importance of energy conservation, but there remains much to be done to raise the level of awareness in concerned ministries. However, the project has suffered from a lack of coherent A.I.D. management and from contradictory signals from design papers regarding project objectives.  Excessive insistence on the construction and completion of an ISERST building limited the contractor's other activities, and the inappropriateness of activities to develop prototype renewable energy technologies became apparent after the project started (these activities were phased out in a later amendment); nevertheless, the contractor put several windmill pumps into operation, initiated collaboration with two local agencies to maintain the water supply, and developed an extensive energy data bank. A change in project direction is recommended.  Some activity in renewable energy should be continued, but the project should highlight energy conservation and education, practical demonstration, conservation techniques, and training.  The contractor must be freed from a preoccupation with construction at ISERST and the project be extended by one year, as activities in many areas are behind schedule (funds remain to finance a continuation of the project as well as additional activities).","","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-1406-I-00-2174-01","","1/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Energy conservation|Renewable energy resources|Energy research|Beneficiary interviews","Djibouti","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDBAW773.pdf","1,395 KB","003445 - Meta Systems Inc.","","008536 - USAID.

"Evaluates project component to increase the use of IUD's in Bangladesh by reimbursing clients for reasonable transportation costs and/or exceptional method-related services.  External evaluation covers the period 10/83-9/84 and is based on site visits and a sampling (probability proportionate to size) of 3,000 IUD acceptors. The study estimated the total number of IUD's inserted during the evaluation period at 312,245.  The IUD insertion figure given in the Management Information Systems (MIS) monthly report for the same period was 14.3% higher at 356,920.  The percentage of IUD acceptors who received a follow-up visit was estimated at 78.1; the percentage who had an IUD reinserted at 2.2; and the percentage who received reimbursement of transportation costs at 75.5.  The probability of continuation of IUD use was found to be 84.3% at the end of 3 months, 78.3% at the end of 6 months, and 65.9% at the end of 12 months.

"Evaluates the lending activities of the Latin American Agribusiness Development Corporation de Centroamerica (LAAD-CA), which lends to nontraditional products' processors and exporters. Final report covers 1976-84 and is based on an in-depth financial analysis and interviews with LAAD-CA staff, sub-borrowers (SB's), financiers, and government officials. LAAD-CA is an effective lender with an excellent reputation, and its loans have created considerable benefits in employment, exchange earnings, and small producer purchases.  LAAD-CA's ability to identify and approve loans for competent businesses is outstanding, as shown by the success of its SB's (11 of 13 SB's sampled are profitable) and dearth of foreclosures.  Despite its small staff (4 professionals and 1 secretary), LAAD-CA's loan approval, monitoring, collection, and rescheduling procedures are effective.  Sixty-two percent of loans were used for expansion or new businesses and 38 percent were used for working capital. The market for LAAD-CA dollar loans, which finance high-risk agribusinesses throughout a high-risk region at market or near-market interest rates, is affected by political and economic stability, availability of credit from commercial and other banks, incentives that attract export industries, local entreprenuerial talent, and companies' need for foreign exchange. A 2-year projection of these factors indicates that market prospects for Costa Rica and El Salvador are excellent, Guatemala average, Honduras very limited, and Panama very poor.  LAAD-CA could distribute $16 million in new funds over a 3-year period. Despite its impressive performance, problems such as a gradual decline in portfolio yield and the 25% cofinancing requirement on A.I.D. loans could threaten LAAD-CA's long-term stability.  It is recommended that ROCAP provide LAAD-CA with an additional loan at concessional rates, with no cofinancing requirement.  LAAD-CA should:  continue to balance the risks in its portfolio; market loans to medium-sized firms that need export marketing assistance; work with a commercial or foreign bank in each country to cofinance nontraditional product exporters; prepare its investment analyses more conservatively; maintain a full set of loan documents at its Guatemala City headquarters; and establish a strict cost monitoring program.","Work order no. 16","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","OTR-0000-I-00-3506-00","","11/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Development organizations|Financial institutions|Loans|Agribusiness|Commercial credit|Nontraditional exports|Financial management|Beneficiary interviews","Central America|Costa Rica|El Salvador|Guatemala|Honduras|Nicaragua|Panama","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAS545.pdf","3,695 KB","000302 - Booz, Allen and Hamilton, Inc.","","002290 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to improve the management of India's cooperative oilseed processing sector.  External evaluation covers the period through 9/85 and is based on site visits and interviews. The development potential of the project concept is enormous. The project has been able to stabilize oil prices and pass on a greater share of consumer rupee to oilseed growers and has the opportunity to capture a 10% share of the domestic vegetable oil market.  Success can be attributed to factors including:  (1) a sound strategy of vertical integration from oilseed production to final product sales; (2) the effective management and technical resources of the Oilseeds-Vegetable Oil Wing of the National Dairy Development Board; (3) creditable TA from CLUSA; and (4) a carefully selected, properly trained, and committed staff for cooperative formation and extension.  As a result, farmer confidence in the project is high, to the point of prompting expansion of production area and processing capacity. Procurement has progressed steadily and is expected to lead processing capacity until 1990.  Existing processing plants are being upgraded and expanded and new facilities constructed; utilization should be at least 80% in the long term and near 100% in the short term, except in drought areas.  Also, quality storage facilities are being built at remote village sites to minimize postharvest losses.  Efforts to produce quality oils and employ innovative packaging and marketing techniques should yield high results given the relatively poor local standards. The project also has the potential to develop groundnut and soy meal products. Although good progress has been made in seed production, problems with seed quality and quantity and the availability of farm implements continue to constrain agricultural production.  The project has also suffered from counterproductive policies at state (i.e., limiting oilseed procurement to member farmers) and national (oil pricing and import policy are the project's most significant vulnerability) levels. Project self-sufficiency can be achieved by the end of 1989 if the P.L. 480 Title II vegetable oil commitment is increased to 267,573 MT. Project expansion to include larger production areas in participating states, the formation of a cooperative federation in a new state, and provision of additional processing capacity is strategically sound; an additional 27,677 MT of oil would be required.","Work order no. 4","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-0000-I-4088-00","","10/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural cooperatives|Vegetable oils|Oil crops|Food processing|Beneficiary interviews","India","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAS542.pdf","1,501 KB","000356 - Checchi and Co.

"Evaluates first year of multidonor cereals market restructuring project in Mali.  Mid-term Mission evaluation covers the period 6/84-2/85 and is based on field visits, interviews, and document review. The project has provided 10,000 MT of rice to the Government of Mali (GRM) for sale by the official marketing agency, OPAM.  In return, the GRM has moved toward cereals market liberalization, although it has not satisfied all the objectives established for year one.  Targets for coarse grain marketing liberalization and cereal import liberalization were met.  Due to the dismal 1984 crop year, there was little or no progress with regard to increased private cereal marketing, but the GRM's Office du Niger (ON) has implemented measures which will lead to market reform programs. Regarding production incentives, the GRM agreed to donors' demands that it increase producer prices; the increase (first-year costs were covered by project donors), meant that, on average, prices covered production costs for coarse grains.  The GRM did not agree to increase official consumer prices in 1984 - a position donors reluctantly accepted - but it has recently taken a key step in this direction by ending the freeze on civil servants' salaries. Progress has also been made in improving non-price producer incentives (e.g., through irrigation rehabilitation, establishing village associations, consolidating and reducing rice holdings, and reducing both ON operating costs and ""super"" subsidies on rice for ON employees).  Also, to reduce costs in the official marketing system, OPAM has implemented transport costs and staff reductions, cracked down on fraud, restructured debt, and completed a study for organizational reform.  Some progress has been made with regard to price data collection and production statistics. In conclusion, the project has invested much of its credibility in realizing a breakthrough in paddy marketing liberalization in the upcoming year, particularly by showing its willingness to cover immediate GRM deficits.  The GRM, despite the progress noted above, has yet to declare its liberalization plans and/or schedule.  It is recommended that the project deliver 5,000 MT of rice in FY85. Reserving the remaining 10,000-MT project allocation for FY86 should maintain maximum project leverage in policy dialogue.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","2/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Rice|Food for Peace Title II|Policy reform|Policy dialogue|Agricultural product marketing|Retail prices|Crop prices|Cereals|Limited data plus","Mali","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDBAX533.pdf","1,216 KB","008575 - USAID.

"Evaluates Combating Childhood Communicable Diseases (CCCD) project in Swaziland to expand and upgrade immunization, oral rehydration therapy (ORT), and malaria services.  Evaluation covers the period 6/84-6/85; methodology is not stated. Many aspects of Swaziland's health care delivery system and CCCD implementation are quite effective.  The ORT campaign, managed chiefly by the Mass Media for Health Practices Project, has been the most successful CCCD activity, and has included formative research, extensive health education activities, and training of over 400 rural clinic and traditional health personnel and promoters in ORT.  The malaria control program is impressive relative to other African nations, but a major epidemic in 1984, possibly the aftermath of extensive flooding, has left incidence of the disease high, and the influx of refugees from Mozambique threatens importation of additional malaria, much of it drug resistant.  A CCCD study has confirmed the presence of chloroquine resistance in Plasmodium falciparum.  The Expanded Program of Immunization has many strengths, but lacked a coordinator from 5/84-5/85 and requires improvements, especially in training of clinic staff and provision of vehicles for supervisors. The Health Information System in Swaziland appears adequate, with overall reporting efficiency at about 80%; the lack of accurate denominators is a concern, since there is no clear idea of health facility catchment area population, but a national census in 1986 will be helpful.  CCCD-related activities are well managed by the Ministry of Health; clinics are adequately staffed and basic drugs and supplies generally available.  However, neither the amount of TA nor of administrative oversight and support provided by A.I.D. has been sufficient.  USAID/S does not have enough personnel to provide the support required, and funds programmed for an administrative assistant were not used for that purpose. Coordination with other CCCD donors (e.g., UNICEF, WHO) has been adequate, but coordination with other AID-supported projects has been somewhat lacking. While levels of implementation and disbursements have been slow to date, now that some of the start-up problems have been overcome these should accelerate to a normal rate.","Evaluation period: Jun 1984-Jun 1985","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Disease prevention and control|Child health care|Immunizations|Malaria|Health care administration|Health research|Communicable diseases|Oral rehydration therapy|Limited data","Swaziland","","","008609 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to increase income-generation opportunities and community services for women in El Castano County, El Salvador. Final external evaluation covers the period 8/79-2/85 and is based on document review and interviews with project personnel and beneficiaries. The project, despite vicissitudes, has contributed to the development of women and of the community at large.  If a food processing center, currently under construction, becomes economically viable, it will have led to income gains as well. Implementation occurred in two distinct phases.  During 1979-81, several activities were undertaken.  A horticultural co-op was established and extensive training was provided to members (60% of whom were women) and their families, including both general education (cooperative crop production, nutrition, child rearing, human development, literacy, and farm practices) and technical training (food processing, accounting, management, and marketing).  Water and electricity subprojects helped to improve community health and the overall standard of living.  Female farmers came to have greater confidence in themselves and show more motivation in their work.  During this period there was widescale community participation - some 19,000 person-days of support were provided by community members to the project. In March 1982, the project was amended to target men as well as women (emphasis remained on women, however) and to focus on two activities - cooperative formation and the establishment of a pilot food processing center.  This change had the effect of reducing, at least temporarily, the number of beneficiaries. Training became more sophisticated and directly related to business and co-op management functions.  Co-op membership decreased markedly due to the elimination of some project activities (e.g., collective agricultural production) and to a long delay in approving the loan for the processing plant construction.  The decrease in co-op membership, however, could reverse if the processing venture becomes an economic success. Lessons learned for similar projects in El Salvador are to:  (1) strike a balance between components benefiting the community at large and those oriented toward commercialization; (2) take time in the design stage to develop understanding of the community, and thereafter, to fully discuss changes in a project with communities and with counterpart organizations; (3) provide sufficient professional expertise (local and external) and financial resources; and (4) avoid rural community development projects with multiple objectives and those dependent on large and ongoing financial inputs. Recommendations for completing the construction of the production center are given.","Attached to PD-AAS-567","Special Evaluation","Documents","519-0168-O-00-5370-00","","8/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Horticulture|Food processing facilities|Women in development|Agricultural cooperatives|Community development|Rural development|Beneficiary interviews","El Salvador","","","001050 - Institute for Foreign Policy Analysis, Inc.","","008540 - USAID.

"Evaluates community-based integrated rural development project in the municipalities of El Sauce and Concepcion de Oriente in El Salvador. Final external evaluation covers the period 9/79-12/84 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with Save the Children Federation (SCF) personnel and community leaders. The project has been successful in meeting the basic needs of both the target population and large numbers of indirect beneficiaries, especially given the unfavorable political, economic, and environmental conditions prevailing in the region. The formation of grupos solidarios has been a key factor in increasing the availability of agricultural credit and inputs which has led to a 100% increase in crop yields and a 20% increase in acreage planted; farmers' net adjusted income has approximately doubled since 1982.  Family health and nutrition (especially of children) have improved significantly due to the increased availability of grain and to project activities such as health and nutrition education, family gardens, vaccination, and deparasitization; child mortality in Concepcion de Oriente decreased from 18 in 1980 to 0 in 1984.  Educational activities (e.g., classroom construction, promotion of school clubs) have led to increases in school enrollment and student promotions and a marked decrease in the dropout rate; in addition, 113 adults have been taught by volunteers to read and write.  Cottage industry development was the only unsuccessful project component. The project has had one major shortcoming.  Although SCF has trained competent community leaders, mobilized volunteers (their turnover is high, however, due to lack of incentives), and formed various ad hoc community committees, it has failed to create self-sustaining community-level institutions which can carry on project functions.  It appears that four municipal committees formed by SCF have been strengthened at the expense of - or in lieu of - strong and permanent community-level organizations. SCF's project management, in general quite effective, was deficient in the areas of reporting and program evaluation. Several recommendations for a follow-on project are made.","Attached to PD-AAS-568","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","2/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Community development|Integrated rural development|Community self help|Community participation|Beneficiary count|Beneficiary interviews","El Salvador","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAS568A.pdf","1,560 KB","001046 - Rural Development Services","","008540 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to expand and improve rural primary education in El Salvador, particularly in the poorest regions.  Special evaluation covers the period 7/79-11/84 and is based on document review, interviews with Ministry of Education (MOE) and A.I.D. officials and teachers, and site visits. It is estimated that 26,500 children are benefiting from expanded services resulting from the project.  Increased violence in the northeast, changes in Government of El Salvador (GOES) policies and priorities, and loss of MOE personnel resulted in suspension of activities from 8/80 to 3/82 and a shift in focus to relatively peaceful areas; still, access to primary education objectives have been met with the construction of 395 rural classrooms at 147 sites, external works (sanitary services, water systems, drains, protection walls) in 18 schools, and 76 additional sanitary services built with counterpart funds. Classrooms have been heavily used, generally serving grades 1-6 as intended; parents, teachers, and directors have been satisfied, while noting that protection fences, water systems, lights, and additional classrooms and desks are still needed. The project sponsored training in educational planning and administration for 131 technicians and administrators and data processing and programming for 100 technicians (although the computerized management system is not in place), and these courses reached an additional 4,000 school personnel through television seminars.  However, no special training was provided to teachers assigned to project classrooms. The fixed amount reimbursement method proved effective, once a loan working-capital fund for the GOES was included, as did GOES direct contracting.  MOE and community participation in transporting furniture and constructing exterior works was sporadic, and while some 750 unskilled community members country-wide were employed in construction, overall, community involvement was minimal. Some lack of communication occurred among the many entities involved in the project, and time pressure, severe understaffing within the GOES implementing entity, and the relative inexperience of supervisory firms led to some design and construction flaws.  For recommendations on correcting organizational and design problems, see action decisions in abstract for PD-AAD-569.","Attached to PD-AAS-569","Special Evaluation","Documents","519-0168-O-00-5473-00","","9/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Educational development|Primary education|Building construction|Primary schools|Rural areas|Beneficiary count","El Salvador","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAS569A.pdf","628 KB","000709 - Juarez and Associates, Inc.","","008540 - USAID.

"Evaluates project component to provide data collection and computer analysis for disaster surveillance in Bolivia.  External evaluation covers the period 3/84-1/85 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with staff and technical personnel. The project is slightly (8-10%) behind schedule in data output due to logistic and staffing problems which resulted from Bolivia's continuing economic crisis and were not within the control of project staff.  The first data available for analysis (in 1/85) represented 10 communities in 5 departments.  Errors in original questionnaire design have been corrected and corresponding adjustments made in field operations. The IBM-XT microcomputer has proven generally adequate; in fact, Mission staff found the computer so useful that it has remained in the A.I.D. central offices and did not move with the project to the new project office, resulting in marked reduction of staff training and practice time.  More microcomputers are on order. Suggestions for improving overall management of the data collection/analysis systems include improved documentation of requests, orders, and performance, and clearer assignment of authority and lines of responsibility.  Suggestions concerning computer equipment and methodological issues are to:  (1) place the project computer in the project office immediately; (2) provide additional staff to improve computer utility; (3) add computer printers, plotter, and a back-up IBM-PC to assure low-cost security for the project; (4) reduce the survey sample size to accommodate prevailing field conditions and field team capacity; (5) demonstrate some project benefit for participant villages; (6) eliminate the requirement to calculate the ""hydrostatic quotient,"" an apparently ambiguous term; (7) investigate and experiment with remote sensing, probably the most cost-effective method of disaster surveillance; and (8) collect more basic cost information on agricultural products for use by more complex statistical processing now underway at Tulane University. An alternative surveillance system utilizing key village informants is also suggested in view of the high costs of maintaining vehicles and field teams in a failing economy.","Attached to PD-AAS-571|Evaluation period: 21 Jan-25 Feb 1985","Special Evaluation","Documents","511-0581-S-00-5066-00","","2/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Disaster recovery|Disaster management|Surveys|Data collection|Data processing|Computer technology|Limited data plus","Bolivia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAS571A.pdf","3,156 KB","008515 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to encourage commercial banks in Peru to provide medium-term agricultural credit.  External evaluation covers the period 3/83-3/85 and is based on site visits, document review, and interviews with Development Finance Corporation (COFIDE) and bank personnel and with beneficiaries. The project has successfully bypassed traditional impediments to medium-term lending by commercial banks in Peru.  Eleven commercial banks have made a total of 92 medium-term agricultural loans, and in all, 22 banks signed lending agreements with COFIDE. The loans were made to good, well-planned operations, many of them to entrepreneurs who have the initiative to develop profitable farming operations, but who could not have launched their farms without a medium-term credit program such as this. Nearly $5 million has been disbursed, far above projections. However, the average loan size ($54,907) is also larger than expected, and it likely that only 300-600 loans, rather than the targeted 1,000, will be made over the life of the project.  Also, although initially interest was not being charged at or near market rates, this problem has been resolved. The project has fallen short in training, promotion, and TA.  A credit manual prepared by COFIDE for intermediate credit institutions (ICI's) is more promotional than instructional, no TA program has been established for farm operators, and the seminars and conferences held for ICI personnel were insufficient to create the required understanding of medium- and long-term credit analysis and of project procedures.  Two COFIDE personnel were trained in-house, and more in-house training is expected. Most importantly, the Government of Peru (GOP) has not met its commitment to provide counterpart funds to maintain the dollar value of the project loan fund (the project was temporarily suspended in 12/84 for this reason); with elections in progress, this issue cannot be resolved until early in FY86.  Nor is it likely the GOP will be able to meet a separate co-financing requirement.  Thus, USAID/P must decide whether to continue or terminate project. A major recommendation is to continue the project at a reduced level, eliminating the co-financing requirement and postponing the counterpart funds requirement.  It is further recommended that the project target the nontraditional export subsector.","Attached to PD-AAS-573|Spanish ed.: PD-AAV-745","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-1406-I-00-4088-00","","5/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural credit|Commercial banks|Beneficiary interviews","Peru","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAS573A.pdf","6,213 KB","000356 - Checchi and Co.

"Evaluates subproject to construct or rehabilitate and expand potable water/irrigation systems in drought areas of Bolivia. Mid-term AID/CARE evaluation covers 10/83-1/85 and is based mostly on a survey of 17 communities. Project purposes are being achieved.  The first year goal of 55 water systems has been met; average construction time has been 3 months.  In 9 communities, water is available year round; some rationing is required in the others.  The water is used for drinking, cooking, washing, and bathing; in some communities it is also used for animals, for small gardens, and/or brickmaking. The water projects have answered a strongly felt need; in each case, the community initiated the project and contributed either labor alone, labor and materials, or labor, materials, and some money; women have played an instrumental part in all project phases.  A maintenance system has been established in each community, and in most, 1 or 2 community members have received short maintenance training courses.  Generally, user fees are collected for basic maintenance; in some communities, the fees will also be used for expanding systems. A more detailed evaluation is recommended to ascertain:  (1) the long-term effectiveness of the maintenance systems and of the water committees that have been formed in some communities; (2) water availability per person and the reason for water shortages; (3) water usage and positive and negative health effects; (4) use of residual water; (5) understanding of the relation of potable water to sanitary feces disposal and the need for patio to kitchen sanitation; (6) impact on diarrheal disease; (7) the impact of the maintenance training courses; and (8) the importance of including women as water committee members and their role in related health education activities. Follow-on community projects (e.g., crop diversification, livestock) are also recommended. CARE's accounting and reporting have greatly improved following an 11/84 review, but inventory control and costing remain weak. USAID/B never provided CARE with information detailing financial procedures, and made no engineering visits to project sites and only 2 site visits in all; USAID/B project manager responsibility was transferred 4 times during the project's first 16 months.","Attached to PD-AAS-580","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Disaster recovery|Potable water|Water sanitation|Water supply|Private voluntary organizations|Community participation|Community self help|Beneficiary interviews|Sampling method|Limited data plus","Bolivia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAS580A.pdf","1,903 KB","008515 - USAID.

"Evaluates subproject to collect disaster surveillance data in Bolivia.  Special evaluation covers the period 3/84-1/85 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with Government of Bolivia (GOB) technical personnel. The project, initially delayed by staffing, procurement, and vehicular problems, is underway, but not at the level envisioned, or needed.  By 2/85 initial data acquisition was completed in some 10 (vs. 30 planned) communities in each of 6 targeted Departments, and censuses had been performed in at least one community per Department, with more planned. Full implementation has been hampered by a number of factors.  A severe deterioration of the Bolivian economy led to a precipitous decline in the value of the peso, followed by social and political disruption, including the collapse of many GOB data collection systems on which the project was designed to draw - most notably, marketplace surveys conducted by the Ministry of Agriculture and Campesino Affairs (MACA) have ceased altogether. As a result, the project has not been able to obtain data on the availability of basic foodstuffs and other agricultural commodities; nor data pertaining to migration, daily wages, cash employment, livestock sales, agricultural loans, crop and animal health, or land prices; nor historical epidemiological and meteorological data (hindering interpretation of current data). In addition, no follow-up ""community characteristics"" data have been collected, preventing the monitoring of trends in population, water supplies, transportation resources, etc. Though many of these deficiencies are attributable to collapses within the GOB infrastructure, or to early logistical problems, the project has not been sufficiently aggressive in devising alternative sources of information.  However, good initiative is evident in a plan to suspend normal activities for several weeks in early 1985 to assist MACA in a much-needed agricultural survey. In addition to the above deficiencies, the project's failure to produce usable reports on the data it has collected is a serious drawback in demonstrating to GOB officials the possibility of efficiently collecting a wide range of vital information; the hoped-for future integration of the project into GOB structures may be affected. Thirteen recommendations address these problems.","Attached to PD-AAS-581","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","2/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Disaster recovery|Data collection","Bolivia","","","","","008515 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to strengthen agricultural co-ops in Equatorial Guinea.  Mid-term evaluation covers the period 8/83-11/85 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with Government of Equatorial Guinea (GREG) officials and co-op leaders. The impact of the project's transport component has exceeded expectations.  Of 23 vehicles which had been been misused under project 6530001, 22 have been retrieved and 12 (vs. 5 targeted) made operational.  Since 2/85 the vehicles have been used as the basis of a transport system on Bioko, in which 15 cooperatives of women producers participate, delivering over 12 MT of previously unmarketable food each week to Malabo.  Further, as this transport system has more than doubled the supply of produce in Malabo, the project has initiated a program to restore a second market there.  Since late 1985 a similar transport system has been operating in Rio Muni, delivering coffee and food products from 3 districts to Bata.  Thus the project - along with external factors such as Equatorial Guinea's adoption of the Central African Franc and its entrance into the Union des Etats de l'Afrique Centrale - has significantly increased domestic marketing, benefiting both farmers and urban consumers. Rehabilitation of the vehicles has also enhanced CLUSA's image in the eyes of the GREG, which has developed a much more positive toward the project, and provided training and job opportunities for drivers and mechanics.  However, purchase of new vehicles might have made the transport system operational sooner, and at a lower cost:  maintenance for the next 2 years will cost $2,500-5,000 per year per vehicle, plus shop and tools costs. CLUSA has provided TA to co-op leaders and members through 2 co-op service centers (CSC's) set up in temporary quarters in Malabo and Bata (permanant CSC's are being built).  However, unless the project becomes more involved in the economic aspects of the co-ops, the TA will not be relevant or successful.  CSC's could potentially evolve into second-level cooperative businesses providing transportation and crop production/marketing services to member co-ops; studies should be conducted to assess CSC and CLUSA potentials in this regard. Lessons learned include:  (1) the project benefited by not expecting any contribution from the financially strapped GREG and by budgeting for local staff costs (with realistic salaries offered, trained local personnel have been more available than had been assumed); and (2) TA and training must accompany equipment and spare parts must be available. Detailed recommendations are provided.","Attached to PD-BBA-585","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","11/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural cooperatives|Agricultural product marketing|Coffee|Cocoa|Private voluntary organizations|Beneficiary interviews|Limited data plus","Equatorial Guinea","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDBBA585A.pdf","2,986 KB","008524 - USAID.

"Provides final report (9/82-7/85) on project to strengthen Thailand's private sector by establishing an Institute for Management Education for Thailand (IMET). The IMET has been established and is carrying out programs through four institutions:  Thai Management Association (TMA), Thammasat University, National Institute of Development Administration (NIDA), and Chulalongkorn University.  A flexible project design allowed the IMET to successfully shift its priority from business school faculty and mid-level managers to to owner-entrepreneurs of rural businesses.  The response has been striking; participant contributions of close to $1,000 per seminar have helped IMET meet the grant's matching fund requirement. The new management approaches have already had an impact at the micro-economic level - sales increases as high as 300% and inventory reductions of 35% have been verified.  The IMET has strengthened its in-house structure by reorganizing the Board of Directors, hiring a full-time manager, and developing a corporate plan. University faculty have appreciated the opportunity to adopt a new role in taking management education out to rural businessmen, and this has in turn had a positive influence on their classroom teaching. However, they were insufficiently prepared to work in a non-academic situation.  Despite the growing numbers of participant contributions, the IMET is not yet self-sustaining due to competition in securing tax-deductible corporate contributions.  All programs are suspended pending a decision on the IMET's proposal for funds from the Bureau for Private Enterprise (PRE).  Overall, the project's results, many of them unforeseen, indicate the replicability of its flexible design. The project taught:  (1) the need of quantified output targets for project evaluation; (2) the advisability of preparing a Project Implementation Letter even in small projects in order to clear up discrepancies between the Project Proposal and the Program Description and avoid delays in funding; and (3) the advisability of having the project officer reside in the A.I.D. mission rather than in Washington, D.C.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","7/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Private sector|Management education|Management training|Entrepreneurs|Rural areas|Project sustainability|Project replication|Limited data","Thailand","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAS597.pdf","988 KB","","","000165 - USAID.

"Presents final Mission report (1981-84) on an OPG to Save The Children Federation (SCF) to promote community-based integrated rural development (CBIRD) in the Gambia by upgrading the technical and management training of the Department of Community Development's (DCD) Community Development Assistants (CDA's) and by helping CDA's promote self-help development activities at the village level. In the area of training systems, the project conducted 6 workshops - 3 in CBIRD methodology for CDA's, 2 in baseline data collection, and one in child-centered strategy.  The project also hired a training coordinator, provided job training to 19 CDA's and 5 home craft assistants, and printed CDA training manuals. In the area of management systems, the project trained DCD staff, as well as a Community Development Officer (CDO) and his assistant, held two workshops for village development committees (VDC's), and helped VDC's establish community data banks and recordkeeping systems; archives now exist in 20 villages.  In the area of information management, the project collected baseline data using child-centered indicators in 6 key North Bank Division (NBD) villages and organized a trainer of trainers workshop in which Ministry personnel participated. Forty-two village-identified self-help projects, monitored by 176 CDA's, were successfully implemented in 27 NBD villages; 11 others were partially successful, while 5 were unsuccessful and 7 are being completed.  Monthly meetings of CDA's, the SCF training coordinator/project officer, and the CDO addressed problems caused by the large numbers of activities and subordinates scattered throughout a large area.  With help from an A.I.D. Matching Grant which began in 1/85, a village food production program was designed and is now operational in a new impact area. CDA's and CDO's expressed a great deal of dissatisfaction over the lack of coordination between governmental and nongovernmental agencies. This is especially true at the national level, where few efforts are being made to enact policy that would encourage agencies to coordinate. Finally, a system is needed to formally document lessons learned and to disseminate this information at the directorate level for the benefit of CDA's.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Integrated rural development|Community self help|Management training|Technical training|Workshops|Institution building|Government departments|Limited data","Gambia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDBAY217.pdf","125 KB","008545 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to provide institutional support and advanced personnel training during the formative years of the Cape Verdean Institute for Agricultural Research (ICR), thereby helping the Government of Cape Verde fulfill its commitment to long term agricultural development in the archipelago.  External evaluation covers the period 1982-7/85 and is based on document review and site visits. Two years before its scheduled 1987 termination, the project is successfully establishing a cadre of trained ICR personnel and is providing consultants to initiate preliminary ICR food crop research using the farming systems research model.  Six ICR staff members (1 less than planned) are abroad earning M.S. degrees in irrigation, engineering, field and vegetable crop agronomy, plant breeding, and other related fields; two others are scheduled to earn Ph.D.'s in soil and crop science in 1986.  The proposed ICR information and communication center is nearing completion, and 4 homes (2 more than planned) are being built for ICR staff housing.  The project is also providing ICR with laboratory equipment and vehicles and is working with the ICR to formalize agricultural research and to survey and evaluate Cape Verdean irrigation practices, pest management, farm structures, and crop varieties and pests. It is recommended that, in order to enhance its effectiveness and sustainability, the project:  (1) develop a clearer strategy based on prioritizing Cape Verde's specific agricultural research and education needs; (2) consolidate the project's fundamental and applied research components into a single unit and develop an infrastructure with close linkages among research, teaching, and extension; (4) increase adaptive and action oriented research; (5) continue to give priority to developing research capabilities through staff training; (6) develop a close counterpart relationship between U.S. and Cape Verdean technicians and scientists; (7) present research results via annual or biannual workshops and a publication; and (8) establish and promote appropriate linkages between Cape Verde and ecologically similar areas of the world.","Companion evaluation summary: PD-ABP-201","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","7/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural research|Research centers|Institution building|Personnel development|Participants|Limited data","Cape Verde","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDBAY352.pdf","355 KB","","","008525 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to strengthen the Government of Belize's capacity to build and maintain rural access roads.  Initial evaluation covers the period 9/83-8/85 and is based on site visits and interviews with GOB, USAID/B, and contractor personnel. Progress has been very good when measured against similar projects around the world.  The equipment and TA personnel arrived in a timely fashion, but the project paper schedule was unrealistically optimistic and the project is about 6 months behind schedule.  Given the weather conditions in Belize, it is doubtful the time can be made up. Therefore, funding has been adjusted for a 6-month operating period after the existing PACD. The GOB seems not to be effectively engaged in the project except at the district maintenance center level.  While the project calls for the central engineering organization to take an active role in road design and in evaluation, little evidence was observed that they expect to be collaborative or operational during the life of the project.  If a functioning organization is to be left when the project ends, the central organization must take part. Although training in maintenance and construction was to be a major thrust, the project, as staffed, can accomplish on-the-job training only. The overall austerity budgeting of the GOB can have lasting effects on the ability of the Ministry of Works to maintain its road system. USAID/B should encourage the GOB to provide enough allocation to ensure maintenance of project-rehabilitated roads. It appears that the project budget is sufficient to complete all activities.  Most funds have been placed in a contingency category to allow flexibility in funding equipment repairs, replacement parts, and other needs, as they arise.","Attached to PD-AAS-755","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","8/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Access roads|Rural areas|Road construction|Road maintenance|Host country cooperation","Belize","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAS755A.pdf","3,638 KB","008513 - USAID.

"Evaluates Commodity Import Program (CIP) aimed at promoting fertilizer use in Senegal.  External evaluation covers FY 1984 and is based on document review and interviews with private importers and officials from USAID/S, the Government of Sengal (GOS), and the Senegalese Agricultural Research Institute (ISRA). Despite factors beyond their control (e.g., high U.S. sulphur prices), importers were able to effectively import and distribute urea and sulphur.  Past financial problems for this type of program, such as considerable GOS arrears in payments to private distributors and banks, were avoided. The GOS undertook agreed upon policy changes in regard to liberalizing fertilizer marketing and pricing, providing agricultural credit, and reducing both the GOS debt to the banking sector and the deficit of the Price Equalization and Stabilization Fund (CPSP). Due to increased contacts of USAID/S personnel with GOS and private sector personnel and the collaborative effort between USAID/S and ISRA on the local currency-funded marketing studies, the program directly strengthened USAID/S's expertise and influence in the fertilizer sub-sector.  USAID/S is now the leading donor in advocating and tracking policy change in this area.  Also, the greater availability of fertilizer as a result of this program was probably a factor in maintaining, and perhaps increasing, fertilizer consumption at a time when total subsidies were being cut by more than two thirds. Lessons learned include, inter alia, that:  (1) privatization and the lifting of subsidies are best implemented gradually and need to be accompanied by dialogue and research; (2) where a climate of mistrust exists, in this case between GOS and private importers, donors must be willing to play a lead role; (3) CIP effectiveness is closely linked to the commodities involved; (4) local currency and TA activities closely related to the relevant sub-sector are generally the most effective activities; (5) in their present form, CIP's are an inefficient way of transferring balance of payments support; and (6) USAID/S has little legal ground for forcing private importers to make deposits to local currency accounts according to deposit schedules stipulated in the grant agreement.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-1096-I-02-4162-00","","7/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Commodity import programs|Fertilizer distribution|Policy reform|Public sector|Private sector|Government policy|Limited data plus","Senegal","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAS779.pdf","1,810 KB","006434 - Devres, Inc.","","008600 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to improve grain marketing conditions and policy in Burkina Faso and increase cereal production and food security in rural areas.  External mid-term evaluation is based on document review, interviews, and site visits. The project did not achieve its purposes as stated, although to a limited degree it did improve the basis for policy and management decisionmaking in food grain marketing.  The capability and operating efficiency of OFNACER, the National Cereals Office, were improved, though not to the level expected - a planning unit (albeit of limited impact) has been established and a rolling fund (smaller than planned) set up, producer prices have increased, and grain stocks are available, but no explicit information system is available and fewer warehouses than planned were built.  OFNACER is capable of handling its current work load, but due to the costliness of its commercial operations must rely on income from food aid to balance its domestic marketing losses. Installation of a contractor-designed financial accounting system - an unplanned output - was in many ways the most successful aspect of the project, and awaits only the finalization of OFNACER accounting and credit policies to be fully implemented. Project design was based implicitly on the incorrect assumption that strengthening OFNACER was equivalent to improving the overall grain marketing system, even though studies available at the time strongly suggested that OFNACER interventions could be counterproductive to the project.  Also, the AID-sponsored planning unit within OFNACER was not properly positioned to influence policymaking, and A.I.D. failed to coordinate its activities with other donors also providing advisory support, causing unnecessary friction between TA teams.  In general, A.I.D. contractors performed well under difficult circumstances. It is recommended most strongly that A.I.D. seek means other than support for OFNACER to help the Government of Burkina Faso (GBF) improve grain marketing and food security; redefine its policy and expectations regarding OFNACER; and stress, in relation to GBF plans to increase OFNACER's role and diminish that of the private sector, the negative effects of GBF domination of the grain market.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-1406-I-01-4092-00","","3/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural product marketing|Cereal crops","Burkina Faso","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAS780.pdf","3,906 KB","006434 - Devres, Inc.","","008520 - USAID.

"Evaluates Phase I project to support a long-term integrated rural development effort in Nepal's Rapti zone.  Final A.I.D./Nepali evaluation covers the period 10/80-9/85 and is based on document review, project observation, and interviews with project personnel, beneficiaries, and others. The project as designed was overly complex and disparate, its components separated rather than strongly linked and focused on project purposes; as a result, management was fragmented.  The project has not been able to meet its - often unrealistic - targets in any critical area; nonetheless, it has contributed substantially (especially during 1984-85) to strengthening district and village capacity to plan and manage development resources and resulted in increased availability and use of national delivery services.  Also, although inputs (54% of planned levels were reached) were used disproportionately for building construction and to support host government operations and were not focused on key production sectors, specific project achievements have included:  increased numbers of agricultural extension, technical, and forestry staff; road upgrading; strengthening of cropping systems research; and provision of agricultural credit, appropriate technology, village adult education, and production credit for rural women.  A strong foundation has been laid for future improvements in agricultural production and natural resource conservation.  Moreover, private, local-level resources have been mobilized and combined with new technologies to boost (in many instances) productivity, income, and quality of life. Recommendations are to close out the project and initiate Phase II with sharper focus on (1) continued support for increasing district- and village-level development management capabilities, (2) expanding and strengthening natural resource management programs, and (3) concentrating resources efficiently and effectively on agricultural production in valley and hill areas. USAID/N should try to supplement and reinforce project resources through linkages with other donor projects in the zone.  Specific recommendations are also provided.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","10/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Integrated regional development|Integrated rural development|Decentralization|Institution building|Beneficiary interviews","Nepal","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAS781.pdf","7,798 KB","006434 - Devres, Inc.","","008583 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to increase employment and earning power of the pueblo joven (slum) dwellers through the Fe y Alegria (FYA) schools in Peru.  Final external evaluation covers 1978-84 and is based on visits to 20 schools and workshops, surveys of students and teachers, and review of teaching materials. Overall, the project was successful in reaching its goals for number of students and teachers trained, and workshops built and basically equipped; over 12,000 youths graduated from the FYA program with marketable skills (in, e.g., carpentry, construction, electrical and mechanical work, ceramics, sewing, baking), and 35% are now employed. General findings are that: (1) the FYA schools and workshops successfully united the community, the government, and the private sector during the process of turning traditional schools into vocational schools; (2) the project taught students from slum areas skills by which they can support their families and change their subsistent conditions; (3) adult participation was reliable, especially that of the Mothers' Clubs in sewing workshops; (4) the FYA dropout rate was extremely low (under 15%); (5) the Job Opportunity Office registered 2,500 FYA alumni and is now producing a report on workshop coordination; (6) the workshop program provided hope and a training/employment infrastructure to the slum-dwellers; and (7) key achievements of the FYA program include its community involvement and its leadership in solving educational problems. However, the project was not without problems.  Nearly 70% of FYA teachers do not have adequate teacher training, and an insufficient number of teachers has resulted in a poor teacher-to-student ratio, especially in Lima and in the carpentry workshops. Other problems are that:  the workshops themselves are inadequately equipped; instructional materials are not standardized; instructional time is limited; students are required to provide their own materials; and FYA schools lack coordination. Recommendations to address these issues are presented here and in the attached PES (PD-AAS-800).","Attached to PD-AAS-800","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Vocational training|Slum areas|Youth|Employment|Educational innovations|Teacher training|Educational facilities|Occupational opportunities|Beneficiary count|Beneficiary interviews","Peru","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAS800A.pdf","2,347 KB","004638 - Study Group for Development","","008591 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to provide potable water, latrines, and health education to 660 communities in Peru's rural sierra and high jungle regions.  Evaluation covers the period 9/80-9/84 and summarizes an attached mid-term evaluation (PD-AAQ-689) based on document review, interviews, and site visits. Great efforts by USAID/P and Peru's Directorate of Rural Sanitation (DISAR) and Ministry of Health (MOH) have brought about major changes since a highly critical 1983 U.S. Government Accounting Office audit. In late 1983, significant progress in constructing rural water systems began to be made, despite the many problems posed by the very serious economic situation in Peru.  This was mainly due to the successful decentralization of DISAR offices; 13 offices with technical personnel have been established in 10 regions (7 offices are implementing construction), and the regional DISAR offices have been significantly strengthened. The target of 660 systems constructed by 1987 will be reached if current momentum is maintained.  Per capita construction costs are about $30, below target.  Community participation in construction has been good, participation in ongoing operation and maintenance less so, due to a lack of well-planned educational programs and to DISAR's failure to provide formal training to juntas administradoras (communally elected water committees).  DISAR, primarily an engineering and construction agency, lacks interest in maintenance.  Also, user fees are not being collected in any of the communities. The latrine program is not progressing well; about 80% of latrines delivered to the communities are either not installed or not used. Rarely were communities given any say regarding choice of excreta disposal systems and no well-defined health education program has accompanied latrine delivery; nor has any sociocultural research on the resistance to the latrines that exists in most project communities been conducted.  Schools have not been provided with latrines as planned. The health education component has not yet begun; support in this area from A.I.D. primary health care projects has not materialized. DISAR staff have received some technical training; in one region, courses on community relations have been given as well.  There has also been limited training of health personnel in water supply and sanitation issues.","Attached to PD-AAS-892|Order of technical direction no. 190|Missing pages are blank - no text is omitted","Special Evaluation","Documents","DPE-5942-C-00-4085-00","","3/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Water supply structures|Water supply structure maintenance|Water sanitation|Health education|Rural populations|Decentralization|Limited data","Peru","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAS892A.pdf","3,551 KB","000333 - Camp Dresser and McKee, Inc.

"Evaluates project to develop Producer Marketing Organizations (PMO's) for farmers in two areas of Jamaica.  Special evaluation covers the period 6/83-4/85 and is based on site visits and interviews with Ministry of Agriculture staff, PMO board members, and beneficiaries. One PMO, in Bushy Park, is operational and has recruited more than 150 members of whom 75 regularly market their produce through the PMO. Sales have improved rapidly, with a steady increase in the variety of items sold; the sales target needed to cover costs at the present level of operations could be achieved within a year.  The PMO's returns to farmers are consistently higher than the prices paid by higglers, while retail prices substantially lower than those in public markets indicate potential benefits to consumers.  The project has protected its farmers from ruinous competition caused by uncoordinated planting of crops; crop and variety trials have also been conducted, and an effective produce distribution system has been developed. Still, the PMO has not yet significantly affected the total volume and overall quality of fruit and vegetables grown and no major penetration of the U.S. market is likely in the next few years. The PMO board is functioning well and staff are being trained in procurement, accounting, and distribution; their performance is steadily improving.  Relations between the PMO and its farmer members are quite good. The project was overdesigned and underfunded.  Its achievements have been limited by such factors as lack of explicit funding for research, the original PMO board's inclination to restrict membership to itself (7 persons), and various production constraints (e.g., siltation of irrigation canals and farmers' unwillingness to coordinate their water use to increase availability to all, and a shortage of capital for pesticides and fertilizers).  Formation of a second PMO has not materialized, as for logistical and other reasons, the project has focused its resources on the Bushy Park area. The project should be continued, especially the TA component. The imminent addition of an assembly-grading station will pose major managerial and economic challenges to the PMO and, given the decline in Jamaica's traditional exports, a major breakthrough in nontraditional exports is also urgently needed. Prospects are positive; project extension for 3 years is recommended.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","4/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural production|Small farms|Food marketing|Agricultural cooperatives|Agricultural product marketing|Beneficiary count|Beneficiary interviews","Jamaica","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAS879.pdf","1,476 KB","","","008563 - USAID.

"Evaluates OPG to the National Christian Council of Kenya (NCCK) to provide credit and TA to entrepreneurs, mainly in 5 secondary cities: Mombasa, Nakuru, Eldoret, Kakamega, and Kisumu. External final evaluation covers the period 1980-6/84 and is based on site visits, document review, and interviews with A.I.D., NCCK, TA, and other knowledgeable personnel and with beneficiaries. NCCK has developed an impressive capability for providing TA and credit, despite a climate of economic distress and refugee pressure in Kenya.  Loans have been provided to 315 individual firms (most are fruit and vegetable vendors, traders in charcoal or clothing, or tailors), but to only 15 groups; the former figure is far over target, the latter far beneath.  TA (mainly in credit, procurement, stock control, and bookkeeping) has been provided to some 6,000 individuals.  Most of this assistance has gone as planned to the very poor.  There is, however, doubt as to whether beneficiary gains - in income, quality of life, and skills - are being sustained. Based on the experience it has gained, NCCK should be able to expand its activities in the future while lowering costs and better assuring that the assistance has the desired social impact.  However, NCCK will have to increase stability among top level project management, lack of which in the past has threatened to undermine project coherence and direction.  Other areas in which NCCK is weak include client selection and follow-up/loan repayment activities. The project teaches many lessons, among them: (1) teams of social workers and business promoters, despite their differences in training and background, can effectively deliver TA and credit to microentrepreneurs; (2) new skills tend to be used less with passage of time, and family and business income to decline; (3) securing regular repayment from informal sector entrepreneurs poses difficult problems; (4) very poor clients need buffers against short-term emergencies that could undermine their businesses; (5) while decentralization of responsibility to social worker/promoter teams seems to produce initiative and commitment, central administration support and adequate information on program goals are still needed; (6) both regional and national staff require regular training on the development significance of what they are doing; (7) institution building at NCCK was facilitated by top-level commitment and by valuable TA from Development-GAP (a PVO); and (8) group formation and development are more complex and costly than expected. Several recommendations are made.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","DAN-1096-O-00-4046-O0","","3/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Business support services|Small scale enterprises|Credit|Secondary cities|Private voluntary organizations|Microenterprises|Beneficiary count|Beneficiary interviews","Kenya","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAS901.pdf","2,810 KB","","","004142 - USAID.

"Provides cost data for three activities conducted by Malawi's Ministry of Health (MOH) under the Combating Childhood Communicable Diseases (CCCD) project.  Cost data for the period 7/84-3/85 were collected at sample sites. The approximate national cost of CCCD activities during the above 9-month period (which included some start-up activities) was over 5 million kwacha, or more than U.S. $3 million.  About 80% of that cost was incurred at the local level.  The expanded program on immunization (EPI) and antimalarial activities show much higher cost totals than do oral rehydration therapy (ORT) - which is consistent with Malawi's efforts to immunize a large population (in the first instance) and to reduce the high incidence of malaria (in the second instance). The country's per capita cost was substantial, but well below that of Swaziland, which was also studied.  This is probably due mainly to the difference in population size between the two countries.  Personnel costs are lower than in Swaziland and other countries, reflecting Malawi's low salary rates.  The low cost for the EPI program ($0.99 per immunization) as compared with other national averages is remarkable and warrants further study either for verification or to ascertain factors inducing such efficiency.  The total cost per immunized child is also low. Nationwide cost averages for ORT and malaria control were unavailable. Site-specific costs vary widely.  In most cases they are consistent with nationwide averages:  low administrative costs, especially in regards to personnel; and higher averages for the EPI and antimalarial programs.  EPI costs are generally lower at smaller facilities, while ORT and malaria control costs are evidently strongly influenced by volume of service. Recommendations for improving the effectiveness of further cost studies address such issues as:  (1) comparing costs of alternative technologies and alternative development strategies; (2) analyzing cost-effectiveness; (3) estimating incremental costs of services; and (4) projecting recurrent costs. Procedural recommendations include:  (1) postponing cost studies until the project has stabilized; (2) expanding the health information system; (3) tracing costs by region; and (4) considering an ongoing cost analysis system. Included are findings pertaining to vaccine wastage, transportation, and housing subsidies for personnel and suggestions for improving reporting and tabulation under the regular MOH information system.","Work order no. 10","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-1406-I-00-4063-00","","9/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Disease prevention and control|Communicable diseases|Child health care|Cost benefit analysis|Health economics","Malawi","","","","","000013 - USAID.

"Provides cost data for three activities conducted by Swaziland's Ministry of Health (MOH) under the Combating Childhood Communicable Diseases (CCCD) project.  Cost data for the period 7/84-3/85 were collected at sample sites. The approximate national cost of CCCD activities during the above 9-month period was nearly SZL 1.7 million, or just less than U.S. $950,000.  About 70% of that cost was incurred at the local level. Costs for the expanded program of immunizations (EPI) and for oral rehydration therapy (ORT) were much higher than were those for malaria control, reflecting MOH health policy goals. The country's per capita cost is well above that of Malawi, where similar CCCD activities are being implemented for a much larger population.  Wages, which are higher in Swaziland than in Malawi, account for just over one half of the total. National averages reveal a fairly high cost for EPI ($2.58 per immunization), which should be examined further for either verification or to ascertain factors that might be responsible for this figure.  The cost per fully immunized child is very high in comparison with other countries, particularly Malawi and The Gambia, due to cost per dose and, especially, the number of doses required to obtain full immunization. National costs for the ORT program are $6.27 per outpatient, and for the malaria program, $8.82 per case. Although the costs vary widely for specific sites, some estimates could be made.  Larger facilities tend to have higher costs than do smaller delivery clinics for both EPI and ORT (it was not possible to estimate average malaria costs by site).  For some large facilities, building costs are appreciable.  One large rural health center has the highest average costs for both EPI and ORT and should be reviewed by MOH officials and local managers. Recommendations are made for future cost analysis procedures and include suggestions for content and method.  Also presented are findings pertaining to such factors as vaccine wastage and suggestions for modifications to the regular MOH information system.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","9/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Disease prevention and control|Communicable diseases|Child health care|Health economics|Costs","Swaziland","","","","","000013 - USAID.

"Evaluates the administration and applicability of operations research (OR) studies conducted in East and Southern Africa under the Combating Childhood Communicable Diseases project (CCCD). External evaluation covers the period 1983-10/85.  No methodology is given. An indigenous administrative structure is being developed in participating nations.  An African Research Review Committee (ARRC), composed of researchers and representatives of the international medical/scientific community, was established in 1983. Responsible for reviewing OR proposals, the ARRC funded 19 studies, 11 during the first year and 8 during the second.  In 10/84, the ARRC made some administrative changes in order to lighten the burden on CCCD epidemiologists, on whom the responsibility for the development, administration, supervision, and evaluation of OR studies had fallen: ARRC members agreed to help potential investigators to develop quality proposals, and CCCD will try to ensure that ARRC members or consultants will be available to assist investigators when the need arises. Nonetheless, as the OR program expands (at the rate of about 10 new studies per year), it will still be impossible for the CCCD epidemiologist to fulfill all of his or her responsibilities.  A key recommendation is that an alternative administrative structure be developed to relieve the epidemiologist of primary administrative and direct field supervision and evaluation duties. The studies funded by the project, which range from fairly simple descriptive surveys to sophisticated epidemiological studies, are of mixed quality.  Most, however, will yield valuable data for the development or improvement of local control programs directed at CCCD target diseases, and some may have wider application in other countries in the region.  As important, the project is providing valuable, often first-time, support to some young and relatively inexperienced African researchers who will, in many cases, be able to provide assistance to ongoing and future project-funded OR. Appendices include:  a list of major recommendations for the region from the October 1985 CCCD OR Review Committee Meeting; and summary evaluations of 8 individual OR studies.","Prefaced by transmittal letter|Project title: Africa child survival initiative-Combatting|childhood communicable diseases (ACSI-CCCD)","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","10/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Disease research|Child health care|Research management|Communicable diseases|Operations research|Epidemiology|Child survival activities","East Africa|Southern Africa","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDJAD658.pdf","783 KB","","","000013 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to strengthen Guatemala's nonformal education (NFE) system.  Mid-point external evaluation covers the period through 6/85 and is based on document review and interviews with project personnel and members of the National NFE Board's Secretariat for Coordination. The project is behind schedule and, although good progress is now being made in several important areas, the administrative capacity of the Secretariat - a small, relatively new institution which under the project acquired significant new management burdens - remains in question.  TA has been of only limited success, due to the weakness of the Secretariat's administrative foundation and to uncertainty regarding advisors' roles. Problems in budgeting, procurement, and staff recruitment - exacerbated by a serious economic crisis - have delayed the project and undermined good work in content areas. The Secretariat's effectiveness has been further hampered by ambiguity in its sense of mission.  Although not yet capable of coordinating the activities of other institutions (and often many of its own), it has been reluctant to give up its own direct service activities in favor of coordination and support functions. Activities in content areas, especially at the regional level, are more promising.  The Quetzaltenango office (though also affected by management problems and by recent charges of fraud) and the Salama office are doing creative work in radio programming. The Salama office broadcasts daily programs over Radio Mundial and a 3-hour program over the public address system at the Sunday market in Cubulco.  A new station is being built in San Jeronimo, although further training and planning are needed to prepare for its opening, and a sophisticated study of potential listeners has been conducted in Baja Verapaz. Regional staff, especially those working directly with clients, are dedicated and committed.  The central office is producing taped shows in several content areas. El Informador Rural (a newspaper) and other project-produced NFE materials have, aside from reproduction and distribution problems, been well-received.  Studies show that the market for easy reading newspapers is large.  The newspaper's national focus will allow it to reach places that radio programs do not, while expected input from regional offices (e.g., production of insert materials) should increase the paper's relevance to rural populations.  An expected consultancy should help with the reproduction and distribution problems. Both regional offices have made important first steps in building relations between themselves and with other institutions and community leaders.  Given the project's administrative problems and the distances between regional offices, these efforts should be encouraged.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","6/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Nonformal education|Educational administration|Institution building","Guatemala","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAS975.pdf","3,857 KB","001341 - Creative Associates International, Inc.

"Evaluates project to provide U.S. training to 60 mid-level Malians who would then return to Mali to take up management positions in private and public institutions.  External, mid-point evaluation covers the period 8/81-7/85 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with project personnel and beneficiaries. Activities are proceeding smoothly after a shaky start.  The initial plan to send three groups of 15, 20, and 25 trainees overseas to obtain Master's degrees in Business and Public Administration, Economics, and Education has been revised to four groups of 15 each.  Of these four groups, two have begun U.S. training and a third has begun English language training (ELT) in Mali in preparation for departure.  Training activities have been greatly aided by an efficient selection procedure; most participants are of high caliber and are performing well. However, implementation has been weak in several areas.  (1) The number of female and private-sector candidates is below planned levels. (2) ELT has been deficient in two areas:  speaking and listening comprehension.  (3) The orientation program has not sufficiently informed participants about various phases of their program.  (4) Procedures for arranging housing for participants upon their arrival is inadequate and has caused some participants considerable anxiety.  (5) The project budget has been inappropriately designed; while most expenditures are less than anticipated, participant allocations are insufficient.  (6) Finally, the Project Advisory Council (PAC) is flawed and unable to serve the purpose for which it was designed. Colleagues and supervisors of participants conducting field research have reacted poorly to participant's title of ""leader"" and have not provided adequate cooperation. The project's success has confirmed the idea that Malians are attached to their homeland and return home after graduation, unlike participants of many other nationalities.  Another important lesson is that a sound screening process is one of the most important determinants of the success of any participant training project. It is recommended that:  (1) expectations for the number of women and private sector participants be lowered and the participants be spread out over more universities; (2) participant allocations be raised; (3) the number of participants in the final group be raised to 20; (4) selection procedures focus on economics majors who now make up a low proportion of total participants; and (5) the PAC be terminated and replaced with a General Advisor and academic experts who could be consulted on theses on an as-needed basis.","French ed.: PD-AAS-977|Companion report: PD-BBB-636","Special Evaluation","Documents","DPE-1054-C-00-1034-00","","7/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Leadership training|Management education|Education for development|Participants|Beneficiary count|Beneficiary interviews","Mali","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAS976.pdf","1,564 KB","001341 - Creative Associates International, Inc.

"The impact of an A.I.D. soil and water conservation project in northwest Somalia to increase low crop yields in a cultivated watershed is assessed 17 years after the project's end. In the major intervention, about one-half of the watershed was bunded (surrounded with contoured earthen dikes) to catch spring rains.  This virtually doubled grain yields in the early years, in comparison with non-bunded lands, although these increases have been reduced by about 50% over the years due to spotty maintenance by farmers over the years. Also, planners ignored the agropastoral nature of food production and the possible effects of having the best watered part of the farm permanently cultivated while the rest was given to perennial grazing by farm livestock.  In addition, bunding even small farms has proved too labor-expensive to be economically justifiable for farmers.  Finally, bunding had only a modest demonstration impact - this is contrast to an add-on subproject to build dams and diversion structures to provide flood-irrigation to a religious farming community. Without any systematic training inputs from the project, this community replicated the project at four sites, enabling it to satisfy its grain needs, produce a cash crop, and purchase farm machinery and chemical inputs. Lessons learned are that:  (1) agropastoral subsistence depends more on the pastoral than on the agricultural base; (2) projects to enhance a productive subsector of less importance to producers should avoid dependence on substantial community inputs; (3) projects to enhance a weaker productive subsector should ensure that such will not occur at the expense of the more valuable subsector; (4) projects to enhance food security should consider all of the target area's nutritional and productive resources and problems and how these may be brought into congruence; (5) ""appropriate"" rural technology fits into existing social organization and does not depend on social tinkering by outsiders; (6) local communities invest themselves according to their own, not donors', priorities; and (7) the current trend towards involving rural people in research, planning, and resource allocation processes should be encouraged.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","8/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Water catchment|Irrigated farming|Irrigated land|Beneficiary interviews","Somalia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAL064.pdf","84 KB","000004 - USAID.

"The Niamey Department Development II (NDD II) Project, begun in 1980, was designed to institutionalize a process of rural development by establishing self-managed village organizations to help farm families increase food production on a self-sustaining basis.  Major efforts have included establishing training centers to train farm couples in improved production and extension techniques, establishing cooperatives and village-level mutual cooperative groups, training cooperative officers in literacy and arithmetic skills, and promoting cooperation among Government of Niger (GON) district-level technical services in the four project zones. After several years of operation, NDD II's capacity to enhance rural development remains limited.  The project's agricultural production technologies only partially address farmers' constraints; their profitability at the farm level is contested and they are insufficiently responsive to local variations in production conditions.  For reasons largely beyond the project's control, efforts to integrate GON technical services have had only a modest impact.  Overall, a basic change of intervention strategy may be necessary. NDD II offers several general lessons for development project management.  (1) Projects which improve existing technical services instead of creating new ones may reduce implementation effectiveness. (2) Promoting cooperation among government technical services requires a commitment of these services to project goals, horizontal integration among the services, and changes in the internal structure of individual services.  (3) Management styles of individual project directors can critically affect the morale and performance of project personnel.  A supportive style can have a positive impact on efforts to strengthen local management.  (4) Projects that seek to improve farm-level resource management must understand and address local production and non-production constraints.  (5) Project interventions should include systematic follow-up and support for beneficiaries' activities, as well as feedback mechanisms.  (6) Management must ensure proper allocation not only of physical and material resources, but also of human resources.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","12/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Development project management|Rural development|Institution building|Community self help|Host government departmental coordination|Training centers|Farmer training|Agricultural cooperatives|Villages|Districts","Niger","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAL069.pdf","3,100 KB","000156 - USAID.

"The central objective of the Agriculture Analysis and Planning Project and its predecessor, the Agriculture Development Program, was to improve the capability of the Government of Liberia's (GOL) Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) for the data collection and analysis necessary for sector planning.  Although sector planning has not been institutionalized in the MOA, the projects have achieved limited success in key management areas; these include establishing a Statistics and Planning Division (SPD), training 50 MOA staff members in agricultural economics and statistics, and making the MOA's internal structure responsive to a sector planning approach.  The projects also provided a base of support to the SPD at a time when such support could not be provided by the MOA. There is room for improvement, however.  Data collection and analysis capabilities are weak and need continued support from technical advisors.  Staff training, particularly in-country, needs to be continued to offset turnover.  Further reorganization and development of effective management systems are needed to improve the MOA's performance.  Nonetheless, the fact that the projects have had even limited success is noteworthy, given Liberia's severe economic problems during the past decade, the political instability resulting from the 1980 coup and its effect on the GOL's ministries, and Liberia's organizational culture and approach to public administration.  The most serious current obstacles to improving the MOA's management capabilties are the country's severe fiscal crisis and the significant budget constraints it creates. Key lessons learned are:  (1) sustainable data-related technologies must be simple and low-cost, but sufficient for basic information requirements; (2) the transfer of technology creates management demands which must be anticipated and used as criteria in selecting technical assistance; (3) technical assistance and training must be continuous to assure that gains made are not lost; (4) in-country training must be emphasized to minimize the disruption of agency operations; (5) necessary organizational changes must be anticipated; (6) advisors should provide quality control and staff support if the agency does not; and (7) project planning should be flexible.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","12/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Management operations|Development project planning|Sector policy|Agriculture|Rural development","Liberia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAL070.pdf","2,155 KB","003433 - USAID.

"The 10-year North Shaba Maize Production Project is evaluated as a case study in development project design and management.  Major findings are that:  (1) the number of new and rebuilt roads and bridges were on target; (2) production and marketing of maize exceeded targets; (3) the general economic condition of beneficiaries improved after the commencement of project activities; and (4) pressure by the project helped achieve a higher farm gate price which, while not a stated project goal, contributed to the project's success. Findings on the project's management strategy were both positive and negative.  On the positive side, the project established an effective management unit under the direction of qualified Zairois and achieved a high level of local participation; also, the Government of Zaire provided project cadre who were motivated, capable, and well trained as managers.  On the negative side, the project had a shifting objective and goal, which were never fully understood by the stakeholders; inadequate attention was given, especially early on, to project sustainability, and only partial solutions were found in the final years to sustain the project's institutional, personnel, and financial interventions. Lessons learned are that:  (1) an in-depth understanding of the local socioeconomic and technical environment is a sine qua non for project design and effective project management; (2) a development project tends to be more successful if its design is administratively simple and its management interventions are integrated into local social and production systems; (3) more complicated projects should devote greater time and money to management issues and need a long timeframe to achieve project goals; (4) where a project's larger context is administratively difficult, it may be more appropriate to design a project that works around, and is not a part of, the established system; and (5) although short-term accomplishments fostered by expatriates can help convince beneficiaries to accept long-term solutions, it is more important in the long run to train local personnel at all levels to implement project activities, even if this temporarily slows implementation.

"The Land Conservation and Range Development (LCRD) Project, begun in 1980, was designed to strengthen Lesotho's Ministry of Agriculture and arrest crop and range land degradation.  To date, LCRD:  (1) has established a prototype range management area (RMA) for applying improved livestock/range management methods; (2) is making a concerted effort within the RMA to introduce rotational grazing, controlled breeding, culling of less desirable animals, disease control, and marketing of livestock and livestock products; and (3) has established a livestock owners' grazing association (GA) to enforce RMA grazing regulations. LCRD offers several lessons for development project management. (1) Training should be extended beyond government counterparts to participants - in LCRD, livestock owners and their herdboys - who can sustain project interventions.  (2) Rigorous financial management may not be an important determinant of project success. LCRD is meeting planned targets despite elementary bookkeeping. USAID is imposing rigorous financial management procedures on itself rather than on the project.  (3) A project that introduces new resource management techniques must co-opt local authorities and yet relieve local organizations of responsibility for unpopular decisions.  LCRD imposes such decisions on the GA but blames failures on the U.S. technical team. (4) Local organizations established to control resource allocation must have supportive linkages to pre-existing legitimate institutions - in LCRD, the hierarchy of chiefs.  (5) Integration of a project into an existing institution - in LCRD, the Ministry of Agriculture - can strengthen a country's institutional capacity. (6) Different project components, levels of focus, and implementation periods may require different management styles. Early on, some U.S. technicians located in Maseru held line positions while their counterparts studied in the United States. Upon the latter's return, the technicians have become advisors to the Ministry.  Within the RMA, on the other hand, U.S. technicians are not merely advisors, but must tell the RMA what to do.

"Evaluates project to foster the development of self-sufficient, market-oriented crafts producers in Haiti.  Final external evaluation covers the period 7/83-6/85 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with CARE, USAID/H, and other donor personnel and with beneficiaries. The project - which rejected the social welfare approach to crafts production used previously (under the Haitian-American Community Help Organization - HACHO) in favor of a more entrepreneurial approach - was highly successful, showing that crafts projects, when well-managed and relevant to the intended beneficiaries, can provide a basis for substantial employment and income generation and can help to develop new products compatible with export market requirements.  Several stable handicraft enterprises were established, as well as a self-sufficient retail outlet whose success has exceeded all expectations; the project also built a solid base for assisting producers in exporting their crafts.  The quality and dedication of project staff was a key factor in the success of the project. Two factors negatively affecting implementation were logistic problems due to the remote location of many craft centers and decreased export potential due to the strength of the U.S. dollar. The project teaches that future and/or follow-on projects should include:  (1) capital generation schemes that encourage producers to view themselves as independent entrepreneurs; (2) quality control mechanisms whereby artisans are directly identified with their products; (3) a revolving credit fund to make short-term loans available (the project's fund had a default rate of 0%); (4) a component to make funds for raw materials procurement available to producers; (5) TA to producers in financial management and accounting; (6) targeting of producers best able to absorb project inputs (in this project, small producers responded much better than did microartisans); (7) strong financial controls and regular contact with beneficiaries; and (8) mechanisms to contribute to project self-sufficiency. A follow-on project is strongly recommended.","Attached to PD-AAT-064","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","9/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Business support services|Small scale enterprises|Private enterprises|Retail marketing|Rural areas|Product development|Handicrafts|Beneficiary interviews","Haiti","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAT064A.pdf","2,979 KB","007433 - Price Waterhouse|008554 - USAID.

"Evaluates subproject to strengthen the Ghana Seed Company, Ltd. (GSC), a parastatal.  End of project evaluation covers the period 1980-11/85 and is based on site visits and interviews with GSC, contract growers, farmers, and other involved personnel. GSC has managed to produce, store, and sell seed under extremely adverse economic conditions.  GSC operates 12 foundation seed farms and in 1984 produced 2,371 bages of maize seed and 3,368 bags of rice seed, more than expected; production of groundnut and cowpea seed was low, however.  The delivery of foundation seed has proceeded well, despite the great distances (30-70 miles) over difficult roads between regional offices and seed farms. Nonetheless, GSC's operational practices and lack of management, accounting, and marketing support are not conducive to further inputs by external donors or the GOG.  GSC's poor financial procedures often violate the Ghana Companies Code.  Control over revenues and expenditures is not appropriate.  For example, GSC has failed to monitor market conditions and purchased seed in excess of demand, experiencing substantial losses.  Sales revenues have decreased as there are problems with the quality and germination of GSC seed and farmers prefer to grow their own; also, GSC's marketing strategy is inadequate.  Further, GSC does not maintain an assets register, carries stocks over from year to year, and values them without reference to condition (thus understating its losses).  GSC does not distribute a debtors list and it is unlikely that outstanding debts will be recovered. Other problems have included:  difficult recruitment due to poor remuneration and general lack of incentives; inadequate linkage between GSC and the extension service; little oversight by the Board of Directors (which was only recently recreated after being disbanded during the revolution); poorly organized equipment and vehicle use; and lack of attention to maintenance. The project was unrealistic in expecting a group of government workers - well-intentioned and well-trained as they may be - to run a large commercial enterprise.  The major recommendation is to reorganize GSC as a joint company with GOG and private shareholders.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","11/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Seed production|Management operations|Financial management|Parastatals|Agricultural product marketing","Ghana","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAT112.pdf","2,927 KB","","","","English","application/pdf","Evaluation team|Indepth evaluation|Final EOPS|Pre evaluation data","","Lefes, William S.|Vordzorgbe, Seth|et al.","","Nov 1985","","","","Final evaluation : managed inputs and delivery of agricultural service (MIDAS II)","","PD-AAT-112","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTkxMjYz","Ghana","6410102|641T020"
"Evaluates three projects to support small village projects identified by Peace Corps (PC) volunteers working with local community organizations.  Special evaluation covers the period 1/83-10/84 and is based on site visits, surveys, and interviews with PC and A.I.D. personnel and with beneficiaries. The Small Projects Assistance (SPA) program, involving 34 agreements between A.I.D. Missions and PC country teams, has provided a valuable tool for community development, while increasing communication between A.I.D. and the PC and contributing to PCV work satisfaction.  Review of 62 projects in 8 countries indicated that 43 were successful, 5 unsuccessful, and 14 of too short duration to assess.  Projects with cash contributions from communities had a high success rate (14 of 15); small enterprise projects had a low success rate; and the food production/agriculture sector, with the most projects, had a 92% success rate, the highest.  Also, in an opinion survey of 44 PC staff members, 87 PCV's, and 23 A.I.D. personnel, the majority favored SPA continuation because of its quickness and reliability, flexibility, cost-effectiveness, PC control, and responsiveness to community needs. Provision of TA by the PC Office of Training and Program Support helped to generate new projects in countries receiving program consultations, and in 75% of countries led to improved relationships with host officials; regional PC training supported by SPA/TA funds led to improved administration in 50% of countries, and 11 of 12 inservice training programs for PCV's and counterparts were successful.  Overall, 77% of SPA/TA activities were rated as successful. Given the success of individual projects and the limited number of PCV's currently able to obtain SPA funding, it is recommended that overall funding be doubled, with some funds allotted for augmenting PC management staff.  The SPA's decentralized nature should be preserved. Clearer guidelines are needed for grant disbursement, which is often marked by confusion and delay; in some cases funds have been deposited to PCVs' personal accounts, contrary to regulations.  Information about promising practices developed in individual countries should have wide dissemination, and a system for monitoring long-range impacts should be initiated.  Training for PCV's is needed in project analysis, supervision, proposal writing, and appropriate use of funds.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","4/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Voluntary organizations|Development projects|Community development|Technical assistance|Beneficiary interviews","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAT115.pdf","14,002 KB","001341 - Creative Associates International, Inc.

"The Bakel Small Irrigated Perimeters project was initiated in 1977 to introduce irrigated rice agriculture to the upper Senegal River basin. The management strategy was to build on the efforts begun by farmers to install small irrigated perimeters.  The project worked with the National Society for the Development and Exploitation of the Senegal and Faleme River Basins (SAED) to supply inputs and extension services to farmers who supplied labor to develop small irrigated perimeters. Although the project met only 50% of its quantitative targets, its accomplishments are important because of farmer acceptance of irrigation technologies, increasing farmer participation in the project, and flexible SAED management.  The major findings of this evaluation are that project accomplishments were possible because of concomitant policy changes by the Government of Senegal and SAED and that success was enhanced by the openness and outward orientation of the people of Bakel and by SAED's willingness to let farmers organize and administer irrigated perimeters on their own terms. Several key lessons were learned.  (1) Projects should carefully assess socioeconomic characteristics of target populations at the design stage.  (2) An effective project management strategy is one that fosters local participation in management decisions and permits local organizations to build on indigenous structures and practices.  Allowing the organization to choose its own officers and management style, for example, fosters organizational and hence project sustainability.  (3) Appropriate government policy changes may be necessary to permit community participation in project decisionmaking.  (4) If host country staff is adequately trained, a loose management style by donors can be effective management, fostering a sense of ownership of the project among the staff.  (5) A strategy fostering beneficiary participation requires concomitant and comprehensive training.  In addition, appropriate training for mid- and upper-level managers can have significant impact on the project, particularly when reinforced by needed policy changes.

"Evaluates project to help the Government of Pakistan (GOP) provide technical and managerial training to public and private sector employees working in priority development areas.  Interim evaluation covers FY82-85 and is based on document review and interviews with project, USAID/P, and GOP staff and with trainees. The project has had a highly successful start.  Three training organizations (NIPA/Karachi, PIM, and the Training Wing of the Pakistan Audit Department) have received TA in developing plans of action for training programs.  Of the 34 management training courses, seminars, and workshops planned, 15 have been conducted with positive results.  There have been over 400 participants, most of them through add-on activities serving other USAID/P projects.  These add-on programs appear to be a highly successful, efficient way to use participant training resources. Finally, English as a Second Language (ESL) training has been provided to those participants who require it. Despite these achievements, the project faces serious constraints. Most seriously, it lacks the financial and personnel resources needed to meet its targets and take advantage of emerging opportunities.  The project has reached a phase in its institutional development, management training, and ESL components - all of which are currently understaffed - which provides A.I.D. with a unique chance to change management practices in the strategic private enterprise, agriculture, and energy sectors. Increased opportunities for training of women are also beginning to develop. Other problems are:  (1) policy differences regarding jurisdictional responsibility and procedural bottlenecks within the GOP will make it impossible for participant training goals to be reached; (2) the GOP (especially at the provincial level) lacks a comprehensive process for linking training needs and opportunities to the career growth of individuals and to organizational growth and strengthening; and (3) the private sector goals of the project, and of USAID/P generally, lack a clear focus. An important lesson learned is that GOP does not share USAID/P's enthusiasm for short-term participant training because it feels that short-term U.S. training is not easily adaptable to Pakistani conditions and that it represents a superficial attitude toward Pakistan.","Companion project evaluation summary: PD-AAT-123","Special Evaluation","Documents","DAN-0000-I-00-5051-00","","11/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Technical training|Management training|Participants|Beneficiary count|Beneficiary interviews|Sampling method","Pakistan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAT124.pdf","9,035 KB","000878 - National Association of Schools of Public Affairs and Administration","","008588 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to support efforts by the Jamaica/Western New York (JA/WNY) Partnership of the Partners of the Americas (PA) to provide TA to nonprofit educational and social organizations. External, mid-point evaluation covers the period 9/82-3/85 and is based on site visits, document review, and interviews with project personnel and beneficiaries. PA has made significant progress toward project objectives.  An effective, operational staff and administrative infrastructure has been established at both the Jamaica and the Western New York offices. Membership in the JA's skills bank has grown from 6 in 1983 to 83 (77 individuals and 6 corporations), and WNY's skills bank has grown to 66 individual members.  General membership at JA now stands at 98 individuals and 28 corporations, and WNY has 38 individual and 1 corporate members.  JA skills bank volunteers have provided TA to 329 individuals and 17 Jamaican agencies; beneficiaries report a high level of satisfaction with the quality of the TA. However, progress in other areas is less impressive.  While both offices have potentially profitable fundraising strategies, little effort has been made to put them into practice, and theoffices depend mainly on in-kind contributions from members; JA has also received some donations to specific nonproject activities.  JA's resource library is incomplete, and although some didactic material developed during TA workshop is on file in print, it has not been converted to electronic media; also, no computer links have been established with associated agencies. Relations between the two offices were strained during the first 2 years of the OPG.  While this problem seems to be resolved, cooperative activities such as the pairing of Jamaican and U.S. trainers to form TA delivery teams have not been undertaken. Nor do perceptions on both sides always coincide regarding such issues as the project's role in the total PA program, the nature of the flow of TA from South to North, and the application of the nonprofit criterion. A 1-year extension, including increased efforts in fundraising, TA delivery, and JA-WNY cooperation, is recommended.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","DPE-1054-C-00-1034-00","","4/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Technical assistance|International cooperation|Development cooperation|Institution building|Private voluntary organizations|Beneficiary count|Beneficiary interviews","Jamaica","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAT138.pdf","4,187 KB","001341 - Creative Associates International, Inc.

"The management aspects of an A.I.D. subproject to expand diploma-level agricultural training at Egerton College, Kenya, are explored in this evaluation study, part of a series on development management in Africa. The project was a success although it lacked an explicit management enhancement effort.  Student enrollment increased on schedule to a current level of 1,437 without any impairment of Egerton's standards or the practical orientation of its training. With few exceptions, all faculty sent to the United States for training returned to assume their planned responsibilities.  The construction program was well planned and completed ahead of schedule.  The simple and straightforward goal of physical expansion and the strong commitment by the Government of Kenya and College staff were key factors leading to successful project management.  The fact that the College had autonomous status and operated during a period of fiscal surplus further facilitated implementation. Lessons learned are:  (1) it is important to keep within the management capabilities of the host institution; (2) the simpler and clearer project goals, the easier it is to reach consensus on them and provide objective criteria for resource allocation; (3) management enhancement takes time - to train staff, develop systems, adapt them to local needs, and become accustomed to them; (4) management success has more to do with leadership quality than with specific reforms or skills; (4) a fiscal surplus permits management flexibility and innovation; (5) weak budgeting and financial management systems may be less of a constraint in small institutions with personal or hierarchical management styles; (6) parastatals and other institutions with significant management autonomy and fiscal flexibility can provide an environment for management innovation and initiative; (7) mid-level management participation in project planning can promote high morale and efficiency; (8) a shared institutional ""doctrine"" can help overcome potential problems; and (9) congruence of key actors' interests and incentives contributes to rapid, efficient project implementation.

"Presents final Mission report (6/79-1984) on a project to help the Government of Indonesia (GOI) develop a self-instructional learning system for primary school dropouts and adult learners. A prototype teaching-learning system, called Pendidikan Anak oleh Masyarakat Orangtua dan Guru (PAMONG), was developed at the Universitas Sebelas Maret (UNS), and a resource center was established on campus to disseminate PAMONG materials.  Training teams, materials, manuals, and implementation guides were also developed and tested, and a formative evaluation process was developed allowing for the integration of various PAMONG programs into a coherent whole.  PAMONG has become a key instrument in the GOI's Wajib Belajar (compulsory education) program, it has been adapted and utilized by other GOI sectors (such as the provincial government of East Java), and variants of PAMONG are in operation at 313 schools, including UNS, where the system has become an accepted method of instruction.  Some 1,456 students have received a Certificate of Completion of Primary Education through the PAMONG system. The project provided M.S. training to four persons and 10 person-months of short-term U.S. or third-country training.  It also trained 158 teachers, supervisors, and school principals in Bali in use of the PAMONG system; educational planners and administrators from all 27 provinces have been trained at UNS to utilize PAMONG within the Wajib Belajar campaign. Lessons learned are:  (1) since static empirical models are seldom suitable to all locations in a country, approaches to educational innovation must be flexible, dynamic, and capable of change as circumstances warrant; and (2) research and development must be carried out simultaneously with institutionalization efforts at both local (implementation) and policy levels.  At operational levels, innovations should be implemented via existing infrastructures and institutions; at higher levels, policy should be continuously aligned with accruing field experience.

"Evaluates Food for Work (FFW) projects coordinated by Catholic Relief Services in Indonesia.  Internal evaluation covers the period through 5/85 and is based on site visits, document review, and interviews with implementing personnel and beneficiaries. An impressive amount of infrastructural and agricultural development has been achieved.  Over 70% (counting cancelled projects) of the projects assessed met or exceeded their construction goals and 65% of these were completed within the planned time period.  The work output included:  78.5 km of roads, 45 km of irrigation canal, 41 km of flood control dikes and canals, 20 ha of reclaimed land, 6 ha of rubber plantations, 2 fish ponds of 4 ha, and 17 ha of prepared ricefields. Most of the projects met the requirement that they be labor-intensive: 65% were highly labor-intensive, i.e., spent at least 80% of their budget on labor; only 3% of the projects were less than 60% labor-intensive.  FFW projects were, for the most part, functioning upon completion of construction and judged favorably for their quality. There is some indication, however, that most of the projects would have been built even without the FFW program, although probably to a lower standard. The target group, impoverished heads of households, made up the majority of the 9,510 FFW workers.  The average worker was employed 61 days and received 2.5 kg of food per day or 153 kg in all.  The food aid was generally used for consumption by most or all of the family members; however, a small but not insignificant percentage of recipients have used it in unintended ways (i.e., to sell or feed to livestock).  Most of the recipients have been pleased with the food aid (except for some dissatisfaction with bulgar) and would be interested in participating in further projects. The status of maintenance on 15 projects which have been completed for at least 6 months and the proposals that these projects have stimulated for follow-on development activities indicate that the FFW program will continue to benefit the population on a long-term basis. This is true of both road projects (which have been responsible for increased traffic and market competitiveness) and non-road projects (3 of 4 non-road projects specifically examined with regard to long-term impacts have increased agricultural productivity).","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","5/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Food for Work|Public works|Beneficiary count|Beneficiary interviews","Indonesia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAT257.pdf","765 KB","007337 - Catholic Relief Services (CRS)","","008558 - USAID.

"Presents final evaluation (4/82-6/85) of OPG to the Foundation for the Peoples of the South Pacific (FSP) for an integrated rural development program in the Solomon Islands, including women's interest (WI) and village fisheries (VF) programs, the latter replaced by a small community and commercial program (SCC) in 3/84. The OPG was ably administered, although office space was crowded and a small truck is needed, especially given the new FSP Training Center at New Koleula and the rapid growth of small projects. FSP recruited 3 of 8 targeted field personnel (and is using its 6 women's workers in SCC) and formed 1 of 6 targeted mobile teams. Of 139 SCC projects supported in 1984, 45 were income-generating (piggery, poultry, bakery, etc.), representing a marked increase in both quantity and quality (the latter due to training at the new FSP center for FSP field staff, project holders, and women leaders) over 1983, when WI funds for income-generating projects were limited. Other SCC projects include a planned marketing center on Malaita, two businesses to promote charcoal stoves, and solar lighting at New Koleula (a first for the Solomons). Overall, the projects are working well. Of the 20 visited, only the poultry project at the Malaita women's club had collapsed - after the chickens were stolen at Christmas, 1984. Reasons for success include able project leaders, the practice of working with family groups, carefully choosing and training project holders, making continued support dependent on good use of that already given, and follow-up by FSP staff. The WI program was highly successful. With targets in the number of visits to women's clubs and in training workshops exceeded and met, respectively, the number of active clubs increased greatly, and many now have income (although only 18 new clubs were formed vs. an unrealistic target of 87). After a slow start, income-generating activities are well ahead of target, possibly due in part to SCC. FSP also helped organize resources for women from public and private entities and is trying to counter male jealousy by inviting men to the workshops. Data collection problems make it impossible to quantify program success. The VF program collapsed when the responsibilities of the Fisheries Division, FSP's intended partner, devolved to provincial offices. FSP now works only with private groups. Yet overall, the funds expended earlier were well used. The program's most notable success - establishment of a small business (now employing 59 people) to build eskies, etc. - came as a side benefit. Fishing activities under SCC have included, inter alia, help for 8 fishing groups (by 6/85) and construction of 3 fishing boats.","Evaluation period: 1 April 1982-30 Jun 1985","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","AID/ASIA-G-492-1650","","6/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Integrated rural development|Small scale enterprises|Women in development|Fisheries|Private voluntary organizations|Beneficiary count","Solomon Islands","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAT328.pdf","1,764 KB","001354 - Foundation for the Peoples of the South Pacific, Inc.","","000039 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to strengthen Sri Lanka's capacity to conduct rice varietal and cropping systems research.  Ex post impact evaluation is based on site visits, document review, and interviews with project personnel and beneficiaries. The project significantly strengthened Sri Lanka's rice varietal improvement program.  Twelve new rice varieties were released during the course of the project, two others have been released since, and others are currently being studied.  The new varieties developed continue to be bred for resistance to pests and diseases and adaptation to various agro-ecological zones.  The new varieties, which have been readily adopted by farmers, have led to increased rice production to the degree that Sri Lanka is now virtually self-sufficient in rice.  However, farmers' net returns per acre and per bushel have decreased due to increased production costs.  Intensified cropping systems have been adopted by high-resource farmers, but are not an option for farmers with economic or environmental constraints.  In fact, due to continual difficulties in establishing field trials or an adaptive research program, little progress was made in developing improved agronomic practices for small paddy farmers.  Strong linkages between research and extension do exist, however. Provision of training and commodities strengthened Sri Lanka's Department of Agriculture (DOA) as an institution.  However, the project's effectiveness in this regard was reduced by poor management during the project and, thereafter, by weak research planning and bureaucratic obstacles. Several recommendations are provided.","Loan no. 383-T-016","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","11/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural research|Rice|Crop production|Varietal research|Beneficiary interviews","Sri Lanka","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAT359.pdf","6,288 KB","008606 - USAID.

"Presents final external evaluation of a project to improve energy policymaking in the Dominican Republic.  The evaluation is based on document review and interviews. Project purposes were only partially met.  Public and private sector participants attended technical mini-courses; energy information was provided to Government of the Dominican Republic (GODR) agencies and in public information campaigns; there was a gradual growth in the number of people skilled in data collection and processing, as well as increasing evidence of awareness of the national importance of dealing constructively with the energy sector; and there is a good probability of achieving project goals in the the planning component of follow-on project 5170144. The key problem was the failure to anticipate how the energy planning information developed under the project would be used. Because the planning software (Al-Edis) and associated hardware (PRIME) did not relate well to the GODR decision structure, much of the information generated did not address issues of interest to the GODR; also, considerable computer maintenance problems were experienced.  A second major problem was personnel turnover, resulting in large training efforts but few long-term benefits to the National Energy Policy Commission (COENER); this is especially true of training given in use of PRIME and Al-Edis. Toward of the end of the project extension in 1984, the diagnostic capability of COENER spokespersons and their framing of policy issues showed some improvement, but there is no evidence that this was translated into an active COENER role in policymaking at that time.  In fine, the project did not meet the expectations expressed in the Project Paper, but it did lay the groundwork for subsequent efforts. Four lessons were learned.  (1) Unless information systems aimed at helping with policymaking are designed not only to improve current policy, but also to work with the world as it is, they are not well supported by the host country and are not worth A.I.D. resources.  (2) Policy TA requires mutual trust, sensitivity, and a great deal of time. This cannot be accomplished through training, but usually requires a resident - which was not provided in this project.  (3) The project confirmed the rule that equipment without local maintenance support and adequate funds often become a white elephant.  (4) Lack of a coherent training plan leads to a diffusion of effort and a loss of human resources.  The cancellation of the project training plan and the impact of proceeding without it was an unfortunate loss.","Attached to PD-AAT-419","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","PDC-1406-I-12-2166-00","","10/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Energy planning|Energy policy|Technical assistance|Technical training|Computers|Computer software|Policy making","Dominican Republic","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAT419A.pdf","565 KB","000439 - Development Sciences, Inc.","","003087 - Dominican Republic.

"Presents final Mission report on a project (6/79-9/84) to upgrade the capability of the Indonesian Ministry of Education's Center for Communication Technology (PUSTEKKOM) to improve formal and nonformal education, especially in rural areas. With all planned TA and training completed, PUSTEKKOM now has all the facilities and the trained personnel needed to produce sophisticated educational materials.  The project library has acquired 1,151 book, 33 journal, and 193 media titles in educational technology, as well as 14 computer software programs and audiovisual and graphics equipment. PUSTEKKOM achievements include helping the newly established Open University to develop materials and, at the direction of the Minister of Education and Culture, producing 52 films entitled ""I Love Indonesia"" for television (its next major activity, also at the Minister's Direction, will be to produce films on Indonesian history). Recently, the chairman of the Ministry's Office for Education R&D (BALITBANG DIKBUD) placed PUSTEKKOM in charge of planning and developing software materials in two subject areas for junior high schools.  PUSTEKKOM is also responding to requests from various government offices for training in instructional software development. The University of Southern California (USC), a subcontractor of the Academy for Educational Development (AED) in the training component, proposed a novel approach to participant training:  a U.S. faculty traveled to Indonesia to provide 1-month intensive courses in Master's and doctoral areas where Indonesian schools were lacking.  USC thereby both greatly increased the number of students trained and helped developed an in-country capability to offer graduate training in educational technology (a secondary project objective). The failure of the project design to coordinate participant training and TA and to provide adequate administrative support to the Chief of Party, as well its underestimation of the time needed to deliver commodities, revealed the importance of these matters.  The project also taught the importance of host country counterparts; the staff of BALITBANG DIKBUD, the implementing agency, too often lacked management capability or hesitated to exercise authority, and the agency, moreover, was undergoing reorganization during most of the project. In this project, it was difficult to reach a consensus as to the project's intended end - whether expansion or improvement of educational opportunities, or improvements in educational technology - and thus to focus on project impacts and measure the results.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","11/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Institution building|Educational centers|Educational development|Government departments|Communications technology|Educational materials|Development project design|Limited data","Indonesia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAT701.pdf","186 KB","008558 - USAID.

"Executive summmary of final outside evaluation (XD-AAT-784-B) of project to strengthen energy sector planning in Costa Rica. Evaluation covered the period 9/81-12/85 and was based on document review and interviews. The project purpose was achieved.  Since its establishment in 1982, the Direccion Sectoral de Energia (DSE) has grown in size and influence to become a participant in many major policy matters, especially those regarding energy demand and renewable energy resources.  While many objective targets were not (and may never be) achieved, accomplishments are substantial, including: creation and acceptance of a holistic view of the energy sector; good DSE working relationships with other entities; very effective training and exchange activities in terms of type and number of trainees (although at a cost double that programmed); and good DSE performance in producing demand surveys and analyses, energy balances, an energy information system, and a computer planning model. Still, the nature and amount of energy planning capacity building which can be attributed to the project was different and less than anticipated.  Targets were both inappropriate and overambitious; the project was expected to contribute directly to improving the Costa Rican economy, but the overall objective should have been stated, rather, in relation to the energy sector.  Short-term TA was mostly in the form of consultancies for studies, with less than expected effectiveness; neither the contractor nor USAID/CR made an effort to ensure the timely completion of work, and the sum of a series of singly justified extensions dampened overall achievement. The greatest disappointment is that DSE has not yet produced the National Energy Sector Plan, despite its capability to do so; the project's development impact will be more easily measured when the plan is produced and after the elections for a new government in 2/86. Two lessons stand out.  (1) Technical and management assistance must be assured throughout a project.  In this case, long-term TA should have been provided for 3 years instead of 2, despite the relatively high level of experience of Costa Rica's professionals and institutions.  (2) The universal tendency to establish high performance expectations should be tempered, or USAID should be willing to provide additional TA to see that these expectations are met. Logical next steps are to:  (1) continue support for the programs and studies of DSE and other energy sector entities; (2) consider funding public information campaigns, senior staff training, further studies, and the implementation of industrial energy conservation audit recommendations; and (3) provide funds for expanded energy conservation efforts in the transport sector.","Attached to PD-AAT-784|Full report: XD-AAT-784-B","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","12/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Institution building|Government departments|Energy planning","Costa Rica","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAT784A.pdf","592 KB","000471 - Energy/Development International","","008533 - USAID.

"Presents final outside evaluation of project (11/79-8/85) to strengthen the capability of Panama's Water Resources and Electrification Institute (IRHE) to develop alternative energy resources.  Evaluation focused on micro-hydropower (MH) activities, and was based on document review, site visits, and interviews with involved personnel and beneficiaries. Seven MH demonstration projects were added during the project to replace the cancelled Yaviza biomass plant; while compounding an ambitious scope, this change helped achieve the project purpose, as MH is the most developed of the project technologies. Still, the project achieved better quantitative than qualitative results.  The target of 40 feasibility studies was met (although the studies were closer to prefeasibility due to methodological flaws). Solar water heating and photovoltaic demonstrations were completed, as was one biogas project; 2 of the 7 MH projects were completed and the other 5 nearly so.  However, due to low turbine efficiency, the completed MH projects are producing only 20% of intended output, and their socioeconomic benefits have been limited, due in part to community underdevelopment and the absence of productive-use promotion.  (Energy use so far has consisted mostly of household and public lighting; an action plan is proposed for forming cooperatives to provide a management structure and promote productive electricity use at six of the MH projects.) Common design flaws persist, even though the MH projects were built consecutively over 5 years.  Still, significant benefits may be realized given limited expenditure of funds and effort on civil works, turbo-generating equipment, and community management structures (e.g., a combined $10,000 investment in material and equipment would be required for the 2 completed MH projects). IRHE staff received extensive training, and while targets for information generation/dissemination and planning were not met, IRHE capabilities were improved in these areas, and the National Energy Commission is drawing heavily on this experience. Reaching maximum institutional benefits, though, would have required greater commitment to activities and more attention to lessons learned. The project shows that:  (1) large utilities with experience in large hydropower schemes may not be the most appropriate entities to design and implement MH schemes, especially in developing countries; (2) technology-driven approaches to MH are inadequate - engineering work must be complemented by a decentralized community management structure and productive uses must be either built into a project or actively promoted in conjunction with it; and (3) priority should be given to ensuring availability of specialized TA.","Attached to PD-AAT-871","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-0100-I-03-2071-00","","9/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Alternative energy technology|Electric power generation|Institution building|Hydroelectric power plants|Small scale energy systems|Beneficiary interviews","Panama","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAT871A.pdf","4,553 KB","004147 - National Rural Electric Cooperative Association.

"Evaluates project to improve the data collection, processing, and analysis capabilities of Rwanda's Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock, and Forests (MINAGRI) through the preparation and conduct of a national survey of 2,100 farm households. Special evaluation covers the period 11/83-1/85 and is based on document review, observation, and interviews. The project has largely succeeded in establishing an effective national program for agricultural data collection in Rwanda. Survey preparation and a 1-year pilot project which gathered information on 710 households (the first national agricultural survey in Rwanda) have been completed; data processing will continue until May, when analysis of data is scheduled to begin. Moreover, MINAGRI's Service d'Etudes, Enquetes et Statistiques Agricoles (SESA) is rapidly developing an excellent reputation among Government of Rwanda and donor personnel. While SESA will require contined technical support in the immediate term in undertaking new activities, it is already developing beyond a unit narrowly focused on agricultural census and provides a good foundation on which to establish an office for policy analysis. Project successes have been achieved despite serious problems, the foremost being:  (1) a constant lack of trained personnel, resulting from a lack of candidates provided by the Government of Rwanda and the related ommission of four of the six training stages for SESA, and (2) the inability of SESA to recruit an agroeconomist, without whose input the survey questionnaire failed to collect data relevant to key policy issues (sales, purchases, and market prices); the lack of an agroeconomist will be felt again as data analysis commences.  The U.S. Bureau of the Census (BUCEN) has provided excellent support, however, including a substitute for the agroeconomist, and in the face of these problems SESA has developed creative responses to problems, e.g., of low morale among field presonnel, data errors, elevated costs, and access to microcomputers. Lessons learned from the project include:  (1) local costs were of the survey were well underestimated and the productivity of some tasks was low, in part due to programming requirements imposed by the use of an outdated computer; and (2) inital expectations were overambitious and unrealistic; a longer longer pilot phase, in particular, would have provided the opportunity for necessary staff training.","Attached to PD-AAT-913","Special Evaluation","Documents","DAN-1190-A-00-4092-00","","2/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Data collection|Data analysis|Sector planning|National level|Agricultural surveys|Institution building","Rwanda","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAT913A.pdf","1,353 KB","008598 - USAID.

"Presents final Mission report (12/83-6/85) on a subproject (SP) of the Chad Relief and Rehabilitation Project to rehabilitate Chad's agricultural infrastructure. The SP, implemented by CARE, ended in 6/85 after a 4-month no-cost extension.  Of the 13 activities planned (9 in small-scale irrigation and 4 in public health, sanitation, and safety), work was done on all except for irrigation in Linia and erosion control in Mao.  A town drainage system was added for Bongor.  The goal of rehabilitating irrigation infrastructure at selected sites was largely met, and Food for Work was effective in generating rural employment.  Less well documented were the SP's benefits to the users of the rehabilitated infrastructure. Status on recommendations of the 6/84 mid-term evaluation is as follows.  (1) The recommendations to implement a second phase of the subproject and to include in it greater planning detail regarding materials, targets, beneficairies, level of effort, and budget, were fully acted upon.  (2) In response to the recommendation to reinforce the project's engineering aspects, CARE recruited an irrigation engineer in early 1985, but terminated this assignment by mutual consent after 4 months; the individual was not replaced.  Subsequently, USAID/C added an engineer to its own staff and requested more detailed engineering plans for review prior to phase II implementation.  (3) Despite the recommendation that CARE submit more complete and timely activity completion reports, reports continued to be too limited in scope, often focusing on timeliness of input delivery and neglecting to discuss the activity's relative merit in light of the overall project purpose.  (4) CARE provided a short-term rural sociologist/anthropologist, as recommended, to analyse impacts on users of the rehabilitated infrastructure.  However, the usefulness of the final report was flawed by its focus on describing ethnic societies, although it did indicate a very strong interest by traditional villagers in irrigation development. Two lessons were learned.  (1) The use of umbrella financing proved a flexible and effective method of rapid response to Chad's war and drought-related emergencies.  This was especially true in this project because of CARE's extensive previous experience in Chad.  (2) Meeting technical engineering criteria for irrigation infrastructure rehabilitation may require professional support beyond a PVO's ability to recruit.  Such expertise could be built into the central, supervisory part of a PVO umbrella project, or could be arranged by the individual PVO through agreements with a university or an agricultural engineering firm.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Disaster rehabilitation|Irrigation system construction|Private voluntary organizations|Economic impact|Water supply engineering|Rural areas|Limited data","Chad","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDBBB523.pdf","74 KB","008528 - USAID.

"Both the enormous success recorded by the first ten years of A.I.D. programs to develop housing finance in the Dominican Republic and the expectations and frustrations generated by that early success are highlighted in this report.  An opening section presents background on conditions affecting housing and housing finance, touching on urbanization and economic conditions, housing finance policy, the construction industry, and the interventions of two public sector institutions, in particular the National Housing Institute.  The country's major financial institutions are introduced and, more specifically, the institutions and policies of the current Dominican housing finance system are detailed.  The paper's major section addresses the development of A.I.D. housing objectives, 1962-84, describing as well the internal and external constraints to these objectives which led to the discontinuation of the Housing Guaranty program. The study concludes that A.I.D. was successful in achieving its primary objectives of stimulating the development of institutions and mechanisms for housing finance and establishing a permanant source of housing finance funds.  Lessons learned are outlined, and the general applicability of these lessons to projects in other Latin American countries is briefly discussed.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Housing administration|Development projects|Housing finance|Institution building","Dominican Republic","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAV553.pdf","1,581 KB","000875 - National Savings and Loan League","","002960 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to increase private sector investment in income-generating, export-oriented, natural resource-based Thai ventures located outside of Bangkok.  Mid-term evaluation covers the period 5/83-6/85 and is based on document review and interviews with private sector personnel. Progress has been slow; only the Thai Joint Agricultural Consultative Committee (TJACC) has been on schedule and has shown results, developing linkages between Thai and U.S. agribusiness and actively furthering the development of several investment opportunities.  No substantive changes have resulted from policy dialogue, which has been stressed to the detriment of developing private sector capabilities to improve the investment environment.  Furthermore, the Joint Standing Committee of Commerce, Industry, and Banking (JSC) has not served as the implementing agency for dialogue as planned, reducing the potential private sector role.  Due to staffing limitations, the Board of Investment (BOI) has delegated its project responsibilities to consultants.  Finally, there is no overall implementation plan, nor has the Project Committee (PC), which has deemphasized its project administration role, required or reviewed any such plan for individual project activities. Nonetheless, progress is being made.  Private associations are concentrating more on issues to raise before the public-private consultative committee, and more private sector representatives are involved in policy.  A 7/84 workshop was particularly productive, stimulating the first progress in formulating studies of policies and regulations.  Overall, it is likely that the project will eventually increase private sector investment and possible that it will have a long-term impact on the investment environment. The project has shown that:  (1) goals and purposes should be concise and easily understood - the breadth of this 3-part project defies specificity and diminishes control; (2) a realistic, detailed implementation plan and schedule developed with the input and commitment of implementors is needed - the project's lack of targets and benchmarks lessens implementors' sense of obligation and limits monitoring capacities; (3) administrative analysis in project design should verify that capacities are as claimed - this project has suffered from the inability of the BOI and the JSC to provide adequate staffing. It is recommended that:  (1) the PC adopt an active role, including development of workplans; (2) the BOI develop a plan to show the benefits to be derived from the consultant-designed investment promotion program; (3) every effort be made to transfer responsibility for dialogue to the private sector JSC and to be more flexible in accepting study proposals; and (4) the TJACC be given resources adequate to retain staff and establish a revolving fund for feasibility studies.","Companion evaluation summary: PD-ABI-344","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","11/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Private sector|Investment promotion","Thailand","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAU650.pdf","1,151 KB","008613 - USAID.

"Evaluates Cooperative Agreement (CA) with the University of Florida to help USAID's and LDC's develop farming systems research and extension (FSR&E) programs.  Mid-term evaluation covers the period 1983-10/85 and is based on questionnaires to USAID's and project support entities (SE's), site visits, and interviews with project staff. Progress has been spotty, although improving in most areas. Response to Mission requests for TA has been quick and adequate, although the demand has been much less than expected.  Other support activities have varied in quality; e.g., a task force to develop a methodology for FSR projects has been set up without effective A.I.D. involvement.  Domestic workshops, while useful for networking A.I.D. and LDC personnel, have been of uneven quality and need to become more responsive to client and sponsor feedback.  (The current intent of project management is to focus on three priority applications modules and de-emphasize introductory workshops.)  Overseas workshops, which totaled 21, were administered very well in Latin America, but failed to address key issues in Africa. For the most part, these workshops seem to be a case of simply doing things rather than doing them well. The newsletter, bibliographies, and guidelines have generally been good to excellent, but represent a dispersion of staff effort and financial resources.  The annotation and distribution service performed by AID/PPC/CDIE has been slow and technically weak. Efforts to network U.S. universities and private firms concerned with FSR&E have been outstanding, especially the annual symposium held at Kansas State University, a subcontractor.  Overseas networking efforts have been exploratory, particularly in Africa, with current emphasis on commodity, animal, and university-based networks.  It is still unresolved whether the project should primarily aimed at creating networks or complementing those that exist.  Closer collaboration with A.I.D. and other SE's could have improved networking activities. State-of-the-art (SOTA) reports have been few and lacking in methodological rigor and comprehensiveness. In several vital areas - selection of SE's, selection of and participation in important task groups, determination of training and of SOTA priorities - the project's core management has often moved without the effective participation of A.I.D. and the SE's through the Technical Committee.  This is in part due to the fact that the CA for this collaborative project is vague in structure and in strategy.  Recent relations between the partners have been adversarial rather than collaborative - a condition which definitely needs improvement. Numerous recommendations are made.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","10/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Development program planning|Farming systems research|Agricultural extension|Technical assistance|Workshops|Information dissemination|Networks|Universities and colleges|Management operations|State-of-the-art reports|Private sector","Latin America|Africa","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAU093.pdf","9,592 KB","000180 - USAID.

"A.I.D's part in a massive emergency food program to combat the 1984-85 drought in Sudan - A.I.D. itself provided more than 800 MT of foodstuffs, mostly in western Sudan - is evaluated. Although the program critically benefited millions of people, its impact could have been greater.  A.I.D.'s plans to have foods in position prior to the rainy season failed, causing serious delays and shortfalls in food delivery.  Numerous unforeseen events then occurred which, due to lack of a contingency plan, further limited program effectiveness.  Timeliness was a continuing problem - 11 months or more elapsed between each USAID/S request and full distribution of the foods requested.  An added problem was the inability of other agencies and the host government to meet their obligations on time. Program management was good given the small and inexperienced USAID/S staff, AID/W's inflexible management system, and a decision to coordinate with other donors at the country level (thus placing the burden on USAID/S).  USAID/S effectively used the private sector, local governments, and private voluntary organizations (PVO's) in managing the program, a strategy that helped develop local food emergency capacities. On the other hand, USAID/S's failure to link the food emergency with long-term development led to very late rehabilitation responses. PVO's proved especially effective, but private contractors were reluctant to deliver food to remote areas.  Rural people, especially in those areas, received too little food and did not receive it when needed.  However, the program had reached even remote villages by 11/85, just as most of the neediest had exhausted their monetary and often their nutritional reserves. The program did substantially limit migration out of villages, but initiated supplemental feeding late and health inputs hardly at all.  Title II monetization in urban areas did not work well due to lack of distribution and financial controls. The U.S. strategy for 1986 - it will provide only 50% of the food needed - while sound, may prove unworkable.  The UN may be unable to take up the slack, and the size of the 1985-86 Sudan harvest is completely uncertain. The report includes both general and specific recommendations and several detailed annexes.","FVA also published this same document in July 1986|Later ed.: PN-AAL-093","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-1406-I-05-4162-00","","","","Emergency food distribution|Disaster relief|Drought|Famine|Management operations|Disaster planning|Rural areas|Private voluntary organizations|Beneficiary count|Beneficiary interviews","","","","006434 - Devres, Inc.","","002672 - USAID.

"Evaluates a community development project implemented in the South Pacific nation of Tuvalu by Save the Children Federation (SCF). External evaluation covered the period 1980-85 and is based on site visits and interviews with Government of Tuvalu (GOT) officials, SCF personnel, and a sample of beneficiaries. SCF has had a marked impact in improving the water supply in project communities on all eight Tuvalu atolls and has also significantly increased income generation, a factor which has abetted local development overall.  The project has also been responsible for less extensive improvements in food production and nutrition, transportation, and village development.  More importantly, the project has benefited all communities equally, with only minor exceptions.  Project management has generally been solid.  SCF field workers are competent, and the organizational structure of Tuvalu Field Office appears well suited to project needs and environment.  Much of the project's success can be attributed to the excellent cooperative relationship between the GOT and SCF. SCF's activities have been highly visible, a factor which has contributed to increased community awareness, especially of physical development.  SCF has played a significant role in supporting physical planning and site design in several communities, thus addressing an important perceived need.  The capacity for local organization has also improved as a direct result of SCF activities, particularly on the large-scale water project, and new skills and technologies have been internalized and replicated.  Despite all these advances, however, breadth of participation in development planning has not progressed much. On the negative side, implementation methods have not always been appropriate.  (1) Although SCF has provided its field workers regular training which has frequently involved community leaders and other development workers, some weaknesses exist and need to be addressed. (2) SCF's emphasis on implementing projects on a national scale has frustrated communities which choose to deviate from the national norm for progress.  (3) There are relatively few linkages to outside resources, especially when compared to local resource mobilization.  (4) Implementation of the Island Development Plan (IDP) process is disappointing, although its benefits are widely appreciated at the local and central levels. Recommendations are, inter alia, that SCF:  increase community responsibility for development and involvement in policymaking; work through established local groups; continue to promote income generation and household gardening; increase focus on problems to benefit youth; and put more effort into revitalizing the IDP process.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","10/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Community development|Community participation|Private voluntary organizations|Beneficiary interviews|Sampling method","Tuvalu","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAU488.pdf","8,455 KB","004984 - South Dakota State University.

"Evaluates project to strengthen the capacities of selected Egyptian urban governorates, districts, and PVO's to implement development subprojects (SP's).  External evaluation covers the period through 1/85 and is based in part on interviews with personnel of USAID/E, the Government of Egypt (GOE), and the TA contractor, Wilbur Smith and Associates. The project has been tremendously successful in implementing district and governorate SP's.  Some 80% of the funds allocated to districts have been disbursed and almost 800 SP's have been completed; many others are in progress and there is no doubt that the target of 950 SP's will be surpassed.  Special projects - chosen by governorates, but largely administered by districts - account for 42% of district funding (up from 22% at the time of the previous evaluation in 12/83).  These special projects are for road paving, sidewalks, solid waste management, office equipment, and equipment maintenance. About 1,000 PVO SP's have been initiated or completed and it is expected that ultimately 75% of the 1,600 eligible PVO's will receive grants averaging $8,000 - project plans had called for 2,500 PVO's to receive $4,000 each.  More importantly and in a marked change from the 12/83 evaluation, a wide variety of PVO's in terms of size and type have received support.  Also, an important funding change has occurred in the PVO category:  $1 million (or 10% of PVO funding) has been reserved for four large community centers, one in each of the project governorates. This, along with the increased emphasis on special district SP's, shows a definite trend toward providing support at the governorate level rather than at the lower levels as originally planned. Training is behind schedule, with implementation only now getting underway.  The nine courses which have begun (five for GOE and four for PVO personnel) seem relevant; cases are drawn directly from project experience.  Attendance is a problem, however, (running at about 50%) and it is difficult to ensure that the courses will reach those engineers directly involved in SP implementation.  Nor is it clear that the GOE will continue the training when the project is finished. In other areas, problems of GOE incentive and maintenance funds remain, but there has been progress in these areas.  Local officials' attitudes toward the project have become more positive, while both USAID/E and TA personnel are now more realistic and better informed about the problems of urban Egypt. Finally, the project still lacks specific targets for local capacity building and decentralization. Targets should be negotiated with the GOE during planning for the next round of SP's and incorporated into the phaseover to a successor project or projects.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Urban development|Local level|Institution building","Egypt","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAU560.pdf","227 KB","000673 - International Science and Technology Institute, Inc.

"Evaluates project designed to integrate primary eye care (PEC) into an ongoing AID-supported primary health care (PHC) scheme in the Bicol region of the Philippines.  External evaluation covers the period through 9/84 and is based on site visits and interviews with personnel of the implementing agency, Helen Keller International (HKI). Project implementation has been sound, especially in developing low-cost training methods and materials suited to the Philippine context.  Focus has been on basic training of village health workers. This training has been conducted primarily by educators, not health professionals.  One manual has been translated into the local language. The project uses an ad hoc surgical referral service, rather than trying to expand hospital-based surgical services.  It hopes to create a grassroots constituency for eye care that will demand such services (especially cataract extraction) in rural areas. Overall, the ""vertical"" project has been well-integrated into the existing ""horizontal"" PHC system and seems to have helped improve it.  Resources allocated by the Ministry of Health (MOH) for eye care seem appropriate for the demand, and the MOH does not appear to be distracted from other duties by project activities.  On the contrary, the PEC training appeared to strengthen the general clinical skills and confidence of peripheral health care workers. The training program should be continued and expanded to new areas (e.g., Panay).  However, attention should be given to:  (1) training host country counterparts to take over training and project management functions; (2) developing a health worker evaluation and monitoring system; (3) improving the availability of surgical services; and (4) developing a system for supplying drugs and supplies to the VHW's.  HKI is aware of these and other project needs.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","DPE-5927-C-00-3083-00","","11/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Primary health care|Eye care|Paramedical education|Rural areas|Limited data plus","Philippines","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAU588.pdf","1,900 KB","000750 - Management Sciences for Health (MSH)","","000186 - USAID.

"Evaluates project activity implemented by the National Academy of Sciences (NAS)/National Research Council (NRC) to promote Luso-American scientific cooperation by providing TA and training to Portugal's Junta Nacional de Investigacao Cientifica e Tecnologica (JNICT).  Internal evaluation covers the period 2/82-85 and is based on document review and responses to a questionnaire mailed to program participants. The program has established itself as being a quality activity. Seven in-country workshops have been conducted, with 234 Portuguese and 31 NAS/NRC participants; 26 Portuguese fellows have visited or studied in the United States; and 7 advisors have worked in Portugal with research institutions.  Positive signs of program impact emerged repeatedly in responses to the participant questionnaires.  JNICT participants are utilizing ideas, techniques, and knowledge gained through the workshops, and, in the case of the fellows, through specially-designed training programs. Credit for the progress and success of the program is due to the Portuguese leadership, the performance of the NAS, and to good Portuguese-USAID/P cooperation and flexibility in quickly addressing project challenges as they arose.  JNICT's ability to identify key individuals in promising areas of development has also contributed to the success of the program. It is recommended that the program be continued, even if A.I.D. support is not continued.  Other recommendations include:  (1) encouraging follow-up meetings for identification and design of key industrial development projects; (2) relaying the recommendations of the program;s final workshop to high-level policymakers; (3) distributing draft summaries of workshop findings and recommendations to all participants and to relevant key institutions and policymakers; (4) emphasizing JNICT's leadership in R&D and utilizing it to explore program modes other than formal workshops and to accelerate private sector development; (5) establishing and/or expanding professional societies and other human resource development mechanisms; and (6) providing certificates of accomplishment to the fellows.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","9/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Scientific cooperation|Technical cooperation|Educational networking|Beneficiary count|Beneficiary interviews|Limited data","Portugal","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAU620.pdf","325 KB","004741 - USAID.

"Summarizes an evaluation of Honduran and Gambian subprojects (SP's) to use mass media techniques to teach rural mothers the use of oral rehydration salts (ORS) - ""Litrosol"" in Honduras, a home preparation in The Gambia - and related nutrition/hygienic practices.  The evaluation, based mainly on longitudinal sample surveys of 750 mothers in Honduras and 1,000 mothers in The Gambia, showed that project strategies succeeded in changing health behaviors. (1) Most Honduran and Gambian mothers had access to radios and to health workers, and most Honduran women lived in literate households; in The Gambia, where household literacy is only 33%, women were taught through the radio and interpersonal channels to ""read"" pictorial flyers. (2) In Honduras, exposure to radio messages was 80% and to posters 40%.  Gambian mothers relied on several information channels:  75% had a mixing flyer, over 50% heard radio messages, 50% knew of the lottery (a contest rewarding correct ORS use), and health workers proved an important source of information. (3) In both SP's, mothers' knowledge of ORS rose sharply at first and then more gradually; the concept of dehydration proved difficult to understand, but there was some learning of how to treat its symptoms; and there was a general rise in knowledge of breastfeeding and of correct feeding during diarrhea.  Overall, learning mirrored the emphasis of the media campaign; when the campaigns focused on a particular issue, learning was high, only to subside when the messages stopped.  This indicates a need for sustained attention in health education efforts. (4) In both countries, diarrhea was common, levels of trying ORS were high, actual use increased continually, and most users prepared ORS correctly.  Some 36% of recent cases of diarrhea were treated with ORS in Honduras (where use was higher for younger children, those in more rural areas, and the more seriously afflicted) and 62% of cases in The Gambia (where use differed geographically, but not by age).  Changes in feeding during diarrhea also occurred, Honduran mothers giving more liquids but with no consistent increase in breastfeeding, Gambian mothers becoming less likely to withhold foods.  Over the life of the Honduras SP, more mothers reported breastfeeding young infants as a preventive measure. (5) Declines during both SP's in childen's nutritional and growth status were due to worsening economic conditions and in The Gambia to the 1983 drought (Gambian children showed increased wasting). Diarrhea-related mortality among under fives dropped in Honduras from 39.8% for the 2 years prior to the SP to 24.4% in the 2 years after it began.  Mortality data were not collected in The Gambia.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/DSPE-C-0028","","9/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Infant health care|Child health care|Disease prevention and control|Diarrhea|Oral rehydration therapy|Health education|IEC|Communications research|Mass media|Technology transfer|Technology adoption|Rural areas|Beneficiary count|Beneficiary interviews|Sampling method","Honduras|Gambia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAU722.pdf","1,269 KB","005034 - Applied Communication Technology","","000186 - USAID.

"Evaluates a reforestation project in Eastern Sudan to decrease soil erosion, supply firewood to refugees in Kassala Province, and upgrade the Forestry Department.  Mid term evaluation covers the period 11/83-7/85 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with forestry experts and beneficiaries. Achievements have been impressive overall.  (1) Fuelwood plantations have been established on 3,091 of 3,500 targeted feddans, excluding areas replanted due to high first year mortality.  (2) Some 317 feddans of planted and direct seeded shelterbelts (totaling 93 km) have been planted in mechanized farming areas; however, only 90 of these feddans are successfully established and the target of 2,000 feddans seems unattainable. (3) Extension activities have resulted in 250,000 trees planted in household compounds, mostly for shade and ornamental purposes. The trees are thriving - the survival rate is 50-70% and growth ranges from 70-100 cm/year - and have been nurtured through local contributions of watering and fencing.  (4) Nurseries, each with a capacity of 600,000 seedlings, have been established in two villages and have produced 1,800,000 seedlings, most of which have been of two species grown for plantations and shelterbelts; 16 different species are grown for the extension program. (5) A recently initiated improved stoves program of training and promotion has, in its first 9 months, produced and sold commercially more than 500 charcoal stoves.  (6)  The Forestry Department has been strengthened, and is now much more supportive of activities in extension, shelterbelts, and agroforestry; 14 government staff have been seconded to the department, 6 buildings constructed, and 20 vehicles provided. Expenditures have been higher than budgeted for almost all activities; also, plantation targets were increased and shelterbelt/agroforestry targets reduced without any budget adjustment, although the former is a costlier activity.  Major recommendations are to provide funding to cover budget shortfalls and expand/diversify extension activities. Several lessons have been learned.  (1) Refugees and rural Sudanese, even without land/tree tenure, will plant and maintain, often at great personal cost, trees that provide early benefits, e.g., shade, amenity, live fence, or food.  (2) Plantation techniques (subsoiling, crossfurrowing, microcatchments, weed control, mulching) can successfully establish trees in areas dryer than they usually grow. Species tested under varying conditions include Leucaena leucocephala under irrigation and as a compound tree and Parkinsonia sculeata as a dryland plantation species and a living fence.  (3) The OPG mechanism has been appropriate for the project.  CARE has provided timely TA and commodities.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","11/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Reforestation|Afforestation|Firewood|Beneficiary interviews","Sudan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAU777.pdf","1,470 KB","001203 - U.S. Dept. of Agriculture.

"Evaluates a project to expand and improve Jamaica's energy programs (Phase I) and support its private energy-related businesses and industries (Phase II).  Special evaluation covers the respective periods 9/81-11/85 and 7/83-11/85 and is based on document reviews and interviews with key personnel. Under Phase I, the Ministry of Mining, Energy, and Tourism's (MMET) Energy Division (ED) was to be strengthened by recruitment of a qualified, professional staff.  This purpose has still not been met due to a constant staff turnover attributed to a low Government of Jamaica (GOJ) salary scale and a lack of both career development opportunities and project job satisfaction. By contrast, the alternative energy component of Phase I is meeting expectations; notable achievements include:  establishing an Energy Center at College of Arts, Science, and Technology (CAST); establishing a demonstration center at Knockalva, with a second underway at Bodles; installing 20 solar- and wind-gathering stations (11 completed and 9 in progress); installing the revised target of 32 solar water heaters (vs. an original target of 24); and evaluating/investigating the potential of fuelwood and bagasse as renewable energy sources. The Phase I energy conservation component has also been successful, notably in its establishment of a public education program which exchanges information through seminars, communication media, and a fully equipped mobile unit; the training of energy auditors and their conduct of audits in excess of the number programmed; the retrofitting of private businesses' facilities; and the construction of energy conservation components below estimated costs. In Phase II, loan activity under the Energy Credit Fund (ECF) has remained relatively low due to a variety of factors such as the depressed state of the economy, a lack of incentive in the private sector for assuming non-productive financial burdens, delays in loan application processing, and the high duties placed on imported materials. The project should be completed 9/30/86 as planned, except for training, although completion of ED institutional strengthening could require an extension. Recommendations are to:  (1) reorganize ED, provide it loan funding to cover project implementation costs, and establish a professional salary structure to make ED competitive with other GOJ parastatals; (2) waive import duties on ECF foreign exchange-funded procurement; (3) make project extensions (other than for training and possible funding deobligations) subject to a favorable results of a planned 6/86 review of progress in project activities and disbursements; and (4) terminate the META Systems TA contract and focus future TA on short-term, highly specialized services.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","11/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Energy planning|Energy resource development|Institution building","Jamaica","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAU778.pdf","2,237 KB","004959 - Jamaica.

"Evaluates project to provide Latin American and Carribbean countries with access to U.S. National Technical Information Service (NTIS) products and services.  External evaluation covers the period 1981-84 and is based on site visits and interviews with project personnel and beneficiaries. Results have been mixed.  The project has succeeded in encouraging private sector use of NTIS.  About 54% of users are small to midsize businesses looking for practical solutions to problems caused by, e.g., excess manufacturing capacity.  It is estimated that each $100,000 of technical information services results in 100 private sector applications, of which 50 are of the ""hands on"" variety. On the negative side, product costs, language and technology problems, and lack of aggressive marketing strategies have kept the project from achieving targets to increase volume of sales, achieve self-sufficiency, and expand its range of services. NTIS' potential for disseminating large amounts of technical information remains unfulfilled because of a drop in demand for services due to devaluation of local currencies during 1981-84. NTIS document pricing (prices are high even without a strong dollar) has further complicated the problem of generating large sales of a product (highly technical documents written in English) which is necessarily of interest to only a select group of customers.  Further, document delivery time is slow, and in-country NTIS network agencies have little incentive to actively promote the products (marketing to A.I.D. Missions and projects is particularly weak).  As a result, hopes for self-sufficiency are impossible to meet.  The project receives a 6-16% return on the dollar in the countries on which it focuses, and 22-38% over the entire region.  Efforts to strengthen in-country network agencies have met with only moderate success; more private sector agencies should be included. Plans to expand the project's range of services have been only partially fulfilled as the necessary technology is just now arriving in Latin America and the Caribbean.  For example, both on-line access and CARINET electronic mail service for document ordering depend on telecommunications with packet switching, which is available only in limited areas of Costa Rica, Honduras, and Panama.  Similarly, document sales would be boosted by the use of low-cost, reliable fiche to paper printers, which are only now coming onto the market. The NTIS project will require subsidy if it is to continue.  This approach should be taken if A.I.D. is convinced that the project can effectively promote technology transfer with positive economic impacts and/or promote the sale of U.S. products and services (including information products and services).","","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-1406-I-00-4052-00","","10/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Databases|Technical information|Scientific information|Technology transfer|Information dissemination|Transborder data flow|Beneficiary interviews","Latin America|Caribbean","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDCAR024.pdf","2,049 KB","000223 - Academy for Educational Development, Inc.

"Evaluates project, implemented by the Salvation Army World Service Office (SAWSO), to improve primary health care (PHC) in rural areas of Pakistan.  External evaluation covers the period 1982-4/84 and is based on site visits, interviews with project personnel, and document review. The project is an innovative approach to transforming the basic orientation of existing dispensaries and health workers from curative to preventative, and has successfully emphasized the importance of PHC outreach in rural areas.  Even so, there are some areas of concern:  for example, the project has had trouble recruiting Pakistani managers; none of the top full-time staff and only one of the project's four nurses-in-charge are Pakistani.  Another problem has been the considerable commuting expense incurred by village health workers (VHW's), who should live near the villages they serve, but do not.  The project is currently making considerable effort to strengthen VHW training and supervision. Two other problems - insufficient cooperation with local Ministry of Health (MOH) officials and inadequate documentation of project results - must be remedied if the project is to be replicated by the MOH.  The project should revise its information system from the village level up; further expansion should be deferred unless better results by VHW's are documented. While communication with USAID/P has been adequate, A.I.D.'s monitoring role has been negligible.  The project would be strengthened if USAID/P were able to monitor progress in a few key areas (e.g., nationalization of management) and ensure cooperation with other relevant A.I.D. projects.  The responsibilities of A.I.D. officers in Washington and Islamabad need to be clarified. It is recommended that A.I.D. continue its matching grant funding to the SAWSO, preferably for 5 years rather than 3, and that the project should be expanded gradually and cautiously (if at all) while the problems identified in this evaluation are being solved.  Both SAWSO and A.I.D. should be satisfied that current approaches can achieve project objectives (which have recently been revised) and are low enough in costs to be replicable.

"Summarizes the findings of eight evaluations of PVO health and nutrition projects supported by centrally funded matching grants (MG's). The evaluations were conducted in 1983-84 by external teams in close collaboration with PVO staff members. Despite formidable socioeconomic constraints and the difficulties noted below, all 8 projects have succeeded in providing modern, low-cost health services such as oral rehydration, immunization, and blindness prevention in some of the world's poorest, most neglected, and most remote areas.  While the impact of these services on morbidity and mortality is less evident due to insufficient baseline or monitoring data, 2 of the projects have dramatically reduced child malnutrition and at least 4 have shown intermediate indicators of impact on maternal and child health. More generally, PVO's often try new approaches which require an independence and creativity not found in public sector projects, and are able to test and demonstrate imaginative, cost-effective primary health care strategies due to the hard work of their dedicated staff and their ability in some projects to work closely with beneficiaries in small, focused interventions. PVO management needs improvement, however.  Plans for the MG's are often vague, drawn up hastily, and lacking in understanding of local conditions and in local input; also, MG's should be more rigorously reviewed by A.I.D.  Pressure on PVO's to show early results (with MG's up for renewal every 3 years) leads to an emphasis on immediate improvements in health delivery rather than on the collaborative institutional development which could lead to long-term sustainability and replicability. Improvements in monitoring and information collection/dissemination are also needed.  PVO health information systems are usually rudimentary. In addition, most of the projects have been ineffective in documenting and replicating their innovative experiences. Lessons learned at the local level often remain there because PVO's, USAID's, and host country entities are not sharing project information. For its part, A.I.D. needs to:  clarify, simplify, and facilitate the responsibilities of AID/W and USAID's in approving, monitoring, and evaluating PVO programs; give PVO's adequate time to plan and to achieve realistic objectives; and in particular, pay attention to specific PVO activities, often neglected, which could improve program institutionalization, sustainability, and replicability. The general recommendation is that PVO's expand their health and nutrition outreach activities and that A.I.D. expand, selectively and with certain conditions, its MG support.

"Evaluates program to develop a replicable mechanism to co-finance pre-investment feasibility studies for private, for-profit enterprises in LDC's.  Midterm evaluation covers the period 9/82-5/85 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with key personnel and participants in Pakistan, Costa Rica, and Malawi, where over half the approved studies were conducted. The program is not ready to be replicated and needs further development on a pilot scale.  On the positive side, the implementation structure and procedures were adequate for the program's size.  Over 300 requests were answered on a timely basis, over 75 files were opened, correspondence was exchanged in 42 cases, and of the 17 studies approved, 16 were carried out. However, permanent financing has not taken place in any of the 16 approved projects and, of these, 7 are known to have been abandoned by the sponsors.  Further, administration of the program from Washington hindered communication with LDC entrepreneurs and opened the door for consultant-driven studies. Eligibility criteria were not always clear to applicants nor to the Mission personnel handling private sector initiatives. Communications with the field were uncertain and character and management verification were difficult.  Finally, the program operated in relative isolation from local financial institutions. No completed feasibility study was taken to a local bank by the Bureau for Private Enterprise (PRE).  Prior commitments by financial institutions were usually weak or missing altogether. Several conclusions were drawn.  (1) The program is not serving LDC entrepreneurs and should be redesigned to stress small, incremental studies in 2-3 countries with active private sectors. (2) The program is inconsistent with established business practices and so does not meet the needs of private sector clients.  It should be administered by intermediate credit institutions (ICI's) in each country.  Loan origination from PRE's Office of Investments should not be a prime program objective.  (3) There is a real demand for feasibility study and investment brokerage assistance, but it is not being met. USAID's should play a direct role in designing feasibility study programs tailored to country conditions, and should help participating ICI's expand investment banking activities. Program experience shows that:  (1) a Washington-based administrative structure is inappropriate for a program targeting LDC entrepreneurs; and (2) the program's design was more suited to the investment style of donors and other governmental organizations than the needs of the private sector.  In the redesign of this and similar programs, the information needs of and procedures used in the private sector need to be more carefully considered.","Related document: PD-ABJ-954, PD-FAK-027","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","5/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Development finance|Investment promotion|Private enterprises|Technical assistance|Feasibility studies|Beneficiary interviews|Cost sharing","Malawi|Pakistan|Costa Rica","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAV066.pdf","3,769 KB","000833 - Robert R.

"Evaluates project to provide in-country and U.S. training to Costa Rican private sector personnel.  External midterm evaluation covers the period 9/84-6/85; is based on interviews with project personnel and participants and on document review; and focuses on the institutional capacity of CINDE-PROCAP, the local implementing institution. CINDE-PROCAP, the training arm of the Costa Rican Coalition of Development Initiatives (CINDE), has made an impressive start.  A substantial amount of in-country training has been conducted, on schedule, in all sectors related to export expansion and foreign exchange; a total of 745 persons have been trained through 24 in-country sessions.  Trainees have expressed a high level of satisfaction with the courses. CINDE-PROCAP's strong performance is the result of the hard work and professionalism of its staff of four.  Each training course has been based on a study of industrial sector, company, and individual needs, and training contractors and trainees have been carefully screened. CINDE-PROCAP has demonstrated management competence in meeting all A.I.D. requirements, and has served 190 companies at the modest cost of $1,208 per person-month of training - 64% of which has been contributed by trainees or their companies.  The project could become self-sustaining if the quality of courses remains high. There is some concern that CINDE-PROCAP might overextend itself: indications are that CINDE-PROCAP is not exerting sufficient control over the performance of instructors of in-country training nor exploiting course evaluations. As for participant training, confusion about where management reponsibility for the program lies has hampered start-up; much of the confusion is due to inconsistencies in project documentation. Awaiting the results of this evaluation, AID/W has not yet issued a request for proposal to obtain U.S. contractors for administering U.S. training. However, CINDE-PROCAP has further demonstrated its understanding of A.I.D. policies and procedures as well as its capability to monitor the contractors by going ahead with:  planning training specifics with Costa Rican institutions; verifying the existence of qualified trainees for U.S. training to avoid later delays (only 30 will receive long-term U.S. training, while 394 will receive short-term training); devising a set of participant regulations based on A.I.D. Handbook 10; and ensuring that a trainee's absence will not negatively affect his organization. Twelve recommendations are provided for USAID/CR, AID/W, and CINDE-PROCAP.","Work order no. 18","Special Evaluation","Documents","OTR-0000-I-00-3506-00","","9/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Personnel development|Management training|Business support services|Participants|Private sector|Beneficiary count|Beneficiary interviews","Costa Rica","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAV549.pdf","1,605 KB","000302 - Booz, Allen and Hamilton, Inc.","","008533 - USAID.

"Final Mission report on a project (4/74-6/85) to help the Pakistan Agricultural Research Center (PARC) establish a centrally-coordinated program of agricultural research in major commodities. After early implementation difficulties requiring project redesigns and extensions, the project was successfully completed. Along with restructuring the PARC to help it set policy and a research agenda, key project accomplishments include: construction and equipping of the National Agricultural Research Center (NARC) and of nine specialized research laboratories thereat; training of 282 researchers, engineers, and NARC administrators in nondegree, M.Sc., and Ph.D programs in Pakistan and abroad; conduct of nationally coordinated research programs in crops, livestock, soil science, water management, etc.; development and implementation of a methodology for genetic improvement of wheat, rice, and maize; five reports on farming systems for wheat, rice, and oil crops; testing of research findings through on-farm trials and extension activities; establishment of a station development and Farm Operations Division, a system for providing technical support to researchers, and efficient interaction with provincial research centers and universities.  Farm yields for key commodities have increased significantly. Unplanned positive project results include:  substantial funding and TA from other donors; good linkages with international research institutions; extensive research publications in English and pamphlets in Urdu for farmers; establishment of a technology transfer unit which fosters farmer-researcher links and sponsors farmer training; and effective information dissemination, documentation, and audiovisual services. The project's success is due to A.I.D.'s refusal to give up on the project, despite initial poor performance, and its willingness to adjust project design to local conditions. Follow-up activities to consolidate project achievements and, in particular, extend them to provincial research institutes, are funded under the Management of Agricultural Research and Technology (3910489) and Transformation and Integration of Provincial Agricultural Network (3910488) projects.  Despite the project's success, improvements are needed in several areas: better control over TA and training; more funding for research and higher salaries; improved research planning, coordination, and evaluation; strengthened linkages among research institutes (in-country and abroad), with extension and educational agencies, and directly with small farmers.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","6/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural research|Research centers|Agricultural extension|Research management|Institution building","Pakistan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAV891.pdf","306 KB","008588 - USAID.

"Presents final Mission report on a project (1979-85) to increase the availability and use of fertilizer in India. The project has been successfully completed, its purpose and objectives achieved.  Although only 225,807 MT of fertilizer were imported under the project (representing only 2.79% of India's total fertilizer imports during the period 1981-85), the project helped the Government of India (GOI) to substantially improve fertilizer distribution.  Three key strategies were utilized: (1) expansion to 104 districts of an earlier Intensive Fertilizer Promotion Campaign (including inter alia, demonstrations, farmer training, and opening of new warehouses); (2) increasing the number of retail outlets; and (3) development of a system of transport subsidies to ensure that fertilizer was delivered to block headquarters, though without disrupting existing distribution and marketing arrangements.  Overall, the number of retail outlets in campaign districts grew by about 46% and consumption by about 51%.  Distribution to block headquarters increased about 67%. A.I.D. has decided that in the immediate future it is not likely to support resource transfer projects such as this in India.  The success of this project, and its record of making disbursements ahead of schedule, should be noted, however.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Fertilizers|Rail transportation|Road transportation|Subsidies|Imports|Agricultural extension|Transportation infrastructure|Transportation facilities|Sales promotion|Warehouses|Retail marketing|Limited data","India","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAV892.pdf","389 KB","008557 - USAID.

"Evaluates grant to the National Association of Partners of the Americas (NAPA) to establish a ""Women:  Partners in Development"" (WPID) program to improve the lives of poor Latin American and Caribbean women. Midterm evaluation covers the period through 1982-84 and is based on document review, visits to local partnerships and seed money grant sites, and interviews with participants and officers. In general, WPID has been successful both in quantifiable objectives and at the programmatic level.  Already, 146 of a targeted 160 travel grants have been awarded to NAPA volunteer professionals; these volunteers have provided direct TA to individuals and groups, developed important institutional linkages, and helped to focus NAPA projects on women's issues. WPID has also held a total of five project development workshops and regional workshops, which have effectively facilitated idea exchange, trained participants in project development methodologies, strengthened women's role in local partnerships, and, in one case, transferred a low-cost appropriate technology for rural women. In addition, seed grants of $5,000 or less have been made to 22 ground-level development projects, most of which have emphasized food production and income generation. The major quantifiable shortfall has been in providing informal U.S. fellowships to community education professionals.  Only 2 of a planned 9 fellows have been identified and neither has yet begun the program because of difficulty in arranging one or two months of leave. Programmatically, good progress has been made in integrating WPID into the NAPA organizational structure, yet two major constraints remain:  (1) NAPA's lack of a standard project analysis, monitoring, and evaluation system that incorporates women's concerns; and (2) a perception that the WPID office exists mainly to administer the A.I.D. grant and its own seed grants rather than to coordinate all of NAPA's Women In Development funds and activities.  Also, while WPID's emphasis on agriculture and income generation has helped to focus efforts during the initial stages of program development, more attention to other development areas, such as family health, nutrition, and family planning, will also help to further WPID's fuller integration into the NAPA structure.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","OTR-0300-C-00-4391-00","","4/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Grants|Women in development|Food production|Income generation|Private voluntary organizations","Latin America|Caribbean","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAV871.pdf","2,114 KB","","","000164 - USAID.

"Evaluates the International Benchmark Sites Network for Agrotechnology Transfer (IBSNAT) project to utilize computer technology to develop a systems approach for transferring agricultural technology. Mid-term external evaluation covers the period 8/82-8/85 and is based on site visits and document review. Project performance overall has been very good.  IBSNAT has procured a commercial database management system (DMS) and has identified the minimum data set (MDS) needed to verify and validate crop models using the DMS.  The wheat, maize, and soybean models which existed prior to IBSNAT have been adapted to fit the DMS, while models for rice and sorghum are under development and should be operational in about a year. IBSNAT's modeling work has been outstanding, despite some negative factors:  the crop models' failure to take diseases and insect damage into account; slow progress in developing cassava and other root crop models; and variability in the quality of the data received from collaborators. Also outstanding has been IBSNAT's work to develop networks of international collaborators; to date, 29 institutions (20 of which are in developing countries) are participating.  However, it is very important that more training, case studies, and on-site applications be conducted to more fully develop the capabilities of the LDC collaborators.  Information dissemination activities have been adequate; IBSNAT produces a variety of periodicals and other publications, but needs to produce more ""user friendly"" material that reaches non-technical audiences. IBSNAT management has been above average, though hampered by lack of control over the performance of collaborators, competing A.I.D. demands on staff time, and inadequate office space. Despite accelerating changes in systems analysis and information technology, IBSNAT's objectives remain valid.  The probability of meeting these objectives is high if the project is extended to 1991. Other recommendations are to, inter alia:  (1) improve data acquisition activities, (2) include disease and insect factors in crop models, and develop a model for millet; (3) provide hands-on training and TA to collaborators in MDS collection, experimental layouts, etc; (4) expand publication activities; (5) and establish a Management Review Group to guide IBSNAT strategic planning.","Companion project evaluation summary: PD-AAZ-060","Special Evaluation","Documents","DAN-4054-C-00-2071-00","","10/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural technology|Agricultural research|Research collaboration|Computer technology|Technology transfer|Simulations|Computer networks","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAW099.pdf","1,392 KB","000559 - University of Hawaii at Manoa.

"Evaluates project to provide U.S. participant training to Black South Africans.  External evaluation covers the period 1979-85 and is based primarily on interviews with 30 new participants and 40 alumni/ae. Some 290 men and women have studied in U.S. universities under the project.  Participants were adequately equipped for U.S. study due in part to successful orientation programs in South Africa and at Denison University.  In general, participants responded successfully to the challenges of a foreign system of higher education and built highly satisfactory academic records; several contributed to the quality of student life at their institutions. Exposed to courses, readings, and technology unavailable to them in South Africa, participants reported that they had expanded their knowledge significantly.  They extolled the quality of instruction and the character of faculty-student dialogue in U.S. colleges and universities. In general, participants were highly satisfied with their U.S. sojourns.  Numerous psychological benefits were cited, including increased self-confidence, a stronger sense of intellectual competence, and a heightened sense of their South African identity.  Inhibitions about working with whites in egalitarian relationships diminished markedly.  Contacts with U.S. students and with those from other African nations contributed to participants' social and cultural enrichment as well, and in the latter case, increased their appreciation of Black African traditions and values. Upon returning to South Africa, most participants found positions commensurate with their training and compatible with their career objectives.  For some, however, the job search was protracted and demoralizing; the intervention of a project or corporate connection was sometimes influential.  Returned participants neither adopted elitist attitudes, nor did they show evidence of retreat from community obligations or family responsibilities. Only nine of the 290 students withdrew before completing their degrees - one for academic failure; six for emotional, cultural, or family reasons; and two because they found their academic programs incompatible with their career objectives. Recommendations are to:  (1) enlarge the administrative capacity of the implementing organization; (2) monitor the progress of undergraduates and anticipate their problems (the suitability of undergraduates for study abroad is a subject of debate among graduate-level participants and alumni/ae); (3) explore means of funding travel for participants' spouses and children; (4) maintain an ongoing evaluation of participants and alumni; and (5) increase the number of students admitted annually.

"Evaluates a Phase II project to support irrigated agriculture, cooperatives, and other development activities in and around Tara, Niger.  Evaluation covers the period 8/83-6/85 and is based on site visits, document review, and interviews with involved personnel. Progress has generally been good.  The irrigated perimeter is operational, and while there have been some problems with water management, farming practices, extension, maintenance, and applied research, the perimeter appears to be economically viable (despite mounting operating costs).  The rice co-op is paying most of the production costs and is fairly up to date in credit repayments; it has become increasingly independent from the project, but needs additional help with management, literacy, numeracy, and marketing.  Training is also needed to improve water management by both co-op members and project staff (including TA specialists). The Women's Poultry Co-op is less far along in self-management, but its egg sales are still profitable, despite poultry management difficulties, misunderstandings with project staff, and the rising input costs.  Training/TA is needed in co-op management, financial principles, literacy, and marketing options. Problems have arisen with the Fishermen's Co-op sections in Tondika and Momboy Tounga, as fishing is becoming less profitable.  If the sections are to be maintained, credit rescheduling and additional training/TA will be needed. The Artisan's Co-op has been on hold because of faulty design assumptions and the limited sources of supply for needed materials; this component should be redesigned to stress group savings on inputs rather than cooperative production or marketing. Overall, AFRICARE's TA and project management have been reasonably successful, despite delays in start-up, a drought, design flaws, and shortcomings in TA.  More back-up TA should have been provided and greater decentralization of management (from Washington to Niamey to Tara) implemented.  Working with Nigerien government (GON) staff has been largely successful, but TA in monitoring and personnel management should be provided to the GON Project Director. In the time remaining, AFRICARE and USAID/N should sharpen project focus, reinforce successes, and assist in a real transition from project to co-op management. use should be made of expertise from other A.I.D. or other donor projects.  AFRICARE should try in increase its core staff in Niamey, and should improve data collection and analysis to ensure that project lessons learned are identified.

"Evaluates project in Somalia to test and implement strategies for increasing refugee self-reliance.  Interim evaluation covers 12/82-11/85. The project has achieved only modest success - fewer subprojects (SP's) than planned have been undertaken, and economic benefits to refugees have been limited by drought and by delays in SP's. The number of targeted beneficiaries has been approached for some activities, however, and the project has had great utility as a groundwork for future planning.  Improved relationships with PVO's, training of a significant number of Somalis in development management, and increased policy dialogue with the Somali government (GSDR) are also among its accomplishments. SP's in agriculture, skills training, and infrastructure were undertaken in and around refugee camps by four PVO's:  Experiment in International Living, Save the Children Federation, New Transcentury Foundation, and Partnership for Productivity. Agricultural activities are on a smaller scale than planned in both rainfed and irrigated land. Seeds, tools, and tractor services have been provided, but a system of refugee cost-sharing has not yet been instituted.  One SP trained five extensionists, and there has been intensive work with refugees in horticulture. The one SP involving irrigation is unlikely to meet its targets due to problems with internal management, subcontractor work, procurement, and unresolved land tenure issues. Training has focused on agricultural, commercial management, and project management skills.  Future training in productive skills will need to be accompanied by some sort of access to capital so businesses can be started.  In infrastructure, refugee wage labor has been used to upgrade roads, and work involving water structures is planned.  These efforts should be continued, but more emphasis should be put on training refugees in productive skills that will transfer to a non-camp environment. Institutional support to GSDR's National Commission for Refugees (NCR) has had only limited success, and project-supported socioeconomic and technical studies of refugee programs have been little used. Lastly, the project has been much more management intensive than expected; this has drawn resources from field operations. Among the lessons learned are:  the subgrant mechanism is appropriate where flexibility is important, but requires much management effort; joint SP funding needs to be better planned and coordinated so as to avoid delays in the whole project resulting from one donor's problems; relief efforts do not necessarily build self-reliance; and long-term goals should be based on refugee input and support the refugees' own initiatives. A 1-year extension is recommended.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","12/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Refugee relief|Economic self sufficiency|Pilot projects|Agricultural production|Technical training|Public works","Somalia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAY140.pdf","7,061 KB","008604 - USAID.

"PACR for project (9/81-9/85) to introduce renewable energy technologies in rural Botswana. Results are disappointing.  The project was able to identify, develop, and test appropriate technologies, and the technical competence of the TA staff was excellent, but the project's rural bias, its relatively poor focus on economic considerations, and its inability to successfully alter a poorly conceived project paper made it impossible to reach all objectives by the end of the project. For example, the PP's original emphasis on two pilot villages limited the project's ability to consider regional or national replicability, and limited as well its flexibility to act on recommendations, made in the midterm evaluation, to emphasize those issues.  Implementation was further hampered by an ambiguous management structure, in which responsibility was shared by project staff and the Botswana Technology Center.  This relationship, until removed after the midterm evaluation, seriously hurt the ability of the contractor to implement the project. In addition, not enough effort was made by either the contractor or the Government of Botswana (GOB) to incorporate project activities into ongoing GOB institutions. The project's management problems and its failure to address key economic and marketing issues teach several valuable lessons. First, Missions should be prepared to support projects involving technology development and field replication for at least five years; since this project was a pilot effort, there was no room in the USAID/B portfolio for a follow-on activity.  Second, this project demonstrates that in technology projects technical concerns should not outweigh economic, replication, and market issues.  Third, management arrangements should obviously be clearer than in this project, and cross-cutting responsibilities should be avoided.  Management concerns also extend to the selection of Chiefs-of-Party, whose managerial qualifications should be as strong as their technical credentials.  Ultimately, though, this project's failure teaches that energy projects limited specificially to renewable energy technologies should never be financed by A.I.D. Projects which examine specific activities and end uses, and which are not limited to renewable energy, could be considered if adequate attention has been given to economic and institutional barriers. For information on the project's technologies and outputs, see the abstracts of the final contractor report (PD-AAW-030) and the final evaluation (XD-AAR-147-A).","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Pilot projects|Renewable energy resources|Alternative energy technology|Energy research|Solar energy|Technology transfer|Rural areas","Botswana","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAY127.pdf","805 KB","008516 - USAID.

"Evaluates OPG to the Florida Association of Voluntary Agencies for Caribbean Action (FAVA/CA) to promote Flordia-based volunteer efforts in Haiti and other parts of the Caribbean.  External evaluation covers 1983-85. FAVA/CA has made substantial progress in implementing OPG activities; it has prepared a resource directory, conducted bimonthly fora, sent over 100 speakers to public and private groups throughout Florida, published its newsletter (Communique) regularly and initiated the smaller Monthly Highlights, developed a computerized resource system containing a volunteer skill bank and a system to match these skills with requests for help, and sponsored seminars in Haiti on public health, dentistry, and tuberculosis.  Two activities planned for FAVA/CA members - seminars/training and organizational development programs - have not materialized due to lack of demand. Despite these achievements, FAVA/CA has made only a modest contribution to development.  The number of volunteers who have actually provided service in Haiti or Belize during the past 3 years has been limited, as has the amount of resources and donations mobilized (with the exception of one very large donation) and the amount of cash and in-kind contributions to support operations.  There has been little or no follow-on to the early seminars in Haiti.  Further, FAVA/CA has not developed its programs and activities in response to A.I.D. requirements and interests; no FAVA/CA staff member has consulted with USAID/Haiti and few USAID/H project managers are aware of FAVA/CA or its potential services.  Additionally, relationships between FAVA/CA and its counterpart agency, the Haitian Association of Voluntary Agencies, soured notably in 1984 and 1985, though this was not wholly FAVA/CA's fault. In sum, despite some major strengths (its close association with institutions in Florida, its potential for mobilizing retirees and others for volunteer work, its positive image), FAVA/CA has revealed a number of distinct weaknesses:  lack of experience in LDC's and with donor agencies, lack of follow-up, a passive approach to providing and marketing services, the absence of a clearly definable constituency either at home or abroad, and inadequate planning.  The Association lacks the personnel, systems, and budget needed to implement the ambitious program planned for 1986.  Further, it has not demonstrated progress toward achieving the 50-50 counterpart contribution by the third year of the project. Although the evaluator did not make a specific recommendation whether A.I.D. should continue to support FAVA/CA or not, the Agency, upon reviewing the evaluation, decided (cf. PD-AAY-748) to provide only $75,000 to FAVA/CA through 9/86 as its final contribution.","Attached to PD-AAY-748","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-1096-I-03-5049-00","","12/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Private voluntary organizations|Volunteers|Financial resources","USA|Haiti|Caribbean","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAY748A.pdf","1,413 KB","006727 - Development Alternatives, Inc.

"PACR of a project (1979-1985) to assist the Government of Jamaica (GOJ) in expanding the freshwater fish industry by providing TA and training to extension agents and farmers in the production of tilapia. A TA team from Auburn University was successful in transferring scientific aquaculture technology to farmers and the GOJ's Inland Fisheries Unit.  Training, provided both in Jamaica and at Auburn, was appropriate and of high quality.  Five staff members completed degrees (1 Ph.D., 3 M.S., and 1 B.S.); another started a B.S., but was unable to complete it within the schedule. However, while the project did establish an inland freshwater fish-farming industry based on tilapia, it did not reach small famers, the intended project beneficiaries. While most production units created by the project are relatively small, many owners are medium-sized farmers or entrepreneurs for whom fish farming is one of several business ventures. The project also failed to establish a regional training program in fish production.  Courses promised and started by the University of the West Indies are not now available, with the exception of a six-week overview of aquaculture.  The Jose Marti Secondary School provided some training but is inadequate for a regional program, while another prospect, the Jamaica School of Agriculture, was closed in mid-project. Several lessons were learned.  (1) Tilapia farming has the potential to become a viable industry in Jamaica and in similar countries.  (2) In trying to develop an industry around smallholder production, a strategy must be developed early on to keep large farmers from seizing control. (3) Production is easier to set in motion than marketing, which must overcome social, cultural, and economic barriers.  (4) Aquaculture is such a relatively new and inexact science that new technology may replace existing technology very quickly.  (5) Most universities tend to neglect business issues (e.g., distribution and market demand).  (6) Project redirection necessitates environmental reassessment, especially when new technologies are involved.  (7) Government financial commitment should be obtained early in a project for activities that are not directly remunerative, such as research and training.","Evaluation period: June 1979-Aug 1985","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Tilapia|Aquaculture|Inland fisheries|Agricultural production|Fish culture|Technology transfer","Jamaica","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABA353.pdf","97 KB","008563 - USAID.

"The project was very successful in terms of its cooperative and institution-building aspects.  The number, range, and quality of the cooperative activities have exceeded the original expectations of the Israeli and Egyptian participants, in spite of the decline during this period of relations between their two nations. Success is due to the following factors, which largely mirror the appraisal criteria for such projects originally set forth by A.I.D.  (1) The project deals with real scientific and health problems of mutual concern.  These diseases spread across borders and call for continuing cooperation between neighbors.  The direct mutual advantages of such cooperation are significant and apparent.  (2) It is based primarily on cooperation between Israel and Egypt - not technical assistance from Israel to Egypt. (3) The project is institutionalized in both countries - in prestigious universities, one step removed from the government. Also in each country, the project involves researchers from other universities, ministries, and research organizations.  (4) It is perceived in both countries to be producing high quality scientific research of practical importance. The cooperation accomplishments of the project are significant. The highlights are two highly publicized conferences (in Egypt and Israel); a combined Israeli/Egyptian team's successful response to a small medical emergency in Egypt; workshops and lectures given at Ain Shams University by Israeli scientists; five jointly authored papers published in leading international journals; and a genuine creation and strengthening of a long- term network of personal and institutional scientific ties between Israel and Egypt.

"In 1961, when Sierra Leone became independent, the country had no facilities to train agriculturalists to the bachelors degree level and few if any Sierra Leoneans were obtaining such training overseas.  In order to address the need for trained manpower, the Government of Sierra Leone (GOSL) and A.I.D. established the Njala University College (NUC) in 1963.  For a decade, from 1963 to 1973, A.I.D. provided $4.5 million in grant funds to finance the provision of long-term expatriate faculty and the training of Sierra Leonean faculty in U.S. universities. In the 20 years since its founding, NUC has been extremely effective in pursuing the twin educational missions of providing scientifically trained agriculturalists and training teachers for rural schools - in particular teachers of rural science and of agriculture.  Njala graduates now occupy positions of responsibility in the Ministry of Agriculture and are engaged at many levels in research and extension activities.  Likewise, its graduates staff secondary schools and the faculties of the training colleges throughout the rural areas of Sierra Leone. The above achievements have been accomplished despite the fact that NUC's effectiveness has been increasingly constrained by an expanding admissions policy and by major decreases in budgetary resources.  NUC's physical plant is now so badly deteriorated and limited in capacity that parts of its educational, research, and outreach programs have been abandoned or drastically curtailed. Beyond the production and employment of its graduates within the education and agricultural sectors, NUC has had limited impact on the process of rural development in Sierra Leone.  In part this condition can be attributed to inadequate funding from the GOSL to support a strong research and extension program at NUC. However, a wider set of institutional practices and policies have also served to neutralize NUC's larger impact on the rural sector.  Thus, throughout the research and extension system, there is an increasing emphasis on adaptive research which relegates the researcher and extension agent to the testing of technical packages rather than on problem identification in the generation of solutions.  This approach, which has been adopted at the behest of major foreign donors, including A.I.D., is marginalizing the national research effort as it bypasses the direct link between researchers and farmers which is necessary for meaningful technology development. A major lesson from the NUC experience is that donor policies can seriously hamper the growth of a strong and effective agricultural college.  The lack of a long-term focus by donors on the development of NUC's institutional needs and linkages with the larger agricultural research and extension system, in addition to a concomitant donor emphasis on adaptive over problemsolving research, and capital over recurrent funding has served to constrain the performance and impact of NUC.

"Evaluates a project to provide rural women in Togo's Kara region with skills training, assistance in developing cooperatives, and nutrition education.  The project was implemented by the Government of Togo (GOT) and the National Council of Negro Women (NCNW). By the end of the project, 432 women had been trained in one of three income generating activities -- weaving, soapmaking, or gardening. Participants benefited from the improved quality of goods produced and increased income.  The project organized 21 women's groups and trained their officers and social agents in cooperative management techniques. Several groups received at least 1 training session in nutrition.  A training center capable of training 350 women per year was built and equipped, a curriculum was developed, and 7 instructors were trained. GOT project personnel received substantial on-the-job experience and gained the capacity to manage the project on their own. The project encountered several major implementation problems: long delays by both NCNW and the GOT in assigning project personnel; faulty construction designs and periodic shortages of funds for the training center; failure to assess the appropriateness and practicality of the proposed craft activities, due to inadequate background research; poor quality and bad timing of research studies; shortages of raw materials; and marketing difficulties.  The large geographic region covered by the project restricted supervision and follow-up training. Overall, the project goal of increasing the socioeconomic well- being of rural women in the Kara region was attained, but its impact was adversely affected by the lack of available production materials, the limited market, and the slow growth of the pre- cooperative groups. More training is needed, as well as more assistance in cooperative development.  Only a small effort has been made so far in nutrition education. The project permitted rural women to earn more income from their trades than they did using traditional production methods. However, the substantial amount of money invested in the project raises questions. The fact that the groups are encountering production difficulties but are not yet able to resolve the problems for themselves means that they will require much assistance from the GOT in the immediate future. Until these difficulties are resolved, no efforts should be made to identify and train new groups. Four key lessons were learned.  (1) The research studies should have been carried out prior to project approval so that the project could have incorporated the research findings.  (2) A closer look should have been taken at the role of women in the traditional structure in order to determine the best way to reach the target population.  (3) The three-year time frame did not allow sufficient start-up time as well as time to carry out project activities.  (4) The geographic region was too large, given the pilot nature of the project and the limited resources and personnel available.

"An analysis of 263 evaluation and of 45 Inspector General audit reports provides the basis for this review of the lessons learned from A.I.D.'s FY84 program experience. The evaluations and audit reports focused on five issues: compatibility with the host country environment; institutional and human resources development; design and implementation problems; sustainability; and technology transfer.  Key findings are as follows. (1) Most projects have been responsive to host government, country development, and U.S. needs. However, some have been incompatible with cultural and ethnic factors (factors sometimes unseen even by host governments); thus projects with national scope may be ineffective in important geocultural regions of a country.  (2) Institution building is widely viewed by USAID Mission personnel and increasingly by contractors as A.I.D.'s core function, and A.I.D. staff have become skilled in strengthening host country capabilities.  (3) Project design and monitoring systems are highly professional and in many respects effective, but have impeded both full realization of institution building and timely goal achievement; management and administrative problems from overall direction to logistics and finance have impeded project objectives.  (4) Sustainability has been inadequately emphasized. (5) The effectiveness of technology transfer has been mixed. Agriculture has posed the most serious problem, as many projects to raise small farm productivity are falling short of goals, in most cases because input delivery systems have not reached the great majority of rural families, but in some cases because farmers have rejected the new technologies. Delivery capabilities, technology acceptance, and community participation have been greater in health projects, but securing an acceptance of preventive medicine equivalent to that of curative services has proven difficult.  Also, in each case where the installation of potable water systems was successfully achieved, water consumption failed to increase.  In a number of countries, family planning is enjoying levels of acceptance and participation similar to primary health services.  Despite the superiority of new fuel-efficient stoves over traditional models, the new stoves have not yet been accepted, especially in African countries. Employment generation has not resulted from rural regional agro-industrial projects as expected.","Previous ed.: PD-AAR-863","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-0000-I-22-3077-00","","11/1/1985 12:00:00 AM","","Development project design|Development project implementation|Project sustainability|Technology adoption|Institution building|Personnel development|Project acceptance","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNACA375.pdf","2,421 KB","000436 - Development Associates, Inc.","","003433 - USAID.
