"<div>The Opportunities for Vulnerable Children (OVC) program represents a unique and highly commendable effort made by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) to bring children with disabilities into Indonesia's mainstream education settings in a substantive manner. &nbsp;The program -- which only cost USD 9.3 million in 10 years or USD 930,000 a year on average -- contributed significantly to strengthening the Indonesian enabling educational environment for children with disabilities, in the following ways: (1) building substantial government bureaucratic and political support for inclusion of children with disabilities; (2) spearheading the development of national policies, such as recognition of ""resource teachers"" as a legitimate category of service, and 22 subnational policies that operationalized the national inclusive education policies; (3) helping stakeholders to lobby for and legitimize the development of budgets to support inclusive education, which will allow inclusive education initiatives to be funded post-OVC; and (4) changing parents' and community attitudes about the rights of children with disabilities to an education. &nbsp;The above was achieved by well-targeted use of short-term technical experts and ongoing engagement of very knowledgeable program personnel who understand how to work with and within the existing systems. &nbsp;However, without strategic and selective external technical support for deepening and broadening OVC accomplishments, full realization of OVC program benefits is at risk. &nbsp;There is also a risk that inclusive education will remain synonymous with special education, rather than special education falling under the umbrella of a functional inclusive education system. &nbsp;USAID's Education Strategy Goal 1 will ensure that 150 million children worldwide become readers in the early grades; however, most early grade reading assessments have not taken children with disabilities into account in testing protocols, data disaggregation, or ensuing programming. &nbsp;If USAID is able to act on the opportunity for disability-sensitive programming that the OVC program introduced, Indonesia can provide a valuable model on which to build in order to bring children with disabilities into this broader group of 150 million children. &nbsp;Failure of the government and donor community to further to deepen and extend OVC program achievements would be a significant and regrettable ""missed opportunity."" &nbsp;(Excerpt, modified)</div>","Evaluated project title: Opportunities for vulnerable children (OVC)","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","AID-497-TO-13-00003|RAN-I-00-09-00008-00","","12/1/2013 12:00:00 AM","","","Indonesia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00JM2M.pdf","1,901 KB","040773 - GRM International|006007 - AMEX International, Inc.","","008558 - USAID.

"The child survival project ""Nehnwaa"" was implemented by Curamericas Global in Bain, Garr, Gbein Clans (subdistricts) and the town of Ganta in northwest Nimba County, in the north-central region of Liberia. &nbsp;The purpose of the evaluation is to determine the extent to which the Nehnwaa Child Survival Project (NCSP) met its coverage targets in key child survival and maternal health indicators determine which elements of the program contributed to achieving results, and determine best practices and lessons learned to guide future programs in Liberia and in other areas with poor and disadvantaged populations. &nbsp;Evaluation questions included : (1) to what extent did the Nehnwaa Child Survival Project accomplish and/or contribute to the following goals and objectives, as stated in the DIP:; (2) did the project&rsquo;s innovations decrease barriers to accessing health services:; and (3) how did the project further the goals of the MOHSW in its rebuilding of the Liberian health system? &nbsp;The evaluation used a participatory methodology that included mixed quantitative and qualitative methods and participatory consensus-building analytical methods followed by stakeholder debriefings with discussion at the project site and in Monrovia. &nbsp;The evaluation fieldwork followed the 30-cluster randomized Knowledge, Practice, and Coverage (KPC) survey of 300 beneficiary mothers of children under the age of 2 years and was led by an external evaluator with extensive experience evaluating similar programs. &nbsp;Findings are largely from self-report but were triangulated by data from key informant interviews, focus group discussions (FGDs), health facility and gCHV service statistics, and data from other surveys and reports. &nbsp;(Excerpt, modified)","'This project was funded .... through the Child Survival and Health Grants Program.'|Statement of differences by Curamericas Global  included in Annex XIII (Annex 13)|Project title: Nehnwaa child survival project (NCSP)","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","GHN-A-00-08-00011-00","","12/1/2013 12:00:00 AM","","","Liberia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACY377.pdf","2,563 KB","040698 - Jean Capps Associates Consulting|040697 - Curamericas Global, Inc.","","011222 - USAID.
