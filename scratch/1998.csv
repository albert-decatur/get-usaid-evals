"Evaluates the American International Health Alliance's (AIHA) partnerships program, designed to transfer U.S. medical knowledge and skills to partner institutions in the New Independent States (NIS) and Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries.  Evaluation covers the period 6/92-2/97 against a PACD of 12/98. Under AIHA's partnership model, which uses volunteers rather than paid consultants, an institution-to-institution focus, and a participatory, collaborative approach, the program has achieved important impact both overseas and in the United States.  Activities have been of two types: cross-cutting initiatives set up by AIHA in the areas of nursing, emergency medical services (EMS), neonatal resuscitation, infection control, and diabetes; and, at USAID's suggestion, initiatives in women's health, breast cancer, health management education, and healthy communities. The program has achieved impressive results in the NIS, moving with agility and effectiveness from clinical practice to broader management issues.  The program has stimulated the flow of medical knowledge and technology to NIS and CEE partner hospitals, led to knew ways of thinking on the part of doctors and nurses, and shown remarkable success in leveraging outside resources. Generally speaking, the NIS partnerships have been more successful than the CEE partnerships, perhaps because the CEE countries are more diverse in language, history, health systems, and challenges, and thus lend themselves less to treatment as a single region.  Hospital partnerships have been more successful than university partnerships. As expected, AIHA has had limited impact on health status, policy reform, and health systems. Unexpectedly, however, there is some evidence that replicability of programs (diabetes, EMS, neonatal resuscitation) has occurred in nonpartner hospitals, and that scaling up to broader systems (infection control, the training and role of nurses) has also occurred.  The potential for program sustainability would be even greater if AIHA were to help partners search for other funding sources and to build outside alliances.  The cross-cutting information technology initiative is critical to sustainability and should remain part of the program's strategy.  The initiative has disseminated lessons learned to all partners and provided important testing of curricula, protocols, and programs. There is a strong case for moving into another noncompetitive cooperative agreement (CA) with AIHA, although any such CA should be limited in scope to hospital-based activities, which are AIHA's predominant strength; broader-level efforts at systemic impact and sector reform should be pursued by a competitively procured, task order-type contract.  In addition, while AIHA has benefitted from strong entrepreneurial leadership, the organization should now work to evolve a more transparent and participatory management style that delegates more program and budget responsibility to regional offices and partnerships. Finally, USAID must resolve the issues that stem from the tensions between the R4 strategic objectives structure, with its firm requirement for field office accountability in the use of resources, and the new guidance on cooperative agreements, with its sharp limits on Washington and field project officers' involvement in the implementation of the CA with AIHA.

"Since 1956, the United States has provided Ethiopia, mainly via the Title II program, with $773 million in food aid.  The sum accounts for 28% of all food aid provided the East African country over the past 40 years. This report evaluates the economic, social, and political effects of this aid and identifies its principal beneficiaries. The impact of U.S. food aid to Ethiopia has varied over time.  During the reign of Emperor Haile Selassie (1930-74), assistance was small, adding on average less than 2% to the country's foreign exchange earnings.  But in late 1973, in response to a famine, USAID increased its allocation of Title II resources from $1 million to nearly $14 million.  Though thousands of lives were saved, at least 100,000 were lost.  Food insecurity eroded the stability of Haile Selassie's regime, but it would be difficult to prove that U.S. food aid had any significant political impact.  Whether earlier introduction of famine relief could have helped save or prolong the regime is uncertain. During Mengistu's Marxist-style regime (1974-91), food aid added somewhat more to the country's foreign exchange resources, but because of the political and economic environment did not contribute to sustainable economic growth.  The period 1982-92 saw famine and civil strife, and though malnutrition rates worsened, food aid most likely deflected even higher rates.  During 1984-86, U.S. food aid, provided mostly through PVOs, probably saved millions of lives.  However, for this period, food aid was used by both the government and (through a cross-border program) the various rebel factions, perhaps helping to prolong the conflict. For the period 1992-95, after the Mengistu regime was replaced by a transitional government, U.S. food aid accounted for 34% of the country's foreign exchange resources.  The transfer of agricultural commodities in that period helped jump-start Ethiopia's productive sectors, released money to support other development activities, and helped build the emergency food security reserve and the country's capacity to respond to a 1994 drought.  Food assistance also provided a basis for policy dialogue on economic liberalization and food security. Over the past 4 years, the nutritional status of children participating in food-assisted maternal and child health (MCH) programs has improved; food rations may have contributed indirectly to this change by motivating mothers to attend MCH activities (counseling, growth monitoring, and nutrition and health education). Lessons learned from the evaluation are that food aid can:  (1) help a country stabilize its economy and provide a basis for policy dialogue on issues critical to food security; (2) unintentionally prolong civil conflict, even when the sole purpose of the aid is humanitarian relief; (3) indirectly contribute to improving children's nutritional status by stimulating mothers' participation in MCH programs; and (4) be an important vehicle for supporting growth strategies and public resource transfers that differentially benefit lower-income groups.

"PACR of a project (1987-97) to improve the coverage, quality, and sustainability of family planning/maternal child health (FP/MCH) services in Bangladesh. Through its support to the NGO, social marketing, and government sectors, this project contributed significantly to national efforts to reduce fertility and infant and child mortality.  Overall, the project achieved or exceeded its goals and objectives and has been a major factor in the expansion of population and health services in Bangladesh. The project was organized under four components, some of which contained multiple subprojects.  Component I focused on the public sector and aimed to improve and decentralize FP service delivery, strengthen logistics, and support the National Expanded Program of Immunization (EPI).  Component II funded the Social Marketing Company (SMC) in promoting and distributing contraceptives and oral rehydration salts.  Component III supported the delivery of FP/MCH services through NGOs.  Under this component, there were cooperative agreements with three international and two national organizations.  Component IV strengthened support services, including commodities logistics, research, evaluation, monitoring, and information, education, and communication (IEC). Overall, the project significantly contributed to increased use of FP, immunizations, and oral rehydration therapy to treat childhood diarrhea.  It also led to significant improvements in contraceptive logistics, the functioning of the SMC, and the viability of local NGOs. Finally, operations research helped to achieve important policy reforms. Lessons learned are as follows:  (1) Significant improvements in contraceptive prevalence and immunization coverage can be achieved with strong national commitment, adequate logistics, strong IEC, and attention to quality of services.  (2) Quality is essential if health and FP programs are to be effective.  Service quality can be improved by establishing and maintaining clear service standards, providing performance-based training based on these standards, maintaining regular and meaningful contact with customers, providing needed equipment and supplies, and improving all aspects of counseling.  (3) IEC is a critical element for successful health and FP programs.  IEC can effectively be used to keep all segments of society well informed about essential, affordable, preventive, and curative interventions.  IEC can also be used to target clients at particular risk, for example, newlywed women or commercial sex workers.  In addition, IEC programs can play a key role in making qualified providers of essential services easily identifiable and accessible to the general public.  (4) Provided they have access to training, supplies, and supervision, local NGOs can be a very effective mechanism for delivering quality FP/MCH services to communities.  (5) Improvements in contraceptive supply management are critical to the performance of FP service delivery programs.  (6) Given the social transformation underway in Bangladesh, the national program should encourage women to seek FP and health services at health centers rather than wait for services to be delivered by fieldworkers at their doorstep.  In addition, women can receive a much wider range of essential services at clinics than are available from community-based distribution programs.  (7) Couples are willing to pay for accessible, high-quality, and affordable services.  (8) Greater utilization of health facilities is possible when an integrated package of essential services is made easily accessible to clients.  (9) Flexibility is needed in allocating resources among project activities.  In addition, program documentation and approval processes should be streamlined.

"Final evaluation of a project implemented by CARE (1/95-1/98) to improve community water supply and sanitation in the four northernmost districts of Inhambane Province, Mozambique. The project, which changed from an emergency to a development program in the course of its life, worked with over 100 communities, constructed 84 new boreholes, and rehabilitated 14 wells, with a focus on areas exhibiting a high demand for water.  The main technology adopted was boreholes with handpumps. In addition, research was carried out on rainwater harvesting, which, while more expensive, is also more flexible, since it employs only locally available materials and skills. Designed to implement the National Water Policy (PNA), the project adopted key PNA principles, including community-level pump maintenance, increasing cost recovery, and greater involvement of the private sector. The project acted as a catalyst to community development, building on local priorities, problem-solving, and management capacities. Development of private sector interest in selling pump spare parts took time to develop and was undermined periodically by government distribution of free parts.  However, vendors are now investing in unsubsidized spare parts, and are forming trading relationships with communities, including some credit facilities.  They have also formed links with manufacturers that allow return and replacement of substandard items. Establishment of decentralized maintenance systems includes building the capacity of community leadership in fund-raising and management of a communal facility, and of a specific maintenance and repair group (GMR) for each handpump (Afridev).  Unlike most other areas of the country, these groups have, as a result of their training, adopted the principle of preventive action and most replace basic parts routinely.  This preventive measure has helped keep pumps in operation near or beyond the recommended limit of operation in terms of depth, the number of users, and water quality; 40% of pumps have never broken down, and 97% were working at the time of the 1997 inventory. Hygiene education included the training of local health promoters (1 for 10 houses), emphasis on role models, and the use of self- monitoring of efforts to improve environmental health. In terms of impact, water use has increased 60-80% per head, with the level of increase linked to provision of health education.  Other positive changes include safe disposal of feces and greater use of soap, which may also improve socioeconomic conditions.  Longer-term and in some cases more continuous monitoring is necessary to identify genuine trends, however, especially regarding the incidence of diarrhea, in which very little change is apparent. The project built up a very good base of information, but could still develop more the linkages that would allow the wider use of the material and help in providing longer-term support for communities as the project phases out, in transferring responsibilities to other organizations, and in reducing the costs of future efforts. Costs per capita and particularly per community were quite high, even for a program with a high hygiene education component.  This is partly due to the project's frequently experimental nature and its keenness to modify and improve impact as it progressed.  Now that methodologies are mostly well established, however, future inputs should be subjected to careful cost-benefit analysis.

"As part of a global program to eradicate polio, Bangladesh held its first round of National Immunization Days (NIDs) on March 16 and April 16, 1995.  During and immediately following the first NID, a process evaluation was conducted to identify operational difficulties and potential solutions.  In order to improve the implementation of future NIDs in Bangladesh, the process evaluation placed emphasis on the NID activities for the urban poor, who are considered to be a hard-to-reach and underserved population.  A total of 100 vaccination sites were observed during the NID and 286 exit interviews were conducted in these sites.  Immediately following the NID, focus group discussions were held in four city corporations and four district municipalities with local managers, caretakers who participated in the NID, and caretakers who did not participate in the NID. Recommendations include (1) improving site organization; (2) developing a strategy to recruit more participants; (3) advising parents to bring their children back for routine immunization; (4) publicizing results of NIDs; and (5) obtaining help from government organizations, political parties, national and local leaders, the media, businesses, teachers, medical personnel, and social organizations.

"To increase immunization coverage and prevent childhood illness, Indonesia has devolved responsibility for immunizations at the local level to health centers, appointed a practical nurse as immunizer in each health center, and developed a system of monthly visits (called Posyandu) to villages.  The Maluku Ministry of Health and Project Concern International jointly undertook a series of activities to enhance the provincial immunization program, including field surveys, a computerized immunization information system, and an on-the-job peer-to-peer training program.  The training program sent experienced, highly performing immunizers to the health centers staffed by inexperienced, poorly performing immunizers for 1 to 2 weeks to provide on-the-job training and assistance.  District health officials selected both the trainee and the trainer immunizers, using information from the surveys and information system. An evaluation of the training program compared changes in key performance indicators in the year before and the year after the training between a group of 13 immunizers trained in 1993 and 1994 (program group) and a group of all 95 immunizers in the province who did not receive the training (nonprogram group).  Coverage of DPT1, polio3, and measles vaccine in the program group rose about 40%, while coverage in the nonprogram group remained nearly constant over the 2-year period, a highly significant difference (p<.001).  This result reflects increases in actual doses given and in reporting accuracy, two of the goals of the training program.  Various potential threats to the validity of the study were addressed and found not to be significant. The training program improved the problem-solving skills of the trainees (such as organizing Posyandu and following up on no-shows) and improved particular techniques (such as refrigerator organization, information system form completion, and BCG vaccination technique).  The out-of-pocket cost of the training program was only about $53 (U.S.) per trainee, which included travel and per diem expenses, but not salaries of the trainers or trainees.  This works out to be about $0.05 per additional vaccination given.  The marginal cost per additional fully immunized child is estimated to be roughly $0.50.

"Innovative child survival (CS) interventions are documented in this summary of evaluations of CS efforts by four PVOs -- La Leche League, Project HOPE, Project Concern, and World Relief. Many of the findings are unexpected.  Project HOPE believed that tea estates in Malawi had supported a maternal and child health program for workers and their families to increase worker productivity or reduce medical costs, but found that estate managers felt that the marginal out-of-pocket cost was very low and that such a program was the right thing to do; they also trusted Project HOPE to manage the activity in a way that would not be controversial and not place undue burden on estate managers. La Leche League trained over 200 volunteer mothers from the poor barrios of Guatemala City to be breastfeeding counselors and then helped them support local mothers in nurturing their children.  The League had thought that over half the breastfeeding counselors had dropped out of the program in the 3 years after the grant ended, but discovered that nearly all were still active and were in touch with about 25% of all the women of child-bearing age in the project communities.  Equally surprisingly, the intensity and quality of the program had continued unabated for 3 years with no supervision.  Instead, a system of mutual support among community mothers, the volunteer counselors, and La Leche League kept the program participants motivated and informed at low cost. In Project Concern International's immunization program in the Maluku Province of Indonesia, the PVO had no idea how remarkably successful its peer training program had been until a study estimated that immunization coverage increased by 40% in program health centers at a cost of only about 50 cents per additional fully immunized child. A study of the Hearth program at Albert Schweitzer Hospital in Haiti through World Relief Corporation produced several surprising and important findings.  To scale up to the district level, the program first had to cut costs by moving the program closer to the communities and using community resources and know-how.  The result was an effective network of community health volunteers linking the hospital to households throughout the district.  Although designed to rehabilitate severely undernourished children, the program unexpectedly proved more effective at preventing the deterioration of mild and moderately malnourished children.  In another unexpected finding, information from ""positive-deviant"" mothers (i.e., poor mothers with well-nourished children) about what they fed their healthy children proved more valuable as a way of convincing other mothers that they too could afford to feed their children a nourishing meal than as a technique for discovering affordable and nourishing menus.

"Evaluates the Parks in Peril Program (PiP), designed to protect some 30 parks and protected areas in the Latin America/Caribbean (LAC) region that are key for conserving biological diversity in this hemisphere. Midterm evaluation covers the period 1994-5/98.  The Nature Conservancy (TNC) is the implementing agency. Although the program is now in its eighth year, it remains urgent. The continuing alarm of World Conservation Union biologists at the threats to humanity posed by continuing losses of biodiversity (5-12% of all species known) is heightened by the combined pressures of population increases, rural poverty, and continued high rates of resource extraction in countries where PiP sites are located.  On the positive side, countervailing changes have occurred in the last 8 years. Environmental awareness is on the rise, most governments are devoting more resources to environmental activities, and a region-wide mosaic of parks and protected areas has been created, of which PiP is one of the most significant components. In addition, democratic values are taking hold, and NGOs have grown in numbers and become significant advocates for conservation. PiP itself is structurally sound, the lack of a clear relationship between governments and the program being the only significant conceptual weakness.  Programmatic strengths outweigh weaknesses, as do program achievements.  Over two dozen ""paper parks"" have been turned into functioning protected areas; staff are well qualified, committed, and enthusiastic; many TNC activities and tools are very innovative, and TNC itself has learned from experience the necessity of engaging the issues of importance to communities in and around PiP sites.  Also, a network of Latin conservation NGOs has been strengthened, and PiP is actively moving from donor-based to market-based financing and has successfully leveraged significant funds from other donors. The numerous lessons learned include the following: (1) By using the principles of adaptive management, PiP has successfully worked in a variety of settings and circumstances. (2) A 3-4 year time-frame for consolidating sites appears unrealistic, and there is no evidence that a set formula can work in all cases. The decision when to terminate USAID funding must be made on a case-by-case basis.  (3) Over time, the relationship between TNC and its partners should grow from mutual dependency related to specific goals to mutual support for larger programs within coalitions.  (4) Success in the policy arena requires operational cooperation between USAID, TNC, partners, and coalitions. In-country TNC coordinators seem critical in organizing and managing such efforts.  (5) Financial planning for the long-term management of a site is essential and should be started from project outset.  Basic protection and basic finance are inseparable elements of PiP site management. (6) Income- generating activities need to be treated as businesses and managed accordingly. It is unrealistic to expect community members, local partner organizations, and onsite managers to develop in a short time the skills needed to manage businesses successfully, particularly while carrying out their other duties. (7) Working with communities has changed their attitudes, often dramatically, toward the protected area.  A good neighbor policy and demonstrated interest for the well-being of the neighbor has proven effective in gaining their support.  (3) Because conservation is a social process, TNC must be very clear about its role and methods with respect to surrounding communities. TNC must focus on its core strengths, reach out to partners having complementary strengths, and find creative ways to attract financing from social development funds for community work.  (5) A clear distinction is needed between activities aimed at community relations, community awareness, and development of alternative resource uses through economic activities. In each case, different interventions and strategies will be needed.  (4) Strategies for developing urban constituencies for the PiP Program sites are sometimes as important as working with local communities.  (5) Care needs to be taken that tools such as threat analysis, gender analysis, partner NGOs, rapid ecological assessments, the scorecard, and income-generating activities do not become ends in themselves.  (6) Accommodate budgets to make room for unexpected events, such as natural disasters, changes in personnel, or new complications.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","AEP-I-05-96-90016-00|AEP-I-00-96-90016-00","","5/1/1998 12:00:00 AM","","Regional level|Natural resource management|Environmental protection|Protected environmental areas|Biological diversity|Private voluntary organizations|Indigenous private voluntary organizations","Latin America|Caribbean","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABQ512.pdf","5,053 KB","005072 - Tropical Research and Development, Inc.","","000114 - USAID.

"Even before the decentralization initiatives undertaken in Mali in the aftermath of the 1991 revolution, USAID was laying the groundwork for decentralization in the country by supporting economic liberalization and localized health care programs.  Since 1991, USAID has fully supported decentralization in Mali, funding the activities of mobilization groups in Kayes, Segou, and Sikasso, as well as training seminars in local finance. Today this support continues; USAID/Mali devotes considerable resources to strengthening local institutional capacity and democratic governance through, in part, the very successful Urban Revitalization Project.  This project is one of the first to use a PVO-NGO-neighborhood model, also used by the Mission in other programs such as its basic education program, which supports decentralization.  In addition, the Mission has helped the Malian Ministry of Education, among the most centralized government agencies, reorganize itself toward the promotion of decentralization and local autonomy; worked to bolster civil society in villages and improved networks between villages; and, in conjunction with the U.S. Information Agency (USIA), supported civic education through media development.  In fact, some of the new enterprises that grew out of the loosening of press restrictions have stayed afloat due to USAID-USIA support; 77 private rural radio stations, a first in West Africa, are among the most promising Mission-supported civic education innovations.  Before decentralization becomes a reality, however, Malians will have to resolve some difficult political issues and overcome some historical and cultural factors.  Chief among these is a scarcity of financial resources, bureaucratic resistance from state-appointed administrators and the Ministry of Territorial Affairs, and widespread public skepticism and mistrust of the national government, coupled with a dependency reflex resulting from massive donor assistance during the food shortages in the 1970s and 1980s.  In addition, land use issues will be difficult to resolve, as will the relationships between levels of government, traditional leaders, and elected officials. Lessons applicable to similar programs in other democratizing countries are as follows.  (1) Capitalize on government commitment; political will has been intrinsic to Mali's success in decentralization and remains the single most important factor for its continued success. (2) Support the creation of an independent decentralization office; the Malian government's Mission for Decentralization has been the driving force behind the country's decentralization program.  The Mission's success underscores the importance of a strong, independent institution in charge of decentralization, under the direct supervision of the country's president or prime minister. (3) Involve people in the decentralization effort.  As a result of USAID's efforts in the area of community participation, Malians everywhere are now stakeholders in decentralization, and an unprecedented dialogue between government and governed has been spurred, which may improve a long-standing antagonistic relationship.  (4) Use local leaders, who are more credible on a local level, as bearers of the message of decentralization.  At local and regional group meetings, local speakers were able to calm tempers and refocus discussions in ways that central government bureaucrats were not.  (5) Use local media to promote public awareness and involvement.  In Mali, where there is widespread illiteracy, private local radio stations are including traditionally excluded groups, including women, in the political arena.  (6) Take advantage of the cultural context.  Mali's cultural heritage offers numerous opportunities for decentralization; villages, for example, have a rich associational life and strong interpersonal networks.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1998 12:00:00 AM","","Democracy|Democratization|USAID|Public administration|Governance|Decentralization|Local level|Institution building|Constraints","Mali","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNACA905.pdf","453 KB","008058 - USAID.

"Honduras has experienced significant advances in democratic local governance in the present decade.  Whereas formerly the central government controlled all aspects of local government, many municipalities are now successfully managing city services, setting their agendas, and increasing their resource bases.  For the first time, citizens are able to elect their mayors directly and participate in local government by voicing their opinions and advancing proposals in open town meetings.  This transformation was spurred by the 1990 Municipal Reform Law granting autonomy to the nation's 297 municipalities, and by the related electoral reforms of 1993. USAID/Honduras has been involved at every stage of this process of decentralization, supporting the passage and implementation of the 1990 Municipal Reform Law with the Municipal Development project (MDP); supporting FUNDEMUN and UNITEC, NGOs which have helped increase local officials' administrative capacities and ability to provide public services; and strengthening AMHON, a private association of mayors, as the single most effective organization in promoting the interests of municipalities on a national level.  However, challenges remain.  These include continued bureaucratic and political resistance to decentralization, the need to integrate the principles of democratic decentralization into Honduras's political culture, and the need to increase media support for decentralization and ensure the sustainability of FUNDEMUN, UNITEC, and AMHON. Finally, progress to date has occurred in larger, more populous municipalities rather than in the more than 250 small municipalities, many of which were left untargeted by the MDP. Three of the more significant lessons emerging from the experience of USAID/Honduras are as follows.  (1) Enabling legal frameworks and strong political leadership are essential to the success of decentralization. Honduras's success with decentralization would never have occurred without the 1990 and 1993 legislative developments and the support of Presidents Callejas and Reina.  (2) With over 20 years of experience in municipal development, USAID had at its immediate disposal a cadre of trained professional who could implement the Municipal Development project in a highly effective manner.  This cadre will continue to be an important factor in the continued expansion of democratic local governance in Honduras.  (3) Targeting assistance involves difficult choices.  The MDP selected municipalities with the greatest potential for success, imposing rigorous compliance standards for continued assistance.  While this strategy yielded some significant successes, it left unanswered the question how to make democratic local governance a reality in smaller, poorer, and more isolated municipalities.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1998 12:00:00 AM","","Decentralization|Democratization|Governance|Democracy|Local level|Cities and towns|Municipal level|Political participation|Electoral systems|Institution building|Political development|Political systems in transition|Project sustainability|Development projects","Honduras","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNACA908.pdf","419 KB","008058 - USAID.

"Evaluates the Population Leadership Program (PLP), designed to enhance the effectiveness of USAID-sponsored population, family planning, and reproductive health (P/FP/RH) programs by (1) recruiting, placing, and supporting technical advisors (Fellows) to USAID/Washington and field missions; and (2) providing executive-level training to participating technical experts.  Interim evaluation covers the period 9/94-5/98.  The program is being implemented by the Western Consortium for Public Health (WCPH), in collaboration with the Center for Health Leadership. Overall, the program has been very effective.  In the first component, PLP has recruited and placed 45 highly qualified Fellows, the overwhelming majority of whom have shown the highest level of performance.  Placement of these individuals has been suitable and timely.  For their part, Fellows, both overseas and in Washington, gave mixed reviews of administrative and management support, complaints centering around the lack of information on and clarity of WCPH procedures, especially personnel management, and the lack of orientation to USAID policies, procedures, and programs given in preparation for assignments.  Field Fellows said they often feel professionally isolated when left to their own devices without an adequate professional support system.  All in all, however, WCPH has made great strides in establishing the systems required to effectively recruit, place, and monitor Fellows. The leadership training component is designed to help Fellows develop leadership skills in communication, advocacy, organizational change, and coalition building.  Fellows and participating direct hires rated it very highly overall and said they use the concepts taught. Specifically, Fellows report being more tolerant of other leadership styles; thinking and planning much more for group process; being more collaborative; and being better at delegation, teamwork, and listening. Direct hires said they have learned to prioritize things that are worthwhile, interact more with staff, listen better, be more aware of how others see them, come to meetings without preconceived ideas, use conflict resolution skills, and be more aware of modeling behavior. Participants generally agreed that PLP has enhanced technical and managerial consultation by improving leadership capacity and by preparing Fellows to inspire and lead in their specialty.  They were less sure, however, about whether other training objectives were being realized, namely, whether PLP: prepares participants to direct, inspire, and mobilize resources for population assistance and effectively communicate P/FP/RH priorities and policy; aids in developing a network of population specialists capable of providing ongoing leadership to the field; assists selected organizations worldwide in developing effective policies and implementing successful population programs; or helps participants mobilize resources. Both Fellows and direct-hires found most of the subjects taught relevant to their jobs; only one topic or course fell below the midpoint (4.5) of the scale:  Week-on-Campus. Typically, topics and courses on the list were rated higher by staff and management than by PLP participants.  To its credit, the WCPH has altered curriculum topics and presentations on the basis of participant evaluations and at USAID's direction.  When asked to identify specific training they wanted added to the program, PLP participants requested individually personalized training plans. PLP participants rated the overall quality of the faculty ""very good,"" while noting that faculty lack USAID experience. However, field-assigned PLP Fellows are seriously underserved in the area of training.  No significant nor successful connection has been made with mission-funded PLP members.  The evaluators recommended a series of initiatives to alleviate this problem. Administrative responsibility for PLP will be transferred from the WCPH to the Public Health Institute on 6/30/98.  USAID should closely monitor this transfer to ensure that Fellows do not suffer changes in their employment contracts or in support that will adversely affect their work.","Project title: Population technical assistance (POPTECH)","Special Evaluation","Documents","CCP-3024-Q-00-3012-00","","5/1/1998 12:00:00 AM","","Population programs|Family planning promotion programs|Reproductive health|Consultants|Health professional education|Participants|Management training|Leadership training","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABQ561.pdf","247 KB","008485 - Basic Health Management International (BHM)|001131 - The Futures Group International, Inc.

"Reviews the COPE (Community-Based Options for Prevention and Empowerment) II project in Malawi, aimed at demonstrating a systematic approach to mobilizing community-based responses to the needs of orphans and others made vulnerable by the impact of HIV/AIDS.  The report covers the period 9/97-1/98.  Save the Children Federation of the United States is the implementing agency. Efforts have focused in the Mangochi District's Namwera area, where a 1996 COPE workshop spurred development of the Namwera AIDS Coordinating Committee (NACC).  NACC, in turn has, first with COPE's help and then on its own, organized a number of Village AIDS Committees (VACs) that have identified orphans, people who are ill, and other vulnerable individuals; helped orphans return to school; trained care givers in home-based care; raised funds and provided material assistance; started youth anti-AIDS clubs; developed community gardens; and organized structured recreation activities to respond to the psychosocial needs of orphans.  AIDS committees have also been formed at the district and community levels.  Community ownership is the essential element in COPE's approach and the key to project sustainability. A key COPE strategy for mitigating the impact of HIV/AIDS is to strengthen the economic stability of communities.  The evaluation suggests that this can be done through two complementary approaches: by creating a community safety net by generating resources locally to mitigate the consequences of HIV/AIDS, and by providing microenterprise services to enable poor families and households to shore up their resources. Five types of microenterprise services have potential for the latter purpose:  microcredit (organizations in Malawi with which COPE can work in this area are identified in the report); savings mobilization; linking producers to markets and to sources of agricultural inputs and advice; and apprenticeships linking youth to artisans in the informal system. Includes recommendations for pursuing income generation activities, as well as for increasing the link between care and prevention activities, an area which deserves much greater attention than it has received. One of the goals of community-based efforts to mitigate the impact of HIV/AIDS is strengthening the economic stability of communities; the villages most vulnerable to the impacts of HIV/AIDS are already poor, and if too many are pushed from poverty into destitution, their needs will overwhelm VACs and erode their capacity to raise funds to provide support.  Building community economic capacity can be done (1) by creating a community safety net through the generation of local resources to mitigate the consequences of HIV/AIDS, and (2) by providing microenterprise services so that families and households can shore up their resources.  Five types of microenterprise service have potential for this purpose: microcredit programs; savings mobilization; market research; linking rural villages with agricultural inputs and advice; and apprenticeships linking rural youths to artisans in the informal system. Among programs addressing HIV/AIDS issues, the potential links between care and prevention activities deserve much greater attention than they have received; programs targeting HIV prevention often operate in isolation from those providing care for those with the disease or made vulnerable by its impact.  Linking the two types of programs might help reduce the spread of HIV because the empowerment that comes with effective community mobilization reinforces among participants the sense that they can affect the circumstances of their lives.  This awareness may increase their receptivity to adopting behaviors that reduce their risk of HIV infection.  Also, personal involvement in community-based care efforts raises participants' awareness of HIV/AIDS and provides opportunities for program staff to discuss with them how HIV is transmitted and to convey prevention messages.  In addition, responding to the difficulties of orphans and widows may motivate community residents to avoid risky behaviors that could ultimately have similar consequences for their own families.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","690-G-00-97-00291-00|HRN-C-00-95-00004-00","","6/1/1998 12:00:00 AM","","Disease prevention and control|HIV/AIDS|Community based delivery|Institution building|Local groups|Health committees|Disadvantaged groups|Community participation|Community mobilization|Home health care","Malawi","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABQ647.pdf","210 KB","003366 - TvT Associates","","008291 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of a project (10/88-12/98) to improve access, coverage, and sustainability of an integrated package of community and child health (CCH) interventions in selected rural areas of Bolivia. Key findings are as follows:  (1) MOH facilities in CCH areas (and likely elsewhere) are not well used because of problems with access by the rural population, low-quality service, cultural barriers, few women in positions of leadership, poor motivation of MOH personnel, and inadequate provision of medicines.  (2) CCH has a burdensome and unresponsive administrative structure.  Centralized decisionmaking and control is no longer appropriate.  (3) The project has made important advances in improving health through its support of health information, education, and communication (IEC).  However, the project appears to have had a relatively weak strategy for working with communities.  (4) Due to CCH's unfortunate evolution into a near-autonomous entity separated from the MOH, and the establishment of much higher salary scales for CCH staff compared with the MOH, the sustainability of many project accomplishments is doubtful. Important CCH successes, most of which are replicable, include: functioning of a nearly self-sufficient rotating fund for essential medicines; establishment of good departmental teams of rural educators; good educational methodology at the community level; decentralized training in one project area and early, good training in integrated management of childhood illnesses (IMCI) in two other areas; good project relations with the Ministry of Health (MOH) at the district and health-post level; good relations with the new mayors and the decentralized municipal structure; good staffing of regional (departmental and district) CCH teams; appropriate use of resources in providing items such as motorcycles and cold-chain equipment; good innovation in designing simplified administrative forms and procedures; a good example of water system follow up in one area; and good pilot activities in the Agua Claro project. Key weaknesses included the following:  (1) The reproductive health add-on came too late to accomplish anything significant, as did the geographical expansion to 11 districts.  (2) Program modifications based on data analysis are sporadic.  (3) Few CCH financed workshops have received meaningful follow up.  (4) IEC staff have not been proactive in seeking other important IEC actors such as UNICEF.  (5) CCH staff seem to have been largely uninvolved in providing technical (medical) supervision to MOH staff.  (6) There is little sharing between CCH departments, and much program fragmentation exists.  (7) Relatively little attention has been paid to training auxiliary nurses and promoters, activities directed at the community and at nutrition issues. Also, there is little local CCH initiative, and staff response is slow to incipient area emergencies.  (8) In some areas, the relationship between the CCH department head and the MOH is strained.  (9) CCH has only sporadically worked with NGOs and the private sector.  (10) CCH Head Office staff lack vision regarding the role of training supervision and do not often travel to areas of difficult access. (11) Many training events are overly didactic.  (12) Lessons learned from the Agua Claro project have not been adequately used.  (13) No thought has been given to a phase-out strategy. More specific findings are as follows:  (1) While CCH has made important contributions to the country's health management information systems (HMIS), a number of issues remain to be dealt with, especially inadequate analysis of the information gathered, a complacency with data known to have weaknesses, and the use of activity rather than impact indicators.  (2) The CCH project has not given much attention to perinatal and neonatal survival.  Further efforts to increase immunization coverage are also needed.  (3) CCH's indicators in child growth monitoring are not likely to have an impact on child nutrition. The quality of CCH's intervention in iron sulfate supplementation is suspect.  Similarly, the attention paid to vitamin A supplementation was probably inadequate.  (4) The water component filled a great need and is highly sought after.  This component provided a vehicle for the kind of grassroots effort that represents the best of development theory and practice.  (5) The CCH-managed budget has been significantly underexpended for much of the life of the project.  (6) CCH piggyback activities filled a great need but placed a considerable management burden on USAID. The current project should close as scheduled and a new project with a similar goal and purpose should be designed. Strategies should be different, however, and should emphasize real community participation, decentralization and municipal buy-in, and eventual sustainability.  New technical areas are recommended:  IMCI; reproductive health and reduced maternal mortality; business management and training; water and sanitation; and Chagas' disease, malaria, and tuberculosis.  The new project's geographical scope should be reduced and cover no more than seven districts.  The MOH should be encouraged to fully staff district and department teams and implement several other pilot activities called for in the Minister's new Strategic Plan.","Project title: Population technical assistance (POPTECH)","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","CCP-3024-Q-00-3012-00","","8/1/1998 12:00:00 AM","","Community health care|Child health care|Development project design|Development strategies|Health care administration|Organizational structure","Bolivia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABQ689.pdf","296 KB","008485 - Basic Health Management International (BHM)|001131 - The Futures Group International, Inc.

"PACR of a project (1990-97) to expand and strengthen the capacity and operational efficiency of the National Railways of Zimbabwe (NRZ).  The PACR focuses on the period after 1994, with emphasis on the 2/95 addition of a Commodity Import-Like Program (CILP) to finance procurement of locomotive spare parts and financial support for the Voluntary Early Retirement Scheme for NRZ. Results were mixed.  On the negative side, the project was not implemented as designed and the approved inputs such as assistance to the road transport sector were not provided.  Also, the impact of the project was adversely affected by the curtailment of the CILP's inter-modal transport operations component and the deobligation of $1.4 million in project funds. Finally, the repeated changes in USAID project managers did not allow for consistency of project implementation, follow-ups, monitoring of project impacts, and assessment of the project's needs. On the positive side, the project reduced the NRZ's locomotive maintenance backlog and improved the locomotive availability rates of the DE 10As and DE 11As mainline locomotives.  It also achieved significant, though only limited, success, in reducing NRZ's workforce because the average payout exceeded estimates by a factor of almost 3, though it was unsuccessful in reducing the wage-revenue ratio to 35%. The financial and operational performance of the NRZ, particularly in rail freight transported and in operating revenues generated, improved significantly during the project. Prospects for sustainability of project achievements for the 1994-97 period are promising.  Under a proposed World Bank-financed restructuring plan, the NRZ will be separated into three entities (infrastructure, equipment and operations) that will be either concessioned or privatized.  Project assistance provided under the CILP to improve NRZ's operational and financial performance supports future concessioning or privatization of the railway by reducing the labor force and improving the locomotive availability.  The new World Bank project adds to the sustainability of the project achievements by concessioning the locomotives previously maintained with USAID project assistance and taking advantage of the workforce reductions financed by USAID. The following lessons were learned:  (1) For maximum impact, new or amended project elements should be closely aligned with the project's original framework.  (2) Project elements should be sized to available resources, in terms of both cost of inputs and of administration and management.  (3) Administrative procedures should be designed such that their cost-effectiveness considers the project's expected development impact.  (4) Implementing a CILP in an open foreign exchange market environment undermines the rationale for such a program.  In such an environment, private firms have unlimited access to foreign exchange and are able to import the equipment and spare parts they require.  (5) The CILP was over-designed, given its stated objective, the amount of resources available for implementation, and the mode of implementation. The project could have made and sustained its achievements with far fewer management resources and in a more cost-effective manner.","Delivery order no. 801","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","LAG-I-00-97-00013-00","","9/1/1998 12:00:00 AM","","Rail transportation|National level|Commodity import programs|Institution building","Zimbabwe","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABQ736.pdf","65 KB","010052 - Transportation and Economic Research Associates, Inc.

"Final evaluation of the Shared Control of Natural Resources (SCOR) subproject (3/93-9/98) of the Natural Resources and Environmental Policy Project (NAREPP) in Sri Lanka.  The revised (1995) purpose of SCOR was to identify, develop, and field test models for increasing the sustainable productivity of natural resources -- mainly land and water -- in a watershed context. SCOR contributed to policy changes in the agriculture, irrigation, and forestry sectors that created openings for positive changes in watershed management through increased user control of natural resources.  SCOR developed institutional innovations that took advantage of these openings.  These have operated well at the project level, and some have been adopted at the national level. SCOR's overall approach had a number of distinctive features:  it was first and foremost an integrated watershed approach that sought to (1) improve interdisciplinary understanding of changing biophysical, socioeconomic, and political systems; and (2) balance conservation with development, protecting the key functions of these systems upon which productivity depends.  SCOR also used a participatory approach, seeking to promote broad, multi-leveled participation and collaborative relationships among a range of government agencies, local groups, NGOs, and individuals. Finally, it was a learning, ""action research"" approach, seeking to fill important gaps in our understanding of change and the impacts of alternative decisions. The specific mechanisms that SCOR employed to carry out these approaches were many, including local resource user groups, a cadre of catalysts, financial and technical support through subwatershed-based ""mini-projects"", market-oriented farmer companies, and various arrangements for sharing resource management responsibilities and benefits between the state and local people. With some exceptions, SCOR's activities to increase productivity will yield positive benefits only in the mid to long term.  Most have not been adopted on a wide scale because they do not provide sufficient short-term benefit to the farmer.  Nonetheless, through its support to farmer organizations and innovations in organizational forms, SCOR has helped develop new income options for farmers. Overall conclusions are as follows:  (1) SCOR's innovative approach created a considerably greater awareness and common understanding of the importance of watersheds and conservation.  Particularly in Nilwala, SCOR helped reinforce a sense of stewardship and responsibility among some public and private leaders for creating a wider public good through investments that are longer term or more distant from their immediate constituencies. Although neither an easy nor a complete accomplishment, this was an important one.  SCOR's success did not, however, extend to the level of the individual farmer and farm household.  Under SCOR, small holders and chena cultivators were seldom heard. It is not yet clear whether the innovations in productivity, resource management, and institutional modes and capacities to which SCOR contributed are well-established enough to be sustained.  In this regard, the short time-frame of the project imposed a serious constraint. The role of multiple leadership, at all levels, was critical to SCOR's achievements.  Committed leadership played a key role in balancing differing interests and building trust and commitment.  Given the project's complex structure, a key task facing project leadership was to concentrate the project's limited resources on activities where success was most likely.  It was appropriate not to narrow too much the focus at the design stage (when the least was known).  After the mid-term evaluation, however, a concentration of focus was essential, yet proved difficult due to the differing interests among project participants.  In the end, the lack of focus and the lack of sufficient consensus on priorities hindered project progress and achievement and its sought-for transformation from ""project"" to ""program"". Numerous lessons learned are detailed.

"PACR of a project (1987-97) to promote the development of new or innovative products or processes relevant to the Indian energy sector (PACER project).  The project was implemented by the Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India (ICICI). PACER provided conditional grant assistance totaling $15.6 million to 29 projects, comprising 2 solicited and 27 unsolicited proposals.  Of these, 18 projects have been completed, 5 are under implementation, and the remaining 6 were truncated.  Of the 18 completed projects, 6 have already been commercialized and repayments to PACER have started. PACER has had a positive impact on the energy research scenario in India.  Several technology development projects relating to energy efficiency, energy conservation, and alternative fuels were taken up that might not have seen the light of day but for PACER.  Only a few projects like the Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited (BHEL) ""Pressurized fluidized bed gasifier"" project might have materialized without PACER. According to a report prepared by the Business Consulting Group (BCG), the potential impact of PACER funded projects likely to see commercialization in India is estimated at Rs. 73 billion, on an annualized basis, for the 12 projects visited by BCG.  This speaks volumes for the national benefit of the PACER program. Lessons learned cover three categories.  (1) Project approach.  (a) PACER has demonstrated the benefits of consortia research.  The program is replicable in other sectors where science and industry must cooperate for the greater benefit of industry and country, e.g., agro-processing, steel, electronics, waste management, telecommunications, and watershed management.  (b) A program like PACER needs external inputs from experts who can provide critical and unbiased insights into evaluation of projects.  A strong and effective Peer Review Committee helps considerably in this area.  (c) Adequate thought needs to be given to consortium fit and members' interest in commercialization.  (d) A Request for Proposal (RFP) approach should be preferred over unsolicited proposals.  RFP should be initiated at the outset of such a program in order to channel efforts in the desired direction at an early date. (2) Implementation approach.  (a) Ten years is inadequate to see the fruits of such a program.  (b) Monitoring of assisted technology development projects can be improved by having clearly defined milestones/benchmarks. This would put pressure on promoters regarding timing and results.  (c) The upper limit ($3 million) for financing subprojects under such programs needs to be flexible so that projects are not left incomplete due to lack of funds.  (d) Promoters should contribute at least 30% of project funding in order to demonstrate their commitment to the project. (3) Sustainability.  Indian industry is generally reluctant to deploy its high-cost funds on research and development.  Programs like PACER lower the ""risk"" to industry and create a better environment for technology development and commercialization.  The sustainability of energy research in non-aid situations is doubtful in most cases, given the pressing need to deploy the scarce high-cost funds in competing areas.  However, the technologies developed using PACER funds were relevant to the Indian situation.  Many of these hold good promise, e.g., power generation from waste heat recovery in the cement industry, beneficiation of high-ash coal for power generation, distillery spent wash treatment along with cogeneration of power, and solar thermal steam generation.  In order to adopt these technologies using their own funds, several Indian companies have begun approaching technology developers for technology transfer.

"From 1954 through 1996, the United States provided more than $52 billion of P.L. 480 food aid worldwide both to alleviate hunger and to promote long-term sustainable development. This report assesses the contribution of that aid to long-term sustainable development by examining the economic, social, and political impact of food aid in five recipient countries (Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Ghana, Honduras, and Indonesia) and the Sahel region. The equity of food aid targeting and the efficiency of food aid as a mechanism for transferring resources are also explored. For the most part, the U.S. food aid program has contributed to sustainable development, more so in some countries than in others. Besides providing balance-of-payments support, food aid can leverage or support a sound economic policy environment (Bangladesh, Indonesia, some Sahelian states such as Mali). But it can also have a negative effect on economic policy (Honduras in the 1980s, some Sahelian states), or no discernible effect at all (Ghana before the mid-1980s, some Sahelian states, Ethiopia until recently). Political stability, a precondition for sustainable development, is at risk in low-income countries (such as Bangladesh) when food prices are high and fluctuate widely. Food aid can help stabilize food prices and, perhaps, contribute to political stability. This seemed to be the case in Indonesia in the late 1960s and early 1970s and in Honduras in the mid-1980s. However, food aid cannot ensure political stability (the Sahel, Ghana, Ethiopia). Food aid can have a negative effect on long-term sustainable development if it enables governments to put off implementing food policies that encourage grain production. This occurred to some extent in Honduras, Ghana, and some Sahelian states. It may also depress domestic grain prices, thus reducing incentives to produce grain, as probably occurred at certain times in Bangladesh and Honduras, but also benefitting consumers. U.S. food aid has had its greatest social impacts through project food aid, which directly distributes food to vulnerable groups through school feeding, food-for-work (FFW), and maternal and child health (MCH) programs. FFW projects have been especially successful in reaching intended beneficiaries, although the public works created under such projects have been of mixed quality, particularly when they began as short-term relief and rehabilitation operations rather than as long-term development programs. MCH programs seem to have improved the health and nutritional knowledge of poor mothers, one of the program's three objectives. However, several factors made it difficult to demonstrate the programs' effect on the nutritional status of children under 5, a second program objective. First, older MCH programs often relied solely on food supplementation without any complementary inputs such as primary health care; these programs had no discernible effect on children's nutritional status. In cases in which nutritional status did improve, the effect of the food supplement could not be disengaged from that of other factors affecting nutritional status, such as vaccinations, potable water, and increased incomes. Finally, the food ration was often shared among family members rather than consumed solely by lactating mothers and children (Ethiopia, Honduras, Indonesia, the Sahel). However, other evaluations (e.g., Mora and others 1990) have found MCH supplementary feeding programs in some countries effective at improving child nutritional status when they included complementary health and education inputs. USAID has used food aid to support school feeding programs in two Sahelian countries (Burkina Faso and the Gambia), Bangladesh, Ghana, and Honduras, but not in Ethiopia or Indonesia. Results, though mixed, have generally been positive, except in Ghana, where none of the program's objectives were achieved. Program food aid, although sold on the open market to anyone with money, can benefit the poor indirectly by promoting an equity-oriented policy environment (Indonesia, Bangladesh); also, local currency generated from the sale of food aid can be invested where the poor live and work -- usually in rural areas growing crops (as occurred in all six countries). However, while it is more efficient to transfer resources as financial aid rather than as food aid, in practice U.S. financial aid is not fungible with U.S. food aid. Therefore, the choice is not between food aid and financial aid, but between food aid and no aid. Six recommendations to guide future programs are provided. Includes bibliography.

"PACR of a project (8/88-9/97) to support, in consecutive phases, free zone development and industrial reconstruction in El Salvador. Before the passage of Section 599 of the Foreign Assistance Appropriation Act of 1993, the project supported the development of three private free zones (El Pedregal, El Progreso, and San Marcos) through funding of pre-investment studies, TA, and training on free zone administration and operation through the Salvadoran Foundation for Economic and Social Development (FUSADES), and construction of public services infrastructure through the Government of El Salvador (GOES). The project also trained Government officials on credit analysis of free zone projects and on how to provide better support to export activities. As of 12/93, achievements of the free zone development phase included: 10,200 new jobs, some 8,670 of which benefitted women; $22.6 million in new exports; 52,900 square meters of industrial space built; 35,000 square meters of industrial space rented; and 14 export firms operating in three free zones.  By 6/98, the three zones had generated 15,255 jobs, a number expected to swell to 30,727 after El Pedregal reaches full capacity.  The project also promoted the construction of four additional free zones, two of which -- Export Salva and American Industrial Park -- are already in operation and to date have generated 8,400 new jobs, and Lido and El Salvador, which will begin operations by 11/98. Because of the Mission's 7/30/96 decision to deobligate $9,255,345 from the project and reduce its goals, the achievements of the industrial reconstruction phase were reduced to the performance of only the feasibility and design studies of Concordia Industrial Park.  These studies were completed by 12/96 and are being used by the Technical Secretariat for External Financing (SETEFE) to build the public services infrastructure for the park. Although industrial development is not currently an area of interest to USAID, it requires further development and should be promoted.  The free zones have benefitted and continue to benefit an important portion of El Salvador's poor population and have also contributed to industrial development. The following lessons were learned:  (1) Since industrial development generates employment rapidly, the promotion of free zones and industrial parks could be a very good economic alternative for countries like El Salvador, where agriculture is hindered by geographic, financial, and technological constraints.  Industrial development provides employment opportunities to less qualified labor, thereby increasing their economic and social opportunities and lessening social and political pressures.

"In 1995, USAID began a project to develop an equities market, named Rasdaq, to complement the Bucharest Stock Exchange, established that same year with help from the Canadian government.  In less than 2 years, USAID created Rasdaq and a complete set of supporting institutions, including a Mutual Funds Association and depository, registry, transfer agent, and self-regulatory organizations.  Rasdaq helped ensure a successful Mass Privatization Program and a listing for 5,600 newly privatized firms.  As a result, several hundred recently privatized and restructured companies have adopted new technologies, increased productivity, and reduced excessive employment.  Further, the creation of Rasdaq encouraged the competing Bucharest Stock Exchange to improve its services. Several factors were critical to the project's success -- the active role taken by the U.S. ambassador in negotiations with the government; the direct linking of the project with a major mass privatization of small and medium-size firms; the large outlay of funds ($30 million); USAID's use of a turnkey approach covering all needed elements; the authority enjoyed by USAID's Bureau for Europe and the New Independent States to hire highly skilled capital market experts to manage the project; and adoption of a tight time frame focused on getting all systems in place and operating within 6 months and fully functioning within a year. Yet serious problems remain.  While securities market laws and regulations are adequate, surveillance and enforcement are weak. Managers need to improve corporate governance, i.e., run companies for the benefit of all shareholders and not merely for the personal gain of the managers.  Finally, due to the continuing prevalence of communist ideas in government and throughout the economy, the economic policy environment is depressed and chaotic, and additional privatization has proceeded slowly.  As long as the government fails to adopt and implement needed economic reforms, Rasdaq and other capital market institutions will not live up to their full potential. The following lessons were learned:  (1) Top-level support, healthy funding, and a firm timetable can spur the success of a capital markets program.  (2) Economic competition encourages efficiency and growth, but also creates duplication and overlap.  It may be time to merge some of the competing institutions, including, at some point in the future, Rasdaq and the Bucharest Stock Exchange.  (3) An independent regulatory commission with strong enforcement powers is critical.  (4) Incentives for good corporate governance need to be instituted.  (5) A stock market alone does not make a capital market.  Romania still lacks a private debt market (corporate bonds), a secondary market in government securities, longer term government bonds, a municipal finance market, and money market instruments.  Moreover, commercial credit in many cases is still allocated by administrative decision rather than market and price decisions.  (6) Absent a sound economic environment, even good institutions cannot yield the full benefits of privatization.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1998 12:00:00 AM","","Economies in transition|Capital markets|Stock exchanges|Privatization|Financial institutions|Economic reform","Romania","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNACA921.pdf","262 KB","008058 - USAID.

"Is life for ordinary people in developing countries becoming easier or harder?  The conventional view maintains that, while many people have indeed risen out of poverty in some parts of the developing world, a mass of poor people, numbering perhaps 1 billion, have been left behind, and that future prospects are unpromising.  As a group, developing countries are seen as falling behind the rest of the world, raising the specter of islands of prosperity, perhaps heavily armed against immigration, in a sea of misery.  Even East Asia -- the one region where broad progress against poverty has been incontrovertible -- became in 1997 the source of a new wave of gloomy stories.  This paper assess the validity of this picture by bringing together the best available data on indicators of well-being of people in developing countries over the period 1950 through 1995 in terms of infant mortality, life expectancy, food and nutrition, education and literacy, and political freedom. Where appropriate, both the percentage of people in poverty and the absolute number of poor are considered for both the world as a whole and for developing countries.  The study looks mainly at the developing countries taken together, although it also includes a limited discussion of gender and regional differences. The basic finding is that the conventional picture is wrong:  there has been a steady and dramatic improvement in indicators of the quality of life for ordinary people in developing countries.  Throughout the developing world, people are living longer lives, eating better, and are far more likely to be literate than ever before in history.  It is even more remarkable that this considerable progress took place in the face of the most rapid population growth rates in developing countries in the history of the world -- rates that peaked in the 1970s and have since been declining.  The average woman in the developing world has three children today, compared with six in 1965. Two characteristics of the trends merit special mention.  First, average well-being can improve in the absence of growth in per capita incomes.  This has happened in Africa for the last two decades, and it happened in Latin America during the 1980s.  Rapid economic growth, as in East Asia, is associated with faster improvement in social indicators.  It is likely that the steady improvement in social indicators in stagnant economies results from continued dissemination of knowledge and -- because of greater literacy -- a greater capacity to learn.  Second, the trends in social indicators show much more stability than do trends in economic indicators.  They do not deteriorate simply because of an economic recession or jump sharply because of an economic boom.  Again, this is consistent with the idea that transmission of knowledge of better practices is important; such knowledge does not disappear because of economic downturns.  The study concludes by emphasizing the importance of these positive trends in counteracting pessimism about or opposition to international development efforts.

"PACR of a project (7/92-9/97) to increase coffee production in El Salvador, especially among smallholders.  The project was implemented by the Salvadoran Coffee Research Foundation (PROCAFE), with TA from the International Research Institute (IRI). The project did not fit very well under the Mission's 6/96 Strategic Objective No. 1 Technology/Marketing Results Package, which called for strengthening secondary level organizations, forming cooperatives and producer groups, and affiliating small farmers to primary and secondary level organizations.  PROCAFE stated in writing that promoting affiliation or forming cooperatives was not their mandate.  As a result, when USAID/W reduced the Mission's FY 1997 budget by $2 million, the PROCAFE project was one of those selected to ""pay the bill"".  This resulted in a large-scale suspension of activities with PROCAFE during 1996 and the first semester of 1997. Overall conclusions are as follows:  (1) PROCAFE's medium-term financial position is relatively strong.  However, the lack of assured long-term counterpart funding is a dark cloud over PROCAFE's future. PROCAFE management should make a concerted effort with coffee sector leaders to resolve this uncertainty.  (2) PROCAFE has made good progress toward becoming a capable coffee research and extension organization, though the slow delivery of vehicles and computers has had a negative effect on PROCAFE's performance, especially in extension activities.  TA provided by IRI, though costly, has given USAID good value for its money.  (3) Privatization of coffee research has had several positive effects.  On the negative side, PROCAFE's research program does not differentiate between high- and low-resource technologies, and the complexity and importance of the environmental aspects of the coffee industry are not reflected in its research program.  There is also a need to integrate more economic criteria into the research program and to monitor the sectoral impact of adopted technologies.  (4) Those receiving TA from PROCAFE regard it highly, but often indicate the need for more.  (5) The inability of small producers and agrarian reform cooperatives to obtain access to credit is a serious limitation to the adoption of PROCAFE's recommendations.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","10/1/1998 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural production|Coffee|Small farms|Agricultural cooperatives|Agrarian reform|Agricultural research|Agricultural extension|Research organizations|Agricultural technology","El Salvador","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABQ912.pdf","3,617 KB","008540 - USAID.

"During the last 4 years, USAID has advanced efforts to empower Nepalese women through activities in basic literacy, legal literacy (legal rights for women), and economic participation (microcredit). This report, one of a series of country studies by USAID's Center for Development Information and Evaluation (CDIE), assesses the impact of these efforts.  The study is based on structured interviews with 95 participating women and on examinations of their children's school records. Literacy and income generation programs have contributed in many ways to raising the quality of life among rural and impoverished women and their families in Nepal.  In 1991, less than 22% of adult Nepalese women were literate.  With USAID/Nepal's assistance, the literacy rate of adult women increased to an estimated 25% in 1995 and 28% in 1996.  Most participants reported that their experiences in literacy classes led to an increased sense of self-confidence and to greater autonomy and authority within their domains.  They have increased their participation in collective community activities and social issues and have begun to engage in improved health practices. Educational attainment of younger children in both the control group and the literacy group has increased by 10% over that of older children, i.e., those who turned school age prior to the program.  Younger children in the microcredit and the microcredit-plus-literacy programs have registered gains of 37% and 18% respectively.  The educational attainment levels of all four groups have increased over recent years. Much of the overall increase in education among children of mothers engaged in microcredit accrues to boys rather than girls.  By contrast, the gender gap in the literacy group is lower, and that in the integrated literacy group is substantially lower.  The lowest average daily attendance in 1996 was recorded among children of mothers engaged in microcredit activities, at 73% (microcredit) and 67% (literacy and microcredit).  Repetition rates for both boys and girls in the microcredit and integrated program groups are lower than those for the region as a whole, as is average repetition among children in the literacy group.  Extremely high repetition rates among control-group children contrast sharply with those of children in all treatment groups.  Children of both genders in all three program groups were three to four times as likely as children in the control group to report that their mothers help them with school. For most women, attending classes or generating other income required that they work harder during non-class hours or hours when they were not generating income.  This is a particular burden for women who attend literacy classes, because the classes take time away from all productive labor, whereas the productivity of microcredit activities may well substitute for productive time missed elsewhere.  The opportunity cost of sending a girl to school for one year is about equal to the opportunity cost of a woman's attending a literacy class.  The higher repetition rates of children whose mothers had not attended training added 34% to the cost of their schooling.  For the poorest of the poor, assuming they can afford any opportunity costs of educational activities, education must be viewed as having immediate and direct effects to be worth the investment in time and energy.  Thus, in comparing the benefits of two types of educational investments -- formal schooling of girls and informal training of mothers -- the relative benefits would be different, depending upon how marginal were the lives of the families involved. Lessons learned include the following:  (1) Development of knowledge and skills among mothers may translate into higher levels of educational attainment among children.  (2) The magnitude of program impact on children's education varies by socioeconomic context.  (3) Increased earnings by mothers do not necessarily or immediately translate into more education for their daughters.  (4) Maternal support for children's education stimulated by program participation translates into private and social savings.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1998 12:00:00 AM","","Women in development|Adult education|Nonformal education|Literacy instruction|Mothers|Legal education|Women's rights|Income generation|Microenterprises|Commercial credit|Impact assessment|Children|Girls|Boys|Gender analysis|Economic participation","Nepal","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNACA917.pdf","222 KB","008058 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (1/92-9/97) to promote the economic and social reactivation of ex-conflictive zones in El Salvador by restoring infrastructure and access to basic services and by assisting the democratic reintegration of their populations. The project had a significant part in ensuring timely completion of the Peace Accords and set the foundation for the Mission's present efforts to reduce rural poverty and promote more broadly based economic growth.  During the life of this project, the largest program in recent history to transfer land to excombatants of a civil war was fully completed.  Following the signing of the Accords, the Mission helped promote democratic elections with broad citizen participation.  A major investment was made to replace and repair destroyed or abandoned infrastructure.  Local government, seriously debilitated during the war, was strengthened, and civilian participation in local government increased.  Accomplishments in the four project areas are noted below. Over 107,000 individuals -- ex-combatants and civilians alike -- received training or TA in agriculture and small business development, and nearly 93,900 loans were provided to increase crop production and establish or expand microenterprises.  According to recent surveys, a large majority of National Reconstruction Plan (NRP) beneficiaries, amounting to almost three quarters of the credit activity's target population, averaged a 33% income increase over a 2-year period. Household income has risen most dramatically in the eastern department of La Union and in the former conflictive zones of Chalatenango, Cabanas, San Vicente, and Usulutan.  By 9/97, 36,059 eligible beneficiaries had received land with the help of project financial or administrative assistance.  The project also played a central role in securing the full cancellation of the land transfer program debt, and in ensuring that program beneficiaries held their land free and clear of all debt. A total of 1.1 million people living in the NRP zone benefitted from more than 2,900 small-scale infrastructure activities, including municipal facilities such as schools and health clinics, water systems, and rural electrification.  Three hundred km of rural electric lines were installed, benefitting some 3,400 families in isolated towns and villages; 2,160 km of rural roads were also rehabilitated, accounting for 24% of the roads needing rehabilitation in the NRP area. Over the life of the project, the NRP channeled nearly $100 million in resources through 137 NGOs to support a wide array of ex-combatant and civilian development activities.  The use of NGOs greatly facilitated the implementation of the NRP, and was essential in providing access to program services by the target population, a large percentage of which is located in remote, war-torn areas.  Assistance to NGOs also strengthened their rural organizational base, improving their advocacy capacity on behalf of rural populations.  The project also contributed significantly to building participatory democracy by supporting 1,378 municipal open town meetings, with over 175,000 Salvadorans participating. The project helped reintegrate ex-combatants into mainstream society by providing vocational and academic training to more than 21,000 ex-combatants, 17,000 of whom received agricultural and microenterprise credit; more than 9,000 war-wounded received rehabilitation services; and 36,059 ex-combatants and tenedores received land under the land transfer program. The peace is an integral part of Salvadoran society. The National Liberation Front (FMLN) is now a powerful political party, sharing control of the legislature with the ARENA party, and controlling, in the political sense, the largest municipalities in the country. Ex-combatants from both sides struggle to advance economically along with a broad segment of Salvadoran society.  Although violence is widespread, organized military conflict is a thing of the past.  In the ex-conflictive zones, as well as in the broader society, potable water, rural roads, electricity, and health and educational services are still in short supply, but exist in far greater abundance than during the war years.  The culmination of the Peace Accords has ratified for the broad reaches of Salvadoran society the desirability of open political and economic structures as the surest road to long-term economic and political development.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","12/1/1998 12:00:00 AM","","Post conflict societies|War recovery|Civil war|Peace|Economic reconstruction|Economic infrastructure|Social development|Democratization|Political participation|Economic and social reintegration|Excombatants","El Salvador","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABR021.pdf","1,276 KB","008540 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (8/92-12/95) to strengthen the ability of environmental NGOs in El Salvador through TA/training and grants (SENS project). SENS substantially increased the capacity of 17 important NGOs to undertake environmental activities in reforestation, soil conservation, environmental education, organic fertilizer production, and protected areas management.  Participating NGOs all developed open membership policies and requirements for member contributions, and established solid administrative and accounting systems, including independent audits.  Their boards and staff received extensive training in strategic planning, fundraising, board functions, administration, gender inclusion, and environmental policy.  All told, 1,558 individuals -- 523 board members, 947 staff, and 88 NGO members - - were trained. Due to SENS support, funding of NGO field activities is more positive than ever.  As much as $1.4 million was made available to NGOs during 1995 through the Initiative of the Americas Fund (FIAES), the Governments of Canada and Japan, and the European Community.  The Interamerican Development Bank's (IDB) Social Investment Fund (FIS) views NGOs as important project implementors.  Project NGOs submitted more than $1.3 million in reforestation projects to the IDB's Fondo de Inversion Social for the 1994-1995 growing season.  Project NGOs implemented more than $700,000 worth of project activities with funding from the Executive Secretariat for the Environment (SEMA), FIS, The Nature Conservancy, World Wildlife Fund, and the National Audubon Society.  Two project NGOs worked in the Parque Imposible/Barra de Santiago, the PROMESA project's demonstration area. During the project, SENS NGOs made important progress in developing practical, productive working relationships with public sector institutions.  NGOs negotiated co-management agreements with the government for management of some of El Salvador's most important protected areas:  Parque Imposible, Bosque Nancuchiname, Barra de Santiago, San Marcelino, and Parque Deininger.  NGOs developed important working relationships with municipal governments in undertaking reforestation efforts and in mitigating the negative environmental impacts of development projects.  Close working relationships were developed with the National Civil Police environmental units to enforce logging and hunting laws in protected areas.  Project NGOs also developed good working relationships with numerous local communities and cooperatives in reforestation, soil conservation, and protected areas management.  One SENS NGO worked with the Cooperative League of the USA (CLUSA) on an organic fertilizer project in Chalatenango. During the life of the SENS project, participating NGOs have grown rapidly, dramatically increasing their environmental activities, as illustrated by the following trends:  (1) The 8 primary SENS NGOs carried out more than 3 times as much environmental work (based on financial investment) in 1994 as in 1992.  (2) SENS NGOs matched every USAID dollar they received with $2.50 from other sources, a 45% increase over USAID's own goal.  (3) Over a 2.5 year period, SENS NGOs increased their collective membership by 40%, from 728 to 1,023.  (4) In 1994, NGOs raised $360,000 from membership and special events, 2-4 times the funds raised from the same activities in 1992.  (5) In 1995, FIS financed $614,000 of reforestation, SEMA funded $56,000 in a variety of projects, the Central America Peace Scholarships Project (CAPS) awarded $250,000 in scholarships to participants of five NGOs, and 10 NGOs were in the process of completing their first FIAES projects, which totaled $834,000.  At the end of 1995, new projects were pending with FIAES, and 11 NGOs had $448,000 worth of projects under consideration by the FONAES-Canadian fund. A key lesson learned is the need for flexibility in NGO selection criteria.  If SENS had not supported NGOs that really did not need its support (e.g., FUTECMA and SALVANATURA), funds would have been available for less prestigious or more local-level NGOs that would probably have benefitted more did than those NGOs.  For other lessons learned, see the abstract of the final evaluation (PD-ABL-679).

"This report assesses the impact of the $2 billion provided to Costa Rica by the U.S. government over the past 50 years.  First, the report provides an overview of Costa Rica from 1945 to 1995, both in macroeconomic terms and by examining how life changed in two rural communities between 1950 and 1995. Next, the study assesses the four broad conceptual approaches used by USAID in Costa Rica (and elsewhere): technical assistance (pre-1961), ""high development"" (the Alliance for Progress -- 1961-72), basic human needs and poverty reduction (1972-81), and economic restructuring and reactivation (1982-92).  Concluding sections assess the effectiveness of USAID assistance, identify particular successes and failures, and present lessons learned. The report concludes that U.S. economic assistance significantly contributed to Costa Rican welfare.  Costa Ricans are healthier, wealthier, and better educated than they would have been without U.S. assistance.  Income distribution is more equal and the country's environmental base is maintained better than would have been the case without U.S. assistance.  Early TA and training were key factors, establishing collaborative relationships between Costa Ricans and Americans and speeding the flow of ideas critical to building the capacity of Costa Rican institutions to deliver basic services and increase economic productivity.  Notable successes included:  the Inter-American Highway, agricultural technical assistance, health projects, export promotion, scholarships, and structural adjustment. Assistance to Costa Rica also met U.S. foreign policy goals. Costa Rica continues as a vibrant democracy with respect for human rights, a model for other countries.  After a rocky period in the early 1980s, its economy has successfully adapted to a changed world economy.  It is also a world leader in ecosystem management.  If all developing countries had matched Costa Rica's progress, there would be fewer complaints about the effectiveness of foreign aid.  The assessment is even more strongly positive with respect to the large-scale assistance provided during the 1980s.  Costa Rica used these U.S. resources effectively, and its leaders, notably then-president Arias, took the lead in formulating an approach that restored peace to Central America. Lessons learned are as follows:  (1) Foreign aid can work, especially in the collaborative atmosphere that is perhaps the key characteristic of U.S. aid to Costa Rica.  (2) Lack of understanding of the development process flawed the high development and basic needs programs.  Two particular problems stand out -- ignorance of government (as distinct from market) failure and of the key role of markets, particularly international trade, in promoting efficiency.  (3) USAID's comparative advantage is due in substantial part to the trust that USAID personnel, on the basis of their in-country experience, were able to engender in host country officials.  (4) Poverty reduction efforts of the late 1970s proved counterproductive due to the unsustainability of host government policies.  (5) Despite the relatively favorable atmosphere, institution building proved more difficult than expected.  (6) USAID's desire to build on its successes in export promotion in the 1980s resulted in an institution too dependent on continued USAID resources.  This lesson probably applies to the entire USAID local currency program.  (7) Although it looked like a success in 1970, Costa Rica's participation in the Central American Common Market actually hindered the country's growth.  (8) Costa Rica is the most successful case of structural adjustment in Central America, though this may be due not just to USAID's comparative advantage in policy reform, but also to the high level of U.S. assistance during the 1980s.  (9) The Costa Rican experience supports the hypothesis of Douglass North that economic development depends on efficient and flexible institutions and procedures, as well as on correct economic policies.  Dialogue by USAID with Costa Rican intellectuals and politicians, particularly during the last two decades, has done much to change the way Costa Ricans perceive their prospects and adapt to a changing world environment.

"Final external evaluation of the Enterprise in Community Development (ECD) project (9/86-9/98), designed to help the Philippine private sector promote participatory and sustainable development activities. Project results have been substantial.  The beneficiaries interviewed claimed that the project improved their living conditions, providing them potable water systems, day care facilities, community-based health programs, and other basic services.  The community organization program enabled the beneficiaries to organize themselves for self-help through cooperative action, access support services from local government units, and avoid usurious loans.  ECD also markedly increased the application of managerial and technical expertise to community development.  A good percentage of project funds were devoted to community organizing, training, and capacity building, to the benefit of both grantees and subgrantees.  Some grantees imparted to their community partners skills in project development, group consultation, participatory planning, bookkeeping, and, most significantly, financial management. The agro-forestry, income-generating projects and the training therein increased beneficiaries' productivity and income levels substantially; further economic benefits will accrue in the next 5 years, when the timber trees planted under the project will be harvested.  The beneficiaries also improved relationships and communication through organizational meetings, group works, and training sessions.  Relationships also improved in areas where both tribal groups and Christians reside.  The training programs developed local leaders who can facilitate meetings and participatory discussions. Beneficiaries take pride in their accomplishments. ECD's development impacts were considerable.  Because of the ECD projects in Davao and Cebu, the denuded forests were replanted with timber and fruit-bearing trees that in the next few years will attract birds back to their habitat.  Day care and health centers, micro-lending, and potable water systems responded to the practical needs of women.  ECD also boosted the economy.  With the increase of productivity and purchasing power of the people, business establishments like sari-sari stores increased tremendously.  Investors and traders from other places now operate in the area.  Transportation services likewise improved, increasing employment opportunities. All the corporate grantees included in this evaluation continued to provide direct assistance to their community partners after the grant period.  To this day, grantee representatives provide monetary and human resource assistance to their community partners either to continue ECD projects or develop new ones.  Corporations that could not accommodate the ECD program into their organizational structure established foundations to carry on community development work.  Those that already had foundations helped them adopt ECD's framework and strategies.  ECD's support for the establishment of the League of Corporate Foundations and other networks of corporate foundations is one of the most significant strategies for ensuring that ECD philosophy and workable approaches will be sustained and mainstreamed in the private sector.  At the subgrantee level, the majority of the community projects developed with ECD funds are doing very well.  While some have serious organizational problems, others have successfully institutionalized their work. Lessons learned are as follows:  (1) Private sector-community partnership is workable and effective.  (2) Equal concern for socioeconomic benefits and community organizing increases program success, especially in marginalized communities.  (3) Corporate management culture is important in community development work.  In this project, it made planners and implementors conscious of value-addition and generated respect for process in managing social enterprises.  (4) Gender and development perspectives are an important component of any community development project.  Without them, programs and projects may unwittingly intensify rather than ease women's workload.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","12/1/1998 12:00:00 AM","","Community development|Business enterprises|Economic development|Partnerships|Private sector|Community services|Income generation|Project sustainability","Philippines","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABR086.pdf","3,303 KB","006975 - University of the Philippines at Diliman.

"PACR of a Cooperative Agreement with Fundacion de Azucar (FUNDAZUCAR) (5/92-12/96), undertaken under the Basic Education Strengthening (BEST) project, for a pilot project to promote girls' attendance and completion of primary school in Guatemala. FUNDAZUCAR implemented the project interventions as designed, although the objective to establish matching arrangements for contributions of funds, services, or resources from other entities was dropped in 12/94.  Specific results were as follows:  (1) The scholarship package was the most effective of the incentives for keeping girls in school and completing primary grades, especially grades 1-3 and most of all the first grade, in which the dropout rate for girls in rural schools is over 40%.  (2) The educational materials package showed some potential for increasing attendance and overall completion rates, although promotion rates were lower in the intervention group for girls in upper grades and especially for girls in first grade. (3) The outreach package (visits by outreach personnel to work with parent committees on the importance of keeping girls in school) was not an effective incentive, especially in terms of first grade promotion, where project girls were 10% below the comparison group.  (4) None of the intervention packages appears to have had an impact on classroom interaction and participation patterns, most likely because the scholarship and outreach packages were focused more on the school level than the classroom level.  (5) Of the three packages, the scholarship package was the most cost-effective. Institutionalization and sustainability objectives were partially met.  Although FUNDAZUCAR determined that it would not continue to implement girls' education programs in the six Departments where the pilot project had focused, the Ministry of Education (MOE) was so convinced of the need to expand the scholarship program that it financed 4,000 girls' scholarships in 1996 and over 35,000 scholarships in 1997, establishing an agreement with a different NGO (FUNRURAL) to manage the program with a strong focus on the predominantly indigenous areas. A 1997-98 Center for Development Information and Evaluation (CDIE) assessment found that the program achieved numerous successes, including:  making basic education for girls a pressing issue; promoting a strong interest in girls' education among some leading business firms and other private sector groups; conducting an experimental pilot project that produced substantive evidence of the impact of scholarships on girls' attendance and retention in school; creating interest in the MOE in girls' education; producing more gender-friendly classroom and teacher materials; and increasing student self-esteem by highlighting the importance of girls and by using indigenous languages.  On the negative side, the CDIE study found that the program was marked by:  an inability to affect substantial system-wide change in the MOE regarding gender; weak integration and institutionalization of gender-sensitive curriculum and teacher training into MOE plans; uneven investment and performance of the private sector in favor of girls' education; and the exclusion of important voices of civil society, particularly Mayan and women's groups, in the effort to promote girls' education. USAID/Guatemala made a strategic choice to establish a small pilot program to test interventions through a private sector NGO rather than pursue system-wide sustainable impacts through the MOE.  The CDIE study criticized that choice, arguing that the project neglected the post-experimental phase of scaling up the effort.  It further argued that USAID should have considered incorporating the girls' component into other BEST components, such as the One Room School (NEU) component, where it could have had a greater possibility of expansion. Another lesson generated from this project is that separation of girls' education issues from other women in development issues is not productive.  Within a democracy, women are an increasingly strong political force and, potentially, a voice for girls' needs and interests.  The USAID project missed the opportunity for this type of engagement by focusing efforts within the MOE and the elite business sector.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","520-0374-A-00-3116-00","","11/1/1998 12:00:00 AM","","Primary education|Access to education|Girls|Disadvantaged groups|Indigenous populations|Rural areas|Pilot projects|Indigenous private voluntary organizations|Scholarships|Educational materials|Incentives","Guatemala","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABR173.pdf","496 KB","008550 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of a project (1994-8/98) to reform and expand India's financial institutions (FIRE project).  Price Waterhouse was the implementing agency. The project had considerable impact on each of its targeted areas. Highlights included the following: (1) A transparent and efficient trade clearance and settlement system reduces the systemic risk faced by investors.  The establishment of the National Securities Depository Ltd. (NSDL) as a modern depository with management and operational systems and a continuous training program is a major step forward for the Indian securities market.  Technical consultancy to establish a clearing corporation, trade guarantee funds, and a stock lending system has helped establish a more efficient market with appropriate risk containment measures.  (2) Technical consultancy to build strong regulatory organizations and enhance transparency in the market was a primary project objective.  Training to support the consultancy was provided for regulatory and exchanges personnel.  Training topics included investor protection, insider training,  and disclosure rules. Testing administration seminars for exchanges and sub-brokers were provided, together with seminars on self-regulatory organization, market surveillance, and the National Association of Securities Dealers' (NASD's) StockWatch Automated Tracking (SWAT) system.  (3) Minimal systemic oversight, surveillance, and enforcement for the market were in place at the beginning of the FIRE project.  Movements toward reform had made little progress.  FIRE was able to develop a consensus among key industry institutions on the steps by which reform could be realized. Best practices were identified and are currently being implemented in stages. (4) The development of the Indian bond market is important if India is to mobilize domestic savings into long-term investments and attract sustainable foreign investment.  In addition, a developed bond market will help India finance its ambitious plans for industrial and infrastructure growth.  The primary market for bonds, in which banks act as the primary buyers, is relatively active.  However, inadequate settlement infrastructure and taxes and restrictions on investments by key institutional investors serve as key impediments to secondary bond market development.  The FIRE project was influential in establishing two industry groups, Fixed Income Brokers Association (FIBA) and Fixed Income Money Market and Derivatives Associations (FIMMDA), that will serve as catalysts for development.  (5) The Indian mutual fund industry is over 30 years old, and is dominated by the Unit Trust of India (UTI), which accounts for 85% of the market.  Since liberalization in 1991, many new funds have been established, including international names such as Alliance Capital, Morgan Stanley, and Franklin Templeton.  The mutual fund industry will bring many new investors to the market and thereby broaden ownership and participation in economic growth.  During its 4 years in India, the FIRE project sought to increase levels of individual investment in mutual funds by increasing the integration of the industry, enhancing self-regulatory standards, and improving industry regulation. (6) In 1995, a task force began to explore the establishment of exchange traded futures and options.  The FIRE project provided technical consultancy experts from the CFTC (unidentified acronym), Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE), Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), and NASD to help prepare the regulatory framework and outline a procedure for establishing a derivatives exchange.  The CBOE technical consultancy team conducted a feasibility study on the benefits and costs of establishing a derivatives market.  In July 1998, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) approved the establishment of separate affiliate exchange traded derivatives.  The industry is expected to begin trading in derivative products in 1999.  (7) In other activities, the FIRE project helped review human resource procedures and introduce worldwide innovations at key capital market institutions.  Assisted by FIRE project training, key market institutions have appointed experienced training supervisors, institutionalized capital market training and research, and begun to establish and develop their own management training programs. Critical to the project's success was the depth of the team's understanding of the complexities of the Indian capital markets. For effective assistance to be given to India, local solutions need to be devised without sacrificing international standards of market operation. It is imperative that the focus on capital market assistance continues.

"Final evaluation of a project (9/94-11/98), part of the Strategies, Training, and Advocacy for Reconciliation (STAR) project, to develop the capacity of women leaders and young activists in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, largely outside of Skopje, to address issues of concern to women.  The evaluation focused on the final year of the project. Delphi International was the implementing agency. Delphi/STAR's strategy of focusing on needs identified by the women themselves was appropriate, but the scope of work was not achievable within the project's time frame.  When the project ended -- abruptly, due to the failure of a further extension or successor project to materialize -- no partner NGO had graduated, and many loose ends were left.  Nonetheless, the project successfully strengthened women's NGOs through excellent facilitation of the subgrant process.  While there remain considerable areas for further growth, the distance the women's NGOs have come since the start of the project and in the 15 months since the last evaluation is impressive. The closure of the STAR project left a gap in funding for small grants for women's NGOs.  Having worked with Delphi/STAR on projects that addressed needs they had identified, women leaders were reluctant to alter their mission to gain donor funds, and most NGOs are surviving from grant to grant, relying on local sources, including locally based donors and group member volunteerism, for support.  On the other hand, the project provided one-to-one support to women's NGOs and the larger NGO community in diversifying funding through private U.S. donors that would otherwise have been unknown to them.  This resulted in small grant funding of over $100,000 to 10 groups in the Yugoslav Successor State (YSS) in 1998, nearly one-third to Macedonian NGOs, and over $400,000 in private funds for YSS NGOs over the life of the project. The grants, most of which met their objectives, demonstrated the shift in NGO mission from humanitarian charity to strengthening other women and women's NGOs for social change.  The growing reach and influence of several of the NGOs was impressive.  In particular, the women from town-based NGOs were uniquely positioned to reach the rural women who are often isolated by traditions which do not allow them freedom of movement and association. While not achieving its lofty goals regarding advocacy, important first steps in developing the advocacy capacity of women's NGOs were taken.  A core of women were trained in policy advocacy and have demonstrated skills in taking advocacy actions.  Individual NGOs became more visible in their communities and strengthened their public image. Women's NGOs expanded their use of the media.  However, the Macedonian women's NGOs will need training, technical support, and mentoring if they are to transform their community education work into successful advocacy. Delphi/STAR enhanced the skills of 16 women leaders and activists in learner-centered training methodologies.  Ten of the women, of various ages, major ethnic groups, and different educational levels, worked in multi-ethnic teams and provided a few well-received training workshops for local women and women's NGOs.  Some of the women have developed participatory training skills that were both unusual by local standards and needed in the Macedonian context.  At the same time, the potential for long-term service as trainers to the women's NGO community was diminished by a lack of time and professional coaching to solidify skills and lack of strategic planning for use of their skills when the Delphi/STAR project closed. An outstanding contribution of the project in Macedonia and the YSS was the consistent creation of environments where multi-ethnic groups could meet, learn about each other, and collaborate on shared issues. As a result, women developed trusting personal relationships and ad hoc collaboration among organizations across ethnic, age, and geographic boundaries that had not previously been possible. USAID should ensure that women's NGOS that are committed to the development of women and civil society have resources targeted to support their work.

"Final evaluation of a project (9/94-12/98), part of the Strategies, Training, and Advocacy for Reconciliation (STAR) project, to develop the capacity of women leaders and NGOs in Bosnia-Hercegovina to address issues of concern to women.  The evaluation focused on the final year of the project.  Delphi International was the implementing agency. During years 1-3, the project focused on fostering cooperation between groups outside the Zenica-Tuzla-Sarajevo triangle in the Federation and groups in the Republic of Srpska (RS).  During year 4, it focused on enhancing linkages among women's groups, creating a core of advocacy-able NGOs and decreasing dependence on the project.  The project's unique contribution to the stability of women's NGOs was its initiation of capacity-building activities during the war, thereby giving the NGOs a head start in carrying forward the structural and programmatic  transformation required under the new funding conditions of the post-war period. Project provision of targeted, timely, flexible, need-responsive TA, training, and financial support supported the development of a few women's NGOs in both the Federation and RS that were equipped to influence the development of civil society. Project support was important in developing the confidence and skills of many leaders and in stabilizing and animating selected NGOs. Delphi/STAR was more flexible and responsive than other donors in the use of subgrant funds.  Two NGO ""anchor groups"" were funded by subgrants for operations costs; this allowed them to establish themselves and leverage sustaining funds.  However, it seems that diminishing donor funds are more likely to support women's NGOs on issues that intersect with the interests of the international community than on the issues that women feel are important, e.g., domestic violence, continued support for victims of trauma, and women's studies. Delphi/STAR's activities on public policy advocacy provided women's NGOs with a critical tool for focusing energy to address the immediate post-war period needs in Bosnia- Hercegovina.  While some women, by their nature and propelled by the situation, were carrying out advocacy-type activities, they had not named or systematized their actions.  Delphi/STAR helped activists and the women's NGO community to name advocacy as an element of their work.  They provided five women with a systematized understanding of key advocacy concepts and encouraged them to develop a localized approach to advocacy through their own work and in the broader NGO community.  The project supported NGOs in advocacy actions in their communities through moral support and subgrants. The project investment in advocacy has begun to bear fruit.  Women's NGOs are beginning to see that they are able to guide and influence social change.  However, the process of developing a critical mass of women and women's NGOs able to collaborate in advocacy efforts has only begun and will have to be furthered if it is to effect broader development of civil society. An outstanding contribution of the project was the development of linkages among women's NGOs across entities and within the Yugoslav Successor States (YSS) through advisory board meetings, issue-oriented exchanges, technical workshops, and meetings.  Women used these opportunities to share information, build trust, strengthen relationships, and discuss joint projects and actions.  The development of ad hoc coalitions of women for advocacy actions in the areas of women's voter education and domestic violence was a tribute to the linkages among the leaders and the NGOs.  Another result was the reduction of fear as witnessed by some Federation women crossing ""enemy territory"" to attend meetings in the RS. Delphi/STAR's unique and important contributions to the development of women's NGOs and to individual women included: modeling multi-ethnic cooperation and valuing diversity; fostering reconciliation among women; developing organizational capacity during the war; providing encouragement; building programs that were needs-responsive, not donor-driven; strengthening linkages among women's NGOs; providing flexible funding; supporting advocacy development; supporting women, women's development, and women's rights; and supporting publications in local languages.

"This study presents practical lessons drawn from USAID's worldwide experience with policy dialogue on the three major areas of USAID environmental assistance -- energy and environmental technology issues, urban environmental management, and natural resources management. Institutional strengthening aspects of the policy dialogue process are also discussed.  Each lesson is first stated succinctly, followed by an explanation of its meaning and importance, a detailed discussion of key issues, and programmatic implications.  Selected case examples demonstrate each lesson.  The lessons are classified into three groups, as provided below. Lessons regarding initiation and context.  (1) Link environmental policy dialogue to economic development and to specific problems that improved policies can address.  Most countries, especially poor ones, are unwilling to make economic sacrifices to enhance environmental quality.  Environmental goals are more easily advanced when they contribute simultaneously to economic progress.  (2) Market the benefits of policy dialogue in terms of local impacts.  Local incentives are the driving force for widespread adoption of improved methods.  Local outreach and training often form necessary complements to environmental policy reform.  (3) Seize targets of opportunity -- timing is everything.  Effective policy dialogue is demand-driven, responsive to local interests and needs.  (4) Involve all key stakeholders, but also make sure that there is a policy champion who can become a significant national player.  (5) Donor coordination is crucial for consistent and effective policies to emerge from the dialogue.  (6) Policy advisors need to approach the policy development process in various settings with diverse parties.  Advisors should seize opportunities to work one-on-one or in small groups with individuals and organizations that could influence the policy process, including private sector representatives, local think tanks, and NGOs. Lessons regarding the process of environmental policy dialogue.  (1) Policy dialogue is not a ""one-shot event"", but a continuing process that requires patience and perseverance.  Unless policy dialogue continues to address emerging problems in the reform process, disappointment and frustration at the lack of results could reverse gains.  Further, even if results are obtained from the start, their sustainability is far from ensured.  At the same time, lack of policy changes, despite sustained policy dialogue, does not necessarily mean failure.  What appears as inaction might actually be a slow change of attitudes and perceptions that will later become manifest in policy change and reform.  (2) Policy dialogue requires flexibility and thrives on open and creative interaction among counterparts.  Flexibility is key to:  reconciling ambitious environmental objectives with actual practice; adapting general laws and regulations to particular situations; and minimizing the economic, social, and political costs of the policy without compromising its objectives.  Open, two-way communications between key players -- often advisors and their counterparts -- must be maintained to ensure continuous adjustment. Lessons regarding the content of environmental policy dialogue.  (1) Policy dialogue depends on solid analysis, which helps advisors and donors establish their credibility and their ability to help determine the causes of environmental problems, especially where these are imperfectly understood.  Finally, a dialogue based on reliable analysis will more likely result in effective policy.  (2) Policy dialogue must be multidisciplinary and recognize cross-sectoral and gender linkages. Donors, policymakers, technicians, and communities need to work together for effective environmental policy dialogue to occur.  A comprehensive understanding of opportunities and constraints is necessary to build the broad-based support that policy changes demand.  Adopting interdisciplinary perspectives can be challenging and demands a continual review of both the environmental and socioeconomic effects of policy change.  Strong consideration of gender and other equity issues enhances the prospects for success.","EPIQ (environmental policy and institutional strengthening|indefinite quantity contract)|Task order no. 01|Contract no. listed on cover as: P.E.-I-00-96-0002-00","Special Evaluation","Documents","PCE-I-00-96-00002-00","","2/1/1998 12:00:00 AM","","Environmental policy|Natural resource management|Urban areas|Environmental technologies|Policy dialogue|Economic development|Public sector|Private sector|National level|Local level|Political leadership|Donor coordination|Development cooperation|Policy analysis|Stakeholder participation","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNACE626.pdf","278 KB","006958 - International Resources Group (IRG)|001798 - Winrock International|000553 - Harvard University.

"Evaluates the ProMedia Program, designed to help professional media entities in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) become independent and sustainable institutions.  Interim evaluation covers the period 9/95-9/98. The first year of program operations was marked with problems, including a lengthy and unproductive process of studies and field assessments; cumbersome planning; poor coordination among implementing partners and confusion regarding roles and functions; and difficulty in finding experienced field advisors. Most importantly, highly differentiated and complex country conditions necessitated senior, experienced long-term Resident Advisors (RAs) and a field-driven management structure.  Most of these problems have been constructively addressed. The current program is characterized by a high degree of country-specific differentiation that makes across-the- board impact measurement very difficult, a relatively high degree of Embassy involvement, and heavy dependence on the senior field staff.  The involvement of the U.S. government in media strengthening is seen as controversial by some U.S. media organizations, though this concern is not shared by CEE media groups.  With regard to impact, improved management is a high priority, there is a strong demand for the types of programs ProMedia provides, individual activities are generally effective (most of all when they are sequentially linked), the program is not viewed as politically intrusive, and there are potential complementarities with other USAID programs.  The cooperative agreement has been increased to $19 million over 4 years, and large programs for Bosnia and Serbia have been added. Strategically, ProMedia programs tend to be activity-driven and have a strong centrifugal tendency.  The country-based approach has led to a diffusion of program identity.  The revised approach relies on the RA as the source of technical strength and the current roster of advisors appears exceptionally well-experienced and qualified.  Use of USAID's results planning framework has helped clarify goals and priorities, but has had limited benefit as a management tool. Finding useful indicators and measuring results has been particularly problematic because of the diversity and country- specific nature of the program, the qualitative nature of many results, and the inherent difficulty of measuring improvements in institutional capacity.  As a consequence, comparative analysis is difficult. With regard to program results, a strong body of anecdotal evidence indicates that ProMedia has been effective in working with and through media associations and that management support in the form of training, workshops, study/training tours to the United States, lecture programs, and targeted management consultations and TA has improved the capacity of media organizations.  The geographic mix and media (TV, radio, press) composition seems generally appropriate.  The media law component leverages private sector money, and there is broad agreement that the technical quality of the work by Covington and Burling has been excellent.  A central issue is whether a more strategic and proactive effort should be made to do more than advise and build legal capacity or whether an effort should be made to focus on building the ability of indigenous advocacy organizations to lobby for reforms. Key conclusions are that:  the building of an independent media is critical to progress toward democratic governance; the decision to adopt a ""field-driven"" approach was correct and needs to be sustained and if possible strengthened; deviations from the original design have in general been well justified; country-based planning should be enhanced; more should be done to integrate lessons learned and develop a stronger central analytical capacity; a simultaneous effort should be made to make the program more programmatic in concept, design,and application; business training and improved management should emerge more clearly as the primary focus area, with association building as the second primary focus area; more explicit attention is needed on designing sustainable assistance strategies; long-term program design should focus on indigenous capacity and ultimate termination of direct USAID assistance; the Cooperative Agreement mechanism should be maintained; and the importance of a consortium arrangement should be reduced in the next Request for Assistance.","Delivery order no. 5","Special Evaluation","Documents","AEP-I-00-96-90005-00","","10/1/1998 12:00:00 AM","","Societies in transition|Political systems in transition|Democratization|Institution building|Mass media|Freedom of the press|Technical assistance|Consultants|Technical training|Professionals|Participants|Workshops|Development project design|Development project management|Performance measurement|Contract management|Field work","Central and Eastern Europe","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABR358.pdf","211 KB","000436 - Development Associates, Inc.","","009520 - USAID.

"Evaluates the impact of USAID-funded long-term training provided 10/91-10/98 to Beninese participants under three regional training programs:  African Graduate Fellowship (AFGRAD), African Training for Leadership and Advanced Skills (ATLAS), and Human Resource Development Assistance (HRDA).  The evaluation was based on interviews with 32 of the 79 Beninese who had completed their training. Overall, the long-term training program is successful and is achieving intended results.  Specific results are as follows:  (1) Over 96% of the participants and most of USAID staff and key informants were satisfied or very satisfied with the program.    (2) Over 34% of the participants did not receive a pre-departure orientation and over half felt they were only somewhat prepared for their U.S. program.  (3) Participants have learned from their U.S. experience, received promotions, and increased their responsibilities or incomes because of the training program.  Many have started private firms and NGOs since their return to Benin.  (4) Many participants and some of their supervisors gave examples of ways in which participants have improved the performance or the capacity of their organizations. (5) Some 88% of the participants have formally or informally shared their knowledge or experience on the job or in their communities.  On average, over 150 colleagues and 230 community people were formally reached by each participant. (6) Impact and results seem more obvious or more achievable in the private sector than in the public sector, probably because in the public sector, the preconditions for applying participants' skills and knowledge, especially a conducive ""climate"", are missing.  Also, in large work settings - - on average, about 400 per work unit in the public sector -- it is difficult for individuals to make an impact at an organizational level unless they hold a very senior position. (7) It is difficult to assess results when the objectives of training are to improve participants' leadership, technical, and professional capacities in order to improve the ability of their organizations to plan and promote sustainable development. Nonetheless, those surveyed generally perceive positive changes at the individual, community,  and organizational levels.  It is also reasonable to say that there are definite associations between the training program and results at the national level and on the future of sustainable development in Benin.

"Summarizes key findings of research conducted by the Evaluation Project between 1992 and 1997 on the maternal child health/family planning (MCH-FP) program in Morocco. Key findings include the following:  (1) Access to contraceptive methods is high, with 98% of women living within 30 km of a facility offering FP services.  The pill is available in almost all government health facilities, the IUD in about two-thirds of urban and one-third of rural facilities.  (2) A 1992 pilot study in five provinces indicated that most facilities had the infrastructure, equipment, and supplies necessary to deliver FP services; pills and condoms were widely available.  Shortcomings included inadequate supplies of Ovrette, less than universal availability of the IUD, and a dearth of printed IEC materials.  These results guided subsequent efforts to improve quality. (3) Despite a substantial investment by the Ministry of Health (MOH) and USAID/Morocco in training service providers, the percentage of women of reproductive age using the IUD only increased from 3% to 4% between 1992 and 1995.  A qualitative study revealed several problems:  provider bias in favor of the pill, rumors regarding ""getting hooked together,"" and fear of side effects.  The study prompted a new cycle of refresher training in regional centers throughout the country.  (4) One of the most innovative aspects of the evaluation work in Morocco has been the development of an interactive computerized system that provides program managers with easy access to 20 MCH/FP indicators.  The system produces tables, graphics, and maps for each indicator over a 5-year period (1992-96), as well as for the different levels (national, regional, and provincial).  It can also be used to generate a chartbook of results for any indicator, year, and level. Numerous secondary analyses were conducted of Demographic Health Survey (DHS) data, including the service availability module (SAM). Four studies involving contraceptive use and other reproductive health (RH) behavior utilized the state-of-the art approach promoted by the Evaluation Project, namely, measuring the effect of FP service environment on contraceptive use.  Key  findings were as follows:  (1) The percentage of women who discontinued their contraceptive method within the first 12 months varied from 1% for the IUD to 39% for the pill to 51% for traditional methods.  Reasons for discontinuation varied by method:  pill users tended to desire another pregnancy, whereas IUD users cited side effects.  Failure rates (by 12 months) were much lower for the IUD (3%) and the pill (6%) than for traditional methods (22%). Results point to the importance of improving method-specific counseling. (2) Data from 567 matched couples from the 1992 DHS allowed for a husband/wife comparison of fertility desires.  The analysis examined three possible factors affecting a woman's contraceptive use:  her own fertility desires, her perception of the husband's fertility desires, and the husband's actual fertility desires.  For women wanting to delay a birth, only the first two mattered.  However, when a woman wanted to limit her family size, both her perceptions and her husband's actual fertility desires influenced her behavior.  Further emphasis on male involvement in FP will help improve husband-wife communication on this subject.  (3) Women who used MCH services were more likely than others to adopt contraception, even after controlling for other factors.  This relationship was stronger where the FP service environment was more favorable.  (4) A study of non-users who ""intended to use"" in 1992 and their actual contraceptive use as of 1995 revealed that (a) stated intentions are an important predictor of subsequent use, and (b) a favorable FP supply environment facilitates contraceptive adoption.  The results indicate that the Morocco FP program not only satisfies existing demand but also generates new demand.  (5) Two studies assessed the impact of the FP program on contraceptive use.  The first used cross- sectional data to test the relationship of program factors (access/quality) and community- and individual-level characteristics on a series of five RH behaviors.  Results were inconclusive, most probably for methodological reasons.  The second analysis, which used a more powerful analytic approach based on longitudinal data, demonstrated the effect on contraceptive use of the supply environment, especially the training of nurses and the infrastructure at the closest facility. These findings suggest that in countries with mature programs, longer observation periods are necessary to evaluate impact.","Project title: The EVALUATION project","Special Evaluation","Documents","DPE-3060-C-00-1054-00|DPE-Q-02-91-00055-00","","5/1/1998 12:00:00 AM","","Maternal child health care|Family planning promotion programs|Development program evaluation|Family planning research|Impact assessment|Quality of care|Fertility preferences","Morocco","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNACG147.pdf","2,905 KB","000821 - University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

"Evaluates the Communal Areas Management Programme for Indigenous Resources (CAMPFIRE), a component of the Natural Resources Management Project (NRMP II) in Zimbabwe.  Interim evaluation covers the period 1989-7/98. In favorable habitats of Zimbabwe's agriculturally marginal communal lands, CAMPFIRE had a stable track record of producing meaningful benefits for local residents.  Where wildlife is less abundant, economic returns have been mixed and show less promise.  By conferring proprietorship of wildlife resources on the Rural District Councils (RDCs), benefits accrue to populations residing near richly endowed megafauna.  Most revenues still derive from the consumptive, sustainable use of this resource.  The maintenance of trophy quality and overall wildlife numbers suggest that wildlife populations are being sustainably exploited.  Most observers consider the hunting quotas in CAMPFIRE areas to be conservative. Although CAMPFIRE's empowering philosophy is well- entrenched among both local populations and government departments, devolution of resource management authority below the RDC level remains problematic. On average (though with significant variation), the RDCs have respected the guidelines for revenue distribution.  Since the program began, RDCs have devolved 58% of revenue to the producer wards, retaining an average of 25% for management fees and 15% as a district levy. Communities use these revenues in various ways, including cash distributions, social infrastructure, and micro-enterprise investments.  Much of these benefits improves the quality of life of women and children in CAMPFIRE districts.  Policies are needed to devolve tenure security over resources below the district level; such empowerment would enable pilot interventions to become more generalized in the producer community and RDC institutions.  The institutionalization of participatory quota- setting offers a model for other resources and practices. CAMPFIRE's early success was founded upon an established international wildlife market, resulting in both socioeconomic benefits and sustainable management of wildlife, particularly the African elephant.  For the past several years, CAMPFIRE, with USAID support, has begun diversifying into other conservation-based economic activities. However, with the possible exception of ecotourism, this diversification does not enjoy ready-made markets.  Accordingly, successful models for these alternatives will take longer to develop, making long-term support for this effort essential.  Long-term sustainability of CAMPFIRE and its RDC and local staff depends on the economic growth of viable diversified natural resource enterprises, possibly including development of non-consumptive tourism or the inclusion of fish, forestry products, and minerals. NRMP II support has facilitated the rapid expansion of CAMPFIRE to the national level, but spreading CAMPFIRE Development Fund (CDF) institutional grants to some 20 Rural Districts dilutes benefits and the efforts of the implementing partners.  In some cases, the project appears to be creating unsustainable levels of staffing.  Absent an expanded revenue base, staff reductions will be necessary when project funds run out. The Africa Resources Trust's (ART) advocacy and networking activities underscored a rapidly widening and fundamental rift between conservation NGOs and animal rights advocacy groups.  CAMPFIRE became a lightening rod for opposition to sustainable use initiatives, especially those involving trophy hunting and elephants.  Ultimately, ART spearheaded a government and NGO counter-response, using its own funding but building on the strengths it had acquired through NRMP II. Two key USAID assumptions about CAMPFIRE may increasingly become untenable, that: ""adequate ownership and use rights continue to exist for individuals and communities to manage resources sustainably and to benefit directly from that management,"" and ""CAMPFIRE communities can manage population growth, particularly due to in-migration from less developed areas.""  CAMPFIRE leadership must concentrate on such key high- level challenges rather than on day-to-day program implementation.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","AEP-0085-I-00-6021-00","","7/1/1998 12:00:00 AM","","Natural resource management|Natural resource utilization|Community based delivery|Communal land|Wildlife resources|Wildlife hunting|Decentralization|Local groups|Economic benefit","Zimbabwe","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABR694.pdf","20,794 KB","008360 - Mitchell Group, Inc.|001035 - South-East Consortium for International Development (SECID)","","008628 - USAID.

"Evaluates the Global Information Networks in Education (GINIE) project, designed to help governmental agencies, international organizations, and NGOs provide educational and counseling services to citizens of or refugees from nations in emergency or post-emergency transition.  Internal evaluation covers the period 10/95-9/97 against a PACD of 5/98. GINIE has fulfilled its contractual obligation to build a prototype database of educational materials for nations in crisis and transition. Moreover, GINIE staff have adapted the materials, organization, and presentation of the database to user needs and extend its usefulness by adding: (1) an online search engine, special topic websites for comprehensive, rapid access to GINIE materials, and links to related websites; (2) a capability for online conferencing; (3) secured websites for online exchanges; (4) listservs for sending information directly to registered users via e-mail; (5) e-mail answering systems accessed via the main GINIE website or from the special topic pages; and (6) a process for automatically submitting and uploading materials to the database via the webpage.  With no additional funding, GINIE far exceeded its mandate to build a database by soliciting volunteers and leveraging the resources and staff of related endeavors to benefit the many complementary elements of the project. GINIE offers unique, computer-based communication and information services dealing with educational issues for nations in crisis or transition, services not found elsewhere in this integrated, accessible format.  Though still in the prototype stage, it has tremendous potential for greater usability and extension.  It has already shown it can be a consistent, responsive, and stable base of support during times of crisis and transition, providing easily accessible educational materials, as well as contacts, advice, and support from experienced professionals.  The continued support of multiple agencies is needed to maintain the growth of the collection. Currently, GINIE's strengths remain underutilized because they are underpublicized.  Funding agency and participating organizations must make it a priority to support those who could benefit most from GINIE services.  There is also a need for formal agreements among user organizations for ongoing contributions to the database.  Funding should be made available to digitize print and media materials when necessary. Agency participants, not GINIE staff or students, should also assume responsibility for generating, moderating, participating, and maintaining discussion topics in the online conferences for the benefit of all.

"Evaluates project to control anaemia in women of reproductive age (WRA) in Malawi's Thyolo District.  The project is being implemented by Project HOPE in collaboration with MotherCare and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.  Evaluation covers the period 6/1995-3/98 against a PACD of 6-7/98. The project has developed in two phases.  Phase I consisted of operational research to determine the prevalence, causes, and risk factors of anaemia in WRA in the impact area. Phase II has implemented interventions, based on Phase I findings, to reduce by 50% the prevalence of mild to moderate anaemia in pregnant and recently delivered women in the impact area, and by 30% the prevalence of severe anaemia in pregnant women and recently delivered women in the impact area.  The interventions have included training health care providers (hospital/health center and community levels); developing and disseminating information, education, and communication (IEC) materials; and iron trials. The program has contributed positively to improving women's reproductive health.  Community members have been sensitized to the dangers of maternal anaemia, and the interventions to address the problem have been well received. Prenatal care efforts to prevent and treat maternal anaemia have been implemented satisfactorily as compared with postnatal activities.  A consistent supply of iron tablets has motivated mothers to attend prenatal care.  Compliance with taking iron tablets has generally been good, despite the side effects experienced and some rumors and misconceptions.  Providers and supervisors involved in implementing program interventions both at hospital/health center and community levels are working diligently despite constraints. The following problems need to be addressed.  (1) Postnatal follow-up has not been reinforced, and community members are generally unaware of the need for it.  Most women have begun prenatal care after 24 weeks gestation despite intensified IEC on early prenatal attendance. Problems in accessibility to health care facilities and cultural beliefs have been the contributing factors.  (2) IEC materials are appropriate, but health care providers have not used them consistently during individual counseling sessions.  Most health care providers did not have adequate one-to-one counseling with clients because it was time-consuming.  (3) IEC messages on preventing maternal anaemia has focused on taking iron tablets, with less emphasis on eating required nutrients.  Apart from taking iron tablets, community members have used traditional methods of treating anaemia, using leaves from guava, mlombwa, and avocado pears.  (4) Distribution of iron tablets has been good, but the current recordkeeping system makes it difficult to account for the amount of iron tablets consumed.  Supervision of health care providers has been inadequate due to transport problems.  (5) Dependence on donor funding has hampered the sustainability of program activities. Effective sustainability plans are needed.","Project title: MotherCare II","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","3/1/1998 12:00:00 AM","","Maternal health care|Disease prevention and control|Iron deficiency anemia|Prenatal care|Health professional education|IEC|Dietary supplements|Iron|Project sustainability|Post partum care","Malawi","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABS216.pdf","2,543 KB","005553 - John Snow, Inc.

"Final report of the contractor, Creative Associates International, Inc. (CREA), on a project (1996-11/98) to support community revitalization projects (CRPs) in Angola. In Angola, implementation of CREA's Post-conflict Target Area Strategy (TAS) model for CRPs in war-torn communities focused on resettlement, reintegration, and selected development needs of war-torn municipalities.  Until the outbreak of renewed hostilities, the model was successful, particularly in Balombo, in establishing durable patterns of participation and sustainable self-help interventions by unifying fractured social, political, and traditional structures; moving communities out of paralysis caused by conflict; providing start-up capital for community investment; revitalizing municipalities' farm-to-market patterns; and developing interested, representative community organizations and associations.  Programming to mitigate armed violence was not possible, however, and while conflict prevention was not within the program's purview, events in Angola have proven deeply disappointing, particularly in light of the great reconciliation strides taken in Balombo.  Project experience taught that the model requires a seasoned, well-trained, and knowledgeable staff; a consistent methodology; and minimum political, social, economic, and cultural conditions (detailed in the report.) Key findings and lessons learned are as follows: (1) If properly implemented, CRPs can facilitate the transition from war to peace by intervening in various degrees throughout the relief-to-development continuum. (2) Strategic programming -- with a regional presence of a year or more -- contributes exponentially to greater outreach; improved communication linkages; increases in freedom of movement, citizen participation, productivity, and reconciliation; and ameliorated living conditions.  (3) Larger, symbolic infrastructure projects are an effective way to establish presence and initiate activities.  They are generally what the communities want (other than free distributions) and give staff an opportunity to test the community's organizational capacities, understand its power dynamics, identify effective leaders and workers, and develop logistics systems.  (4) In CREA/Angola's spheres of influence, programming for reconciliation between civilians is both feasible and sustainable, even in the event of conflict.  (5) Where two opposing factions control villages, the implementer must strike a balance along political lines.  Emergency assistance does not contribute to a perceived potential for a better quality of life; sustainable projects do. (6) A ""tough love"" attitude by the implementing organization is effective in social mobilization for project identification and implementation and for sustainability of interventions.  (7) Unnecessary payment for services and materials available in the community cheapens the perceived value of the project, encourages corruption, and lessens civic pride and feelings of ownership.  (8) Community investment, largely through participation, is required if projects are to have a chance at sustainability.  (9) Communities are more likely to participate in a project if they have had an active role in its selection and design.  (10) Infrastructure CRPs (especially roads, bridges, and schools) were seen as symbols of the international community's belief and commitment to the peace process.  (11) CRPs have helped reestablish links between communities under UNITA (National Union for the Total Independence of Angola) and MPLA (Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola) influence.  CRPs targeting shared infrastructure needs catalyzed interaction among communities separated by the war. (12) The communities have rehabilitated or opened 396 km of roads and rehabilitated or built 73 bridges under the TAS model.  (13) An example of a labor-intensive infrastructure project implemented without any incentive for community participation besides promotion is the irrigation channel.  During the life of the project, CREA/Angola and participating communities opened 412 km of irrigation canals and sources of potable water. (14) Schools are indicators of normalcy, and communities are willing to work together and contribute all locally available materials and manual labor for school construction.  (15) Productivity CRPs benefit self-starters in communities, and support them as role models for other community members.  (16) Except for some specific vocational training courses, projects that did not directly or indirectly benefit women were generally judged by the communities to be not in their best interests.","Statistical annexes: PD-ABS-301","Special Evaluation","Documents","AOT-0000-C-00-5196-00","","11/1/1998 12:00:00 AM","","Post conflict societies|Disaster recovery|Disaster rehabilitation|Development projects|Community development|Community participation|Project sustainability|Impact assessment|Economic and social reintegration|Political reconciliation|Development strategies|Community facilities|Bridges|Road construction|Educational facilities|Water supply structures|Irrigation|Potable water","Angola","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABS300.pdf","4,089 KB","001341 - Creative Associates International, Inc.

"Evaluates the Women's Reproductive Health Initiative (WRHI) in Ukraine. Interim evaluation covers the period 1994-11/97. The project has achieved most of its strategic objectives, but may not be achieving goals to decrease abortions or increase contraceptive use.  This may be in part because the project has only been operational for 3 years.  In addition, however, the assumptions linking strategic objectives with project goals may be invalid; e.g., contraceptive use may have been fairly high when the project began.  Also, with very low fertility, virtually no use of sterilization, the lack of acceptance of unintended pregnancies, and the ready availability of abortion, the abortion rate will likely remain relatively high. Seven Cooperating Agencies (CAs) were assigned specific roles and given unusual autonomy in achieving the project's strategic objectives. All have performed effectively, but the large number of CAs working in each oblast has created some confusion, and significant conflicts between some CAs were never resolved.  Some CAs fault USAID for inadequate project leadership. Family planning (FP) services are provided mainly in clinics run by specialists and are not a routine part of primary, postpartum, or gynecological care.  FP services are also provided in separate FP rooms (encouraged by WRHI), but only at certain times by special doctors.  FP counseling and services are provided in most of the government's ""Ladies Consultation Centers.""  Overall, Ukraine's emphasis on hospitals and hospitalization in order to centralize health care and allow the specialist a way to focus care seems to decrease the integration of preventive care. The project has not adequately focused on men, even though they probably account for over 50% of contraceptive protection, given the wide use of withdrawal and condoms.  On the other hand, clinical observation of sterilization, intrauterine device (IUD) services, and counseling services continue, as in the 1996 assessment, to receive high marks. Contraceptive commodities, particularly low-cost or free condoms, are not available in sufficient numbers.  Infection prevention practices appear satisfactory.  Demonstration sites have been established in urban areas, but FP services are not available to many rural residents. The quality of training delivered by the CAs appears to be high and well received.  Important innovations in both content and training methodology have been institutionalized.  However, some information presented in refresher training, especially regarding oral contraceptives, is not consistent with international guidelines.  No national FP guidelines have been developed to guide training content. Second generation training conducted by Ukrainian trainers is proceeding well and on schedule.  At least 1,000 service providers have received FP training, and trainers in the three oblasts are now ready to train trainers in the ""expansion"" oblasts.   Training materials have been translated and adapted for use in Ukraine for refresher courses and national FP training, but funds are not available to produce them for all trainees. Much has been accomplished through information, education, and communication (IEC) efforts of obstetricians/gynecologists (OB/GYN) associated with the regional maternal child health (MCH) centers that have been the primary partners in this project. WHRI has stimulated and supported these efforts, some of which had been initiated before the project began.  On the down side, IEC has been too small a part of the project, and its focus -- on OB/GYNs based in tertiary training institutions in three oblasts -- is too narrow.  The project has not even initiated contact with some major participants in reproductive IEC in Ukraine. The family-centered maternity care (FCMC) component has had remarkable success with very limited funding.  It is popular with women, and doctors and midwives are beginning to see its advantages even though, as ""low technology"", it goes against the Ukrainian belief that the most technically sophisticated care is best.  This component helps to balance the project, which otherwise would focus almost exclusively on contraception in a country with a very low birth rate, and also verifies USAID's interest in maternal and infant health.  Every component of the FCMC approach is supported by conclusive medical evidence of substantial health benefits.  This should be true of all project components.","Project title: Population technical assistance (POPTECH)|POPTECH assignment no. 97-118-060","Special Evaluation","Documents","CCP-3024-Q-00-3012-00","","4/1/1998 12:00:00 AM","","Health delivery|Reproductive health|Women|Strategic objectives|Contractors|Family planning services|Family planning education|IEC|Maternal health care|Family health care|Government policy|Abortion","Ukraine","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABS347.pdf","131 KB","010110 - BHM International, Inc.|001131 - The Futures Group International, Inc.

"Final evaluation of a project (9/93-9/98) to improve family planning (FP) services in sub-Saharan Africa through operations research and TA (OR/TA II).  The Population Council (PC) was the main implementing agency. The project has responded to USAID's request to diversify the project research portfolio to encompass a broad reproductive health (RH) agenda. Research is being carried out in a mix of countries, reflecting both USAID mission priorities and PC's willingness to optimize ""windows of opportunity"". Research topics clearly respond to new emphases in RH and build upon PC's strengths.  Work with adolescents, postabortion care, integrated services, and female genital mutilation (FGM) is likely to yield important contributions to the field. To date, the project has initiated 47 OR subprojects, of which 22 were completed.  Nearly half the studies are diagnostic or evaluative, and 12 of these are situation analyses (SAs).  One-fifth of the studies are interventions, such as testing new methods of service delivery and improved quality of care, and linking FP services with postabortion care. Although USAID/Washington had expected more intervention studies, USAID missions are more interested in diagnostic or evaluative studies, particularly SAs.  OR interventions are not always called for, in large part because the SAs so clearly identify weak service delivery functions that can be improved through direct intervention rather than through experimental testing. SAs   responsibility for which has moved to the new MEASURE project --  also help service providers, program managers, NGOs, ministries of health (MOH), and donors understand components that contribute to high-quality programs and identify opportunities for change.  USAID should ensure that follow-on activities to the SA, such as data interpretation workshops and national and regional seminars, which the present project does well, are continued.  Among the large intervention studies, those in Burkina Faso and Ghana are testing different models of community- based service delivery and use of different levels of service providers.  In Kenya, an experimental design examined different modes of delivering postabortion FP, and a study in Senegal is testing the effect of improved quality of services delivered at model clinics.  A study in Zambia is comparing community-based strategies to improve RH among youth. About half of project activities consisted of TA to International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF) affiliates, regional research organizations, MOHs, and cooperating agencies. To cope with the growing demand for SAs, the project has trained a cadre of 40 professionals to serve as consultants to other countries.  Local capacity was also enhanced through long- standing relationships and informal training derived from subproject implementation and the day-to-day presence of host- country social scientists (HCSS) and PC Fellows. Institutionalization, a project priority, has included:  teaching administrators and decisionmakers the means to use OR; informing FP and RH agencies how to analyze and resolve problems, conduct OR, and apply OR results; providing TA and training for African researchers in OR protocols and implementing research with service delivery agencies; and providing TA to disseminate OR results.  The project also provides support and TA to institutions and community health laboratories; has worked to strengthen Evaluation and Research Units (ERU) in Zimbabwe, Ghana, Zambia, Burkina Faso, and Senegal; and is providing support in OR research design and implementation to the newly established Center for Training and Research in RH (CEFOREP).  However, there still is not a critical mass of sufficiently skilled researchers to implement OR without TA. Efforts to disseminate and use project information are detailed in the report.","POPTECH project no. 97-117-056","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","CCP-3024-Q-00-3012-00","","2/1/1998 12:00:00 AM","","Family planning research|Operations research|Reproductive health|Health delivery|Technical assistance|National level|Regional level|Information dissemination|Educational materials|Institution building|Human capacity development|Research centers|Data analysis|Research management|Research utilization|Situation analysis","Africa south of Sahara","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABS555.pdf","225 KB","010110 - BHM International, Inc.|001131 - The Futures Group International, Inc.

"Evaluates Essential Services for Health in Ethiopia (ESHE), a program/project designed to improve the level of service of and access to primary and preventive health care (PPHC) in Ethiopia.  Interim evaluation covers the period 8/95-5/98. Overall, ESHE is supporting national health policy as expressed in the Health Sector Development Program (HSDP) and is contributing to its own strategic objective of increased use of PPHC services.  With relatively minor modifications, ESHE is likely to have a favorable, long-term impact on the health status of the population of Ethiopia through its increased budgetary allocations for health, particularly for PPHC; more effective management and planning; and direct support for increased access and use of essential services, such as immunization, maternal/child health/family planning (MCH/FP), STI/HIV/AIDS control, and curative services.  The prospects are favorable for ESHE to build on advances in improved services at the central level and in focal project areas and to have such advances replicated in other regions. Progress has been made in FP, including condom social marketing, through effective NGO programs, and in PPHC enhancement through capacity building and systems development in the project focus area, the Southern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples Region (SNNPR). On the down side, progress in health care financing (HCF) has been constrained by the late start-up of the project and by delays in establishing formal counterpart structures, including the set up and staffing of the HCF Secretariat. Additionally, there is insufficient ""ownership"" of ESHE by the Government of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia (GFDRE) and in particular by the central Ministry of Health (MOH), although this does not appear to be an issue in the SNNPR.  The situation at the central level may stem from communication problems on all sides, which are creating a feeling that the central departments are being ""left out"" of the project's planning and implementation.  USAID's system of project funding may also be contributing to the lack of ownership.  Because of present USAID policies, it is difficult to pass bilateral funds directly through the GFDRE; substantial additional investment in management and accounting capacity would be needed to facilitate this process. Although progress is being made in strengthening the relevant systems at the central and regional levels, there does not appear to be a more cost-effective option for the immediate future than using TA contractors or other mechanisms to facilitate and account for the flow of funds. Other salient issues are as follows:  (1) Several MOH departments expressed a need for other capacity-building activities at the central level, such as information, education, and communication (IEC) activities and supplies management (essential drugs and FP commodities). These are two essential components of the HSDP that will directly affect ESHE's strategic objective of increasing use of health services.  (2) ESHE could have greater impact and improve communications and coordination, particularly at the central level, if the technical advisors of the project's Cooperating Agencies (CA) were located within the MOH and had well-defined terms of reference and job responsibilities agreed upon by all parties.  For maximum impact, the Basic Support for Institutionalizing Child Survival (BASICS) project's HCF advisor should be located in the MOH's Projects and Planning Department with close links to the Health Services and Training Department.  (3) In the SNNPR, where progress has been more visible, the Regional Health Bureau has expressed its general satisfaction with achievements. However, TA for capacity building and systems strengthening in the SNNPR will be required beyond the life of the current contract.  (4) The performance indicators for some components and for intermediate results relating to ESHE's results packages may be too numerous and too general, and it may be difficult to manage and measure progress adequately.  Includes recommendations.

"Final evaluation of a matching grant (1993-98) to strengthen the institutional capabilities and field impact of the Katalysis North/South Development Partnership and its development partners in Central America. The evaluation focuses on three of the four project partners -- Cooperacion para el Desarrollo Rural Occidental (CDRO) and Asociacion de Mujeres en Desarrollo (MUDE) in Guatemala, and Organizacion de Desarrollo Empresarial Femenino (ODEF) in Honduras.  The Belize Enterprise for Sustainable Development (BEST) was terminated from the partnership in 1996. Since the midterm evaluation, Katalysis has undergone a notable transformation that has enhanced its capacity to support partner NGOs in poverty reduction.  The key change has been a shift from a multi-focus to a single program focus. Katalysis has strengthened its program in terms of personnel, system development, program planning, and partner TA. Decisionmaking has been decentralized by creation of a regional field office and a headquarters management team, and by broadening the board of directors. Each partner has received Katalysis training and support to strengthen its financial management and accounting systems, strategic planning capacity, and fundraising capacity. Use of partnership exchanges and the cross-training of partners in microcredit methodologies have been strong and well-received. A notably weak area, as also noted in the midterm evaluation, has been the development of monitoring and reporting systems. Katalysis provided substantive assistance in developing the agriculture training and extension (AGTE) aspects of partner programs. A major achievement was the co- establishment with ODEF of the Herencia Verde agricultural center.  After refocusing its programming, however, Katalysis eliminated AGTE support.  Consequently, ODEF and CDRO decided to continue agricultural programming on their own, MUDE to eliminate it. With completion of the microcredit team in late 1997, Katalysis has adopted a more aggressive stance in partner application of microlending methodologies.  This more rigorous approach has been an important catalyst for partners in refining and consolidating their community banking efforts.  Despite the delays encountered, Katalysis has created a context for community banking and has met the aggregated measures specified in the detailed implementation plan (DIP).  Both ODEF and CDRO met the revised DIP goals for establishing community banks; only CDRO has lagged, completing less than 2/3 of its DIP targets.  Overall, more than twice the DIP target number of community banks were established and the amount of credit disbursed totaled over $1.2 million, against a goal of $364,000. Discussions with bank members and observations at a few bank meetings attest to the transformative power of community banking that has been cited by Katalysis and in a related impact study.  In all three partner programs, bank members report higher standards of living for themselves and their families, a goal of the matching grant.  In rural areas, community banks have been active in sponsoring community wide activities such as local clean-up campaigns, school repair, and community center construction.  It appears that many community banks, especially those associated with ODEF, are becoming local ""engines of development"" through loans provided to non-members from the internal accounts. In moving forward to strengthen its own and its partners' capacity in microcredit, Katalysis has begun to implement long-overdue standards and systems that will enable partners to strengthen their programs and ensure client performance.  The difficulty is to maintain a flexibility appropriate to distinct partner programs while ensuring quality of service.  The issue has been as much ""how"" these new strategies are implemented as ""why."" Katalysis's shift to a single program focus and its realignment not only of an institution but also of a partnership network pose three key challenges:  (1) to strike a balance between consultation and direction in helping partners implement best practices; (2) to ensure an appropriate balance in the partnership core and microcredit focus that plays to Katalysis's strength and strategic competence; and (3) to maintain a workable balance of breadth and depth in Katalysis's programming of a network vision.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","FAO-C-00-95-00036-00","","4/1/1998 12:00:00 AM","","Development organizations|Private voluntary organizations|Indigenous private voluntary organizations|Partnerships|Networks|Institution building|Credit|Microenterprises|Loan administration|Human capacity development|Development program planning|Women in development|Agricultural training|Financial institutions|Banks|Community based delivery|Procedural development|Microfinance","Central America|Honduras|Guatemala","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABS641.pdf","4,044 KB","006190 - AMA Technologies, Inc.","","007747 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of a matching grant (1993-98) to World Relief Corporation (WRC) to develop self-sustaining microenterprise credit programs in selected developing countries. Participating primary country programs included Honduras, Burkina Faso, Mozambique, and Rwanda. Liberia also participated. Each country program exceeded nearly every grant target.  Over 56,000 people benefitted directly, vs. a target of 20,100.  The total number of community banks at the end of the grant period was 1,002.  Average loan size ranged from $57 to $160, with the total outstanding loans totaling $1.97 million. The repayment rate has been 87%-100%.  Member savings total $1.36 million.  Some 94% of program participants were women, vs. a target of 91%. During the course of the matching grant, WRC has developed an expertise in initiating microfinance programs in the wake of complex disasters.  This is evident by its work in Liberia, where clients continued to repay their loans in the midst of civil strife; in Mozambique, where everyone said it could not be done; and in Rwanda, where the population was highly mobile and insecure following the genocide and return of refugees.  Even in Burkina Faso, the program continued in the face of drought.  A painful test of the resiliency of the community banking approach and of the microentrepreneurs themselves will be made in the coming months in Honduras following the devastating hurricane and floods in October 1998. WRC has also established successful microenterprise development (MED) programs in non-matching grant countries in political turmoil (Cambodia and Peru). WRC has been recognized within the microfinance and donor communities for its achievements, particularly in demonstrating that microfinance can be a successful developmental tool in complex disaster situations. The role of the matching grant in achieving this impact has been crucial, enabling WRC to continue to work with partners as well as with country offices during a downturn in overall institutional income, and to provide TA to non-matching grant countries.  It has also influenced thinking in other program areas and promoted collaboration across program areas and departments. Key lessons learned are as follows:  (1) Microcredit can work in complex disaster recovery situations.  (2) No program is immune from external forces.  (3) Bad practices of other programs can undermine the best practices of one's own program. (4) What works draws attention. (5) Institutional capacity building takes time, especially when complex disasters break down local systems and organizations and there are losses of trained human resources.  (6) Technical capacity at headquarters level must be sufficiently deep to be able to support the variety of situations and partners on a timely basis.  (7) Methodology evolves continuously.  (8) Prudent new product development is essential to meeting client needs and to promoting institutional sustainability. (9) New issues are emerging that need to be addressed, such as legal status, security of staff and clients, fraud, product development, etc, (10) Partners need capacity building in strategic and business planning. (11) The importance of a good management information system (MIS) grows as the institution and its portfolio grows.  (12) Better financial management is required as the programs become larger and more complex. (13) Community banking can work with male clients, although there may be compelling reasons to focus on women.  (14) Many significant achievements and impacts are not reflected in proxy indicators and must be described rather than quantified.

"To respond to the high prevalence of cholera and diarrheal diseases and observed inadequacies in health worker knowledge and practice in Central America, the Institute of Nutrition for Central America and Panama (INCAP) developed and implemented a distance education course on the management of cholera and diarrheal diseases in El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua. The course included preprinted educational materials delivered to participants one chapter at a time, group meetings at the beginning and end of the nine-month program, and fieldbased tutors who provided a day-long practice session at mid-program, written responses to homework submitted by the participants at the end of each chapter, and one-on-one tutoring. The course's impact on the knowledge and practices of participating doctors and nurses in Guatemala was evaluated. Results showed significant improvements in patient assessment and diagnostic practices as well as knowledge.
