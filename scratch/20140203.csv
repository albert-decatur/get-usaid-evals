"The overall purpose of Strengthening Communities through Integrated Programming (SCIP) is ""to integrate health, HIV/AIDS, water/sanitation, and rural enterprise components with nutrition and agriculture to strengthen communities in Nampula and Zambezia."" &nbsp;SCIP utilizes this innovative approach to activity delivery at the provincial, district, and community levels. &nbsp;The objectives of this mid-term evaluation were two-fold: first, assess the effectiveness of integration as a model for service delivery by SCIP; and second, &nbsp;assess processes and mid-term progress toward results in selected areas and determine whether interventions designed are contributing toward the desired result, with the objective of informing future programming decisions (e.g., scale-up, modification, and enhancement) during the second half of SCIP's implementation. &nbsp;The evaluation team was provided eight core questions: (1) to what extent is the SCIP activities integrated in practice; (2) what have been the management and implementation benefits of activity integration; (3) what are the management and implementation challenges of activity integration and do certain activity areas get reduced attention because of the management needs of other activity areas; (4) to what extent is the SCIP strategy strengthening the relationship between Community Leader Councils (CLCs) and other government structures; (5) of the organizations supported by SCIP, are community organizations more likely to continue their activity after completion of the SCIP activities; (6) to what extent has SCIP succeeded in creating demand for health services and which interventions are the biggest drivers of increased demand for health services; (7) to what extent do youth participants and their families perceive youth farmers clubs to be beneficial and what aspects of the Youth Farmer Clubs (YFCs) are most beneficial and effective; and (8) to what extent do former participants in YFCs who ""aged-out"" of the program continue to employ lessons learned as part of YFC participation? &nbsp;A summary of evaluation results states that overall, integration of services is occurring, and is strongest at the community level, with most progress attributable to work that both SCIP partners do with and through community mechanisms. However, in both provinces, SCIP activities experience government of Mozambique (GOM) and donor-related limitations to full integration. &nbsp;(Excerpt, modified)","'Evaluation Report'|Cover title: USAID/Mozambique strengthening communities through integrated programming performance evaluation|Evaluated project title: Strengthening communities through integrated programming (SCIP)","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID-656-T0-13-00001|RAN-I-00-09-00016-00|AID-RAN-I-00-09-00016","","1/1/2014 12:00:00 AM","","Integrated health care|HIV/AIDS|Agricultural development|Nutrition|Water sanitation|Access to services|Community health care|Community services|Community mobilization|Youth","Mozambique","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00JNNZ.pdf","1,368 KB","001891 - International Business and Technical Consultants, Inc.

"This is a report on the mid-term performance evaluation of the Advancing National Integration (ANI) project funded by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) Mission in Georgia. &nbsp;The project is being implemented by the United Nations Association - Georgia (UNAG) between September 2011 and January 2015. &nbsp;The evaluation of ANI was conducted during the period October-December 2013. &nbsp;The overall purpose of evaluating ANI is to ""determine the effectiveness of the project and to provide recommendations on corrective actions and new directions for the remaining years of project implementation and beyond."" The main goal is to review actual progress toward achieving key expected results and identify accomplishments, delays, challenges, and their impact on the project, as described in the Statement of Work (SOW) for the evaluation. &nbsp;An integral part of the evaluation mission was to answer a set of four pre-determined questions, which are detailed in the body of this report. &nbsp;The questions concern: (1) the way that youth understand tolerance and national unity and how ANI has affected levels of youth civic engagement and participation in society; (2) the efficacy of ANI's collaboration with non-governmental organizations (NGOs) as hosts of the youth centers (YCs) in various cities and agents for mobilization of youth; (3) ANI's effect on the capacity and effectiveness of the Tolerance Center (TC), Council of Religions (CR) and Council of National Minorities (CNM); and (4) the effect on ANI of the change of government in 2012. &nbsp;The conclusions reached and suggested recommendations will be used by USAID/Caucasus to: (1) improve ongoing interventions in the area of national integration and tolerance; and (2) contribute to the design of USAID's next generation of support in that sector. &nbsp;(Excerpt, modified)","'Prepared under RFTOP No. SOL-114-13-000008'|Evaluated project title: Advancing national integration (ANI)","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID-114-TO-14-00001|AID-114-I-13-00001","","1/1/2014 12:00:00 AM","","Youth|Civil society|Community development|Community behavior|Job satisfaction","Georgia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACY246.pdf","1,490 KB","008414 - Mendez England and Associates","","009620 - USAID.

"Approximately 67% of the national cattle population (5.2 million) and 85% of the national goat population (3.4 million) is owned by smallholder, communal agro-pastoralists in Zimbabwe.&nbsp; The Southern Africa Rangeland and Grazing Training Program (SARGTP) is a holistic land and livestock management (HLLM) project collaboration between Africa Centre for Holistic Management (ACHM), Land O' Lakes (LOL)/Zimbabwe, Land O' Lakes/Zambia, and Africare/Zambia.&nbsp; This program is may be viewed as a coping strategy to enhance resiliency of agro-pastoralists to more effectively manage the natural asset base - rangelands and rain fed croplands adjacent to homesteads - across the southern African region.&nbsp; The evaluation examines the effectiveness of community livestock keeper training to improve grazing lands, water, and livelihood/food security.&nbsp; Based on evidence collected it is clear that HLLM is an approach with considerable appeal for many communities frequently facing disaster due to drought and desertification so long as four major technical preconditions are in hand: (1) sufficient water availability for livestock to facilitate joint herding, or ""bunching,"" the bringing together of livestock owned by individual families into a collective herd; (2) enough grazing availability in areas where HLLM is first applied to enable livestock owners to rationalize giving HLLM a go; (3) access to input markets to enhance the purchases of commercial stock feed (maintenance and fattening), drugs, chemicals, and output markets to facilitate livestock sales, income generation, and in particular to destock in early stages of drought; and (4) community consensus based on analysis of costs benefits and risks of HLLM leading to consensual buy-in.&nbsp; The overall finding in the SARGTP evaluation is that: (1) risk reduction and resiliency have been improved to some degree&nbsp; through HLLM training provided through ACHM directly to beneficiary communities in Zimbabwe, as well as through ACHM to other NGO implementing partners and communities in both Zimbabwe and Zambia, (2) when targeted appropriately, HLLM as currently packaged is pertinent to many communities in the southern Africa region as a disaster and risk reduction approach, and (3) to scale up HLLM in the sub-region, a shift in focus is needed from the current approach relying on awareness raising/community mobilization/HLLM training, to one where more sophisticated upstream analysis of prevailing land use patterns and governance arrangements is used to optimally frame HLLM implementation.&nbsp; (Excerpt, modified)","'The Southern Africa Rangeland and Grazing Training Program (SARGTP) was evaluated by the AMEX International, Inc. to consider livestock grazing management training programs funded by USAID/OFDA and implemented by  various NGO partners since 2007.

"The Transition and Persistence Project (TAP) was a three-year USAID-funded education project, implemented by Plan Ghana.&nbsp; The project aimed to increase junior high school (JHS) enrollment and completion rates in 156 JHSs across 13 districts in 4 regions (Brong Ahafo, Central, Eastern, and Greater Accra).&nbsp; TAP contributed to USAID's Strategic Objective 8 (SO8): ""Improved Quality of, and Access to, Basic Education."" &nbsp;The objectives of the TAP project were to: (1) increase the number of improved spaces available for JHS enrollment in targeted districts through building new facilities or rehabilitating existing facilities, (2) increase JHS enrollment in targeted districts by improving teacher quality, strengthening district level Ghana Education Service oversight, providing more diverse and innovative educational opportunities for children, promoting community involvement and ownership of the SIP process; and creating incentives and rewards for teachers, children, and communities for improving performance, (3) increase JHS completion rates by institutionalizing the processes and systems that will be used to increase enrollment.&nbsp; This evaluation was designed to explore the degree to which the desired changes were brought about due to the TAP interventions.&nbsp; The evaluation field work developed a sample based on disaggregating across the schools which exhibited the highest enrollment change and average and lowest enrollment change over the three year TAP intervention period (2010/11 to 2012/13); the evaluation also explored the degree to which interventions were effective and yielded the most promising results for replication. &nbsp;The evaluation study found that the TAP project recorded enormous improvements in increasing the spaces, improving the physical infrastructure and in reducing socio-economic barriers to JHS enrollment and completion for pupils and their families across 156 TAP schools in 13 districts of Ghana.&nbsp; The evaluation revealed that the TAP project was a highly valued intervention by all stakeholder groups interviewed, particularly teachers, communities and children.&nbsp; Evidence from interviews revealed that TAP interventions met the immediate practical needs of households and schools.&nbsp; Key stakeholders at the district and school levels also suggest that the TAP project should continue, with at most minor modifications.&nbsp; (Excerpt, modified)","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","641-A-00-10-00026-00","","1/1/2014 12:00:00 AM","","","Ghana","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00JPRV.pdf","787 KB","040824 - Associates For Change (AFC)|013207 - Plan International USA, Inc.","","008547 - USAID.

"<p>The Support for International Family Planning Organizations (SIFPO) mission is to increase the use of Family Planning (FP) services globally through strengthening selected international FP organizations and an extensive, multi-country network of FP clinics, in order to achieve maximum program impact and synergies.&nbsp; The current project is working toward the following four results areas: (1) strengthened organizational capacity to deliver quality FP services to target groups; (2) internal quality assurance standards and results quantified and disseminated to strengthen FP performance at a global level; (3) increased organizational sustainability of country-level programs, including internal south-to-south support and technical assistance; and (4) gender-sensitive FP services targeting youth strengthened at a global level.&nbsp; A special focus of the SIFPO projects has been on capacity building and systems strengthening to build upon and leverage the organization's extensive network of country programs that are often funded by other donors.&nbsp; The mid-term evaluation presented here is an examination of Marie Stopes International's (MSI's) internal system and structures and the impact SIFPO has had upon them.&nbsp; It also examines MSI's relations with SIFPO partners and the joint activities they have undertaken.&nbsp; The evaluation questions include but are not limited to: (1) what evidence exists that core resources invested in organizational strengthening have improved country-level platforms and programming; (2) what has been the effect on organizational capacity; (3) is there evidence that there is increased sustainability; (4) how have management practices within the organization been affected; (5) is there evidence that the internal quality assurance standards have been disseminated to strengthen FP service delivery and performance at a global level; and (6) to what extent is the MSI project's portfolio of service delivery activities meeting the needs of stakeholders?&nbsp; Specific evaluation findings, conclusions and recommendations are provided with detailed analysis for each evaluation question.&nbsp; (Excerpt, modified)</p>","Evaluated project title: Support to international family planning organizations : Marie Stopes International (SIFPO/MSI)","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID-OAA-C-13-00032","","8/1/2013 12:00:00 AM","","","Ghana|Madagascar","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00JQ1X.pdf","1,325 KB","011492 - Development & Training Services, Inc.

"This report presents the findings of the evaluation of the agricultural portfolio for USAID/Zimbabwe's Economic Growth Office (EG). &nbsp;USAID/Zimbabwe undertook this performance evaluation to review the entire portfolio of agricultural activities and determine: (1) whether the design of the agricultural portfolio was appropriate, given the country context at the time, and (2) whether its projects have and are achieving desired results (the evaluation, however, was not intended to serve as project performance evaluations). &nbsp;The evaluation team was tasked to examine USAID's current strategy and activities in terms of their relevance to meeting its economic growth objectives and Feed the Future (FTF) initiative objectives, taking into consideration the country context, past experience of USAID projects, and lessons learned from the projects. &nbsp;The evaluation examined interventions of the portfolio organized under three main topics: (1) appropriateness of the portfolio design; (2) achievement of intended objectives under each phase and in household food security, household agricultural incomes, and agricultural productivity in the targeted geographic zones; and (3) transition management between the recovery phase and the development phase. &nbsp;The evaluation gave focused attention to the degree to which women were incorporated into and derived benefits from the interventions. &nbsp;USAID will use the results of the evaluation to make design changes (as appropriate) and mid-course corrections to its current strategy, and to share lessons learned with key stakeholders. &nbsp;The implementing partners will learn about their strengths and weaknesses and adjust their projects accordingly. &nbsp;Finally, lessons learned from this evaluation will inform follow-on portfolio activities to be designed in FY 2014/2015. &nbsp;(Excerpt, modified)","Footer title: USAID/Zimbabwe agriculture portfolio evaluation final report|USAID contract no. also listed on document as AID-RAN-I-00-09-00015","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","AID-613-TO-13-00001|RAN-I-00-09-00015-00","","2/1/2014 12:00:00 AM","","","Zimbabwe","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00JQ3F.pdf","2,619 KB","011492 - Development & Training Services, Inc.
