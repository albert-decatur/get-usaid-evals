"BRIEF SUMMARY REPORT DATED 9/16/66 OF PRELIMINARY DATA REVIEW OF USAID-COMISSIONED OHIO STATE UNIV (OSU) SPECIAL STUDY  TO DETERMINE EFFECTS OF BRAZILIAN FERTILIZER LOAN'S INTERNAL CREDIT SYSTEM (CNCR) ON FERTILIZER USE. UNDER THE LOAN, CREDIT-WORTHY FARMERS RECIEVE FERTILIZER FROM PARTICIPANT DISTRIBUTORS AT A SIZEABLE DISCOUNT CONTINGENT UPON REPAYMENT BY A SPECIFIC DUE DATE. USO TEAM COLLECTED 313 QUESTIONNAIRES FROM FARMERS,BANKS,DISTRIBUTORS,& LOCAL AUTHORITIES IN EIGHT MUNICIPIOS IN STATES OF PARANA,SAO PAULO,AND MINAS GERAIS. 2 FURTHUR MUNICIPIOS ARE SCHEDULED FOR INTERVIEWING AT A LATER DATE. SUMMARY OF PRELIMINARY DATA IS SUBJECT TO COMPLETE ANALYSIS AT OSU. RESULTS OF SURVEY INDICATE THAT DISCOUNT PROVISION SERVED THE DUAL PURPOSE OF OFFERING SUBSTANTIAL PRICE REDUCTION WHILE ENSURING PROMPT REPAYMENT AT THE RISK OF FORFEITING THE DISCOUNT. THIS DISCOUNT PROVISION APPEARS TO BE ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTORS IN THE CREDIT SYSTEM'S SUCCESS. MOST PARTICIPATING FARMERS HAD USED BOTH CREDIT & FERTILIZER PREVISOUSLY,THOUGH THERE WERE A CONSIDERABLE NUMBER OF IRST-TIMERS IN MINAS GERIAIS AND A SMALLER NUMBER IN PARANA.THE TIGHTENING OF CREDIT BY TRADITIONAL SOURCES OF FINANCING DURING 1965 MUST BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT IN MEASURING THE IMPACT OF THE CNCR PROGRAM UPON FERTILIZER CONSUMPTION. FARMERS GENERALLY FOUND THE PROGRAM TO HAVE BEEN THE BEST AVAILABLE TO THEM; IT WAS DEEMED LESS BUREAUCRATIC,WITH NO DELAY IN RECEIVING THE FERTILIZER,AND NO INSPECTION OF LOAN-RELATED ACTIVITIES. ON THE OTHER HAND,THE INFLEXIBILITY OF THE REPAYMENT SCHEDULE DID NOT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT PRODUCTION & MARKETING PROBLEMS THAT COULD AFFECT FARMER'S RESOURCES. FARMERS WITH PREVIOUS FERTILIZING EXPERIENCE ARE LIKELY TO APPLY MORE PER LAND UNIT; THERE IS WIDESPREAD BELIEF THAT FERTILIZER USE AUGMENTS PRODUCTION BY MORE THAN 50%. USAGE IS HAMPERED BY A LACK OF SOIL ANALYSIS DATA; THE MINAS GERAIS DISTRIBUTOR DID,HOWEVER,OFFER SOIL TESTING SERVICES. WITHOUT LOAN INSPECTION,THE POTENIIAL DOES EXIST FOR MISUSE OF LOAN FUNDS BY FARMERS OR DISTRIBUTORS.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","9/1/1966 12:00:00 AM","","Statistical data|Agricultural research|Fertilizers|Agricultural production credit|Agricultural credit|Economic studies|Labor intensive farming|Agricultural extension|Agricultural production|Beneficiary interviews|Sampling method","Brazil","","","008517 - USAID.

"Evaluates project performance from 7/1/65 to 6/15/66 in Afghanistan. Project aids Royal Govt of Afghanistan (RGA) to develop financial & administrative techniques to run RGA's cadastral, tax, & administrative programs more efficiently. Evaluator feels contractor has a clear understanding of the scope & nature of contract objectives & has demonstrated good leadership both in Afghanistan & its US office.  Adequate, realistic goals have been developed which assure completion of contract objectives on-schedule. The Ministry of Finance (MOF) has hired more staff & is engaged in training personnel from other RGA agencies.  The new MOF Junior Advisor has designed & installed a new central accounting structure for Kabul University.  MOF on-the-job training visits to various RGA agencies resulted in a 90% completion rate (previously 60%) of daily expenditure reports prepared by RGA agencies.  The lack of a feasible classificatn plan & administrative organization to administer land classification has been eliminated with the completion & RGA's acceptance of the Land Registratn Manual (LRM) & Arable Land Classification Manuals.  These manuals pave the way for a modern cadastral system in Afghanistan.  The LRM defines steps in land registration processes; settlement of land disputes; conveyancing; recording rights & encumbrances of both individuals & RGA; & limitations of land ownership. Under contractor leadership the first Provincial land registration offices will be opened in 1966 in Kandahar, Helmand, & Kabul, with plans to soon open others in Ghanzi & Kunduz.  Offices will be manned by the first cadastral surveyors which have been graduated & given career civil service positions. The Machine Records Division has developed good ledgers & is preparing reports for the Accounting Department; year-end closing & request cash procedures have been designed, improved & installed; Agency Budget officers were trained in the use of the new budget manual; & new income tax laws have been defined in an income tax manual. Evaluator feels RGA will be able to administer program on its own after contract termination.","Evaluation period: 1 JUL 1965-15 JUN 1966","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/nesa-42","","","","Cadasters|Survey methodology|Taxation|National budgets|Financial records systems|Financial management|Economic planning|Fiscal policy|Management operations","","","","008504 - USAID.

Principal recommendations are that: (1) participants should be involved in planning their own program; (2) supervisors should be involved in selecting trainees and in planning both their program and the use to which the training will be put; (3) except where professional reasons indicate otherwise, longer-term training should be preferred to short-term training; (4) USAID and the host government should make formulate definite plans up front of how returned trainees will be employed; (5) steps should be taken to ensure that participants are informed about and satisfied with their programs prior to their departure; and (6) follow-up activities with participants, particularly their contacts with USAID, should be increased.

"This report is one of twenty-three country studies conducted as part of the worldwide survey of returned participants in accordance with AID/W instructions and guidelines contained in ICATO Circular A-175, November 1959.  The major purpose of this global effort was to obtain an overview of how the participant training program was progressing to ascertain ways in which future training might be effective at the country, AID/W, and training institution levels.  The study involved oral interviews in 1961 with 605 returned participants in the Japanese Productivity Study Team, a random sample from 2555 returnees.
