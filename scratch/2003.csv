"Close-out report of USAID/Bangladesh on strategic objective 3 (SO3): improve representation of the interests of women and the rural poor. The report covers the period FYs 1996- 2002 and focuses on the cornerstone Democracy Partnership (DP) program, implemented by The Asia Foundation (TAF). Achievements in DP's five programmatic areas were as follows: Citizen advocacy.  Interventions helped to improve tax collection, water quality and sanitation, local roads, and the effectiveness of flood relief.  Advocacy efforts were also highly effective in promoting grassroots development in ways that could not be achieved through national-level efforts. Free and fair elections.  Interventions provided rural Bangladeshis with a better understanding of their rights, roles, and responsibilities in the electoral process and helped create a more educated and informed population in future elections.  In addition, the base of individuals serving as local elected officials was broadened.  The DP was instrumental in strengthening a network of organizations with countrywide election monitoring capacity.  In the 1996 elections, two partner NGOs fielded about 30,000 observers.  For the 1997 UP elections, the number increased to almost 34,000 and one election observer was fielded in every polling station. Performance and accountability of local elected bodies. Interventions helped to increase the ability of participating NGOs to positively influence local government (LG) and helped LG councils become more democratic and effective.  The percentage of LG councils using five or more best practices (out of a total of 14) rose to 96% in 2000, up from 70% in 1999 and 34% in 1998.  The average number of best practices being used increased to 9.88 in 2000, up from 8.57 in 1999 and 2.98 in 1998. Increasing awareness of legal rights.  DP educated disadvantaged rural populations in their legal rights, where they should go for assistance, how to deal with the police, and how to effectively participate in alternative dispute resolution (ADR) mechanisms.  Some 88% of all marriages surveyed in the legal awareness program were registered in 1999, versus the control sample of 59%. Promotion of ADR.  Program interventions helped to change the traditional mediation system in Bangladesh, ensuring the participation of women and people other than the ruling elite in mediation committees, and sensitized community leaders to gender equity and issues involving the disadvantaged.  These activities transformed justice delivery to the poor.  In areas with ADR programs, confidence in local justice processes was 58.9% in 1999 and 64.1% in 2000 compared with the 1998 baseline of 45%.  Impacts of other programs funded under SO3 led to progress in combating the trafficking of women and children as well as in fighting corruption.  Important strides were also taken towards reducing child labor and strengthening the role of unions in the garment sector. The sustainability of DP activities is SO3's most important legacy. The DP pioneered a wide range of democracy and governance (DG) programs currently being implemented in Bangladesh today.  Encouraged by the success of the DP program, many donors have for the first time developed and funded through the NGOs new programs for grassroots democratization, local governance, and informal justice systems.  The DP also introduced numerous NGOs to democracy issues, and these NGOs now consider democracy promotion to be a fundamental part of their core development activities. Many are continuing DG activities with funding from other donors or with their own resources. The Partnership also inspired the formation of several democracy coalitions/networks and advanced techniques used locally in several areas of governance and human rights. Several NGOs and NGO coalitions are monitoring the 2003 UP [probably=Union Parishad] elections, fielding more than 100,000 election observers.  The Partnership has also had significant and lasting impacts on the way many NGOs in Bangladesh approach grassroots activities.  The previous pessimism about LG activities felt by many NGOs has been replaced by confidence.  In addition, the reports produced by TAF under the DP have substantially increased the understanding of local-level DG issues in Bangladesh. Lessons learned are as follows:  (1) The USAID/Bangladesh DG/ED Team must work closely with State and the Embassy in the search for DG funds and help coordinate among various USG agencies. (2) DG activities should not be spread over too many sub-sectors nor across too many NGOs.  The DG program must be focused.  (3) In order to affect change at the national level, numerous local human rights activities must be linked and coordinated -- a daunting challenge.  (4) The DG horizon must be long term, and activities should not focus on short-term success. Progress in DG programs is frequently uneven and unpredictable, and this fact must be taken into account in monitoring and evaluation activities. (6) The USG has a major competitive advantage in providing DG assistance, given both our experience and commitment to human rights and the promotion of democratic values.  (7) Progress in all other sectors in Bangladesh is threatened if democracy does not continue to develop and gain strength.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","2/1/2003 12:00:00 AM","","Strategic objectives|Democratization|Disadvantaged groups|Women|Poor|Rural populations|Advocacy|Political participation|Elections|Governance|Municipal level|Accountability|Civil and political rights|Alternative dispute resolution|Grassroots development|Networks|Project sustainability|Indigenous private voluntary organizations","Bangladesh","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABX692.pdf","36 KB","008511 - USAID.

"Closeout report of USAID/Cambodia on achievement of its strategic objective (SO) to improve reproductive and child health (RCH). The impact of activities under this SO for the period 1996 to 2000 is reflected in:  decreases in infant and child mortality per 1000 live births from 115 to 95 and from 181 to 124.5, respectively; and an increase in contraceptive prevalence rate from 7% (in 1995) to 19% (29%-37% for USAID target areas in 2002).  All achievements were in excess of target. Achievements in terms of intermediate results (IR) are as follows: (1) An expanded supply of RCH services is reflected in:   an increase in couple years of protection (CYP) from 100,000 in 1998 to 432,000 in 2002; a decrease in the stock-out rate of essential drugs and contraceptives at health centers from 80-90% in early 1998 to 5% in 2002; .and adoption/use by the Ministry of Health (MOH) and NGOs of numerous policies, standards, training modules, guidelines, and protocols such as COPE (client-oriented, provider-efficient) and safe motherhood.  (2) In terms of access to RCH services: households having access to safe water in target areas increased from less than 13% in 1996 to over 50% in 2002; 30% of deliveries were attended by trained midwives in Reproductive and Child Health Alliance (RACHA) target areas in 2001 (up from almost zero in 1997); the availability of Reproductive Health Association of Cambodia (RHAC) services in target areas increased from nearly zero in 1997 to 37% in 2002; the contribution of health centers to the contraceptive prevalence rate rose more than five-fold between 1998 and 2001; vitamin A coverage increased from less than 15% in 1997 to over 85% in USAID-supported target areas by 2002; and immunization coverage rates in CARE's project areas rose from 18% in 1995 to 84% in 2002.  (3) IR 3: A strengthened demand for quality services is reflected in:   CYP directly attributable to USAID-supported interventions increased from just over 100,000 in 1997 to 432,000 in 2002; the volume of services provided by RCH clinics increased from less than 100,000 clients in 1998 to over 350,000 in 2002; more than 45 health feedback committees and 30 village development committees were established and are working with health centers and target communities to improve access to health center services; there were increases in sales of 'Number One' brand condoms from zero in 1994 to 18.5 million in 2002 and of 'OK' brand oral contraceptives from zero cycles in 1997 to over 700,000 in 2001. The prospects for long-term sustainability are good.  There is good reason to expect that the MOH will continue to make significant progress towards the goal of accessible health services nationwide.  Since the delivery of RCH interventions is urgently needed but constrained by the level and pace of system development, RCH efforts in Cambodia must proceed on two tracks simultaneously: strengthening the nascent service delivery system, and promoting the delivery of specific interventions. Many of the gains achieved under the SO can be sustained through the efficacy of Cambodian and international partners and the strong commitment of the Cambodian government. The principal threats to sustainability are the weak institutional capacity of public health services, the overall poverty within Cambodia with increasing landlessness and inability of the poor to access adequate nutrition, and the possibility of renewed violence. Lessons learned were as follows: (1) Competency-based training of midwives has significantly improved the quality of their services and utilization. Keys to this success have been careful training selection criteria, practical training provided in a setting with a high volume of deliveries, and intensive post-training follow-up.   (2) Very dramatic reductions in malarial morbidity and mortality can be achieved through a combination of information, communication, and education (IEC) programs and the distribution of insecticide-impregnated bednets when carried out by NGOs in a structured, intensive manner at the community level, accompanied by careful monitoring and evaluation of both behavioral change (maintenance and use of bednets) and impact (decrease in malaria incidence).  (3) There are numerous potentials for linkages between RCH and HIV/AIDS/sexually transmitted disease (STD) interventions that would render both more effective, e.g., in joint IEC efforts; in links between maternal care and prevention of STDs and of mother to child transmission of HIV; and in links between family planning, voluntary counseling and testing, and STD/HIV prevention.  (4) Social marketing is an appropriate and cost-effective strategy for increasing access and demand for family planning methods. However, current marketing strategies do not effectively reach the rural areas where the majority of the population resides. There is also untapped potential for using social marketing to improve access to and demand for RCH services, e.g., oral rehydration solution (ORS), iron/folate supplements, etc.  (5) In the Cambodian context, where human resource capacity is extremely weak, and change is needed not only in information and skills but in basic attitudes and expectations, effective TA and training requires extensive, prolonged, hands-on follow-up, coaching, and mentoring at the actual service delivery point. To achieve this, it is critical that implementing agencies systemically approach, and allocate resources for, capacity-building of their own national staff so that they are well positioned to serve as mentors.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/2003 12:00:00 AM","","Reproductive health|Child health care|Strategic objectives|Health delivery|Access to services|Family planning services|Maternal health care|Disease prevention and control|Malaria|Health policy|Health care planning|Commercial retail sale of contraceptives|Condoms|Contraceptive prevalence|Child survival activities|HIV/AIDS|Community participation|Project sustainability","Cambodia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABX738.pdf","42 KB","008523 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of Phase II of a project (1994-12/02) to promote democratic development and citizen participation (DDCP) in Bolivia. Chemonics International was the implementing entity. Major achievements are as follows:  (1) The project has promoted and popularized citizen participation in democratic processes through the creation of citizen oversight committees and base-level territorial organizations.  (2) The DDCP methodology and approach has gained widespread legitimacy at the grassroots, municipal, departmental, and national levels. (3) The project's participatory methodology and approach to strengthening and extending decentralization to the grassroots level has been well accepted and adopted by the Government of Bolivia as policy, and by different donor organizations as a part of their strategy for working with municipalities.  (4) The project developed the model of participative municipal management (MGNP), initially through working with 20 municipalities; the approach is replicable nationally. The DDCP has supported and strengthened associations of municipalities and mancomunidades (=voluntary associations of two or more municipalities) at the departmental level, and these are now replicating the model in municipalities. The project provided managerial training and TA to improve municipal authorities' efficiency in implementing and managing infrastructure projects, as well as in providing other municipal services.  (6) The integration of gender issues into the overall project methodology and approach has begun.  (7) DDCP has been instrumental in establishing two national organizations -- the Federation of Municipal Associations (FAM) and the Association of Council Women of Bolivia (ACOBOL) -- that represent and advocate women's interests in all aspects of governance. (8) The project support fund has been a valuable resource in supporting and strengthening FAM, ACOBOL, associations, and mancomunidades toward sustainable goals to provide services, representation, TA, and consulting services to municipalities and ultimately to local constituents.  (9) The project has demonstrated that it is possible to develop a ""bottom-up"" participatory decentralization activity, even when the policy and laws were ""top-down"" national initiatives.  (10) The project has instilled in the citizenry and the municipal authorities who were trained (29,000) a sense of common responsibility, ownership, and participation in municipal governance. Lessons learned are as follows.  (1) The MGNP model was successful because DDCP staff understood that popular participation in developing the model was essential and generated interest, responsibility, and ownership from the participants.  (2) With the first 20 communities (1996-99), the participative model was carefully designed as a learning process and was flexible enough to continue evolving in the light of experience.  (3) A centralized model for implementing a decentralized project was appropriate for the DDCP.  This allowed for creation of a ""think tank"" of highly experienced and knowledgeable staff at the national level, who developed the model as a group effort through trial and error.  (4) DDCP also correctly understood that, besides building the capacity of associations and mancomunidades at the departmental level, there was also a need to support the  representation of associations, mancomunidad, and municipal interests at the national level, through the creation of the FAM and ACOBOL.  The achievement of DDCP objectives would have been greatly facilitated if the gender integration process undertaken in Phase II had been incorporated into the project from the beginning.  (5) Working at the legislative level with the uninominales (=single-member circumscriptions) has been a slower process, partly due to reasons beyond DDCP's control.  The role and responsibilities of the uninominales require better definition, recognition, and support from the congress and the executive branch of government.  Until this happens, only limited successes will be possible in encouraging uninominales to effectively respond to constituents' demands and needs, as the uninominales have little power and resources within the National Congress.","Task order no. 823|Evaluation indefinite quantity contract (Evaluation IQC)","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","AEP-I-00-00-00023-00","","1/1/2003 12:00:00 AM","","Democratization|Governance|Government reform|Decentralization|Political participation|Municipal level|Institution building|Human capacity development|Public services|Associations|Women in development","Bolivia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABX760.pdf","2,436 KB","000436 - Development Associates, Inc.","","008515 - USAID.

"USAID/Nepal close-out report for strategic objective 3, usually referred to as the Women's Empowerment Program (WEP - 9/95-9/01). WEP activities focused on facilitating literacy, legal literacy, and savings and credit activities among the women in 6,265 groups.  In the literacy component, 6 months of basic literacy and numeracy education was reinforced by post-literacy materials on both savings and credit and legal literacy; 122,852 women passed a literacy test following completion of the course.  Legal literacy groups that completed the basic literacy module were introduced to the legal literacy curriculum involving 24 weeks of study.  The groups later engaged in advocacy campaigns both to address social issues and to improve local infrastructure; 109,306 women completed the course and passed a test of their knowledge of basic legal rights.  These women went onto engage in 380,883 collective actions.  Savings and credit activities group members deposited compulsory weekly savings, with the minimum amount determined by the group.  The groups loaned money to members for microenterprise projects; 86,833 women had such projects. The WEP's most important output is the thousands of women who finished the program with the self-confidence and the skills needed to change their lives and their communities.  Some of these women have already begun to seek political office; WEP groups have begun to band together to form coalitions to advocate more effectively for social and political change.  With the $10 million dollars generated annually by their microenterprises, and their $1.8 million in savings, they are an economic force in their communities.  Other significant outputs include capacity building for local NGO partners, models for literacy and savings and credit programs, and materials to teach literacy and legal literacy, combat trafficking, and explain WEP to a larger audience. (Details provided in report.) In its final report to USAID, The Asia Foundation (TAF) summarized the qualitative assessments of the project impacts made by TAF, Private Agencies Collaborating Together (PACT), and evaluation consultants, based on interaction with WEP participants, NGO staff, and government representatives.  The following is a summary of the broad impacts that they identified:  (1) patriarchal norms challenged (with both individual acts and collective actions challenging norms within families and communities); (2) changing attitudes (especially among village men, as well as growing respect of women by villagers for women's role in solving social problems); (3) enhanced sense of social responsibility (with women actively articulating and advocating concerns in the public sphere); (4) a space carved out for women in public affairs (in women's organization legal discrimination against women).  (5) increased women's confidence (shown when women take action that emphasizes their confidence, such as registering marriages and obtaining citizenship certificates, together with enhanced bargaining power within the family); (6) local development role (translating their new knowledge, and sometimes their groups savings, into practical actions for community benefit); (7) engagement with local authorities (claiming resources from the village development committee [VDC] for public development works and becoming high-profile ""watch dogs"" for their communities); (8) linkages established (between WEP women and line agencies, elected officials and other concerned authorities); and (9) networks formed (of advocacy groups at the VDC and district levels, with the beginning of linkages to the national level). Includes lessons learned and prospects for sustainability.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","367-A-00-98-00001-00","","2/1/2003 12:00:00 AM","","Women in development|Literacy instruction|Arithmetic instruction|Advocacy|Legal education|Associations|Political participation|Banks|Credit|Microenterprises|Income generation|Human capacity development|Local groups|Village group loans|Savings|Educational materials|Private voluntary organizations|Indigenous private voluntary organizations","Nepal","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABX764.pdf","95 KB","008583 - USAID.

"In sub-Saharan Africa as a whole, per capita income declined 15% and poverty rates increased between 1980 and 2000.  Uganda was one of the few exceptions to this pattern. Starting in 1986, the Ugandan government introduced broad economic reforms.  It eliminated a straightjacket of government economic regulation and control as it liberalized both the domestic economy and international trade.  In the mid-1990s, the government adopted poverty eradication as its overarching objective. From 1993 to 2000, GDP increased at a remarkable average annual rate of 6.7%, and the proportion of the population living in absolute poverty declined dramatically, from 56% to 35%.  Uganda demonstrated that sound economic policies can accelerate economic growth and reduce poverty. Eliminating inefficient government crop marketing boards resulted in higher crop prices for small farmers.  A massive road building program opened up new opportunities and lowered costs for poor farmers. Universal primary education was introduced to improve the skills -- and therefore the economic prospects -- of poor children.  Uganda also showed that implementing pro-poor budget and social policies can accelerate poverty rates decline even faster.  USAID supported Uganda's poverty reduction efforts, but at times congressional earmarks created difficulties.  They reduced USAID's flexibility and made it difficult to support programs to strengthen the economic and policy environments that are crucial to helping the poor.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/2003 12:00:00 AM","","Poverty|Economic growth|Economic reform|Economic policy|Market economy|Management goals|Economic impact|Data collection|USAID|Development assistance|Constraints|Debt repayment|Poverty reduction","Uganda","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNACR354.pdf","298 KB","008735 - USAID.

"In 2001, the Government of Honduras completed a Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) in response to the World Bank and International Monetary Fund's heavily indebted poor country (HIPC) initiative.  This assessment examines the extent to which USAID/Honduras is engaged in poverty reduction programming, and whether it has modified its assistance strategy to be consistent with the PRSP approach. It  also asks whether USAID Honduras has supported the PRSP process, and whether the mission can enhance the poverty reduction impact of its portfolio. The assessment finds that in most respects USAID's focus on broad-based sustainable development works effectively as a poverty reduction approach. More specific findings are as follows:  (1) USAID/Honduras is one of the few agency management units that comes close to adopting poverty reduction as its overarching goal.  (2) USAID's program is well focused on the poor, especially in health and education, and incorporates many poverty reduction objectives.  (3) Honduras needs additional policy and institutional reforms in many areas, particularly in public sector salary policy, rule of law, and modernization of the state.  However, the mission's portfolio is heavily skewed toward delivery of services, mainly due to congressional earmarks and the USAID results management system.  Earmarks make it difficult for program officers to balance direct and indirect approaches to poverty reduction and to resolve inconsistencies between funding availability and program needs.  (4) USAID played a key leadership role in the development of the Honduras PRSP.  (5) Key to successful USAID involvement in the PRSP has been the high level of donor coordination achieved in Honduras. (6) The recent Honduran experience illustrates the importance of regarding poverty as a multidimensional concept.","Related document: PN-ACR-481","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","3/1/2003 12:00:00 AM","","Poverty|Economic growth|Economic reform|Economic policy|Management goals|Economic impact|USAID|Development programs|Beneficiary targeting|Social services|Constraints|Private voluntary organizations|Development strategies|Donor coordination|Debt repayment|Poverty reduction","Honduras","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNACR351.pdf","319 KB","008735 - USAID.

"This assessment the extent to which USAID/Mali is engaged in poverty reduction programming and whether it has modified its assistance strategy in line with the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) developed by the Government of Mali in response to the World Bank and International Monetary Fund's Heavily Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) initiative. The assessment finds that in most respects USAID's broad-based sustainable development approach works effectively as a poverty reduction approach.  More specific findings are as follows:  (1) USAID's program is generally focused on the rural poor and incorporates many poverty reduction objectives.  (2) USAID supported the PRSP process. (3) It is imperative that USAID continue to contribute to this process, which allows donors to raise important political economy issues (such as corruption and aid effectiveness) that would otherwise not be discussed with the government.  It also presents an important opportunity to collaborate with the government in programming the local currency made available for social programs under the HIPC process.  (4) USAID has created an impressive synergy among programs in different sectors. U.S. and Malian PVOs play a key role, implementing almost half of the portfolio.  (5) The USAID program is heavily skewed toward delivery of direct social services to targeted groups, with proportionately less allocated to broader economic or policy reforms that have an indirect effect on the poor.   USAID's system of budget and program earmarks, as well as the need to report measurable annual achievements under the ""results framework"" system, has also ensured that the portfolio emphasizes service delivery rather than longer-term macro activities. (6) Direct approaches to poverty reduction involve the delivery of services to the poor, while indirect approaches help the enabling environment for poverty reduction.  The question arises, however, whether there is a good balance between direct and indirect assistance in the USAID portfolio.  In a country like Mali, where 65% of the population live on less than $1 per day, direct social services provided by PVOs may be largely unsustainable over the long run, particularly if the government is not prepared to assume these services.  A greater number of poor could be helped through broader-based efforts to address the sources of poverty and the systems that perpetuate it.  (7) Commitment of a large proportion of the portfolio to PVO projects may reflect a relative lack of engagement on a regular basis with the government.  This may reduce USAID's visibility and influence at the national level on key policy and strategy issues that create the enabling environment for poverty reduction.  USAID actively supports grassroots empowerment of local villages, but there may be missed opportunities at the national level to support free and fair elections and build the capacity of political parties and elected assemblies.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/2003 12:00:00 AM","","Poverty|Economic growth|Economic reform|Economic policy|Management goals|Economic impact|USAID|Development programs|Beneficiary targeting|Social services|Constraints|Private voluntary organizations|Indigenous private voluntary organizations|Development strategies|Resource allocation|Donor coordination|Advocacy|Host country cooperation|Policy dialogue|Debt repayment|Poverty reduction","Mali","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNACR352.pdf","490 KB","008735 - USAID.

"Poverty reduction is not a formal, overarching objective of the Government of Romania (GOR) or its development donor community.  The situation is compounded by the absence of the concept of partnership between the GOR and international donors.  Despite recent progress, economic growth has been hamstrung by poorly conceived privatization of state farms and of state-owned industrial and energy enterprises.  This factor has contributed to low productivity, weak competitiveness, high labor redundancy, and high costs of energy and other utilities.  The country's legal and regulatory environment remains thin in areas ranging from business to environment to social issues.  Weak governance in the legislative and judicial branches complicates matters further. USAID Romania's 1996-2001 programs emphasized economic growth.  Over half of the mission's portfolio was allocated to indirect interventions to enable economic growth, especially in the areas of financial markets, agriculture, micro- and small/medium-sized enterprises, the environment, and energy sector restructuring.  One-third of the portfolio was devoted to programs in democracy and governance and in social services. USAID's democracy and governance programs are also indirect interventions: they address local government capacity building and civil society organization development.  Social service reform programs highlight child welfare and health issues, blending direct service delivery with indirect actions aimed at strengthening policymaking and building capacity to deliver local social services.  The rest of the portfolio is allocated to cross-cutting programs such as training.  USAID Romania does not explicitly target poverty reduction, though the mission views the evolving poverty trends in the country as a gauge of program success.  Its assistance strategy for FY2002-07 recognizes the connection between increasing poverty and escalating political volatility and social problems.  As a senior officer observed, failure to address the issue of poverty in Romania will jeopardize the very success of the country's transition. Key issues for future poverty reduction programming are as follows: (1) Lack of coordination on poverty reduction at the central level of government increases the difficulty of coordinating donor initiatives around this theme, even though donors are concerned about rising poverty rates.  (2) A program economist is needed if the mission is to enable market and political economy analysis of policy choices in the economic growth, democracy and governance, and social service sectors. (3) Funding directives may result in resource allocations that exceed the mission's capacity to program effectively.  (4) In lower middle-income countries such as Romania, a more targeted pro-poor focus is needed to track the poverty impact of economic growth, governance, and social service programs and to counter rising concerns induced by looming, post-transition poverty rates.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/2003 12:00:00 AM","","Economies in transition|Poverty|Economic growth|Economic reform|USAID|Development programs|Social services|Constraints|Private voluntary organizations|Development strategies|Resource allocation|Donor coordination|Beneficiary targeting|Experts|Debt repayment|Poverty reduction","Romania","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNACR353.pdf","270 KB","008735 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of the Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) operation in East Timor (11/99-10/02). OTI's legacy in East Timor is extremely positive.  There is considerable evidence that the OTI program had significant impact and promoted the larger foreign policy goals of the U.S. Government (USG). The core objective of promoting a democratic evolution in East Timor was pursued with vigor and skill and resulted in a series of effective interventions. Economic recovery efforts were less consistent in achieving their intended impact.  The initial transitional employment program (TEP) offered considerable political and some economic impact, but its two successor programs were less successful.  Efforts to shore up the technical economic capacities of the incoming government -- largely centering on Timor Sea issues -- are likely to have more long-lasting effect than higher profile programs. OTI achieved measurable impact in its efforts to strengthen the NGO and media sectors in East Timor.  In both cases, however, more could likely have been realized had there been greater care in selecting entities to assist and earlier emphasis on capacity building (rather than commodity transfers).  The psychological and political impact of OTI programming, especially early on, made a substantial contribution to calming turbulent seas. The procurement mechanisms and small grant authorities exercised by OTI were key to its success.  The flexibility of the grant mechanism and the quick disbursement of funds made OTI a highly effective player when most other donors remained stymied and inactive. Equally essential to success was the comprehensiveness of OTI's approach.  OTI took on multiple challenges and facilitated the engagement of other players, domestic and international, to address these challenges in an impressive manner, which delivered results across a broad front. The indicators of OTI's impact in East Timor are numerous.  OTI succeeded in earning USAID and the USG considerable credit in the eyes of the host government and of donor officials, as well as the general public.  USAID was well-served by the integration of OTI and Development Alternatives, Inc. (DAI) personnel in East Timor; this model can be replicated anywhere.  OTI's work has enabled USAID to have continuing high impact in East Timor into the foreseeable future. Several lessons were learned.  (1) The early phase of OTI's operations in East Timor sharply profiled its capabilities as an organization.  OTI filled gaps, bought time, arguably averted an escalation of communal tensions, provided the means for engaging a host of players, and bolstered fragile new structures.  The attitude demonstrated by OTI representatives in East Timor demonstrated that concrete steps could be taken to address the chaos and turmoil.  Sending people to the field with the political savvy needed to see and seize such opportunities is central to operations likely to have early impact. (2) Do not overestimate what can be done by simply investing resources. Behind the scenes pressure to move too much money too quickly can undermine impact.  Interventions undertaken outside a sound analytical framework are less likely to deliver on objectives.  (3) Likewise, care has to be exercised before large investments are made in spheres beyond the expertise and managerial capacity of the OTI staff. The NGO and media programs in East Timor arguably would have benefitted from the earlier provision of TA from international entities, while the TEPS II and Building Empowerment, Leadership, and Engagement (BELE) programs were weakened by the lack of OTI field presence to keep projects on track.  (4) The management of the OTI program worked well in East Timor due more to the trust and mutual respect of a dedicated core of individuals who had long-standing investments in the situation than to a coherent administrative structure.  More explicit planning on how to support OTI staff in non-presence countries would be highly advisable. (5) A recurrent trap encountered by OTI in East Timor was the assumption that various UN agencies were going to deliver on stated or implied commitments to the transitional process. Assumptions about UN agency effectiveness have to be tested on a situation-specific basis.  (6) OTI operated with significant advantages (i.e., contracting, procurement, and grantmaking mechanisms) not enjoyed by UN agencies, by other donors or even by other USG entities in East Timor. The prospects of generating resentment on the part of other key players were serious, but never materialized.  OTI staff in other locations would do well to display the attitude of cooperation and inclusiveness that was a hallmark of its presence in East Timor.","Related document: PN-ACT-252|Evaluation indefinite quantity contract (Evaluation IQC)","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","AEP-I-00-00-00023-00","","2/1/2003 12:00:00 AM","","Post conflict societies|Societies in transition|Political systems in transition|Economies in transition|Democratization|Rule of law|Political participation|Political institutions|Institution building|Economic recovery|Employment|Mass media|Indigenous private voluntary organizations|Government departments|Human capacity development|Political aspects|Development organizations|Funding mechanisms","Timor-Leste","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABX987.pdf","354 KB","000436 - Development Associates, Inc.","","008058 - USAID.

"Assesses lessons learned from the  Delivery of Improved Services for Health (DISH II) project (11/99-9/02), designed to strengthen reproductive, child, and maternal health services in Uganda.  The goal of the evaluation was to help ensure the positive launch of USAID's new ""Systems"" and ""Services"" programs, that will continue support to the Ugandan health sector begun under DISH I.. DISH II expanded on DISH I with a broad mandate to provide technical and material assistance to 12 of Uganda's 56 health districts, in the process strengthening systems at the central Ministry of Health (MOH) level.  Through grants to the 12 ""DISH districts,"" accompanied by TA provided by DISH branch offices, the project made possible significant improvements in access to and quality of reproductive, child, and maternal health services at all levels. Despite its short duration, DISH II substantially strengthened the capacity of DISH districts to plan, manage, and supervise health services.  Representatives of district health teams who were interviewed repeatedly expressed their appreciation for this support. Reinforcing national policy, DISH II successfully promoted the integration of services in health facilities through a combination of training in a range of clinical skills and enhanced support supervision. The DISH II Yellow Star program signaled a new approach to quality assurance that was universally appreciated and has been adopted by the MOH for national application.  Through design of new health management information system software, training, and provision of computer equipment, the project demonstrated to its district health teams the value of using health service data for management decisionmaking and contributed to the MOH's drive to create a ""culture of information"" throughout the system. In a country where the sector-wide approach to health sector funding predominates, DISH II showed that the project approach still has its place.  It did so by communicating and collaborating closely with the central MOH even as it focused on the specifics of TA and capacity building in its focus districts. It thus paved the way for helping the MOH plan for national application of innovations, such as Yellow Star, that had proved their worth.  At the same time, it is important to note that the innovations in question remain ""fragile."" The project was far too short to fully achieve its ambitious goals, and there were signs that its relatively abrupt termination led in some cases  to a distinct fall-off in performance and left some of its most significant products in a precarious state between success and failure, dependent on future support. The report singles out areas in which DISH II had significant impact, looks in detail at the strengths and weaknesses of its inputs, and summarizes what the review team sees as the key lessons that emerged in each area.  In a concluding section, it restates those lessons in the form of recommendations as to how DISH successors might best build on DISH II's admirable contributions to Ugandan health systems.

"Evaluates USAID's Malaria Vaccine Development Project (MVDP) from 1992 to 2002. MVDP has been exceptionally successful over the past few years and has become a leader in the rapidly accelerating process of malaria vaccine development, emerging as a unique catalyst and problem-solver by virtue of its combination of expertise, flexibility, and close monitoring of the changing needs in its field.  MVDP has been able to fund key targeted areas intended to speed vaccine candidates that would not have been funded by any other entity through the pipeline.  MVDP is unique among funding entities in that its staff has a thorough understanding of the whole spectrum of malaria vaccine development issues.  No other funder has been able to work as swiftly, or has had the ability to fund relatively small, but essential facets of larger projects.  MVDP has assumed a vital role in maintaining a focus on developing vaccines that will protect populations living in endemic regions.  Had MVDP never existed, several promising malaria vaccine candidates would either not be nearly as far along in the development process as they are today, or would never have been developed at all. MVDP has been extraordinarily successful in its mission to move vaccines to the clinic and field for proof of principle as soon as possible.  Specifically, MVDP support has, directly or indirectly, enabled the work on the Merozoite Surface Protein (MSP1) and the Apical Merozoite Antigen (AMA1) vaccine candidates to move from early preclinical development to clinical trials.  MVDP has achieved a very well-balanced portfolio consisting of projects at different phases of malaria vaccine development, and projects involving different kinds of vaccine candidates. Lessons learned include the following:  (1) The MVDP, like other public and private entities, needs to be more aggressive in pursuing formal agreements with its partners, in order to ensure that any successful vaccine developed with its funding be made available to populations needing it.  (2) Progress in getting effective malaria vaccines to children and pregnant women in developing countries is severely hindered by a lack of resources.  (3) Progress is also jeopardized by limited staffing, both of the MVDP and of its partners. The recent re- deployment of several key members of the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR) staff involved in MVDP projects to responsibilities related to a national emergency highlights the importance of being able to be responsive and flexible.  This issue is made more acute by the general lack of depth in staffing and resources throughout the malaria vaccine development field. It is strongly recommended that the program be continued and, if at all possible, expanded.  One of the most compelling reasons for this is that there are so many potential candidate antigens available for testing today. If this work is not continued, there is a very great risk that progress on important MVDP-supported candidates, such as MSP1 and AMA1, will either be slowed or discontinued for lack of funding and/or for lack of the outside expert guidance provided by MVDP. The importance of preventing death and serious disease from malaria in children and in pregnant women in developing countries cannot be overstated. Malaria not only has a profound effect on health, but also has a major impact on the economic development and political stability of endemic areas. In its 2001 report, the Commission on Macroeconomics and Health of the World Health Organization reported that a small number of conditions, including malaria, are so widespread and debilitating that they can destabilize economies and entire political systems. The impact of malaria has grown in recent years, despite longstanding treatment and prevention programs.  There is a consensus among experts that, ultimately, the most effective way to control malaria is to develop a vaccine that is effective in vulnerable populations, particularly children and pregnant women in endemic areas.  In addition, it is predicted that in the long run, a vaccine will be much more cost-effective than reliance on current control measures.","Project title: Monitoring, evaluation and design support (MEDS)|Technical directive no. 69","Special Evaluation","Documents","HRN-I-00-99-00002-00","","3/1/2003 12:00:00 AM","","Disease prevention and control|Malaria|Vaccines|Product development|Community leadership|Development organizations|Disadvantaged groups","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABY236.pdf","1,452 KB","007877 - LTG Associates, Inc.|011323 - Social & Scientific Systems Inc.

"Assesses the NGO Service Delivery Project (NSDP), a child health (CH) project in Bangladesh, for the period 5/02-3/03. Two project-level factors impede CH programming: (1) Like its predecessors, the NSDP has not focused on expanding coverage or priority interventions with the most impact on CH. Acute respiratory infections (ARI) and diarrheal disease remain major causes of child morbidity and mortality.  (2) NSDP programming is often driven by unofficial policies that encourage NGOs to judge their success largely by cost recovery and emphasize the primacy of static and satellite clinics over community-based services (CBSs).  This approach is not conducive to the provision of many critical CH services, especially in extremely low-resource environments.  Unless these two issues are resolved, the NSDP is likely to spend a great deal of money but have little impact. Other program findings are as follows:  (1) The NSDP lacks clarity regarding its objectives and benefits, especially for efforts to introduce new strategies (e.g., integrated management of childhood illness [IMCI], community integrated management of childhood illness [C-IMCI], and essential newborn care [ENC]).  (2) Reliance on training as the main CH strategy is not sufficient.  The current focus on developing capacity to conduct training internally is also not optimal, since many CH programs also offer these capabilities. (3) CARE and Save the Children Federation are the NSDP's primary partners, but have very small roles in the project.  (5) NGOs are usually not included in decisionmaking, and processes affecting them are not transparent. Organizationally, NSDP is strongly vertical, creating barriers to integrated CH efforts.  Additionally: the Clinical Services Unit, where most activities are located, does not have a community health approach or management perspective to support CH efforts; the NSDP lacks a senior-level CH technical expert; there is no specific plan to help NGOs operationalize activities over the long term; management information and monitoring and evaluation systems need to be adjusted; institutional development is excessively linked to financial concerns; and current logistics plans may be unrealistic. The NSDP's technical approach features separate interventions introduced through training.  The project has no systematic plan for integrating new strategies nor has it analyzed the costs and benefits thereof.  There is a common perception that some technical initiatives ""belong"" to specific NSDP partners.  Those having a bigger share of management and resources are able to push forward their favorite initiatives, while initiatives championed by less influential staff have not gained much traction. The Essential Service Package (ESP) appears to have worked well for NGOs, but has limited capacity and cannot respond well to emergencies. The NSDP has differing views about how this limited emergency capability should be overcome.  Many see improved static clinics and community education as the answer, while others believe that only improved treatment options in the community will adequately address the problem. Clinical IMCI is the main mechanism through which modern CH is being implemented in the NSDP.  Under a joint program with the Government of Bangladesh (GOB), the NSDP has 15 pilot clinics in urban areas where IMCI is being initiated as a national strategy.  There is much internal pressure on the NSDP to implement IMCI rapidly.  The current plan calls for establishing up to 55 clinics this year, and similar scale-up is planned for the following years.  It is clear that clinical IMCI is the future for project NGOs, but a number of issues will need to be resolved:  (1) There is no clear understanding of the advantages of IMCI in NGO clinics.  Current expectations may not be realistic.  (2) NGOs may be unaware of the complexity and costs of an IMCI clinic system and may not be able to assume these costs when the NSDP ends.  (3) Clinical IMCI is currently considered largely a training issue.  There has not been adequate thinking and planning about recurring costs, logistics, and other support systems. The C-IMCI strategy is closely aligned with that of the GOB and current plans are to initiate NSDP activities in 9 pilot areas in 2003. Over the next 3 years the NSDP hopes to roll out this program to approximately two-thirds of its 278 clinics and 7,000 depot holders. Although C-IMCI is potentially NSDP's most important CH intervention, it lacks a clear mandate, a strategic framework, and a detailed implementation plan.  Also, it has not had strong senior management support nor been widely discussed and embraced by the NSDP as a pivotal intervention.  A careful examination of the far-ranging implications for community-based programming and services is overdue. NSDP lacks a neonatal component and the current service delivery system is not well positioned to deliver ENC. There are no plans to intervene with neonates at the community level, although C-IMCI may provide more focus on newborns in the home.  The proposal to adapt successful strategies from the Saving Newborn Lives (SNL) initiative places meaningful neonatal activities at least 2-3 years away. Improvements in neonatal care are closely linked with better maternal health, but except for a plan to improve the referral process, there are no strategies to move forward in this area.  Likewise, nutrition is underrepresented. Finally, behavior change communication (BCC) activities are not well aligned with CH needs.  Current plans focus on expanded community awareness of NGO services, household prevention, and community mobilization to support C-IMCI.  The Bangladesh Center for Communications Programs is a good resource, but will have to support this program area to a greater extent than currently anticipated.","Technical directive number 74|Task order no. 2|Project title: Monitoring, evaluation, and design support (MEDS)","Special Evaluation","Documents","HRN-I-00-99-00002-00","","5/1/2003 12:00:00 AM","","Health delivery|Child health care|Private voluntary organizations|Indigenous private voluntary organizations|Development project design|Community based delivery|Constraints|Development strategies|IEC|Behavior change|Child nutrition|Domestic government programs|Delivery systems|Emergency medical care|Pilot projects|Clinics|Management goals|Management information systems|Health professional education|Organizational structure|Development project planning","Bangladesh","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABY459.pdf","1,657 KB","007877 - LTG Associates, Inc.|011323 - Social & Scientific Systems Inc.

"Mission close-out report for strategic objective (SO) 2, designed to improve educational and human resource policies in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC).  Report covers the period 1996-2002. Achievements exceeded expectations.  The Partnership for Educational Revitalization in the Americas (PREAL), the major effort under SO 2, built public and private support for education reform through dozens of outreach activities, as well as through its research and publications. PREAL has been credited with producing the most comprehensive publications to date on education problems and recommendations for change. Several effective dialogue, communication, and analytical tools for promoting education policy reform among business leaders, government officials and academic leaders have been developed and are being effectively applied to create a cadre of advocates at the highest levels throughout the region.  The Central American Report Card, a mechanism to document the successes and failures of education and identify areas for improvement, was developed.  PREAL also published a Report Card on Education in Latin America, which for the first time provided generally available information comparing schools in the region. PREAL also identified four key education reform objectives that governments must support:  (1) set standards for the education system and measure progress toward meeting them; (2) give schools and local communities more control over and responsibility for education; (3) strengthen the teaching profession by raising salaries, reforming training, and making teachers more accountable to the communities they serve; and (4) invest more money per student in pre- school, primary, and secondary education.  These four objectives, as well as the concept of education report cards, became the basis of a follow-on cooperative agreement to PREAL under SO 23, and provided the goals of both the LAC and Central America and Mexico (CAM) regional programs.  PREAL also established:  a 24-institution network to work on education reform in 16 countries; a multinational Task Force on Education, Equity and Economic Competitiveness in Latin America and the Caribbean that released and distributed a comprehensive report in three languages; and a Central American Task Force for Educational Reform that produced a report analyzing the key problems facing schools in Central America and offering recommendations for change. The US/Brazil Partnership served as an outstanding model of inter- governmental cooperation between USAID and a number of U.S. agencies. Under the Partnership, USAID supported LTNet, a program of study tours and conferences for Brazilian educators visiting the United States, complemented by a bilingual website providing U.S. and Brazilian stakeholders access to information, educational technologies, and networking support and services.  To ensure sustainability, LTNet established a partnership with GlobalEnglish.com to offer Brazilian public schools free access to GlobalEnglish's online English language resources.  Under the Partnership seven successful policy dialogues were held. Led by UNESCO, the Summit of the Americas Regional Education Indicators Project (PRIE) was carried out 8/00-8/03.  PRIE established a set of initial indicators for the Americas, and distributed their data to Ministries of Education (MOEs).  PRIE also strengthened statistic systems in the region and encouraged the use of quality information in education decisionmaking. Despite the program's successes, education reform in the region remains a major challenge, largely due to a lack of the information and the political processes needed to stimulate public demand for reform. Also, the tests being developed to measure student learning remain new and many have serious shortcomings.  To date, no country in the hemisphere has established, disseminated, and implemented comprehensive and comparable national education standards or indicators.  The limited technical capacity and resources of MOEs are a further constraint.  Even more critical, however, is the lack of a culture of accountability. Education providers (e.g., government officials and teachers) tend to distrust or even resist establishing standards or conducting assessments, and when such measures are imposed, governments tend to resist making their methodologies and results public.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/2003 12:00:00 AM","","Educational reform|Regional level|Educational policy|Partnerships|Policy dialogue|Publications|Educational research|Advocacy|Strategic objectives|Performance measurement|Performance indicators|Conferences|IEC|Government departments|Computer networks|Accountability|Reporting systems|Educational administration|Decentralization|Educational finance|Resource allocation|Teachers|Career development|Development cooperation|Local languages|Websites","Latin America|Caribbean|Central America","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABZ719.pdf","43 KB","009348 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (7/93-7/03) to develop and implement a sustainable, long-term strategy to expand the availability of affordable, temporary contraceptive methods through private commercial channels in Guatemala. The project was implemented by Importadora Productos Farmaceuticos (IPROFASA). The project supported IPROFASA's social marketing program, donated condoms (repackaged as ""Scudo"") and oral contraceptives (repackaged as ""Perla""), and provided TA through the centrally-funded SOMARC project. A phaseout of assistance to IPROFASA began in 1999 when all direct financial and technical assistance ended and USAID assistance was limited to the donation of condoms and oral contraceptives.  IPROFASA is now responsible for all of its own contraceptive procurement. The key results achieved under the project are as follows: (1) introduction through social marketing techniques of seven brands of condoms, eight brands of oral contraceptives, two types of IUDs, a contraceptive injectable, and a vaginal tablet; (2) provision of approximately 490,000 couple-years-protection from all contraceptives distributed; (3) Scudo and Perla contraceptives achieved and have sustained the leading market share for, respectively, condoms and oral contraceptives in pharmacies and are being sold in over 1,500 retail outlets nationwide; (4) IPROFASA has achieved financial self-sufficiency; (5) IPROFASA has negotiated and begun to procure replacement stocks of condoms and oral contraceptives from private suppliers and has agreed to maintain the low price of Scudo and Perla (adjusted for inflation), thus assuring a continued commercial source of low-priced condoms and orals; (6) IPROFASA and Pan American Social Marketing Organization (PASMO) reached agreement in early 2003 to eliminate ""push money"" and collaborate on the joint placement of generic ads for condom sales.","Project title: Family health services","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","520-0357-A-00-3222-00","","7/1/2003 12:00:00 AM","","Family planning promotion programs|Commercial retail sale of contraceptives|Social marketing|Condoms|Oral contraceptives|Private sector|Business enterprises|Economic self sufficiency","Guatemala","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABZ765.pdf","23 KB","008550 - USAID.

"Evaluates the impact of the Better Health for Rural Women and Children project in Guatemala (1995-2002), implemented by Management Sciences for Health (MSH), on the institutional development of the Asociacion Pro-Bienestar de la Familia (APROFAM). The MSH APROFAM partnership has been highly successful, both in terms of concrete results and the processes by which these were achieved. APROFAM has reached about an 80% level of financial sustainability. Clinic services have reached a 120% level of financial sustainability as a whole.  Four of the five departments have been fully re-engineered and systems and controls have been developed that provide both cost-cutting elements as well as growth potential. These findings strongly support MSH efforts and APROFAM's willingness and ability to manage the change process in a constructive and productive manner. These joint efforts and the major diversification of clinic and laboratory services resulted in a significant degree of financial and institutional sustainability.  The results of MSH activities with APROFAM are institutionalized and sustainable.  Already, APROFAM has moved from a traditional NGO highly dependent on donor contributions to a viable enterprise in its own right. The process by which these achievements were accomplished generally followed sound concepts relating to institutional cooperation, communication, and participation. MSH provided expert technical support and conscientious individuals who sought and acted upon APROFAM's needs and long-term goals.  APROFAM actively managed the process and activities with full support from the Board and the Executive Director. Importantly, APROFAM knew generally what it needed to achieve and was thus in a strong position to guide the TA towards those ends. Therefore, the main tasks of MSH were to seek and provide the very specific technical and organizational means towards APROFAM's goals. Initially, MSH took the lead with a long-term strategy for change. That strategy has now been adopted as its own by APROFAM as is documented in its strategic planning documents.  This became clear in interviews with APROFAM managers and staff. Positive anecdotes about how ""MSH people"" provided ample opportunity for APROFAM staff to internalize and act upon proposed major changes clearly indicate the success of the MSH and APROFAM team approach in managing positive institutional change and growth.","Management & leadership development program/project|Project title: Better health for rural women and children|Evaluation summary: PD-ACQ-707","Special Evaluation","Documents","HRN-A-00-00-00014-00","","6/1/2003 12:00:00 AM","","Indigenous private voluntary organizations|Institution building|Impact assessment|Family planning services|Family planning clinics|Management development|Strategic planning|Economic self sufficiency|Reengineering|Development cooperation","Guatemala","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABZ934.pdf","481 KB","000750 - Management Sciences for Health (MSH)","","011262 - USAID.
