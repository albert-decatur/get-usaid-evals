"This study examines the extent of returned participants' contribution to the country's economic development, and whether any changes in attitude toward the United States on the part of the participants developed from the training experience. The evaluation used both oral interviews and written questionnaires. Of 261 returned participants, 132 were interviewed and 47 others completed written questionnaires. The study is one of the first participant training evaluations ever undertaken. This is an early and valuable effort with many good suggestions and insights into the training program.

"This evaluation report on the Point IV Brazilian Training Program identifies the proportion of participants who, on their return to Brazil, used the training they received under this program and in turn trained others, and suggests guidelines for selecting applicants who are most likely to use their training.  The study was based on personal interviews from three separate surveys, undertaken respectively in 1955, 1956, and 1957.  Of the many hypotheses tested, a participant's record prior to selection as a leader and innovator was found to correlate significantly with increasing the likelihood of ultimate success in utilization of training.
