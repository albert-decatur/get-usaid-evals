"This report is an evaluation of the Limy ak Organizasyon pu Kolekyivite yo Ale Lwen (LOKAL) program implemented by Tetra Tech ARD. The LOKAL program was a four-year project funded by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) designed to improve local governance and support the decentralization process in Haiti by strengthening the capacity and transparency of local governments and improving their ability to provide goods and services to their communities. Designed as an element of USAID/Haitis 20052010 strategy under the Governing More Effectively and Democratically Strategic Objective, the LOKAL program had four main components: (1) completing and implementing a legal framework for decentralization; (2) building local capacity; (3) managing a small grants program; and (4) managing information and disseminating lessons learned. Field operations began in December 2007 through a task order under the Decentralization and Democratic Local Governance Indefinite Quantity Contract (IQC) mechanism. A separate six-month extension contract was awarded June 30, 2011, extending the period of performance to December 31, 2011. As stated in the Statement of Work (SOW), for the purposes of this evaluation, the LOKAL program refers to work performed by Tetra Tech ARD under both contracts.","Cover title|Inside title: LOKAL program evaluation : final report|Task order no.

Armenia has become a signatory to the European Convention of Human Rights and other international treaties.

The project is a direct follow-up to the ""Food Security/Poverty Alleviation in Arid Agriculture Balochistan - Pilot Project Phase"", which began activities in 2004 and was completed by December 2008. The current project used the same overall approach as the original project in five districts instead of the three districts included in its precursor project. The current project examined the districts of Killa Saifullah, Loralai, Zhob, Quetta and Mastung. It aims at directly contributing to the Government of Pakistan's (GoP) Poverty Reduction Strategy by reducing poverty in the border areas and contributing directly to the GoPs ongoing National Food Security Program. At a more general level, it supports the ongoing government efforts to foster economic growth and stability in the border areas.","'Contracted Under No. GS-23F-8012H and Order No. AID-391-M-11 -00001'|Evaluated project title: United States Assistance to Balochistan border areas (US ABBA)|Project title: Independent monitoring and evaluation contract (IMEC)|Evaluation report: PD-ACT-381|Related mid-term evaluation: PD-ACL-739","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID-391-M-11-00001","","1/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","","Poverty reduction|Food security|Border areas|Crop production|Income generation|Agricultural technology","Pakistan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACT382.pdf","827 KB","003970 - Management Systems International, Inc.

"Balochistan is the least developed province of Pakistan, with levels of human development that are much below Pakistan's, greater gender disparities, higher poverty, greater food insecurity, and poor infrastructure. Government allocations for development are small in relation to the size of the province and the spread of the population, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) have a limited presence. Small farmers and the poor are unorganized, which, together with scattered settlements and low population density, makes service delivery much more costly than in other provinces. The poor have meager access to services. The operating environment for development projects has been especially testing in recent years in the presence of an insurgency and frequent targeted killings and kidnappings. Implemented by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations (UN), the United States Assistance to Balochistan Border Areas (US ABBA) project is working in five districts of Balochistan, namely, Killa Saifullah, Loralai, Mastung, Quetta, and Zhob. The project has been active in the first three of these districts since 2005, and in the other two since 2009. US ABBA aims to mobilize small farmers, promote agricultural development, and address rural poverty. The project portfolio spans social and human capital formation, community infrastructure development, the demonstration and diffusion of agricultural technology, and linkages between producers and markets. This report also includes an Annex as well.","'Contracted Under No. GS-23F-8012H and Order No. AID-391-M-11-00001'|Title in footer: US assistance to Balochistan border areas - evaluation report|Evaluated project title: United States Assistance to Balochistan border areas (US ABBA)|Project title: Independent monitoring and evaluation contract (IMEC)|Annex A (impact assessment): PD-ACT-382|Related mid-term evaluation: PD-ACL-739","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID-391-M-11-00001","","1/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","","Development assistance|Agricultural development|Food security|Poverty reduction|Educational development|Literacy|Primary health care","Pakistan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACT381.pdf","985 KB","003970 - Management Systems International, Inc.

"Balochistan is the least developed province of Pakistan. Besides a higher incidence of poverty than other provinces, Balochistan also exhibits a higher level of gender disparity due to lack of education and conservative social norms. According to the Labor Force Survey 2010-11, Balochistan's female labor force participation was at six percent. This is much lower than the national average of 15 percent or that of Punjab at 20 percent. Most women lack mobility and are largely homebound. Even women who are involved in agricultural activities serve as unpaid family workers and their ownership of important assets or land appears to be extremely limited. While homebound, the women of Balochistan inherit a rich tradition of embroidery. The quality of the embroidery is borne out by its demand from within the province as well as from other parts of the country.","'Contracted Under No. GS-23F-8012H and Order No. AID-391-M-11-00001'|Evaluated project title: Women's economic empowerment : Balochistan (WEE:B) [WEEB]|Project title: Independent monitoring and evaluation contract (IMEC)","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","AID-391-M-11-00001","","2/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","","Female empowerment|Women|Economic growth|Business formation","Pakistan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACT577.pdf","1,406 KB","003970 - Management Systems International, Inc.

"<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"">Market-based Partnerships for Health (MBPH) was a $13.5 million USAID/India funded project implemented by Abt Associates between October 1, 2008 and May 11, 2012. MBPH aimed to improve the environment for commercial sector engagement in USAID/India&rsquo;s key priority health areas by forging partnerships between the private and public sectors. MBPH fostered market-based partnerships in: (1) reproductive health, maternal health, and child health, including promotion of good hygiene, such as hand washing; (2) safe water; (3) prevention of indoor air pollution (IAP); and (4) the control of tuberculosis. MBPH, which was operational in Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Jharkhand and Karnataka, had two primary objectives: (1) build on, implement, institutionalize, and scale-up MBPH models; and (2) explore new commercial-sector opportunities to accelerate public health improvements, especially in base-of-pyramid (BoP) and rural population groups, improving access, demand, and service delivery through health and non-health partners. The program aimed to create and nurture MBPH models that can be brought to scale by commercial partners, government programs, and/or civil society groups. The program also sought to institutionalize local capacity to broker market-based partnerships for health in the future by supporting the establishment of a Center of Excellence. The final evaluation had three purposes: (1) review and analyze the overall program strategies and technical approaches adopted; (2) review and assess the effectiveness of the processes adopted for MBPH innovations, including planning, monitoring, finance, and technical support; and (3) provide recommendations on future directions, especially introducing new and/or continuing approaches for innovations with the private sector. The evaluators found that MBPH project successfully designed, implemented, and evaluated a wide range of private partnerships and initiatives that addressed a number of critical public health issues. In less than four years, and with a modest budget, MPBH made significant progress, building upon previous partnership models and exploring new opportunities to engage commercial private sector partners to test approaches ultimately designed to improve health outcomes for BoP families. The key MBPH achievements are: (1) developed eight partnership models; (2) demonstrated some success in execution, cost sharing, and commitment of partners to scale-up (or at least have scale-up potential) in each model; (3) introduced nine health companies to profitable BoP markets; and (4) leveraged over six million dollars from partners.

"The Copper Cobalt Conflict (CCC) Project implemented by PACT International (PACT) and funded by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) aimed to promote peace and security in the artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM) sector in and around Kolwezi, a mineral-rich area in Katanga Province, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). The specific objectives of the project were to: a) promote reconciliation, cooperation and understanding among all stakeholders within the ASM sector, and prevent and mitigate conflicts over access to and use of resources; b) raise awareness and provide technical support to prevent health risks, accidents and injuries at the mines; c) raise awareness and strengthen understanding of the mining code and related legislation; and, d) establish conflict resolution mechanisms to promote peace.The evaluation findings indicate that overall, project activities contributed to achieving project objectives by: a) reducing conflicts at mining sites by supporting the establishment of grassroots cooperatives that organized miners and upheld their rights; b) providing technical support to reduce accidents and injuries at the mines; c) strengthening the capacity of ASM-related institutions to resolve and mitigate conflict through dialogue and peaceful means; and, d) educating stakeholders on their roles, rights and responsibilities under the mining code and legislation.","'Task Order Number AID-527-C-07-00002'|Title in footer: Final evaluation of PACT CCC project|Evaluated project title: Copper cobalt conflict (CCC)","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","AID-527-C-07-00002","","4/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","","Copper|Cobalt|Conflict resolution|Peace|Mining|Minerals|Political reconciliation|Public awareness|Accidents|Wounds and injuries|Cultural cooperation","Congo DR","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACT716.pdf","1,196 KB","011492 - Development & Training Services, Inc.

"ESI was specifically concerned with information systems that measure and inform the United States Government (USG) PEPFAR program in South Africa, and the South African Government (SAG) HIV and AIDS program activities. The ESI Project (and thus this evaluation) focused on two distinct areas: 1) refinements to the web-based information system for program reporting and performance monitoring; 2) building the capacity of PEPFAR and SAG implementing partners to collect, report, and use high-quality data and strategic information for purposes of program management at the implementation level.The Project was designed to put in place a technical assistance organization/contractor with the technical scope and capacity to refine the information systems structure to improve its user interaction, and analytical functionality and tools; to serve as the information systems administrator and technical support office for users; and to simultaneously build the awareness, motivation and capacity PEPFAR and SAG managers to place high value on data quality and use of data/information for performance management purposes.This evaluation was both summative and formative in nature. It covered the period from inception of ESI in 2008, through March 2012, and considered key areas of ESI Project performance including: the appropriateness of the Projects development hypothesis; the adequacy of the Projects management; and the Projects performance including key achievements and gaps. The evaluation Scope of Work also requested the evaluators to make recommendations that would inform the future direction of similar projects.","'This document was submitted .... under ....

"Pakistans large and rapidly growing population challenges the country's ability to provide essential services, economic opportunities, and a good quality of life for its citizens. Furthermore, high total fertility rates put children and women at greater risk for higher mortality and poor overall health. Most non-first births in Pakistan fall into the high-risk category, and infant and maternal mortality rates remain high. Evidence shows that longer intervals between births can reduce the incidence of both neonatal and maternal mortality. Pakistan instituted a comprehensive and detailed family planning program in the mid-1960s to address the impact of poor birth spacing and high fertility and has continued to explore different approaches to expand family planning services, improve quality, and reach underserved areas. Family planning services were delivered primarily through the separate Population and Welfare Ministry and not connected to the Ministry of Health services.","'Contracted Under No. GS-23F-8012H and Order No. AID-391-M-11-00001'|Evaluated project title: Family advancement for life and health (FALAH)|Project title: Independent monitoring and evaluation contract (IMEC)","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","AID-391-M-11-00001","","3/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","","Family health care|Population growth|Access to services|Health service utilization|Quality of life|Economic development|Fertility|Women|Maternal mortality|Child mortality|Health risk","Pakistan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACT744.pdf","2,316 KB","003970 - Management Systems International, Inc.

"This evaluation addresses three tasks per the statement of work. The first task is to analyze the costs and benefits of how MEASURE DHS operates within this complex and changing environment with an emphasis on contractors success in delivering two aspects of their operation: (a) responding to the varied needs of key stakeholders, and (b) providing technical assistance (TA) in survey content, design, and implementation. The evaluation team identified needs within the manageable interests of the project and TA approaches that might increase contractors TA performance (including those that may not be part of the current project approach). The second evaluation task is to assess the feasibility and appropriateness of the capacity building goals laid out in the MEASURE DHS contract in light of the increased complexities of survey work and global demand for high quality and timely information by examining stakeholder (particularly host country stakeholder) needs and advising on approaches that might increase contractor capacity building performance. The third task is to provide recommendations and document what is and is not working with regard to meeting stakeholder needs and conducting TA and capacity building activities.","'Contracted with PHI'|Project title: Global health fellows program (GHFP)","Special Evaluation","Documents","GPO-A-00-06-00005-00","","5/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","","Health surveys|Demographic research|Disease prevention and control","Africa south of Sahara|Malawi|East Africa","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACT785.pdf","1,063 KB","003970 - Management Systems International, Inc.

"In November 2008, USAID awarded IntraHealth International a bilateral Cooperative Agreement, for five years and nearly USD $50 million. The stated goal of the project was to build the capacity of indigenous organizations to respond to and implement HIV/AIDS programs leading to increased numbers of Namibians who know their HIV status, and to improved access to high quality HIV/AIDS prevention, care, and support and treatment services.IntraHealth was to work primarily with FBOs, other non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and the MoHSS in pursuit of these objectives, emphasizing building the capacity and availability of managers and staff within the FBO health care and MoHSS systems through training and TA to clinical and administrative personnel, and development of e-data systems for management of patients records, human resources and project data. Work was focused on voluntary counseling and testing centers (VCTCs), clinics at FBOs, and the development of, and training in the use of, the HRIMS (Human Resources Information Management System). These clinical and non-clinical activities have both direct and indirect impacts on the wide spectrum of HIV prevention and care, in such areas as availability and adherence to early diagnosis, appropriate antiretroviral treatment (ART), prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT), and linkages of diagnosis and treatment of HIV and TB, etc. Now past mid-term and approaching the expected end of project in September 2013, and in the context of extraordinary success of the overall Namibian HIV Program, it is the opinion of the assessment team that the IntraHealth project has been a major success in meeting its objectives, though not without attendant current and future problems described in the evaluation.","Evaluated project title: Namibia HIV prevention, care and support|Project title: Global health technical assistance bridge (GH tech bridge)","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID-OAA-C-12-00004","","6/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","","HIV/AIDS|Disease prevention and control|Health facilities|Health care planning|Voluntary Counseling and Testing (VCT) for HIV/AIDS","Namibia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACT792.pdf","532 KB","011492 - Development & Training Services, Inc.

"he purpose of this evaluation is to identify results and lessons learned from USAIDs Afghanistan Media Development and Empowerment Project (AMDEP). AMDEP was designed as a one-year project (later extended) that began on November 1, 2010. It built on eight years of previous USAID media activities in Afghanistan and continued USAIDs strategic focus on improving news and development-related radio information for underserved groups such as rural families, women and young people. AMDEP supports a comprehensive value chain approach to strengthening the media sector, dealing with training of journalists; establishing and operating a network of rural radio stations; introducing new media to enable amateur voices to communicate about social, economic, and development issues; encouraging advocacy to protect journalistic freedoms; helping citizens understand and value the importance of media information and news; training media lawyers; and supporting new media laws and policies that will support development of a dynamic, independent media industry. Internews is the lead implementer of AMDEP activities and of previous USAID media activities that led to AMDEP. Overall, AMDEP has been remarkably successful. It had to function in a context of administrative delays and funding uncertainties, security threats, an environment of many different media projects and an unpredictable economy. The technical and managerial depth of the Internews team was an important factor in the projects success, as was its selection of effective Afghan partner organizations. Flexibility and agility on the part of USAID and Internews made it possible to adapt to changing circumstances.","''Contracted under USAID Contract Number: GS-10F-0425M (Order Number: 306-M-00-07-00502-00) (Task Order Number 2007-012)''|Evaluated project title: Afghanistan media development and empowerment project (AMDEP)|Project title: Services under program and project offices for results tracking (SUPPORT)","Special Evaluation","Documents","306-M-00-07-00502-00","","4/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","","Communication media|Communications development|Radio|Rural populations|Youth|Broadcasts|Information dissemination","Afghanistan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACT895.pdf","2,133 KB","000356 - Checchi and Co.

"The District Delivery Program (DDP) was conceived in late 2009 as a means to quickly begin providing basic public services in areas recently cleared by the military and, through greater presence and visibility, help strengthen the credibility of the government so the population would stop supporting insurgents. The purpose of this evaluation was to assess program performance in the 13 Districts that had been approved for USAID funding including identifying program delivery obstacles, achievement of objectives and benchmarks, and to recommend a way forward.Despite its short duration and negligible disbursements, DDP has been a rich learning experience. It highlighted major shortcomings in DDPs design and implementation. With respect to design flaws, the dual objectives of the program were valid but did not fit together well - one aimed at short-term quick impact and other longer-term institutional strengthening. The program is considered an anomaly as it was an on-budget stabilization initiative with TA provided through USG field representatives. Regarding implementation, the pressure for a quick roll-out, without other benefits of piloting and testing, contributed to problems based on inaccurate assumptions of GIRoAs financial and staffing capability. IDLG requires considerable support at the central, provincial and district levels to operate effectively. Program management by USG was deficient in many respects, and there was much room for improvement in the technical assistance provided at the provincial and central levels where support was needed most. USG field staff had mixed capabilities and failed to receive adequate management support.","'The performance evaluation was contracted under: USAID Contract Number: GS-10F-0425M, Order Number: 306-M-00-07-00502-00, Task Order Number 2007-012'|Also known as: Performance evaluation of district delivery program|Evaluated project title: District delivery program (DDP)|Project title: Services under program and project offices for results tracking (SUPPORT)","Special Evaluation","Documents","306-M-00-07-00502-00","","4/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","","Government planning|Government reform|Districts|Political stability|Governance|Political corruption|Anticorruption interventions","Afghanistan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACT900.pdf","2,093 KB","000356 - Checchi and Co.

"The Accelerating Sustainable Agriculture Program (ASAP) followed other USAID funded agriculture development programs with similar objectives. The intent was to continue moving agriculture along the spectrum from the farm gate to higher levels within the processing sector, with the end goal of increasing exports as an engine for development. The project ended in October 2011 with interest in an evaluation two-fold: assess the performance and reach of the activities implemented under ASAP and pose lessons learned that might impact future program considerations along this farm gate to export continuum. The evaluation process considered the four focus areas of the project: agribusiness investments, agriculture inputs, agriculture services provided to the sector, and advisory services provided to the ministry, which formed the basis for addressing the questions posed in the Statement of Work. ASAP achieved much success, pointing the way to better post harvest quality products and moving traders and exporters to higher levels of performance.

"Troubled relations between Armenia and Turkey have had a negative influence on Armenia since independence. Armenia and Turkey are neighbors that share hundreds of years of history of living together - as well as the last century of tensions. The border has been closed by Turkey for most of the 20 years of Armenian independence and the two countries have not established diplomatic relations. However, from a 10 year perspective there have been dramatic changes in Armenia-Turkey rapprochement - from almost no contact to significant civil society and business ties. Improved Armenia-Turkey relations are important to the United States Government in its efforts to support peace and stability in the Caucasus and the development of a strong democratic Armenia with economic and other engagement with her neighbors. But conditions are not propitious for a breakthrough in the status quo because there are few opportunities for a significant change in state-to-state relations. USAID thus needs a medium- to long-term perspective to support future rapprochement, as well as to provide support to keep the ideas and vision of Armenia-Turkey rapprochement alive and to build on growing concrete ties in civil society and businesses.","'Contracted under RAN-I-00-09-00016-00, Task Order Number AID-111-TO-11-00002'|Submitted to USAID on March 29, 2012|Also known as: SATR evaluation report|AID-RAN-I-09-00016","Special Evaluation","Documents","RAN-I-00-09-00016-00|AID-111-TO-11-00002|RAN-I-00-09-00016-00","","2/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","","International conflict|International monetary relations|Business formation|Civil society|Partnerships|Multilateral relations","Armenia|Turkey","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACT906.pdf","983 KB","001891 - International Business and Technical Consultants, Inc.

"This report presents an assessment of the Program Research for Strengthening Services (PROGRESS) project, conducted by a team of independent consultants.&nbsp; The project is a five-year USAID cooperative agreement that was awarded to Family Health International 360 (FHI 360) in June 2008, ending in June 2013.&nbsp; PROGRESS is a key component in the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) Bureau for Global Health/Office of Population and Reproductive Health/Research, Technology and Utilization Division (GH/PRH/RTU) portfolio seeking to improve the effectiveness of family planning (FP) programs for underserved populations in sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia through innovation and scale-up of evidence-based practices.&nbsp; To achieve this, PROGRESS conducts operations research (OR) studies, research utilization (RU) activities, and capacity building (CB) support and works in collaboration with USAID missions, ministries of health (MOHs), USAID implementing partners, and other stakeholders.&nbsp; The evaluation was based on a desk review of documents provided by PROGRESS and face-to-face, telephone, Skype, and e-mail interviews conducted with stakeholders, both in the field and in the United States.&nbsp; The evaluation team was charged with capturing successes and opportunities to influence the last year of project implementation and the lessons learned regarding program structure, management, and partnerships that should be applied to future projects.&nbsp; Particular emphasis was given to capturing the lessons learned for working well with USAID missions and meeting their future needs.&nbsp; The evaluators provided recommendations to the project and USAID, including: (1) there is still a need for an FP operations research flagship project funded and functioning independent of a service delivery project; (2) the project timeline should be 7 to 10 years; (3) with a longer project timeline, take a more disciplined approach to initiating activities and select a small number of core focus countries; (4) capacity building in FP program monitoring and evaluation should continue to be a central component of the project; and (5) develop a specific branding strategy that distinguishes the project from the implementing partner.&nbsp; An additional seven recommendations are included in the report.&nbsp; (Excerpt, modified)","Evaluated project title: Program research for strengthening services (PROGRESS)|Project title: Global health technical assistance bridge II (GH tech bridge II)","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","AID-OAA-C-12-00027","","6/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","","","Africa south of Sahara|Southeast Asia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACT952.pdf","803 KB","011492 - Development & Training Services, Inc.

"The Democratic Indicators Monitoring Survey (DIMS) cooperative agreement (CA), signed between USAID and the Latin American Public Opinion Project (LAPOP), is an eight-year agreement including several components.&nbsp; The largest component of the agreement is a series of nationally-representative public opinion surveys that have been conducted biennially since 2006 in 16 Central American, South American, and Caribbean countries.&nbsp; Other components of the agreement include survey oversamples in DIMS countries, a range of reporting and dissemination activities, and special studies, most notably including the Central American Regional Security Initiative (CARSI) impact evaluation (IE).&nbsp; The DIMS surveys are a part of the broader AmericasBarometer (AB) project conducted by LAPOP, a research institute at Vanderbilt University.&nbsp; The DIMS public opinion surveys are designed to measure citizen perceptions of and experiences with several aspects of governance and democracy.&nbsp; Their purpose is to: (1) track longitudinal changes in democratization in each country individually as well as the region as a whole; (2) support USAID strategic planning at both Mission and Bureau levels; (3) allow USAID to make cross-national comparisons and develop common indicators of progress; and (4) assess the outcomes of USAID's democracy programming.&nbsp; A rigorous performance evaluation was conducted of the public opinion survey component of the DIMS agreement.&nbsp; The overall purpose of the evaluation was to assess the performance of DIMS and to advise USAID on ways to strengthen the design and implementation of a possible new iteration of the DIMS cooperative agreement.&nbsp; Some of the findings evaluators found include: (1) DIMS has provided an abundance of high quality data to USAID/Washington (USAID/W), USAID country Missions, host governments, NGOs, media and researchers; (2) DIMS methodology adheres to the highest professional standards; (3) the DIMS questionnaire is carefully constructed, with a core time-series of standard questions across countries combined with country-specific and special topic questions; (4) surveys are used by USAID both in the LAC Bureau and in individual country missions, but only somewhat by host country governments and other in-country users; (5) the survey process has increased the survey capabilities of individuals and firms throughout Latin America; and (6) LAPOP has extensive female participation in staff at Vanderbilt, but less at its partners and contractors.&nbsp; The evaluators also provide numerous recommendations in the report.&nbsp; (Excerpt, modified)","Evaluated project title: Democratic indicators monitoring survey (DIMS)|Project title: Democracy and governance analytical services III","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","AID-OAA-I-10-00003|AID-OAA-TO-11-00057","","8/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","","","South America|Caribbean|Central America","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACU123.pdf","6,829 KB","011933 - Social Impact, Inc.","","040194 - USAID.

"The South Sudan Health Transformation Project phase II (SHTP II) was developed to strengthen local health systems and improve the delivery of services to patients while also increasing the local demand for services.&nbsp; The project ran from February 2009 to October 2012 with a total available funding of $58,497,880.&nbsp; SHTP II had three result areas: (1) service delivery; (2) health system strengthening; and (3) demand increase.&nbsp; The project was designed to accelerate health system development by making the provision of essential health services compatible with the Ministry of Health's (MOH's) capacity to manage the service delivery system.&nbsp; Management Sciences for Health (MSH) was contracted to manage SHTP II and provide support to 166 government-owned health facilities through performance-based contracts (PBCs) with lead agencies in each of the 14 focus counties.&nbsp; The seven high-impact services to be provided were based on the MOHs Basic Package of Health Services (BPHS), including: child health, nutrition, hygiene and sanitation, malaria, maternal health, family planning (FP), and prevention of HIV/AIDS.&nbsp; To underpin delivery of these essential services, SHTP II was designed to support the strengthening of South Sudan's health systems at the facility and county levels.&nbsp; Under SHTP II, emphasis was also put on involving the community and increasing its demand for health services.&nbsp; The purpose of this end of project (EOP) evaluation, which was based on a series of specific research questions, is to understand the strengths and weaknesses of SHTP II's approach to its three stated result areas in order to develop recommendations for new health program planning and for USAID's South Sudan health portfolio in general.&nbsp; The evaluation took place during May and June 2012 and relied on an extensive document review, key informant interviews, a rapid survey of sub-contracted partners, and field visits to a representative sample of health facilities.&nbsp; The findings of the evaluation are: (1) service delivery: the evaluation found that the SHTP II project achieved some encouraging results at the supported facilities, however, the availability of services was vulnerable to persistent supply and equipment shortages and lack of qualified health workers; (2) in health systems strengthening, the evaluation assessed response to health system challenges at the facility and county levels, with the process revealing that the very low baseline of national health systems posed significant implementation challenges for SHTP II and the sustainability of health services; (3) increasing demand for services: the project successfully used standardized trainings to rapidly increase the number of trained community members, namely home health promoters and village health committees.&nbsp; The evaluators also outline specific recommendations for each of the project's result areas.&nbsp; (Excerpt, modified)","Evaluated project title: Sudan health transformation project phase II (SHTP II)|Project title: Services under program and project offices for results tracking (SUPPORT)","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","DFD-I-00-05-00251-00","","7/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","","Health delivery|Access to services|Demand|Health care systems|Health facilities|Community based delivery","South Sudan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACU122.pdf","2,715 KB","003970 - Management Systems International, Inc.

"The Gender Equity through Education (GEE) Program was funded by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and implemented by Winrock International in close partnership with the Republic of South Sudan Ministry of General Education &amp; Instruction (RSS/MoGEI).&nbsp; USAID established GEE on March 23, 2007 to continue, accelerate, and expand accomplishments achieved under the Gender Equity Support Program (GESP) which ran from July 2002 to September 2007.&nbsp; The GEE project objectives were to increase the number of girls and women attending secondary school, and teacher training institutes (TTIs) by reducing financial and infrastructure, social, and institutional barriers.&nbsp; Its components included: (1) stipends for secondary school and TTI students; (2) a mentoring program; (3) small school improvement grants; and (4) technical assistance to the MoGEI and State Ministries of Education (SMoEs).&nbsp; The objective of this final performance evaluation are: (1) to ascertain the extent to which the mid-term evaluation recommendations were implemented; (2) whether project objectives and indicator targets were met; and (3) the efficacy of the overall design.&nbsp; The evaluation was undertaken in May and June 2012, and included both qualitative and quantitative methods including a review of relevant documents and the GEE Education Management Information System (EMIS,) interviews with GEE staff and government officials, and field visits to three states where evaluators interviewed teachers, parents, and students.&nbsp; The evaluators conclude that the GEE project is a good project embedded in a very weak system, a system that makes much of the GEE components either unsustainable or their benefits short-lived.&nbsp; While some important aspects of the project remained unimplemented until the latter years of the project, it generally came to be well executed.&nbsp; By the last years of the project, disbursement of stipends to over 5,300 beneficiaries over five years became well implemented and well monitored.&nbsp; GEE staff relationships and collaboration with national and state ministry officials appeared to be excellent and deeply appreciated.&nbsp; The evaluators have made recommendations, including: (1) all parties should better coordinate responses to evaluation recommendations and enable flexibility to respond to changing conditions in project settings; (2) capacity, sustainability, and exit strategies should be established before a project begins and required in all work plans from the very beginning; (3)projects must consider the broader institution enabling mechanisms (transportation, equipment, etc.) since their absence can limit the effects of any individual or institutional capacity improvements; and (4) any subsequent projects addressing gender equity and access should draw models from the Gender Thematic Working Group (GTWG), the Wau Mentor-Teachers' Union, and the Central Equatoria SMoE carry-on of the GEE mentor training regime.&nbsp; An additional six recommendations are included in the report.&nbsp; (Excerpt, modified)&nbsp;","Evaluated project title: Gender equity through education (GEE)|Project title: Services under program and project offices for results tracking (SUPPORT)|Midterm evaluation: PD-ACR-923","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","DFD-I-00-05-00251-00","","6/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","","Gender equity|Access to education|Girls education|Women","South Sudan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACU197.pdf","2,210 KB","003970 - Management Systems International, Inc.

"According to its logical framework, the purpose of the MDP is to increase the accountability of municipal governments to the communities they serve and to achieve broad community participation in decisionmaking and oversight of local public investments. However, the performance of the program was not uniform in all municipalities. The sensitive political setting in Cabinda and the difficult socio-economic conditions in Cuito Cuanavale influenced on the relatively weaker performance of these municipalities in some outputs. One of the insights stemming from this is that, due to the approach adopted that privileged the adoption of a model that could be used for all municipalities, the program might have overlooked the different contexts where it operated, applying a standardized approach in all components for all cases. Whilst the alternative of applying different policy models for different municipalities cannot be considered realistic, finding ways to address the specificities of the municipalities in a diverse country like Angola is important to ensure the relevance and effectiveness of governance interventions like the MDP.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","3/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","","Municipal level|Political development|Accountability|Community development|Political participation|Governance","Angola","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACU206.pdf","1,002 KB","","","008507 - USAID.

"USAID/Serbia's Preparedness, Planning and Economic Security (PPES) Project is a five-year $25 million project implemented by Development Alternatives, Inc. (DAI).&nbsp; It consists of two distinct but related components: preparedness planning (PP) and economic security (ES).&nbsp; It began in May 2006 and was originally scheduled to end in 2011, and the preparedness planning component ended then.&nbsp; The contract was amended to add eighteen months for the economic security component.&nbsp; The objective of this performance evaluation was to conduct a full, evidence-based and independent review of USAID-financed activities under PPES.&nbsp; The purpose of the evaluation was: (1) to examine the effectiveness of project activities to date; (2) to determine whether the project has achieved planned results; (3) to identify gaps in performance against targets; and (4) in the case of activities under economic security component, to provide recommendations on closing these gaps in the final year of the project.&nbsp; At the request of the mission, further consideration was given to identifying lessons learned and recommendations for consideration in future funding.&nbsp; The evaluation's overall findings are: (1) PPES has met or exceeded requirements of the project; (2) DAI's reports are consistent with the findings of this evaluation, with one minor exception; (3) the failure to have any progress in government-to-government dialogue between Kosovo and Serbia is having a broad negative impact on PPES' ability to help business expand across borders and it also limits linkages in youth activities; and (4) the economic downturn has limited export markets and slowed business growth throughout Serbia, including those firms included in the performance evaluation.&nbsp; Some overall recommendations at the program level were made as well: (1) migrate some of the best, ongoing work in Youth and Business Support to other ongoing or planned initiatives; (2) the PPES Grants program had a high level of impact, but is understated; (3) USAID/Serbia should initiate new designs or interventions now so as not to lose the momentum that PPES has been providing; (4) six changes in Contracting Officer Technical Representative (COTR), now titled COR, occurred during the life of PPES; given the caliber of the technical national staff within USAID/Serbia, that such authorities and responsibilities be vested in a permanent national staff; and (5) having locally identified staff work in region-specific positions is highly recommended as it facilitates all aspects of program implementation.&nbsp; (Excerpt, modified)&nbsp;","'This Final Evaluation Report was prepared .... under Evaluation Services IQC task order AID-169-TO-12-00002.'|Title in footer: PPES performance evaluation : final evaluation report|Evaluation project title: Preparedness, planning and economic security (PPES)","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","AID-169-TO-12-00002","","9/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","","Economic development|Economic planning|Industrial security|Performance indicators|Border areas|Youth|Institutional linkages|Exports|Market development|Economic growth","Serbia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACU293.pdf","710 KB","International Business and Technical Consultants, Inc.

"The purpose of this performance evaluation is to assess the results of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID)-funded Elections and Political Processes Program (EPP Program) in Colombia designed to strengthen political parties and electoral processes in Colombia. The Program was implemented by the International Republican Institute (IRI) and the National Democratic Institute (NDI) from 2007 to 2012. This evaluation examines implementing partners activities, evaluates their results, identifies lessons learned and best practices, and develops recommendations for possible future USAID support. The Elections and Political Processes program has been successful in many respects. Colombian partners and beneficiaries acknowledge the value of working with NDI and IRI and the importance of partnering with them to advance their interests. NDI and IRI were recognized by a vast majority of interviewees as critical players in Colombia, as unlike local organizations, these international Institutes achieved unparalleled convening power, and managed to reach agreements among often seemingly irreconcilable organizations and/or leaders on a range of issues. Component 1 - Promoting more effective and programmatic parties at the national and local level. Component 2 - Inclusion of Afro-Colombians, Internally Displaced People and women in the political process.

"Akazi Kanoze (Work Well Done) is a five-year, $9.8 million youth workforce development project designed specifically to help Rwandan youth develop the skills and attitudes necessary to obtain sustainable livelihoods, maintain healthy lifestyles, and participate constructively in their communities through a combination of education, training, and support services. More specifically, it couples a Work Readiness Curriculum designed to build the soft skills required by youth to succeed in the careers they are preparing as they complete skills training programs offered by various youth-serving organizations. Akazi Kanoze is financed by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and implemented by Education Development Center, Inc. (EDC).The project also seeks to build the capacity of organizations promoting youth workforce development and contribute to emerging Government of Rwanda (GoR) policy implementation in this area. The project design includes linking youth to existing jobs, training, and education opportunities where possible. Nurturing formal and informal collaborative alliances between USG, local government institutions, other donors, NGOs, education and training providers, and the private sector are also part of the project design. This evaluation explores the relevant data available to inform USAID/Rwanda on the impact of the Akazi Kanoze program in relation to the following four objectives: (1)Identify evidence of increased youth access to employment; (2)Identify evidence of increased capacity of local NGOs to serve youth needs for non-formal Work Readiness and job skills training; (3)Identify key components of the Akazi Kanoze model that may affect program success; (4)Assess how well the Akazi Kanoze project is meeting its goal and key objectives cost-effectively.","Project title: Akazi kanoze youth livelihoods","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID-696-A-09-00002|696-A-00-09-00002-00","","4/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","","Youth|Livelihood|Labor force|Health behavior|Skilled workers|Life skills training|Professional training|Occupational opportunities|Employment|Access to information","Rwanda","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACU298.pdf","661 KB","000461 - Education Development Center, Inc.

"The purpose of the USAID/South Africa (SA) Umbrella Grant Management (UGM) evaluation was to inform the design of the next UGM. The evaluation focused on strengths and weaknesses of three bilateral UGM partners (or UGMPs): FHI360, Pact, and Right to Care. It also focused on a fourth project (the FHI360 Capable Partners project) in a variety of domains. FHI360 Capable Partners, or CAP, was not a UGM, but rather a Leader with Associate Award under a global award. Therefore, throughout the report, UGMPs is used to refer to the first three UGMPs, and CAP is addressed separately, due to its different aims, methodologies and funding mechanism. The evaluation teams overall observation, based on documentation and interviews with UGM and USAID, is that all three UGMPs ensured compliance and accountability for US funds. There were few instances of noncompliance or nonperformance by the SPs managed by the UGMPs; in these limited cases, the evidence seen suggests that the UGMPs discovered the issues quickly and took prompt action. The SI team observed that minor flaws in financial management, governance, or leadership, if not addressed rapidly and pro-actively, have the potential to escalate to major flaws.","Project Name: Pact Inc.

"This report presents the results of an evaluation of the performance of the West Africa Trade Hub (the Trade Hub), which focuses on export-ready companies, and two regional trade projects the Agribusiness and Trade Promotion Project (ATP) and the Extended-ATP (E-ATP), which focus on promoting regional trade within West Africa for value chains including grains, cattle, poultry, and onions. When discussing the latter projects in this report, they are collectively referred to as E/ATP, and all three projects conducted a tremendous amount of training and capacity building to build commodity associations and help individual companies and producer organizations improve their performance and exports. The challenges addressed, such as nontariff barriers to free trade in Africa, transport impediments, the severe shortage of credit for agribusiness, and marketing and policy issues were substantial and the projects undertook short-term and medium-term activities that met those challenges and in the process built capacity for the future and expanded trade.The Trade Hub, under the current evaluation period (2007-2011) achieved a number of successes, directly facilitating $178 million of private sector exports by small companies for non-traditional exports to America and Europe. E/ATP launched in 2009, specifically dealt with very small producers and their production and marketing organizations achieving success in expanding marketing information and contacts, introducing technological improvements, and building capacity in key producer and trader organizations, in a short time frame. Regional trade registered in these commodities by the trade monitoring system that E/ATP set up reached $392 million in 2009/10 including cattle ($293 million), onions ($44 million), maize ($15 million), sorghum ($13.4 million), millet ($12.9 million), parboiled rice ($7.7 million), and poultry day-old chicks ($6.8 million).","Task order no.

"<span style=""font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"">The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) provided technical assistance to the National Tuberculosis Control Program of Mexico based on a memorandum of understanding (MOU) signed in 1999 by Presidents Bill Clinton and Ernesto Zedillo and a strategic objective grant agreement (SOAG) in 2000. &nbsp;The strategic objective was to develop a sustainable and effective institutional capacity to diagnose, control, and monitor tuberculosis in target areas. &nbsp;USAID's commitment was approximately US$16 million; support started in 2004 and ended in 2012. &nbsp;The project aimed to increase political commitment to the TB program, increase use of laboratory-based diagnosis, improve directly observed therapy, and strengthen mechanisms to monitor program activities to reach 70 percent TB case detection and 85 percent cure rate. &nbsp;This evaluation aims to: (1) update the findings and recommendations from the 2010 evaluation of activities by USAID and the Tuberculosis Coalition for Technical Assistance (TBCTA); (2) document USAID's legacy in Mexico for TB control; (3) assess the sustainability of USAID investments in Mexico for TB; (4) identify priority activities at risk of not being continued after the phase-out of USAID support; and (5) recommend options for ensuring sustainability. &nbsp;The document also analyzes the past and current epidemiological situation of tuberculosis in Mexico and includes recommendations to USAID and to the National Tuberculosis Program (NTP) for future action to sustain gains and increase the impact of control activities on TB transmission, incidence, and mortality. &nbsp;The evaluators concluded that USAID cooperation had a major impact on the national capacity for TB control, disproportionate to the funds invested (~US$0.01 per capita per year). &nbsp;The main areas strengthened were: (1) the laboratory network; (2) human resource capacity at national, state, and district level; (3) the information system; (4) and MDR-TB diagnosis and case management. &nbsp;Technical cooperation accelerated DOTS implementation and increased political commitment at national level and in geographical areas in addition to the priority states. &nbsp;There were increased treatment success rates, and the strategic objectives of case detection and treatment success were achieved. &nbsp;In areas with direct support to service improvement, PP/PPM and ACSM, the detection of suspects and notification of smear-positive pulmonary TB cases increased rapidly. &nbsp;(Excerpt, modified)</span>","'Task Order 01 (TO2015)'|Project title: Tuberculosis indefinite quantity contract (TB IQC)","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","GHN-I-00-09-00006-01|GHN-I-00-09-00006-00","","10/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","","Tuberculosis|Disease prevention and control|Disease transmission|Mortality|Multidrug-resistant/extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR/XDR-TB)|Community mobilization","Mexico","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACU379.pdf","1,037 KB","006425 - Program for Appropriate Technology in Health (PATH)","","011222 - USAID.

"<span style=""font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"">In India, the urban poor are among the fastest growing and especially vulnerable sub-populations, having limited access to clean water, sanitation, and health care. &nbsp;Despite compelling need, urban health has not been a priority issue and receives less attention than rural health care. &nbsp;In response to the Government of India's proposed National Urban Health Mission (NUHM), USAID's Health of the Urban Poor (HUP) project in 2009 was designed to work at state, municipal, and community levels to develop innovative policies and program strategies to better meet the health needs of the urban poor. &nbsp;This mid-term HUP evaluation was designed to provide an assessment of the project's progress in addressing five key components (i.e., technical assistance (TA), public private partnerships, convergence, demonstration models, and management and governance) after one year of project implementation. &nbsp;The evaluation addresses the extent to which HUP is developing and implementing innovative urban health interventions and models that can be considered for replication and scale up, in India and possibly other countries as well. &nbsp;The evaluation's goal is to provide useful guidance on how well the project has been rolled-out, what appears to be working or not working, and how HUP might be best deployed to ensure positive results during the remainder of the project. &nbsp;The evaluation was conducted over a period of four weeks during June and July 2012. &nbsp;The evaluators found that the HUP project has several accomplishments and achievements, despite encountering many challenges which include: on-going delay in the launch of the NUHM and thus, no clear incentive for states to address urban health issues; a 10-month delay in HUP project approval by GOI, resulting in a very short period (six to 12 months) for implementation of project activities to date; and uncertainty about the remaining time period (one or two years) until project completion. &nbsp;Another fundamental challenge is the nature of the project design, which includes a broad range of activities to be provided through a TA approach in eight states and five municipalities representing diverse environments. &nbsp;Also, the project's performance indicators make it difficult to assess achievements in many areas. &nbsp;However, in a relatively short period, the HUP project has helped to delineate national- and state-level policies on urban health, in addition to broadening the participation of relevant stakeholders in the development of NUHM policies, program priorities, and operational strategies (e.g., national- and state-level ministries and departments). &nbsp;(Excerpt, modified)</span>","Submitted as: Final HUP midterm evaluation report|Evaluated project title: Health of the urban poor  (HUP)","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID-386-TO-10-00003|RAN-I-00-09-00019-00|AID-RAN-I-00-09-00019","","10/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","","Urban populations|Poor|Health delivery|Water sanitation|Local level|Municipal level","India","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACU382.pdf","1,161 KB","011933 - Social Impact, Inc.","","000035 - U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)","English","application/pdf","Performance evaluation (2011 definition)|Interim evaluation","","Justice, Judith|Gopinath, Ranjani|et al.","Health delivery","Oct 2012","","","","USAID/India health of the urban poor : mid-term evaluation report","","PD-ACU-382","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MzI0NjU2","India",""
"In terms of education, Pakistan ranks among South Asia's lowest performing countries and is unlikely to achieve the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) of universal primary education by 2015.&nbsp; Pakistan's poor performance in education persists despite a vast body of research that demonstrates a clear link between education and poverty alleviation, attainment of long-term development goals, and sustainable economic growth.&nbsp; In other words, the relative lack of educational opportunities in Pakistan does more than just minimize job opportunities; its poor performance in education is a key contributor to the nation's ongoing political and social instability.&nbsp; In 2004 the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and Pakistan's Higher Education Commission (HEC) developed the Merit and Needs-based Scholarship Program (MNBSP.) The objectives of MNBSP are: (1) to enable the academically qualified, yet financially needy, Pakistani students to continue university studies in selected private and public universities of Pakistan in the fields of agriculture and business administration; and (2) to enhance the institutional capacity of the HEC of the GOP and local public and private sector universities in designing and implementing need and merit based scholarship projects.&nbsp; The purpose of this evaluation of MNBSP is to provide USAID/Pakistan with an independent performance-cum-process evaluation to help improve the performance of MNBSP and its contribution to USAID/Pakistan's development objectives.&nbsp; The scope of the evaluation was defined through twelve specific questions.&nbsp; After review, the evaluators make five key recommendations: (1) in consultation with HEC, reconsider the fields of study and the allocation of scholarships across supported fields of study in future scholarship programs; (2) increase outreach to women; (3) consider modifying eligibility criteria for women with a more robust definition of ""remote/vulnerable""; (4) identify and resolve causes of delayed payments to recipients; and (5) ensure that the scholarship covers all education expenses of the students.&nbsp; (Excerpt, modified)","'Contracted Under No. GS-23F-8012H and Order No. AID-391-M-11-00001'|Evaluated project title: Merit and needs-based scholarship program (MNBSP)|Project title: Independent monitoring and evaluation contract (IMEC)","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID-391-M-11-00001","","8/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","","Scholarships|Higher education|Educational development","Pakistan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACU395.pdf","3,283 KB","003970 - Management Systems International, Inc.

"This report is the result of an evaluation of the results of a two-year (20102012) rule of law program implemented by Tetra Tech DPK Consulting, Inc. (DPK) under United States Agency for International Development (USAID).&nbsp; The program focused primarily on supporting the development of the formal judicial structure in Afghanistan.&nbsp; The overall goal of the program was to support USAID/Afghanistan's Rule of Law Strategy for Afghanistan, specifically Pillar 1 (improve the justice sector and reduce corruption) and Pillar 4 (build leadership in the justice sector and civil society).&nbsp; To support Pillar 1, the contractor attempted to develop the capacity of judiciary and the law schools; for Pillar 4, the contractor worked to raise public awareness and encourage citizens to resolve disputes through the formal justice sector.&nbsp; The program was divided into four components: (1) capacity building of the judiciary; (2) capacity building of court management systems; (3) capacity building of the faculties of law and Sharia; and (4) public legal outreach and awareness through strategic communication.&nbsp; Overall, the evaluators felt that the contractor was effective in reaching its programming goals when program beneficiaries bought into the program.&nbsp; When buy-in was not explicit, program results were mixed at best.&nbsp; During the evaluation, several issues emerged that affected DPK's ability to achieve its goals, including: (1) slow establishment of the program; (2) a lack of administrative agility; (3) fragile monitoring and evaluation systems; (3) USAID issuing the contract for one year, with a one-year option; (4) and security issues affecting how and when training could be conducted.&nbsp; All of these issues affected not only how much the project could achieve in the time available, but also how well the project could answer the ""so what"" questions about the value of its efforts.&nbsp; Going forward, emphasis should be placed on programs that focus on Afghan youth, as this group demonstrated enthusiasm for participating in and implementing the lessons learned from the program.&nbsp; (Excerpt, modified)","Title in footer: RLS-F program evaluation final report|Task order no.

"This is a report on the mid-term performance evaluation of the Kosovo Growth and Fiscal Stability Initiative (GFSI) program, which began in July 2010 and ends in July 2013.&nbsp; The main purpose of the evaluation is to provide USAID/Kosovo with an objective external assessment of GFSI's performance to date.&nbsp; The evaluation will further help the mission: (1) understand whether the project is meeting its objectives; (2) consider whether GFSI project implementation is efficient; (3) identify deficiencies in the programs current target areas and recommend remedial actions to be carried out in the remaining life of the program; and (4) use lessons learned to inform the decision for possible future USAID programming in the macro-fiscal policy and economic institutions strengthening area.&nbsp; GFSI has three main objectives: (1) support private sector participation; (2) strengthen fiscal stewardship; and (3) improve the prospects for economic development.&nbsp; GFSI is organized in three components that match the above objectives.&nbsp; Underlying that straight<br />forward structure, is a broad and complex mix of results and activities.&nbsp; The request for task order proposal (RFTOP) issued in 2010 lists 43 separate results that GFSI should achieve within three years.&nbsp; The GFSI's workplan includes 37 distinct activities.&nbsp; Many of these are a continuation of activities that began in one or more of the predecessor programs.&nbsp; Certain activities are interwoven with assistance provided by other development partners, such as in property tax by SIDA and PEFAs by DFID.&nbsp; With up to 43 separate results and 37 distinct activities to review and evaluate in a two-week time period in the field, the evaluators made a conscious decision to focus on providing an objective, informed response to the six priority questions identified by USAID in the evaluation's statement of work (SOW).&nbsp; The overal findings from the evaluation are: (1) although GFSI is still ongoing it has already produced tangible results; (2) key central institutions have been strengthened; (3) GFSI has made timely adjustments to deploy resources consistent with project needs and has maintained costs at a reasonable level; (4) coordination between other program and releated issues is generally effective, but not with all; and (5) attention to gender as a cross-cutting theme focuses on statistics of persons trained by GFSI.&nbsp; Also as part of the evaluation, general and specific conclusions and recommendations are included in the document.&nbsp; (Excerpt, modified)","'Prepared under Task Order AID-167-TO-12-00004 Under the Evaluation Services IQC'|Evaluated ask order title: Growth and fiscal stability initiative (GFSI)  [part of project: Economic growth and governance initiative (EGGI)]","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID-167-TO-12-00004|RAN-I-00-09-00018-00","","9/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","","Financial management|Economic growth|Private sector|Stability|Profits|Municipal level|Fiscal policy","Kosovo","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACU483.pdf","503 KB","008414 - Mendez England and Associates","","010393 - USAID.

"<div>This report is a mid-term evaluation of the Increased Trust in Electoral Processes project (ITEP) in Georgia, a four year (2010-2014), $8.0 million project implemented by the International Foundation for Electoral Systems (IFES) under the Consortium for Elections and Political Process Strengthening (CEPPS) cooperative agreement. &nbsp;The project has four stated objectives, plus a small fifth objective recently added. &nbsp;This evaluation covers only the first two objectives: (1) improved capacity of election administration; and, (2) improved transparency of electoral processes through improved media coverage and CSO involvement. &nbsp;The intended end result or outcome for these objectives mirrors the project's title: increased trust in electoral processes. &nbsp;The evaluation focuses on electoral management bodies such as the Central Election Commission (CEC), the Voters' List Verification Commission (VLVC), the former Chamber of Control Group (CCG), now State Audit Office (SAO); and, to a more limited extent, the Inter-Agency Task Force on Free Elections (IATF), a non-beneficiary. &nbsp;In the non-governmental sector, the evaluation covers four civil society advocacy groups (CSOs) receiving assistance through ITEP. &nbsp;They are the International Society for Fair Elections and Democracy (ISFED), the Georgian Young Lawyers' Association (GYLA), Transparency International-Georgia (TI-G), and New Generation, New Initiative (nGnI). &nbsp;The findings in the report support the appropriateness of the project's design and the conclusion that the project is performing up to expectations, delivering timely, valued technical assistance through highquality field office staff and international consultants. &nbsp;The CEC and VLVC have increased capacity and have improved institutional performance. &nbsp;The SAO has improved its capacity, but it is implementing a political party and campaign finance law that does not meet minimum legal standards of due process and is having a &ldquo;chilling effect&rdquo; on freedom of association. &nbsp;The four CSOs that received sub-grants used the funding for well-targeted activities in support of election law reform, civic education outreach, and monitoring of public spending, thereby helping to increase electoral transparency. &nbsp;(Excerpt, modified)</div>","Evaluated project title: Increased trust in electoral processes project (ITEP)","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","10/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","","Elections|Electoral systems|Public administration|Transparency|Communication media|Public awareness|Information dissemination","Georgia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACU516.pdf","427 KB","012295 - Democracy International, Inc.","","000035 - U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)","English","application/pdf","","","Costello, Charles|Lippman, Harold|Jijelava, David","Elections","Oct 2012","","","","Mid-term performance evaluation of the increased trust in electoral processes project (ITEP)","","PD-ACU-516","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MzI1NTc4","Georgia",""
"<span style=""font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"">The New Applied Technology Efficiency and Lighting Initiative (NATELI) was a two-year USAID sponsored activity, and follow-on agreement to the Rural Energy Program, implemented by Winrock International from October 1, 2009 through September 30, 2011. &nbsp;The NATELI project was designed to fulfill USAID's Strategic Objective (SO) 1.51 (A foundation for a more sustainable energy system and Intermediate Result IR) and section 1.51.3 (Increased efficiency in the energy sector). &nbsp;This mid-term evaluation covers activities performed between October 1, 2009 and September 30, 2011 and&nbsp;was designed to assess whether the NATELI project achieved its stated objectives and, where appropriate, make recommendations regarding emphasis and methodology for the remaining work. &nbsp;Evaluation efforts were designed to answer four key questions posed by USAID/Caucasus in the request for proposals and statement of work. &nbsp;The evaluators found that overall: (1) NATELI successfully contributed to efforts that made significant progress in raising awareness of energy efficiency and the local utilization of renewable energy resources; and (2) barriers to implementing these technologies exist, but have been identified, and work continues to improve Georgian's access to knowledge and the means to improve efficient use of energy. &nbsp;The evaluators concluded that: (1) USAID designed a program to build awareness about energy efficiency and to demonstrate technologies that had an impact on a wide range of stakeholders; (2) NATELI provided the seed money and the catalyst necessary to get the Energy Efficiency and Auditing Program at Georgian Technical University underway; (3) hospitals were able to take advantage of the recommendations of energy passports and energy audits as well as the partial funding for energy efficiency remediation efforts; and (4) Winrock International did an excellent job as the implementing organization, demonstrating flexibility with changing needs. &nbsp;One of Winrock's most important contributions was assembling an outstanding array of local sub-contractors. &nbsp;At times, these local sub-contractors growth in their capabilities due to their additional responsibilities, but this led to increased in-country capacity and ability to provide services in the energy efficiency arena. &nbsp;(Excerpt, modified)</span>","Cover title: Mid-term performance evaluation of the new applied technology efficiency and lighting initiative (NATELI) : final report|USAID contract no. listed on document as AID-RAN-I-00-09-008|Evaluated project title: New applied technology efficiency and lighting initiative (NATELI","Special Evaluation","Documents","RAN-I-00-09-00008-00|AID-114-TO-12-00003","","10/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","","Energy efficiency|Lighting|Energy technology|Energy consumption|Industrial efficiency|Rural areas|Community services","Georgia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACU518.pdf","1,711 KB","006007 - AMEX International, Inc.","","009620 - USAID.

"The Promoting Youth for Civic Engagement (PYCE) project is a two-year project (October 2010 September 2012) implemented by AMIDEAST in Yemen and designed to improve the livelihoods of Yemeni youth in vulnerable areas by supporting USAIDs strategy to engage dynamic, responsive and credible religious leaders.&nbsp; The PYCE project falls under the USAID Conflict Management and Mitigation (CMM) initiatives and is also expected to resonate with and positively feed into the 2010-2012 USAID Yemen stabilization strategy.&nbsp; The implementation of the PYCE project was impeded by Yemen's popular uprising that began in late January 2011.&nbsp; The purpose of this mid-term performance evaluation is to assess the PYCE projects implementation, effectiveness, and suitability of the projects approach to achieving the projects objectives.&nbsp; The evaluation desk review and field assessment revealed that the PYCE project has diverged to a certain degree in approach, targeting strategy, and implementation methodology from the technical approach prescribed in the cooperative agreement.&nbsp; These modifications to the project's approach and implementation methodology have to a certain extent foregone communication with and involvement of the concerned ministries, undermined the role of the Governorate Steering Committee and neglected the peer education model in favor of a direct implementation of activities that involve youth in sports and recreational initiatives and engage youth with community work.&nbsp; This approach has defeated the 'stabilization' purpose recommended by USAID to improve trust and perception of the Yemeni youth with their government officials and local leaders and will be unlikely to create positive linkages and increase trust and communication between the various stakeholders through sports, recreational programs and community work.&nbsp; Furthermore, the direct implementation approach that has been favored by PYCE staff in the second half of the project will negatively impact the sustainability of some of the project's initiatives.&nbsp; It is normal that projects experience certain changes during implementation, changes that are often necessary to accommodate the realities ""on the ground"" which often vary from the original program design assumptions.&nbsp; Nevertheless, these changes should not have diverted the project from its conflict mitigation framework.&nbsp; Of note is that when the project undertook the 'correct' outreach and engagement strategy of Republic of Yemen Government (ROYG) officials and community leaders, the project managed to successfully engage these actors and to create communication and trust linkages between these actors and youth.&nbsp; More specific evaluation findings, conclusions and recommendations are included in the main body of the report.&nbsp; (Excerpt, modified)","Task  order Number 1|Evaluated project title: Promoting youth for civic engagement (PYCE)|AID-RAN-I-09-00016","Special Evaluation","Documents","RAN-I-00-09-00016-00|RAN-I-00-09-00016-00","","7/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","","Youth|Civic action|Civic education|Livelihood|Conflict prevention|Stability","Yemen","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACU526.pdf","390 KB","001891 - International Business and Technical Consultants, Inc.

"The Responsive Governance Project (RGP) in Yemen is a five-year $43 million project implemented by a consortium led by Counterpart International (Counterpart) as the prime contractor.&nbsp; RGP was designed to strengthen government institutions at the national and local levels to help them improve the delivery of public services while encouraging more citizen participation in the political process, as well as to facilitate more equitable socioeconomic development to help mitigate key drivers of instability in Yemen.&nbsp; The purpose of this mid-term performance evaluation was to assess the implementation, effectiveness, and progress of the project.&nbsp; The findings of this evaluation are be used to inform USAID whether the program is on track to achieving programmatic goals, fiscal goals, and targets.&nbsp; Also, the evaluation is be used to assess whether the project had been supportive of the initial overarching USAID strategy in Yemen of positively impacting stabilization in key areas.&nbsp; The evaluators found the project's strongest results to date are in the area of government policy making.&nbsp; RGP had an effective mechanism for contributing to passage of legislation with citizen input.&nbsp; Three activities, Access to Information, Safe Motherhood, and Health Insurance, illustrate how the three RGP program components worked together to support the executive branch and legislative offices of the Republic of Yemen Government (ROYG0), and civil society organizations (CSOs) consult and advocate with the various stakeholders that ultimately resulted in the passage of legislation.&nbsp; Information from parliamentarians and CSOs indicated that RGP's civic education and Get Out The Vote activities were relevant and effective.&nbsp; In the area of anticorruption, the project had some results with its Peer Learning and Mentoring Program (PLMP).&nbsp; In contrast, RGP activities carried out by Counterpart in support of the ROYG0's operational capacity, including the Project Management Information System (PMIS), seemed unlikely to lead to systemic change in the Ministries and seemed less relevant in light of current priorities.&nbsp; Several recommendations are in the report, including: (1) continue activities related to the formulation and passage of legislation; (2) cancel RGP activities related to the development of service delivery standards; (3) support the institutionalization of parliamentary public hearings; (4) continue civic education, voter campaigns and similar activities; (5) continue with the advanced capacity building to the nine selected CSOs; and (6) RGP's monitoring and evaluation reporting should focus on the basics, such as accurate documentation and sound reporting practices.&nbsp; (Excerpt, modified)","Task  order number 1|Evaluated project title: Responsive governance project (RGP)|AID-RAN-I-09-00016","Special Evaluation","Documents","RAN-I-00-09-00016-00|RAN-I-00-09-00016-00","","8/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","","Governance|Policy making|Political participation|Access to information|Laws and legislation|Civil society|Civic education|Anticorruption interventions","Yemen","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACU527.pdf","892 KB","001891 - International Business and Technical Consultants, Inc.

"This is a performance evaluation of the Albanian Agricultural Competitiveness (AAC) project, a 5.5-year activity (2007-2013) funded by USAID/Albania and implemented by Development Alternatives, Inc.

"The Kosovo American Education Fund (KAEF) is a fellowship program for Kosovars that was established in 2004 from proceeds generated from the sale of the American Bank of Kosovo.&nbsp; The bank shares were held by the Kosovo Business Finance Fund (KBFF), established by USAID in 1999.&nbsp; The proceeds in the amount of US$7,881,825.25 formed the base of the grant agreement with the American Councils for International Education (AC) to establish the Kosovo American Education Fund.&nbsp; The goal of the KAEF is to provide Kosovar's with the education they need to lead Kosovo's economic development.&nbsp; Since its establishment, 51 Fellows have received KAEF support to attend masters programs in the U.S.&nbsp; The expectation was that income generated by the endowment would support at least ten Fellows annually.&nbsp; Additional resources that AC was expected to generate from other donors would enable AC to augment that number of Fellows.&nbsp; Because the ultimate objective of the effort was Kosovo's economic development, scholarships were limited to fields of study such as business, public administration, economics, international affairs, policy, and urban planning.&nbsp; This report presents the results of an evaluation of this program requested by the USAID Mission to Kosovo (USAID/K) and conducted in June and July, 2012.&nbsp; Conclusions reached by the evaluators are: (1) KAEF is a success with respect to producing degree graduates, although at a level somewhat lower than expected; and (2) KAEF has not performed as expected financially, and it will cease to exist if current financial trends continue.&nbsp; Recommendations include: (1) review KAEF's finances to determine what can reasonably be done to make KAEF's financial future more secure; (2) improve program analysis and reporting; (3) increase Kosovar involvement in decision-making and fundraising; (4) review options to increase the development impact since not all master's degrees -- not even all degrees in the currently accepted fields -- have the same development impact; (5) address the participation of women and minorities; (6) find ways to strengthen linkages Fellows host U.S. universities and other Fellows, to enhance follow-up activities in Kosovo; and (7) convince more Fellows to return to Kosovo since not returning reduces the program's impact.&nbsp; (Excerpt, modified)","'It was prepared under Task Order AID-167-M-12-00001 under GEM II BPA AID-EDH-E-00-08-00003'|Project title: Global evaluation and monitoring II (GEM II)","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","AID-167-M-12-00001|EDH-E-00-08-00003-00|AID-EDH-E-00-08-00003","","8/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","","Educational development|Banks|Economic development|Income generation|Public administration|School graduates|Masters degrees|Higher education|Girls education","Kosovo","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACU680.pdf","674 KB","013070 - JBS International, Inc.

"The report begins with a brief review of the historical and contemporary context of the project in Angola. It then presents an historical overview of ProAgro, including a presentation of the primary goals and objectives of the program. These goals and objectives are then analyzed quantitatively and qualitatively. This review is based on documentary data collected, and observations made, by the author during a three-week visit to the program in late April and early May 2012. The final two sections of the report present the reviewer's conclusions and recommendations related to the program. The emphasis in these concluding sections is on lessons learned from the six years of CLUSA's agricultural cooperative development experience that can be applied to future such projects especially related to coffee and bananas in Angola and also to similar agricultural cooperative development projects in other countries. ProAgro has been largely successful in carrying out a value chain project that has benefited over 6,000 farmers in Kwanza Sul, Benguela and Bengo provinces. It has set the stage for increases in production and marketing for the future through its development of 25 cooperatives, 12 co-op service centers, CESACOOPA ( a union of cooperatives in Kwanza Sul), and the proposed Cooperative Federation in Benguela. Both coffee and banana production now appear to be nearing a critical mass in which coordinated marketing through CESACOOPA, the planned Cooperative Federation in Benguela, and the co-ops have the potential to play major roles in increasing producer returns and continuing production and productivity.","Submitted as: ProAgro-Angola evaluation 2006-2012 (Avaliacao do ProAgro-Angola 2012)|Evaluated project title: Agricultural development and finance program (ADFP)|Evaluated project title also known as: ProAgro Angola|Portuguese ed.: PD-ACU-684","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","690-A-00-06-00099-00","","5/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural development|Agricultural management|Economic growth|Agricultural cooperatives|Agricultural enterprises|Farmers|Food production|Coffee|Bananas","Angola","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACU683.pdf","1,268 KB","","","008507 - USAID.

"This is performance evaluation report of the Strengthening Human Rights in Kyrgyzstan program, implemented under a cooperative agreement between Freedom House and USAID/Kyrgyzstan that began in March 2010 and is presently scheduled to continue until late 2013.&nbsp; The agreement initially had a modest budget of $629,730 for a period of two years (March 201-February 2012), but it was more recently extended for an additional nineteen months (February 2012-September 2013) along with a budgetary increase of $800,000.&nbsp; The evaluation will be useful to: (1) USAID/Kyrgyzstan for strategic planning and program management and design; (2) to Freedom House for informing future programming; and (3) to the human rights development community for tracking developments in Kyrgyzstan.&nbsp; The evaluation is based on mixed-method, evidence-based research and included semistructured interviews with stakeholders, focus groups with average citizens in Kyrgyzstan, and an online survey of Freedom House training participants.&nbsp; The evaluators found mixed results regarding Freedom House's performance, both in its fulfillment of the existing cooperative agreement and its activities' potential to impact the current human rights situation in the country.&nbsp; While Freedom House has taken advantage of the opportunities to have substantial input on legislation and policies at the national level, it has had less impact, however, in other activities outlined in its original agreement.&nbsp; Freedom House has also not had much impact on the protection of human rights in the south over the last two years, which is one of the biggest problems facing human rights in the country today.&nbsp; The team determined that Freedom House's lack of impact was at least in part due to its lack of resources for programming as well as a result of a cooperative agreement designed before 2010, but implemented in a completely dif-ferent context.&nbsp; As a result, the program is not based on a clear theory of change appropriate to the present context and does not have a logical framework that links proposed impacts to the out-comes of planned activities.&nbsp; Despite these shortcomings, the team also found that Freedom House has made contributions to human rights in Kyrgyzstan.&nbsp; Freedom House continues to have significant potential to be influen-tial in the country given its generally positive reputation amongst human rights organizations and its perceived value as an internationally recognized protector of human rights.&nbsp; The evaluation report provides a variety of recommendations for how Freedom House can improve its impact during the remainder of its current program as well as a series of recommendations for USAID as it considers future interventions to consolidate the observation of human rights.&nbsp; (Excerpt, modified)","'Submitted to: USAID/Kyrgyzstan'|Evaluated project title: Strengthening human rights in Kyrgyzstan","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","10/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","","Human rights|Government reform|Local level|Law enforcement|Civil society|Civil law|Reporting|Discrimination|Racial discrimination","Kyrgyzstan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACU713.pdf","1,268 KB","012295 - Democracy International, Inc.","","000035 - U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)","English","application/pdf","","","Roberts, Sean|Salmorbekova, Zumrat","Human rights and social justice","Oct 2012","","","","Strengthening human rights in Kyrgyzstan program evaluation","","PD-ACU-713","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MzI2Mzg5","Kyrgyzstan",""

The C4J is a 19 million dollar fouryear project focused on sustaining and deepening reforms in the Indonesian justice sector to produce a less corrupt, a more accountable and more highly performing justice system. This goal will be achieved through more efficient, credible, and transparent functioning of the Supreme Court (Component 1) and the Attorney Generals Office (Component 2), including increasing the competence and integrity of judges, prosecutors and staff. Integral to meeting these goals, Component 3 is designed to meet special initiatives of the US government (USG) to further strengthen the reform process in the Indonesian justice sector.","Evaluated project title: Changes for justice (C4J)","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","3/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","","Access to justice|Social justice|Judicial reform|Institutional linkages|Civil society|Administration of law|Lawyers|Rule of law|Judges","Indonesia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACU720.pdf","411 KB","011460 - USAID.

"This is a midterm evaluation of the Support for Economic Analysis Development in Indonesia (SEADI) Program, working with the National Development Planning Agency (Bappenas) under the Assistance Agreement Economic Growth Programs in Indonesia.&nbsp; The overarching objective/spirit of this assessment is to go beyond a typical project retrospective report card, to learn from the experience of all project stakeholders, and apply these insights for the purposes of: (1) taking the SEADI project to its most promising level over its second half term; (2) creatively improving the focus, delivery, efficacy, impacts and potential outcomes of project activities; (3) ensuring that SEADI and mission economic growth agenda and program activities are strategically synergistic; and (4) considering the rationale, focus and agenda for a follow-on project building on cumulative SEADI achievements through mid-2013.&nbsp; Some of the many observations outlined in the evaluation include: (1) the SEADI project overall, and all major components, are now meeting and in many cases exceeding all contract specified outputs and work plan activity/achievement indicators; (2) grants initially lagged but are now on track and will be limited only by funds obligated and expended within the brief duration of the contract; (3) scholarships awards were slow and behind schedule during the first year for other reasons as well; (4) overall, most counterparts enthusiastically confirm the quality/value of SEADI services and its ""demand/need driven"" process; (5) SEADI's work-products, deliverables and conduct of operations and activities, are of sound to excellent professional world standard; and (6) advisor, consultant and staff performance are commendably strong.&nbsp; The evaluator makes many recommendations, including: (1) focus GOI/USAID mutual interests more strategically on impacting priority integrative cross-cutting development themes; and (2) take seriously the old adage: ""Better to do fewer things well (in more depth), than too many not so well"" (too shallowly).&nbsp; Included in these recommendations are several relating to the USAID contracting officer's representative (COR).&nbsp; (Excerpt, modified)","Cover title|Inside title: Mid-term evaluation for support for economic analysis development in Indonesia (SEADI) Program, working with the National Development Planning Agency (Bappenas) under the assistance agreement economic growth programs in Indonesia|'This evaluation was contracted under: USAID contract number: BPA SOL-OAA-11-000086, project order ID # INDONESIA_DB_052912'|Evaluated project title: Support for economic analysis development - Indonesia (SEADI)","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","7/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","","Economic development|Economic growth","Indonesia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACU721.pdf","327 KB","","","000035 - U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)","English","application/pdf","","","Brunell, David","Economic policy","Jul 2012","","","","Mid-term review of USAID SEADI project, support for economic analysis development - Indonesia","","PD-ACU-721","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MzI2NDUz","Indonesia",""

"In response to the financial crisis of 2008, the United States Government (USG) provided a stimulus package, known as the Financial Crisis Initiative (FCI), to complement actions by the Government of Tanzania (GoT) to stimulate the Tanzanian economy, increase food production, and provide social protection and safety nets to vulnerable groups.&nbsp; The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) contributed a total of $52.7 million over two phases to the FCI, intended as a rapid response to assist the rural poor affected by the financial crisis.&nbsp; Organizations already conducting similar programs in Tanzania were identified and their programs expanded to targeted vulnerable communities.&nbsp; The bulk of the USAID FCI support consisted of four safety net components implemented from 2009 to 2012 by the World Food Programme (WFP), the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), and the United States Department of Interior (DOI).&nbsp; These four components included: (1) Food for Education (FFE) implemented by WFP to provide school meals to primary school students in coordination with the Ministry of Education and Vocational Training (MoEVT); (2) Food for Assets (FFA) implemented by WFP to enable community members to receive food while working on infrastructure construction projects to improve food production and/or access to markets (3)Cash for Work (C4W) implemented by WWF and DOI to provide temporary income while building infrastructure for communities in Wildlife Management Areas (WMA) that may have suffered from a reduction in tourism; and (4) Cash Transfer implemented by WFP to provide training on nutritional practices to mothers with young children along with a monthly cash transfer to enable these mothers to better feed their children.&nbsp; Deloitte's Leadership in Public Financial Management (LPFM) FCI Evaluation Team undertook a performance evaluation on behalf of USAID, focusing largely on the effectiveness and sustainability of the FCI.&nbsp; Performance measurement centers on whether a program has achieved its objectives, expressed as measurable performance standards.&nbsp; Key recommendations based on findings from each FCI component are included.&nbsp; (Excerpt, modified)","'This publication was produced .... for the Tanzania Financial Crisis Initiative Performance Evaluation Task Order ....'

"<span style=""font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"">The purpose of the evaluation was to assess the success of United States Agency for International Development (USAID) Nicaragua's Family Planning (FP) phase-out strategy, including progress on recommendations from the mid-term assessment and for the post-graduation phase. &nbsp;The report is intended to inform USAID and other United States Government personnel, health donors, representatives from the Government (GON), non-governmental and civil society organizations. &nbsp;The USAID Nicaragua's Family Planning Graduation Strategy (FPGS) was implemented from October 1st, 2007 through September 30th, 2012, with a budget of approximately US$ 13.5 million. &nbsp;The implementing partners included John Snow Inc. (DELIVER Project), University Research Co., LL (Health Care Improvement Project), NicaSalud Federation (FamiSalud project) and MSH (PRONICASS Project). &nbsp;Taking into account the USAID Technical Note on Graduation for Family Planning and based on the findings discussed in this section, the evaluation team concludes that Nicaragua has achieved a successful graduation stage and that it is reasonable to expect that the provision of family planning (FP) services will be sustained in the future, that the Contraceptive Prevalence Rate (CPR) will be maintained at the level achieved prior to graduation and that inequities in access will not be increased. &nbsp;Overall, the implementation of USAID/Nicaragua's FPGS has been successful. &nbsp;USAID has achieved the main goals included in the strategy, and 15 of the 17 indicators defined by the FPGS have been met. &nbsp;The two unmet indicators, which are related to market segmentation and the participation of the Ministry of Health (MOH) and the social security in the market share, are in the process of being achieved. &nbsp;Through the implementation of the FPGS, USAID contributed to establishing a foundation for a solid, efficient and sustainable provision of family planning services in Nicaragua. &nbsp;It should also be noted that all recommendations presented in the mid-term evaluation of 2010 were implemented and monitored by the USAID health office, allowing adjustments to be made during implementation. &nbsp;(Excerpt, modified)</span>","Cover title: USAID/Nicaragua family planning graduation strategy : final evaluation report","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","AID-524-O-12-00006","","10/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","","","Nicaragua","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACU908.pdf","1,190 KB","","","008584 - USAID.

"The Development Communities through Intensive Agriculture Project/Dezenvolve Agricultura Comunitria in Timor-Leste is a USAID-funded contract, implemented by Development Alternatives Inc. (DAI) and hereafter referred to as DOCIA/DAC project.&nbsp; The intention of the project is to complete implementation of a development model that improves the economic and social livelihood of members of households in a poor community in a way that distributes benefits fairly between people of different genders.&nbsp; The DOCIA/DAC project will achieve this by combining two things: (1) the introduction of technology, plant and equipment to a community of poor households; and (2) focused technical and management training of community members.&nbsp; It is anticipated that the community can increase its income and the value of its assets by serving a demanding market that pays premium prices for selected products, and, through increased material wellbeing, will enable the community to improve its social and environmental status.&nbsp; The project was to run for three years from August 30th 2010 through August 31st of 2013, but was recently extended to accommodate a Global Development Alliance (GDA) contribution from ConocoPhillips with matching support from USAID.&nbsp; The completion date is now expected to be August 31st of 2014.&nbsp; After nearly 21 months of implementation, evaluators reviewed the project in three areas: (1) project performance against plan; (2) project results and impacts; and (3) sustainability.&nbsp; Overall, the project is on track to meet or exceed its goals, even while facing many challenges.&nbsp; The technical training by the project of farmers has helped overcome some of these challenges.&nbsp; With regard to sustainability, it appears that the project has capacity building initiatives in place to insure the present approach of ""linking farmers to markets"" is able to be maintained.&nbsp; Evaluators also make 12 recommendations in the report to help with weaknesses and gaps within the project.&nbsp; (Excerpt, modified)","'Prepared for USAID/Timor-Leste ....'","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID-486-TO-10-00001|EDH-I-00-05-00004-00|AID-EDH-I-00-05-00004","","6/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural development|Community development|Livelihood|Socioeconomic development|Poor|Agricultural technology|Households|Income generation|Training|Market development","Timor-Leste","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACU918.pdf","780 KB","006727 - Development Alternatives, Inc.

"The Quality Control and Certification (QCC) Project was designed to support the Chambers of Commerce, Industry and Agriculture (CCIA) food labs in Saida, Zahle and Tripoli.&nbsp; The objective was to assist the labs to become recognized leading facilities for testing in Lebanon.&nbsp; The project sought to assist the labs with equipment and capacity building so that each lab would achieve ISO 17025 and ISO 9001 accreditation.&nbsp; ISO (International Organization for Standardization) is the internationally recognized body established to ensure that products and services are safe, reliable and of good quality.&nbsp; ISO 17025 is the main ISO standard used by testing and calibration laboratories.&nbsp; ISO 9001 sets the standards for quality management systems.&nbsp; Compliance with the ISO standards ensures that quality management and technical systems are in place that will see the labs consistently produce valid results.&nbsp; Lab accreditation coupled with CCIA certifications allows the CCIA to operate as one-stop export shops and that provide reliable and efficient test results to Lebanese processors.&nbsp; The project came at a time when food safety in Lebanon became a major concern as some Lebanese products were rejected from export markets.&nbsp; High levels of pesticide residue and low-quality standards had affected Lebanon's ability to export.&nbsp; Supporting testing facilities and expanding the range of services outside Beirut was viewed as key for improving the competiveness of the agro-food industry and raising the quality of exported products ultimately resulting in increased exports.&nbsp; Overall the project has succeeded in enhancing Lebanon's export potential by supporting the three CCIA labs in achieving the needed ISO accreditation.&nbsp; Specifically, the key findings of the evaluation include: (1) the CCIA labs in Tripoli and Zahle and Saida achieved ISO 17025 accreditation that is inclusive of ISO 9001 accreditation; (2) all three labs now have the capabilities of one-stop-export shops; (3) QCC has helped the food industry by developing the enabling environment for export so that food processors can demonstrate to the export market that they produce high quality and safe products; (4) lab accreditation and the proximity of the labs to producers will act as a catalyst for increased exports; (5) based on revenue generated from the lab tests reported in income statements, two out of the three labs are currently assessed to be financially sustainable; and (6) none of the clients faced difficulty in export following testing their products in Lebanon and none had their goods returned.&nbsp; (Excerpt, modified)","USAID indefinite quantity contract no. listed on document as RAN-I-00-09-00019","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","RAN-I-00-09-00019-00|AID-RAN-I-00-09-00019","","8/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","","","Lebanon","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACU968.pdf","1,590 KB","011933 - Social Impact, Inc.","","000035 - U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)","English","application/pdf","","","","Agricultural management","Aug 2012","","","","Agricultural product quality control and certification (QCC) program : final external evaluation report","","PD-ACU-968","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MzI3NTQ1","Lebanon",""
"USAID/Nigeria's Maximizing Agricultural Revenue and Key Enterprises in Targeted Sites (MARKETS) was a multi-faceted six and a half-year pilot program designed to strengthen agricultural competitiveness and food security in Nigeria.&nbsp; The program began in 2005 with a budget of $24 million which later increased to $51.6 million by the time the project closed in December 2010; after which the project was extended for 16 months (January 2011 through April 2012) with an additional $9.5 million through the Bridge to MARKETS II (BtM2) project.&nbsp; The project was managed by Chemonics International with international and local sub-contractors, MARKETS employed a private sector-led, comprehensive value chain approach that identified commercial buyers and facilitated inputs that supported farmers to meet market standards and a guaranteed buyer.&nbsp; The final evaluation fieldwork of the MARKETS program was conducted in June and July 2012.&nbsp; The evaluation was commissioned by USAID/Nigeria Mission with the aim: (1) to determine whether the goals and objectives of MARKETS were met; (2) establish how effectively MARKETS interventions were delivered; (3) assess project outcomes; (4) assess the extent to which the project affected its beneficiaries; (5) determine whether the USG investment in the program received the greatest possible return; and (6) learn lessons that will guide the implementation of MARKETS II.&nbsp; The final evaluation was guided by eight key evaluation questions on project design, implementation and outcomes.&nbsp; The evaluators found, in general, the value chain approach had a positive impact on the farm level and with agro processors.&nbsp; Production and quality increased two- and three-fold.&nbsp; The value chain approach of this pilot demonstrated notable success stories in linking farmers to formal credit and guaranteed markets.&nbsp; There is still a vast ongoing need for access to credit, consistent output and meeting quality standards of the marketplace.&nbsp; A constraint is that Nigeria small holder farms are still very labor intensive and inefficient.&nbsp; The good news is that the introduction of new technologies was well received and the new production technology adoption rate of was 100 percent.&nbsp; Beneficiary satisfaction is one of the main achievements of the MARKETS pilot program.&nbsp; Satisfaction was very high with increases in yields and related incomes.&nbsp; The beneficiaries expressed their strong interest in ongoing knowledge through trainings and demonstrations as well as improved and certified inputs like seeds, agrochemicals and fertilizer.&nbsp; Likewise the agro processors were largely satisfied with the MARKETS activities and program staff, and most important the results of increased value added commodities and products (132% of the MARKETS target).&nbsp; MARKETS II has been launched and is going more deeply into a fewer number of value chains that meet the current programmatic criteria and priorities&mdash;food security and nutrition, income and job creation and greater benefits to women and youth among others.&nbsp; (Excerpt, modified)","'Report'|Initial MARKETS contract no. listed in annex as 620-C-00-00077-00 (fiscal year digits missing)|Evaluated project title: Maximizing agriculture revenue and key enterprises in targeted sties (MARKETS)|Evaluated project title: Bridge to MARKETS (BtM2)","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","9/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural markets|Revenues|Agricultural enterprises|Economic growth|Economic competition|Food security|Value chains|Commercial farming|Income generation","Nigeria","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACU991.pdf","920 KB","008360 - Mitchell Group, Inc.","","008586 - USAID.

"The Nutrition and HIV Program (NHP) was designed to take the two-year Food by Prescription (FBP) pilot project started in 2006, to scale.&nbsp; As a flagship initiative, NHP goal was to strengthen delivery of nutrition services in and out of hospital settings in Kenya.&nbsp; Objectives included: (1) build on partners expertise in HIV and nutrition, food manufacturing, and logistics, while introducing a new patient-centered concept for clinical service delivery; (2) introduce a locally produced F-100 equivalent RUTF for severely malnourished HIV+ patients and OVC; (3) link Insta (the food partner) and health facilities with care programs for HIV+ patients and OVC to extend the supply chain, improve client tracking, mitigate loss to follow-up, and increase the quality and comprehensive care; (4) scale up interventions while maintaining high quality through performance monitoring and quality assurance systems; and (5) strengthen the capacity of local partners, particularly NASCOP.&nbsp; The evaluators found that: (1) NHP has exceeded targets set out in the cooperative agreement for a number of key areas, including the number of sites providing nutrition assessment counseling and support (NACS) treatment and the number of clients treated by food by prescription (FBP); (2) NHP, with NASCOP, have put in place curricula, resources and training to allow the clinical service delivery of NACS; (3) rapid expansion of sites supporting NACS from 62 to 619 has at the cost of providing quality services.&nbsp; The evaluators make several recommendations for the future: (1) continue to invest in the expansion of NACS program infrastructure, including beyond HIV; (2) separate RFPs for ""commodity component"" for ""service delivery component""; (3) embrace and expand public private partnerships (PPP); (4) improve NACS outcomes through efficient and effective use of FBP and increased focus on other kinds of support; (5) improve quality of NACS service provision by health care providers; (6) clarify and expand the community link component of NACS; (7) support the Government of Kenya to gradually be able to implement all aspects of NACS service provision; and (8) incorporate operations research into the next iteration of NHP.&nbsp; (Excerpt, modified)","Evaluated project title: Nutrition and HIV program (NHP)","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","AID-623-C-10-00003","","6/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","","","Kenya","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACW260.pdf","1,247 KB","012990 - IT Shows, Inc.","","012598 - USAID.

The focus of the project was on the integrated management of common childhood illnesses, including malaria, diarrhea and pneumonia.&nbsp; The geographic coverage included the five health zones of Kandi-Segbana-Gogounou, Banikoara, Ouak-Copargo, Djougou-Bassila and Tchaourou in the Departments of Alibori, Donga and Borgou.&nbsp; The general objectives of the iCCM evaluation were: (1) to assess the integrated community case management(iCCM) projects achievement of objectives and targets; (2) measure coverage and quality of care of community level service delivery; and (3) attempt to understand the projects contribution to observed results by comparing service coverage and quality in USAID focus health zones with those in non-USAID focus health zones.&nbsp; The evaluation was also designed to assess the capacity and sustainability of health zones and local NGOs to support community level workers and compile lessons learned for scale-up and challenges encountered.&nbsp; Evaluation findings indicate that the project has established good quality iCCM with good coverage in semi-remote (more than 5 km from the nearest health facility) villages in rural Benin using members of local communities.&nbsp; This statement is supported by these results: (1) 1048 community-based community health workers (RCs, 'Relais Communautaire') were trained, equipped and supervised to establish iCCM; (2) over 86,000 clinical contacts took place and children were treated with established standard treatments for malaria, diarrhea and acute respiratory infection; (3) RCs were trained and deployed in 1716 villages, 43% of all villages more than 5 kilometers from the nearest health facility in the five health zones covered by the project; (4) significantly more children were treated at the community level within the first 12 hours of the onset of illness than those in control villages; (5) many patients were receiving treatment who previously did not attend for clinical care and relied on self-medication or traditional healers; and (6) RCs performed an average of 3,000 household visits per year over the last two years of the project to encourage mothers to take preventive action for their child's health.&nbsp; It should be noted, however, that 83% of the RCs are male, which given religious and cultural precepts in Benin, may make prove to be an obstacle to the delivery of maternal health services and family planning as it has in other countries.&nbsp; In addition to these findings, lessons learned and several recommendations are included in the report.&nbsp; (Excerpt, modified)","Cover title: USAID/Benin : integrated community case management performance evaluation|Evaluated project title: Integrated community case management (iCCM)|Project title: Global health technical assistance bridge II (GH tech bridge II)","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID-OAA-C-12-00027","","7/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","","Case management|Health care administration|Health care planning|Communities|Community health workers|Child health care|Morbidity|Mortality|Access to services|Disease treatment|Disease prevention and control|Diarrhea|Malnutrition","Benin","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACW267.pdf","3,591 KB","011492 - Development & Training Services, Inc.

(690-A-00-07-00104-00) on September 26, 2007, with a planned life of project of US$40 million through the PEPFAR. &nbsp;The goal of the Pact program, Community Rapid and Effective Action Combating HIV/AIDS (REACH) Namibia program was to scale up and sustain a comprehensive response to HIV/AIDS services (including prevention, care, and support for orphans and vulnerable children) through Namibian and international sub-grantees. &nbsp;The program was guided by six key program objectives through October 2010. &nbsp;In November 2010, following a mid-term evaluation, USAID entered into a modification of assistance agreement with Pact Inc. to realign its program to the Government of Namibia and PEPFAR phase II priorities. &nbsp;The emphasis shifted from a focus on the emergency scale-up approach of PEPFAR I to the Pact ""Strengthening the Capacity for Country Ownership (SCCO)"" programmatic themes of country ownership, long-term sustainability, and systems strengthening. &nbsp;This end-of-project report evaluates the final 19 months of the five year project and distinguishes accomplishment in this timeframe from previous accomplishments and activities. &nbsp;The focus of the report is on evaluating Pacts effectiveness towards strengthening the four directorates of the Ministry of Gender Equality and Child Welfare (MGECW) and six USAID-selected civil service organizations (CSOs). &nbsp;This report continues the USAID evaluation procedure whose last major effort was a mid-term evaluation report (January 2011). &nbsp;The evaluators conclude that Pact fulfilled all of its contractual obligations at a standard that is defined as satisfactory (i.e., fulfilling its contractual obligations under the award) that is supported by primary collection of evidence via document review and key informant interviews. &nbsp;This evaluation also identifies strengths and weaknesses as reported by both Pact advisors and Ministry and CSO partners. &nbsp;(Excerpt)</span>","Authoring organization unknown|Evaluated project title: Community rapid and effective action combating HIV/AIDS (REACH) Namibia program|Evaluated project title also known as: Community REACH Namibia program|Restricted ver.: PD-ACW-318","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","10/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","","","Namibia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACW317.pdf","2,629 KB","","","008582 - USAID.

"This is a mid-term performance evaluation of the Competitiveness Enhancement and Enterprise Development II (CEED II) Project in Moldova that took place during the period September-December, 2012.&nbsp; The evaluation was led by USAID's Bureau for Policy Planning and Learning, Office of Learning Evaluation and Research, and conducted by a team that included a PPL/LER Senior Evaluation Specialist and two Development Leadership Initiative (DLI) Foreign Service Officers, from USAID/Egypt, and USAID/Mali on behalf of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) Country Office in Moldova.&nbsp; CEED II is a four year project (December 2010 December 2014) aimed to increase competitiveness in the six targeted industries (apparel and textile, fashion accessories, home furnishings, information technology, wine, and tourism) through activities that are expected to produce results in increased productivity, increased trade and investment and improved public-private dialogue for a better business environment.&nbsp; The purpose of the CEED II evaluation is to help determine what components and aspects of the CEED II project are achieving the expected results, and which are not, and to make recommendations for modifications and mid-course corrections where applicable.&nbsp; The findings from this evaluation revealed that in general, across almost all of the industries with perhaps the exception of the apparel and tourism industries, strengthening of industry associations is a project activity that has most advanced the projects purpose.&nbsp; (Submitter abstract)","Evaluated project title: Competitiveness enhancement and enterprise development II (CEED II)","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","12/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","","Economic competition|Business enterprises|Economic development|Industrial development|Industrial productivity|Textiles|Furniture|Wine|Tourist industry|Information technology|Trade promotion|Investment promotion","Moldova","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACX183.pdf","1,108 KB","013413 - USAID.

"<span style=""font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"">The Government of El Salvador (GOES) is determined to reverse the current trends of receding or marginal economic growth. &nbsp;To this end, US Government assistance to El Salvador recognizes this GOES-driven process and is supporting measures to overcome the pervasive barriers to increased investment and broad-based economic growth. &nbsp;Moreover, in timely consonance with national efforts to promote economic growth, the Partnership for Growth (PFG) Joint Country Action Plan (JCAP) 2011-2015 between El Salvador and the United States enables the Governments of El Salvador and the United States to jointly engage new efforts to ensure, among other things, that education of the labor force matches labor market demand. &nbsp;Consistent with a focus on workforce development that stems from valuable research conducted prior to the JCAP initiative, in December 2009 USAID awarded a contract to Carana Corporation to undertake the Improving Access to Employment Program in El Salvador (the program), contract EEM-I-00-07-00006-00, with a total funding of $7.4 million. &nbsp;The program, currently in its third year of implementation and scheduled to end in November 2013, focuses on improving the function of the Salvadoran labor market to make it capable of matching the supply of skilled workers with private sector demand for labor.Overall, Program outcomes relate to coverage and engagement of individual beneficiaries, including at-risk youth and people with disabilities, in an effort to increase access to employment. &nbsp;By mid-year 2012, the program had achieved a total of 4,886 new or improved jobs (4,629 new jobs, or 95% of the total, and 257 improved jobs, or 5%). &nbsp;Based on accruals from early 2010, Carana has already surpassed the original life of program (LOP) target of 4,480 by 9%. &nbsp;So far, 42% of persons benefiting from new or improved jobs are women, 21% are youths, and 3% are people with disabilities. &nbsp;(Excerpt, modified)</span>","'This publication was produced .... under REQ-519-12-000021, ,,,,'|Evaluated project title: Improving access to employment program in El Salvador = Programa para mejorar el acceso al empleo en El Salvador|Spanish ed.: PD-ACU-556|AID-RAN-I-09-00016","Special Evaluation","Documents","RAN-I-00-09-00016-00|RAN-I-00-09-00016-00","","10/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","","Employment|Employment services|Access to services|Economic growth|Labor force|Labor market|Occupational opportunities","El Salvador","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACU555.pdf","2,022 KB","001891 - International Business and Technical Consultants, Inc.

"<p>The Arid and Marginal Lands Recovery Consortium (ARC) Program in Kenya was a three-year program that ran from 2009-2012, in response to the drought of 2008/9 and the resulting food crisis in Kenya.&nbsp; The goal of the project was to sustain access to food in vulnerable rural communities through enhanced resilience to shocks.&nbsp; The specific objectives of the program were to increase agricultural productivity, to protect and diversify household (HH) asset bases, and to strengthen livelihood options to increase HH purchasing power.&nbsp; The evaluators found that the program beneficiaries across the ARC project area repeatedly expressed confidence that ARC area HHs had improved their ability to cope in times of severe stress as compared to 2009.&nbsp; More specifically, the evaluation outlines the results to five questions: (1) appropriateness of the program; (2) program performance; (3) effectiveness; (4) gender equity; and (5) sustainability.&nbsp; The ARC program has generated important lessons: (1) strengthening of public (Government of Kenya)/private partnerships is an essential component for ensuring the sustainability of activities; (2) community involvement and partnerships are vital to the success of activities, such as community monitoring of livestock border movements and disease control through the Community Disease Control Committees (CDCCs); and (3) economic recovery and income generation activities such as the agro-vet store in Balambala and the tilapia farm in Kinnia proved to be the most attractive and sustainable among pastoralists and drop-outs.&nbsp; Overall recommendations call for the modification of pilot projects and incorporating lessons learned in order to ensure that future activities are scalable and replicable, both technically and financially: (1) build on program successes and achievements by further developing scalable activities from pilot interventions in livestock and alternative livelihoods into larger scale interventions across the target areas; (2) continue the development of alternative livelihoods as options for pastoralists to allow for asset diversification to help strengthen HH resiliency from future shocks; (3) continue the development of growth centers to provide alternative lifestyles and income generating options; and (4) allow time for interventions to produce results of critical mass in order to ensure the realization of impacts from these interventions.&nbsp; (Excerpt, modified)</p>","'Submitted to: USAID Kenya'|Evaluated project title: Arid and marginal lands recovery consortium (ARC)|RAN-I-00-09-00015-00","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","AID-623-TO-11-00007|AID-RAN-I-09-00015","","10/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","","","Kenya","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACU559.pdf","776 KB","011492 - Development & Training Services, Inc.

"<span style=""font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"">This report is the final evaluation of USAID/Indonesias Decentralized Basic Education (DBE) program. &nbsp;The DBE program was the cornerstone of the United States assistance to education in Indonesia and was designed to directly respond to the Government of Indonesias priorities to decentralize and revitalize the education sector and focused on improving school management and governance and the quality and relevance of education in primary and junior secondary schools. &nbsp;The project was divided into three components: (1) assistance to local governments and communities to manage education services more effectively; (2) enhancement of teaching and learning to improve student performance, especially in key subjects such as math, science and reading; and (3) assurance that Indonesias youth gain more relevant life and work skills to better compete for jobs in the modern economy. &nbsp;The purpose of this evaluation is to assist USAID/Indonesia in the assessment of the impact of the three DBE programs on the quality and relevance of primary and junior secondary education in Indonesia. &nbsp;More specifically, the evaluation assessed: (1) how successful the three DBE programs were in achieving the primary goals; (2) the degree to which these goals have been met; and (3) the contributing factors that were responsible for or detracted from the achievement of these goals. &nbsp;In addition, USAID/Indonesia asked the evaluators to highlight any lessons learned or best practices from the implementation of the DBE program that could be applied to a recently-awarded new basic education program, Prioritizing Reform, Innovation, Opportunities for Reaching Indonesia's Teachers, Administrators, and Students (PRIORITAS). &nbsp;The evaluation concluded that all three DBE projects (DBE1, DBE2, DBE3) were aimed at addressing systematic weaknesses in the Indonesian education system. &nbsp;In each case, the DBE projects introduced important concepts and made significant in-roads toward improving school and district management and governance and teaching and learning outcomes in primary and secondary schools in Indonesia. &nbsp;Moreover, bringing education reforms to scale is incredibly difficult under the best of circumstances. &nbsp;Nevertheless, in the case of DBE, the ""glass is half-full"" and rapidly shrinking. &nbsp;When compared to the standard conventional Indonesian school, DBE schools are significantly better and the schools are better managed with greater community involvement, better teaching methods evident, and more enthusiastic teachers and students apparent. &nbsp;However, when compared to outstanding schools using active learning pedagogy, most of the DBE-partner schools were lack-luster with weak, inconsistent active learning methods being applied. &nbsp;In some schools, the program appears to be fading quickly. &nbsp;(Excerpt, modified)</span>","Title in footer: Indonesia : decentralized basic education final evaluation|Evaluated project title: Decentralized basic education (DBE)|Task Order 46|Project title: Global evaluation and monitoring II (GEM II)|V. 2 (annexes): PD-ACU-719","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","EDH-E-00-08-00003-00|AID-EDH-E-00-08-00003","","11/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","","","Indonesia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACU718.pdf","1,104 KB","013070 - JBS International, Inc.

"This evaluation is intended to provide USAID/Bangladesh an informed assessment of the Mission's Improving Local Level Governance (ILLG) project, which included three phases rolled out from 2002 to 2011, at a cost of $3.8 million.&nbsp; In addition to the project's traditional components, ILLG offered several unique components for study.&nbsp; In a break from the usual USAID project structure, in which an intermediary&mdash;most often, U.S.-based contractor or cooperating agency operates between USAID and in-country implementers, Rupantar, a Bangaldeshi nongovernmental organization, worked directly with USAID.&nbsp; As the implementing partner, Rupantar employed a mix of traditional song and drama to provide ""adult civic education"" in addition to more conventional approaches to promoting rural, local democratic governance.&nbsp; The project began in August 2002 with 23 union parishads (UPs), expanding in 2006 to a second phase with 50 UPs, and finally, encompassing 210 UPs and four pourashavas in its third and last phase in 2008, which introduced a disaster management component and lasted until March 2011.&nbsp; The project's three-part strategy worked with three groups: (1) UP chairs and members through training, mentoring and activity support; (2) carefully selected citizen committees through training and mentoring; and (3) citizens through traditional dramatic arts.&nbsp; The evaluation methodology comprised three basic elements: document review, intensive interviews and daylong field visits to 12 UPs in two regions of Bangladesh.&nbsp; The major constraints on the evaluation were the nine-year life of ILLG, and the 18-month lag between its project's end and the evaluation period.&nbsp; Problems included:&nbsp; (1) the evaluation team could not locate USAID personnel who had worked with the project before its terminal year; and (2) the project's target population at little memory of the project.&nbsp; Also, the May 2011 UP elections installed new chairmen in most UPs, along with many new members resulting in a loss of actual ILLG participants available at project locales.&nbsp; These constraints however, did, provide an opportunity to assess post-project sustainability.

"In 2009, the Targeted States High Impact Project (TSHIP), the USAID/Nigerias flagship project, started improving the quality and delivery of a number of integrated high impact maternal, newborn and child health (MNCH), family planning (FP), and reproductive health (RH) interventions in two States, Bauchi and Sokoto in Nigeria.&nbsp; The TSHIP, along with other USG projects, is part of USAID/Nigerias focus state strategy designed to achieve impact at the state level.&nbsp; The TSHIP design was based of the achievements of prior USG projects, and on a number of assumptions, to achieve the following four strategic subobjectives as measured by 25 indicators: (1) strengthen State and local capacity to deliver and promote high-impact interventions; (2) strengthen service delivery at primary health centers (PHC) and referral levels; (3) strengthen the roles of households and communities; and (4) improve policies, programming and resource allocation.&nbsp; Some of the evaluation findings include: (1) TSHIP has effectively introduced a number of high impact MNCH/FP/RH interventions, trained large numbers of health providers in both States and advocated for a number of system strengthening activities; (2) TSHIP has achieved high levels of visibility and good will among all beneficiaries, raised the level of awareness about quality of care, coverage and community engagement, and created and strengthened an effective community platform, the Ward Development Committees (WDC), to expand the community-based delivery of the target interventions; (3) project progress indicators show that in spite of these achievements, the project has not progressed as planned due to various factors; (4) the state-wide focus and the five TSHIP strategies used to guide project implementation so far have helped the project face the challenges of improving health services at the same scale as the focus states; (5) TSHIP's five overarching strategies do not seem to have followed the approach described in the grant application and the TSHIP Team has not yet taken ""the next step"" to ensure the stakeholders use interventions and incorporate them in their routines; (6) project activities seem to have had much breadth, but not enough depth to effect and sustain change; (7) integrating MNCH/FP health services was the main goal of the TSHIP, but it is not evident; (8) the critical assumption that the essential medicines and supplies would be there for the target interventions to be implemented was not valid; (9) TSHIP's achievements are appreciated by state, LGA and WDC authorities, but are not owned by them; and (10) the grants component has been delayed and is two years behind.&nbsp; (Excerpt, modified)","Cover title: Target states high impact project : mid-term evaluation","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","11/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","","","Nigeria","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACU950.pdf","1,343 KB","008360 - Mitchell Group, Inc.","","008586 - USAID.

FAI was launched on October 1, 2007 and concluded on September 30, 2012.&nbsp; The project was designed to build on earlier efforts, by EGPAF and others, to create and maintain a national program for the prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) of HIV, a disease that has for many years been an extremely heavy burden on Zimbabwean health systems.&nbsp; This evaluation assessed FAI's success in achieving its objective of building the capacity of the Zimbabwean Ministry of Health and Child Welfare (MOHCW) to develop and maintain PMTCT services of high quality on a national scale.&nbsp; The evaluation took place during October and November of 2012 and sought answears to two overreaching questions: (1) has FAI managed to develop capacity within the Zimbabwean Ministry of Health and Child Welfare and local non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to support continued delivery of PMTCT services beyond the life of the project?; and (2) how can these efforts be improved upon?&nbsp; The evaluators found that FAI has succeeded in achieving its principal objective, namely to ensure access to high quality PMTCT services for women, children and their families in urban and rural health service facilities, but several recommendations are outlined to continue progress towards the original goals.&nbsp; (Excerpt, modified)","Cover title|Inside title: An evaluation of USAID's family AIDS initiative (FAI) project's efforts to development capacity within the Zimbabwe Ministry of Health and Child Welfare and local non-governmental organizations to support continued delivery of PMTCT services beyond the life of the project : final report|Title in footer: End-of-project evaluation of FAI project|Evaluated project title:  Family AIDS initiative (FAI)|The project and evaluation falls under development objective 4 under the draft CDCS strategy for USAID Zimbabwe.","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","AID-613-TO-12-00002|RAN-I-00-09-00018-00","","11/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","","","Zimbabwe","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACU945.pdf","559 KB","008414 - Mendez England and Associates","","008628 - USAID.

The evaluation found: (1) a well-qualified LOGODEP project team is in place and is implementing well-drawn implementation plans in close coordination with Ghanaian counterparts. LOGODEP's institutional arrangements and commitments are contributing positively to achievement of the project's objectives; (2) the competitive grants program review process is leading to high-quality submissions, but the short time frame of the grants is inconsistent with durable gains in governance or service delivery; (3) work with traditional authorities has proven to be an important activity in community outreach and is especially noteworthy because it was not planned into original project activities or results; (4) spatial planning is now recognized as a critical tool for future development planning exercises. &nbsp;(Excerpt, modified)</span>","'Prepared under task order, 641-TO-12-00002 under the democracy and governance analytical services indefinite quantity contract, AID-OAA-I-10-00004'","Special Evaluation","Documents","641-TO-12-00002|AID-OAA-I-10-00004","","12/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","","Governance|Local level|Decentralization|Transparency|Civil society|Civil society organizations (CSO)|Community leadership|Taxes|Information dissemination|Licensing","Ghana","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACU990.pdf","277 KB","012295 - Democracy International, Inc.","","008547 - USAID.
