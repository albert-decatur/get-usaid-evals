"Since January 17, 2010, Land O'Lakes International Development has been implementing the Rebuilding Livelihoods and Resiliency in Zimbabwe (ZDL) Project. &nbsp;Initially, the project was to be completed in January 2011, later extended by an additional two years in May 2011 up to May 31, 2013. &nbsp;A further extension up to November 30, 2013 was later granted. &nbsp;This project was initiated with the objective of supporting USAID/Zimbabwe's Assistance Objective 3 (Livelihoods restored and maintained/economy stabilized and growing and assistance) and Objective 4 (Increased income and employment generated by the agricultural sector). &nbsp;The purpose of the midterm evaluation of the Land O'Lakes intervention focused on the following performance factors: (1) project progress; (2) project design, implementation and achievements; (3) processes that affect achievement of project outputs; (4) sustainability of project outcomes; (5) beneficiary rating of project services; (6) documenting lessons learned; (7) suggesting recommendations for the remaining period of the project. &nbsp;The evaluation concludes that based on progress to date, the ZDL program is highly likely to achieve and in some cases exceed most of its targets by the end of the program. &nbsp;The program has successfully revived all the milk collection centers that had either closed down or struggled due to a number of factors. &nbsp;Significant progress has been made in building the business capacity of beneficiary members and linking milk producers to better markets. &nbsp;The program however, remains with a considerable amount of capacity building and training to be completed in the remaining period of implementation. &nbsp;The evaluation also includes ten recommendations for the current implementation period and future programming. &nbsp;(Excerpt, modified)","Project title: Rebuilding livelihoods and resiliency in Zimbabwe (ZDL)|Final evaluation: PB-AAA-381","Special Evaluation","Documents","674-A-00-10-00002-00","","6/1/2013 12:00:00 AM","","","Zimbabwe","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PBAAA380.pdf","1,637 KB","005829 - Land O'Lakes, Inc.","","000035 - U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)","English","application/pdf","","","Musitini, Tawedzegwa|Mazibuko, Lifa Jacob","Agricultural development","[June 2013]","","","","Mid term evaluation of the rebuilding livelihoods and resiliency in Zimbabwe project - 674-A-00-10-00002-00 (January 17, 2010-November 30, 2013)","","PB-AAA-380","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MzQ4NDU0","Zimbabwe",""
"Land O&rsquo;Lakes has been implementing the Rebuilding Livelihoods and Resiliency in Zimbabwe (ZDL) project aimed at building livelihoods and promoting food security of farmers through interventions in the livestock and dairy value chains. &nbsp;It was expected that the significant gains from dairy in terms of income, improved food security and improved asset base that had been demonstrated regionally could be replicated in Zimbabwe. &nbsp;The purpose of this end-of-project evaluation was to carry out the final evaluation of the ZDL project in order to track program progress towards set targets; assess the appropriateness of project design; review constraints and how ZDL addressed them; and document the impacts, key lessons and best practices that will inform implementation of other USAID, Land O&rsquo;Lakes or local stakeholder development programmes. &nbsp;Highlights of the accomplishments are: (1) the ZDL project activities included the linking of dairy farmers to high-value milk markets, increasing access to animal health services, increasing capacity of fodder flow management, and promoting the use of donkeys for milk transportation; (2) the project has been a major success, setting a foundation for smallholder dairying in Zimbabwe; (3) the project distinguished itself through the promotion of a pro-business approach, facilitation of commercial dairy production, capacity building of local MCCs and the ZADF; (4) the project achieved an overall physical progress rate of 97.2% against set targets, with the majority of the project's indicators surpassing expectations and the set targets; (5) the volume of milk produced per household each month increased from 50 litres at the baseline to 562 litres in 2013 (1,124% increase); (6) the number of households with adequate food provision increased by 21.4%; (7) the mean Household Dietary Diversity Score (HDDS) was 8.2 compared to averages of 7.2 during the baseline period and 7.6 during the mid-term evaluation period; (8) the number of jobs achieved and attributable to the Feed the Future (FTF) initiative stands at 932, with 783 for males and 149 for females; (9) average annual dairy incomes increased by 743%, increasing from US$312 during the baseline to US$2,943 currently, and a paltry US$206 for the control group (non-beneficiaries). &nbsp;(Excerpt, modified)","Project title: Rebuilding livelihoods and resiliency in Zimbabwe (ZDL)|Mid-term evaluation: PB-AAA-380","Special Evaluation","Documents","674-A-00-10-00002-00","","5/1/2014 12:00:00 AM","","Livelihood|Crop protection|Income generation|Food security|Regional development|Regional development|Livestock|Dairy farms","Zimbabwe","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PBAAA381.pdf","2,063 KB","005829 - Land O'Lakes, Inc.","","000035 - U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)","English","application/pdf","","","Carr, Dammika|Mlambo, Benjamine","Agricultural development","[May 2014]","","","","Final evaluation report : rebuilding livelihoods and resiliency in Zimbabwe (ZDL) project implemented by Land O'Lakes and funded by USAID","","PB-AAA-381","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MzQ4NDU1","Zimbabwe",""

"The Tanzania Police Force, Prisons Service, and the Immigration Department (TPPI) program was designed to support the Government of Tanzania through the Police, Prisons, and Immigration Department to implement an HIV and AIDS workplace program. &nbsp;The aim of this program was to keep the personnel of Police, Prisons, and Immigration Services (TPPI or the Forces), their dependents, and civilians living in the vicinity of the health facilities of these Forces, free from HIV infection. &nbsp;The components of the program were: (1) HIV prevention; (2) prevention of mother-to-child transmission (3) HIV counseling and testing; (4) HIV care and treatment; (5) TB/HIV collaboration; (6) pediatric care and support; (7) pediatric anti-retroviral treatment (ATI); (8) umbrella care and support; (9) orphans and vulnerable children (OVC); and (10) police child-friendly services. &nbsp;The main purpose of this performance evaluation was to: (1) determine the extent to which the expected results of developing a comprehensive HIV and AIDS workplace programs for each of the Forces has been achieved; and (2) provide information and recommendations for planning and designing of any new support program. &nbsp;Guiding questions intended to address the evaluation objectives were: (1) how effective has the program been [and] have the program objectives been met; (2) what are the major results of the program [and] what is the impact of these results; (3) were there specific project management policies, structures, or practices that contributed to either success or failure of intervention implementation; (4) how well is the project working to coordinate planning and implementation of activities [and] how well is the program working in collaboration with other United States Government (USG)-funded programs; (5) are the staffing structure and capacity sufficient to achieve project goals; (6) what worked well, what did not, and why; (7) identify lessons learned, successful interventions for continuation or replication, best practices, significant products and tools of the above projects for possible dissemination and replication; (8) are the content and structures of TPPI's approach sustainable [and] are they embedded in national structures; (9) does TPPI's approach empower medical teams in the forces to proactively address HIV needs [and] are there alternative approaches that may contribute to host country ownership; and (10) what could be improved. &nbsp;To the evaluation team's knowledge, the TPPI program and the Tanzania Police and Defense Force (TPDF) program are the only HIV and AIDS donor-funded projects including care and treatment to be implemented nation-wide in Tanzania. &nbsp;This particularity of the TPPI program, along with its comprehensive nature, offers many advantages and raises challenges. &nbsp;The evaluation team has compiled a set of recommendations detailed under each program area as well as general recommendations. &nbsp;Specific evaluation analyses on program findings, conclusions, and recommendations are provided in detail.&nbsp; (Excerpt, modified)","Evaluated project title: Tanzania police, prisons, and immigration (TPPI)","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","2/1/2013 12:00:00 AM","","","Tanzania","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00JVKB.pdf","674 KB","012551 - LTL Strategies","","008612 - USAID.

"In 2008, USAID procured two HIV Testing and Counseling (HTC) projects, Angaza Zaidi and Universal HIV and AIDS Intervention for Counseling and Testing (UHAI-CT), both with indicators and targets aimed at contributing to increased use of HIV/AIDS prevention to care services and products. &nbsp;The primary goal of the Angaza Zaidi project is to improve the health of Tanzanians by ensuring that they know their HIV status, take steps to protect themselves, and have better quality of life if infected. &nbsp;The Angaza Zaidi technical approach uses three modalities: (1) integrated voluntary HTC; (2) stand-alone HTC; and (3) community-based HTC. Implementation is guided by strategies of: (1) targeting; (2) decentralization and community engagement; (3) branding; (4) partnerships and sub-granting; (5) advocacy; and (6) counseling and testing systems strengthening. &nbsp;The primary goal of the UHAI-CT project is to increase access to testing and counselling services to Tanzanian families, couples, and individuals, particularly those at high risk, and to link those found to be HIV-positive to relevant HIV care, treatment, and prevention services. &nbsp;The UHAI-CT technical approach is guided by the principles of: (1) innovation; (2) rapid expansion; (3) diversity of strategies; (4) quality; (5) sustainability; (6) strong links to HIV care; and (7) treatment and cost effectiveness. &nbsp;UHAI-CT activities are implemented using Providor Initiated Testing and Counseling (PITC) and community outreach. &nbsp;Main questions for this program evaluation were the following: (1) has each project achieved its stated goals and objectives; (2) what are each project's strengths, weaknesses, and gaps in planning, management, routine data use, and service delivery; (3) how did each project strategically use different HTC modalities to achieve its goals and objects [and] were these modalities effective in reaching the target populations [and] what are the lessons learned from successful interventions that merit continuation or replication, better practices, significant products and tools for possible dissemination and replication; (4) was each project able to successfully refer newly-identified HIV-positive clients to HIV care and treatment facilities [and] what systems were used during these referrals; (5) how has each project built capacity and/or institutionalized its practices to heighten opportunities for sustainability [and] were these efforts successful. &nbsp;The evaluation team concludes that both projects met many, but not all, of their objectives and targets. &nbsp;Although the evaluation documents several weaknesses, both projects had more strengths than weaknesses. &nbsp;While all of the HTC modalities played a significant role in increasing HTC and reaching different populations, they were not used strategically to reach populations at high risk. &nbsp;Among a number of key lessons learned by both projects is the necessity for a decentralized approach to project management in Tanzania to facilitate project monitoring, communication, and stakeholder engagement. &nbsp;Neither project created a robust, traceable linkage system to ensure HIV-positive clients are linked to care and treatment. &nbsp;However, both projects made measurable progress towards building the capacity of local institutions and institutionalizing practices for HTC.

"During the 2007 elections, controversies over the voter register and the tallying, transmission and announcement of results catalyzed the post-election violence and humanitarian crisis. &nbsp;The violence came to an end and an independent review commission gave numerous recommendations. &nbsp;The purpose of this evaluation is to determine the effectiveness of the election assistance provided by USAID/Kenya from January 2008-August 2013. &nbsp;The results of the evaluation are meant to guide USAID in designing future electoral assistance in Kenya and globally. &nbsp;The primary audience for this evaluation is USAID/Kenya and USAID/Washington. &nbsp;As a meta-evaluation, the purpose is to examine USAID&rsquo;s assistance broadly and to propose recommendations for the design of future electoral assistance based on the data collected, evaluator knowledge of best practices and standards, and learning that has taken place. &nbsp;The evaluation is not designed to look at individual activities in detail. &nbsp;The evaluation addressed six questions: (1) to what degree did USAID&rsquo;s electoral assistance, using the seven identified approaches, contribute to the 2013 elections? &nbsp;These seven approaches are: (i) strengthening the capacity of the election management body (EMB); (ii) election dispute resolution (EDR) and security; (iii) professionalizing political parties; (iv) election observation; (v) civic and voter education; (vi) media engagement; and (vii) participation of marginalized groups; (2) to what extent has U.S. government (USG) electoral assistance strengthened the technical and, where applicable, administrative capacity for delivery and/or reporting of accountable elections in the future of (i) the electoral commission; (ii) major political parties; (iii) domestic monitoring network; (iv) media; and (v) civil society organizations (CSOs) funded by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID); (3) how appropriate was the mix and timing of activities in addressing the needs identified by both past and ongoing evidence; (4) to what extent did USAID coordinate with other donors to maximize the leverage of USG resources and funds; (5) to what extent were the electoral assistance activities effective in promoting participation by women and youth; and, (6) what are some lessons that can inform the design of future electoral assistance projects both in Kenya and globally? &nbsp;To summarize results the evaluating team states that in response to the recommendations, many key changes in the legal framework and structure of the government of Kenya (GOK) were implemented. &nbsp;To respond to the challenges identified, USAID/Kenya designed an electoral assistance program whose development objective is ""democratic and inclusive reform agenda advanced"" and the fifth intermediate result (IR) is ""free, fair, credible and peaceful elections held."" &nbsp;(Excerpt, modified)","Cover title: Performance evaluation of USAID electoral assistance to Kenya from January 2008-August 2013|'Kenya Support Program'","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","AID-623-TO-14-00003|AID-623-I-12-00001","","6/1/2014 12:00:00 AM","","","Kenya","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00JVSB.pdf","1,961 KB","003970 - Management Systems International, Inc.

"Control and Prevention of Malaria (CAP-Malaria) is the flagship project of the President's Malaria Initiative (PMI) in the Greater Mekong Sub-region (GMS), running from October 2011 to October 2016.&nbsp; The overall aim of the CAP-M project is to reduce morbidity and mortality from malaria in the GMS and to eliminate artemisinin-resistant parasites.&nbsp; The key populations at risk for malaria within the GMS are highly mobile and migrant populations with exposures or occupations in forested and border areas.&nbsp; These populations are generally socially, geographically and economically marginalized, with consequent limited access to health services.&nbsp; This evaluation focuses on five major queries: (1) to what extent is CAP-M on-track to increase the use of preventative measures among at-risk populations; (2) has the CAP-M community-based approach contributed to increased use of quality diagnostics and treatment; (3) how optimal are the design and management arrangements for achieving project objectives; (4) to what extent has the strategic information generated by the project been used; and (5) what measures/mechanisms have been put into place to achieve sustainability?&nbsp; The CAP-M project is off to a strong start, and has made extensive progress even in the face of multiple challenges related to political limitations, changing program focuses, procurement delays, and access/safety issues in some areas.&nbsp; Notable progress has been made throughout the first half of the grant by URC and its partners in increasing access to preventative measures and early diagnosis/appropriate treatment throughout the region, but progress has not been equal in all areas.&nbsp; While CAP-M is well positioned to build on these successes through the remainder of the project, particularly regarding widespread long-lasting insecticidal net distribution and strengthened community-based activities, diverse challenges remain in the three settings of the country-specific projects.&nbsp; (Excerpt, modified)","Project title: Control and prevention of malaria (CAP-Malaria)|Project title also known as: CAP-M","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID-486-A-12-00001","","5/1/2014 12:00:00 AM","","Malaria|Antimalarials|Disease prevention and control|Maternal child health care|Artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT)|Morbidity|At-risk groups|Quality of care|Disease treatment","Burma|Cambodia|Thailand","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00JWRP.pdf","1,280 KB","004293 - University Research Corp.

"Pastoralist communities in Ethiopia exhibit some of the lowest water and sanitation coverage rates in the world. &nbsp;Building on considerable water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) experience in conflict-prone pastoralist areas, the Internal Rescue Committee (IRC) Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene Transformation for Enhanced Resilience (WATER) project contributed significantly to improving pastoralists' access to clean and sustainable water sources, hygiene awareness and access to sanitation, and rangeland management practices. &nbsp;The evaluation team sought to answer these questions: &nbsp;(1) what were the project's contributions towards meeting the development objective of economic growth; (2) how effective was the project in achieving its anticipated results; (3) how effective was the project in mainstreaming gender issues and addressing the needs of people with disabilities; (4) how was the project's approach and methodology designed to achieve project objectives; (5) what worked well and what did not work [and] how [and] why? &nbsp;One of the main conclusions of the performance evaluation is that the project was very effective in achieving its anticipated results in terms of providing access to improved water sources and on hygiene and sanitation awareness. &nbsp;The project implementing partners have operated competently and have met all expectations as indicated in the project documents. &nbsp;The implementation of the core WASH activities worked well. &nbsp;The integration of Natural Resource Management (NRM) activities in the project was also appreciated by beneficiaries and served to mitigate some of the less desirable impacts of the project such as settling of pastoralists around water points, allowing livestock to graze around water points and overall sustainability of rangeland around the project site. &nbsp;(Excerpt, modified)","Evaluated project title: Water sanitation and hygiene transformation for enhanced resiliency (WaTER)","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","AID-663-O-14-00011","","4/1/2014 12:00:00 AM","","","Ethiopia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00JWVB.pdf","1,086 KB","040827 - SaafConsult B.V.","","008543 - USAID.
