"The Improved Basic Education in Cambodia project's strategic objective is to improve access, quality, and relevance of basic education in Cambodia.&nbsp; More specifically, the IBEC project is to increase lower secondary school enrollments, retention, and completion rates, providing Cambodia's adolescent youth population with an opportunity to be better educated and lead productive lives.&nbsp; The IBEC project targets selected schools in three provinces, Kampong Cham, Kratie and Siem Reap.&nbsp; There are four inter-related, mutually reinforcing, and complementary components to achieving this overarching goal.&nbsp; These four main components include: (1) local NGO and government capacity building &amp; advocacy for sustainability; (2) more equitable school access; (3) improved school management and community involvement; and (4) improved educational relevance.&nbsp; The development hypothesis underlying the IBEC project is that a more relevant curriculum, combined with better trained teachers and school managers would encourage more students to attend lower secondary school and to stay long enough to complete the lower secondary cycle.&nbsp; Improved physical facilities (wells for drinking water, sanitary latrines, life skills laboratories, etc.) were also believed to play a positive role in inducing students to attend and remain in school.&nbsp; In addition, a limited number of scholarships would directly help vulnerable youth obtain a quality education.&nbsp; In total, these improvements were to create a better educated youth population who will have a knowledge base more relevant to the economic needs of Cambodia, with skills more compatible with the demands of the local job market.&nbsp; The purpose of the evaluation is to assess the project's accountability and extent to which it was able to meet its intended objectives at all result levels.&nbsp; The evaluation also documents lessons learned and best practices, as well as providing recommendations to inform evidence-based future programming.&nbsp; The Evaluation Questions guiding this performance evaluation were: (1) to what extent did the project achieve its objectives; (2) among all the interventions implemented by the partner, identify the interventions that have been the most effective in achieving the project objectives; (3) what are key lessons learned?&nbsp; The end-of-project performance evaluation provides evidence to confirm that IBEC largely achieved its objectives to improve access, quality and relevance of basic education in Cambodia.&nbsp; Specific evaluation findings, conclusions and recommendations are provided with detailed analysis for each evaluation question.

"<p>This report presents the findings of the final performance evaluation of the Monitoring Nepal's Peace Process and Constitution Drafting Process (MNPPCDP) project.&nbsp; The MNPPCDP project initially conducted district-based monitoring of selected aspects of the political transition in Nepal, and then grew to include monitoring of voter registration in advance of the November 2013 Constituent Assembly (CA) elections and fielding an international mission to observe the CA elections.&nbsp;&nbsp; Over the span of the project, program documents associated with this project make it clear that the project was much more concerned with generating information to inform elite (""key stakeholder"") decision-making than with the wide dissemination of information to ""Nepali citizens.&rdquo;&nbsp; This evaluation seeks to assess the veracity of the following inter-connected hypotheses: (1) information generated by The Carter Center's (TCC&rsquo;s) monitoring reached and was consumed by the intended ""key stakeholders"" (and perhaps also citizens more generally); and (2) TCC-generated information, analysis and suasion influenced the decision-making of key stakeholders in ways that contributed to sustaining the peace process.&nbsp; More specifically, the main research questions include: (1) how effective was the program in engaging women, youth, dalits, differently abled and other marginalized groups during the monitoring of peace and constitution drafting processes and in bringing their issues to influence these processes [and] do citizens feel that their voices have been heard through this program; (2) how have the findings of TCC's analytical work such as field visit reports and press releases contributed to policy level decisions and to help shape programs and strategies of stakeholders such as CSOs, USAID projects, Election Commission of Nepal (ECN), Government of Nepal and donor communities? &nbsp;What other information would have been more helpful for the stakeholders; (3) in what ways have the report on ""limited observation of the ECN's voter registration program"" contributed to strengthening Election Commission's voter registration process [and] what recommendations from TCC's 2013 CA election observation report and/or other reports are being implemented for the June 2014 by-election and future local elections; and (4) what are further opportunities and challenges for making the long-term observation process more efficient and effective?&nbsp; Evaluation conclusions were that given the political context in Nepal circa 2009-2013, a case can be made that long-term monitoring of the peace process by the Carter Center was valuable for the following reasons: (1) it addressed the lack of credible information coming from the regions; (2) given the multi-faceted nature of the peace process, there was value in having a single organization that could deal holistically with all the elements of the peace process: local level peace and security, the constitutional process and the electoral process; (3) there was an openness -- perhaps even a desire -- on the part of most key political actors to have a neutral international actor that could, in the name of the CPA, help to resolve political impasses and also help keep any one group from behaving in ways that would cause the peace process to collapse; (4) President Carter had experience and credibility with most key actors and wasn't too threatening to the Indian government.&nbsp; Specific evaluation findings, conclusions and recommendations are provided with detailed analysis for each evaluation question.&nbsp; (Excerpt, modified)</p>","Evaluated project title: Monitoring Nepal's peace process and constitution drafting process (MNPPCDP)","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","AID-OAA-M-13-00013","","8/1/2014 12:00:00 AM","","","Nepal","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00K2VF.pdf","571 KB","040818 - NORC at the University of Chicago","","040194 - USAID.

"Wellness and Agriculture for Life Advancement (WALA) is a five-year Title II Multi-Year Assistance Program (MYAP) funded by USAID to prevent and mitigate food insecurity in southern Malawi. &nbsp;WALA targets the most vulnerable communities and households, ensuring holistic provision of services to the selected groups. &nbsp;In the original design, targeted groups are comprised of households that have small and marginal farms, are female-headed, host chronically ill persons (tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS), are food insecure, and/or host orphans. &nbsp;WALA is implemented in the eight most food insecure districts of southern Malawi: Nsanje, Chikwawa, Thyolo, Mulanje, Zomba, Machinga, Chiradzulu and Balaka. &nbsp;The goal of WALA is to improve the food security of 214,974 chronically food insecure households in 39 Traditional Authorities in eight districts in southern Malawi by 2014 through strategic objectives in: (1) maternal and child health and nutrition (MCHN); (2) agriculture, natural resource management (NRM), irrigation and economic activity; and (3) disaster risk reduction. &nbsp;The evaluation assessed the results of program and how the program management and implementation affected and/or supported program achievements. &nbsp;This will inform future Food for Peace and USAID development programming in Malawi. &nbsp;The specific program objectives were: (1) to carry out a comparative analysis (bivariate and multivariate) of baseline and endline surveys to assess the changes in the indicators (program result) as outlined in the indicator performance tracking table (IPTT); (2) to identify program strategies, structures, systems and interventions that contributed to or impeded the achievement of intended results of program interventions and links between inputs and results with gender focus; (3) to assess the effectiveness and efficiency of technical, managerial and resource management strategies; (4) to assess progress made in responding to the midterm evaluation recommendations; (5) to assess the synergy between various WALA program components including linkages with Government of Malawi and other development programs (e.g., Positive Action for Community Transformation (IMPACT), Water for Irrigation for Life Advancement (WILA), MCHN+), and how the linkages enhance the program performance; (6) to assess the sustainability of the program outcomes; (7) to list the major successes and challenges faced by the WALA program and how well these challenges were addressed; (8) to extract and report on lessons learned to inform future Food for Peace program designs; and (9) to make specific recommendations on improving strategies and program interventions for future programming and/or scale-up. &nbsp;Specific evaluation findings, conclusions and recommendations are provided with detailed analysis for each evaluation question. &nbsp;(Excerpt, modified)","'A Title II MYAP Funded by USAID Food for Peace'|Project title: Wellness and agriculture for life advancement (WALA)","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","AID-FFP-A-09-00001","","8/1/2014 12:00:00 AM","","Food for Peace Title II|Food security|Maternal child health care|Malnutrition|Child nutrition|Maternal nutrition|Disadvantaged groups|Crop yield|Poverty reduction|Rural areas|Natural resource management|Irrigation|Disaster planning","Malawi","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00K2WJ.pdf","1,623 KB","007337 - Catholic Relief Services (CRS)","","010990 - USAID.

"<p>Health Program of the Community Livelihoods Project (CLP) in Yemen.&nbsp; The CLP is an integrated, multi-sectoral, assistance project designed to mitigate the instability in some of Yemen's most difficult regions through the facilitation and implementation of quality government service delivery, job creation, responsive local governance, and active civic participation.&nbsp; Within the CLP the health program has focused largely on the extension of reproductive health care to populations that did not have access to health services.&nbsp; The health project of the CLP aimed to improve maternal, newborn and child health (MNCH), ultimately intending to reduce maternal, neonatal and child mortality.&nbsp; This goal is aligned with the health goals of the Ministry of Public Health and Population (MoPHP), as well as USAID&rsquo;s MNCH and Reproductive Health (RH), Family Planning (FP), and Nutrition priorities.&nbsp; This evaluation of the CLP Health Program aims to provide USAID with recommendations to inform the design of future health programs in Yemen and similar fragile states.&nbsp; To this end, the evaluation assessed: (1) the quality of the program design and the strategic and operational approach; (2) the quality planning, monitoring, data quality and reporting; and (3) the efficiency and effectiveness of the program.&nbsp; There were improvements seen in access to and the quality of health services during the life of the project.&nbsp; Health-sector activities related to PPM and MMTs were particularly effective in contributing to improved health access in rural areas.&nbsp; From 2011-2013, 9 health centers were rehabilitated.&nbsp; The numbers of assisted births in specific areas increased from 206 in 2011 to 894 in 2013.&nbsp; The project made key investments in training.&nbsp; The project can claim credit for 352 midwives being trained between 2011 and 2013.&nbsp; During that same period, 213 other staff were trained in maternal-child care.&nbsp; The original hypothesis of the project&rsquo;s logic model -- that health service delivery would contribute to national political stability and peace -- remains undetermined.&nbsp; The lack of counterfactuals and the existence of other numerous extraneous driving factors make it difficult to measure any attribution.&nbsp; The CLP health project demonstrated reasonable resilience in re-inventing itself in response to changing conditions in Yemen and evolving analyses and priorities.

"The Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) Institutional Strengthening project (FISP) supports USAID/Pakistan's Development Objective -- increased stability in focus areas.&nbsp; According to the FISP results framework, the strategic objective of the project is to ensure the institutional viability of the FATA Secretariat (FS) and FATA Development Authority (FDA) as service-oriented government bodies capable of managing their duties in a transparent, well-planned manner.&nbsp; The project is pursuing the following: (1) improved capacity of the FS to govern through systems development, training, and strengthening of the IT infrastructure [to include] strengthened planning, monitoring and evaluation, budgeting, finance, human resources management, office management, and communication functions of the FS and FDA; and(2) strengthened IT infrastructure and IT capacity of the FS and FDA.&nbsp; By achieving the above-mentioned intermediate results, the project expects to improve: (1) efficiency; (2) transparency;(3) accountability; (4) and the quality of project plans, proposals, monitoring, and reporting in government departments.&nbsp; The evaluation aims to assess progress toward institutional strengthening in relation to the organizational needs of the three key FATA institutions, the FS, FDA and the Governor's Secretariat.&nbsp; The evaluation focuses on five main questions: (1) how and to what extent are the systems developed by FISP and currently in use addressing the organizational needs of the departments that own and use the systems, and what factors explain progress or lack thereof in this regard; (2) how and to what extent have the FS, the FDA, and the Governor's Secretariat institutionalized the systems introduced by FISP; (3) what has been the usefulness of the policy-related reports prepared with FISP assistance;&nbsp; (4) what evidence is there of women's participation and a concern for gender issues in FISP interventions; and (5) what changes could better serve the project objectives and the priority organizational needs of the FS, FDA, and the Governor's Secretariat?&nbsp; The evaluation found that six of the seven systems in use were being used to address some or all of the organizational needs expressed by the owner/user departments and other users.&nbsp; The evaluation also found that top-level support for the systems deployed so far is the most important factor facilitating implementation of the systems and progress toward meeting organizational needs.&nbsp; Specific evaluation findings, conclusions and recommendations are provided with detailed analysis for each evaluation question.

"The Support for International Family Planning Organizations (SIFPO) project mission is to increase the use of family planning (FP) services globally through strengthening selected international FP organizations which have a global reach and an extensive, multi-country network of FP clinics, in order to achieve maximum program impact and synergies.&nbsp; The current project is working toward the following four results areas: (1) strengthened organizational capacity to deliver quality FP services to target groups; (2) internal quality assurance standards and results quantified and disseminated to strengthen FP performance at a global level; (3) increased organizational sustainability of country-level programs, including internal south-to-south support and technical assistance; and (4) gender-sensitive FP services targeting youth strengthened at a global level. The evaluation's overarching questions seek to: (1) ascertain how satisfied various stakeholders, including USAID missions, have been with the work done by SIFPO and with assistance from the program; (2) identify what existing gaps and future technical directions or issues need to be addressed in any follow-up; (3) determine how the use of core resources by each recipient organization strengthens country-level platforms and their effect on improved organizational capacity, performance, and management; (4) survey the additional support and strengthening needed for improved sustainability at the country level; and (5) identify the areas for improvement or strengthening of family planning/reproductive health (FP/RH) service delivery and quality assurance.&nbsp; The questions comprise, but are not limited to: (1) what evidence exists that core resources invested in organizational strengthening have improved country-level platforms and programming; (2) what has been the effect on organizational capacity; (3) is there evidence that there is increased sustainability; (4) how have management practices within the organization been affected; (5) is there evidence that the internal quality assurance standards have been disseminated to strengthen FP service delivery and performance at a global level; and (6) to what extent is the PSI project's portfolio of service delivery activities meeting the needs of stakeholders?&nbsp; Specific evaluation findings, conclusions and recommendations are provided with detailed analysis for each evaluation question.&nbsp; (Excerpt, modified)","Footer title: PSI-SIFPO : midterm project evaluation|Evaluated project title: Support for international family planning organizations : Population Services International (SIFPO/PSI)|Project title: Global health technical assistance project bridge IV (GH Tech IV)","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID-OAA-C-13-00113","","3/1/2014 12:00:00 AM","","Family planning|Family planning clinics|Access to services|Integrated health care|Gender analysis|Quality control|Health care costs|Social aspects","Guatemala|Benin|Africa south of Sahara","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00K3WC.pdf","1,090 KB","011492 - Development & Training Services, Inc.
