"THE EVALUATION TEAM CONSIDERS THE ORIGINAL PROJECT DESIGN AND RATIONALE, IN TERMS OF INPUTS PROVIDED, OUTPUTS EXPECTED,AND PROJECT PURPOSE, TO BE GENERALLY SATISFACTORY. THEY DO NOT CONSIDER THE STATED GOALS OR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF EVALUATION TARGETS AT THE GOAL LEVEL TO BE REALISTIC IN RELATION TO THE SIZE AND NATURE OF THE INPUTS. GIVEN THE DOMINANCE OF INTERVENING VARIABLES EXTERNAL TO THE PROJECT, IT IS DIFFICULT TO ESTABLISH A CAUSE AND EFFECT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PROJECT OUTPUTS AND THE GOAL INDICATORS. ON-GOING RESEARCH PROJECTS ARE GENERALLY WELL-RECEIVED IN TERMS OF THEIR PROJECT PURPOSES, AND MANY TREAT PRIORITY AREAS OF IMPROVED NUTRITION AND PASTURE MANAGEMENT. A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF FIELD DAYS AND TRAINING COURSES HAVE BEEN HELD AND DEMONSTRATION PLOTS ESTABLISHED.  HOWEVER, ORIENTATION OF EXTENSION STRATEGY SHOULD BE IMPROVED TO INCREASE THE MULTIPLIER EFFECT OF DISSEMINATING RESEARCH OUTPUT AND TO REACH THE SMALL AND MEDIUM RANCHER AND MIXED FARMER. THE EVALUATORS RECOMMENDED THAT THE PROJECT BE CONTINUED, BUT WITH SIGNIFICANT ADJUSTMENTS IN ORIENTATION, GOALS, ACHIEVEMENT MEASUREMENT, PURPOSE, AND COURSE OF ACTION, WHICH ARE DETAILED IN THE SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/CM/OTR-C-73-198","","1/1/1974 12:00:00 AM","","Livestock|Animal husbandry|Agricultural extension|Agricultural research|Agricultural training|Educational materials|Institution building|Information dissemination|Associations|Participants|Project change","Paraguay","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAB102.pdf","3,025 KB","000256 - American Technical Assistance Corp.

"Five Nigerian vocational schools in the Lagos area were visited to provide perspective for comparative purposes with the Opportunities Industrialization Centre, Lagos (OIC/L). All schools but one appeared to be providing adequate training for rapidly expanding Nigerian industrial skill needs. The exception, the Nigerian Army Resettlement Scheme (NARS), is coping with the special problem of rehabilitating disabled military veterans. Although comparative cost data are fragmentary, it appears from this limited information that OIC/L is performing effectively. (See Tables 1 and 2.) OIC/L has, in addition, introduced a number of significant innovations which set it apart from the others. These include: an accelerated course schedule, individualized instruction, counseling and placement on jobs. They are accomplishing these objectives to a fair degree. They also are trying to involve the community in the support of the school. Although slow in coming, evidence of success in this area is accumulating and is judged satisfactory by the consultants. Industrial Training Fund (ITF) staff, seven in all, were assigned to the task to introduce them to evaluation techniques. They were totally involved throughout. Their reviews of OIC/L all recommended ITF support with varying degrees of emphasis. The consultants concur in this recommendation.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/CM/OTR-C-73-198","","1/1/1974 12:00:00 AM","","Private voluntary organizations|Skilled workers|Training centers|Vocational training","Nigeria","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAB177.pdf","2,434 KB","000592 - Industrial Training Fund|000256 - American Technical Assistance Corp.

"Evaluates general rural development problems in Ethiopia based on a brief observation of the Ada agricultural development project. The project is designed to provide the Ada district with new technology, infrastructure, and local institutions to increase small farmer income. The author spent two weeks in Ethiopia interviewing government officials and Ada project staff as well as a number of farmers and local officials. In his analysis of the national policy constraints to rural development, the author gives special emphasis to expanding and improving agricultural production research.  This warrants emphasis because (1) a basic, solid core of research institutions already exists and (2) without expanded research, Ethiopia will soon lack profitable recommendations to farmers.  The first priority for the experiment station system must remain with the basic food crops. Ethiopia is presently following the ""extensive approach"" to rural development which provides broad areas of the country with a basic ""minimum package program"".  Despite the simplicity of the present technical package there is a clear need for increased technical knowledge and for modification of the package to suit specific conditions. The Ada project, by contrast, is an intensive effort in a small area. The role of intensive projects such as Ada should be to serve as a focus for experimentation on ways to improve the existing package and to set priorities for its expansion.  To this end, the author recommends that the Ada project intensify experimentation and testing in order to improve that basic technology package.  The working relationship between Ada and the Debra Zeit experiment station should be expanded; different extension techniques should be analyzed and compared; and different ways of organizing farmers for provision of marketing services should be tested, including crop storage and handling techniques.  More experimentation is needed to find the most effective way of organizing farmers for infrastructure projects, especially roads.  All these recommendations will require an expanded project staff including more evaluation experts.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/TA-C-1131","","1/1/1974 12:00:00 AM","","Development projects|Rural development|Agricultural policy|Agricultural development|Agricultural research|Beneficiary interviews","Ethiopia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAB284.pdf","3,719 KB","000395 - Cornell University","","","English","application/pdf","Sector level evaluation|Indepth evaluation|Onsite evaluation","","Mellor, John W.","Agricultural development","1974","","","","Report on rural development issues in Ethiopia : problems and prescriptions with special reference to EPID and the Ada project","","PN-AAB-284","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTU2MDI3","Ethiopia","6630162"
"THIS SUMMARY REPORT IS VOLUME 1 OF A FOUR-VOLUME REPORT ON THE AGRICULTURAL ""SECTOR APPROACH"" AS APPLIED IN COLOMBIA, COSTA RICA AND GUATEMALA. THE TEAM'S PRINCIPAL FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS ARE: THE APPROACH HAS BEEN EFFECTIVE, IT HAS MADE POSSIBLE DIALOG CONCERNING SECTOR PROBLEMS, AND IT HAS PERMITTED THOSE PROBLEMS TO BE CONSIDERED IN A HOLISTIC CONTEXT. IT HAS DIRECTED ATTENTION TO THE NEGLECT OF THE SMALL FARMER. SECTOR ANALYSES ARE NOT YET ADEQUATE AS A BASIS FOR STRATEGY AND PROGRAM REVISIONS. EXISTING PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN MOST SUCCESSFUL IN STRENGTHENING THE INSTITUTIONAL BASE FOR DEALING WITH SECTOR PROBLEMS AND BRINGING SERVICES TO THE SMALL FARMER. HOWEVER, THE PROGRAMS HAVE NOT YET DEMONSTRATED THAT DIRECT PROVISION OF PRODUCTION CREDIT AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO SMALL FARMERS BY PUBLIC AGENCIES IS THE BEST MEANS OF IMPROVING THE WELFARE OF MOST OF THE RURAL POPULATION. THERE IS A NEED TO DO FOUR THINGS: (1) ESTABLISH IN EACH PROGRAM AN EVALUATION PROCESS; (2) CONSIDER ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES TO IMPROVEMENT OF THE WELFARE OF SMALL FARMERS; (3) REVIEW AID CRITERIA AND PROCEDURES AND ADAPT THEM TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THE SECTOR APPROACH; AND (4) PROVIDE AID STAFF WITH THE SKILLS NECESSARY TO MEET TECHNICAL, MANAGERIAL, ANALYTICAL, AND EVALUATIVE REQUIREMENTS.","Summarizes the following country rpts. - Colombia: PN-AAD-109,|Costa Rica: PN-AAD-110, and Guatemala: PN-AAD-111","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","6/1/1974 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural development|Sector evaluation","Colombia|Costa Rica|Guatemala","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAD108.pdf","1,785 KB","000108 - USAID.

"THIS STUDY EVALUATES AND PROVIDES A BASIS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF GENERAL POLICY AND ADJUSTMENTS IN CURRENT AGRICULTURE SECTOR PROGRAMS. IT IS THE SECOND VOLUME OF A FOUR-VOLUME REPORT. THE PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: COLOMBIAN AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT HAS PROGRESSED RAPIDLY IN THE PAST DECADE. PRODUCTION AND EXPORT OF COMMERCIAL AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS HAVE INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY. THE GOVERNMENT HAS ORGANIZED A STRUCTURE OF PUBLIC AGENCIES SUITABLE FOR DEALING WITH AGRICULTURAL PROBLEMS. AID'S PROGRAMS CAN TAKE MAJOR CREDIT FOR THE FACT THAT COLOMBIA HAS A NEW GENERATION OF OFFICIALS TRAINED TO HANDLE COLOMBIA'S AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROBLEMS. THE SECTOR APPROACH IN COLOMBIA HAS RESULTED IN MORE INTEGRATED THINKING ABOUT AGRICULTURAL PROBLEMS. IT HAS PROVIDED A BASE FOR CONSIDERATION OF SIGNIFICANT QUESTIONS AND DEVELOPMENT OF EFFECTIVE POLICIES.

"THE AGRICULTURE ""SECTOR APPROACH"" AS APPLIED IN COSTA RICA IS EVALUATED IN THIS THIRD VOLUME OF A FOUR-VOLUME REPORT. THE BASIC PROGRAM CONCEPT AND DESIGN IS LOGICAL AND INTERNALLY CONSISTENT. IT FOCUSES ON PROVIDING ASSISTANCE TO SMALL FARMERS WHO PRODUCE PRIMARILY FOR THE DOMESTIC MARKET. HOWEVER, THE RESULTS MAY FALL CONSIDERABLY SHORT OF EXPECTATIONS. THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND CREDIT PROGRAMS MAY NOT PRODUCE PRODUCTION AND INCOME INCREASES FOR BROAD AREAS OF THE FARM POPULATION. MOREOVER, IT MAY NOT BE POSSIBLE FOR ONE AGENCY TO PLAN AND COORDINATE PROGRAMS EXECUTED BY AGENCIES OVER WHICH IT HAS NO CONTROL. THE CAN, CANCITOS, AND MINISTRY OPERATIONS NEED TO BE REORGANIZED AND INTEGRATED. A CONTINUING PROGRAM OF EVALUATION NEEDS TO BE INITIATED. THE MISSION SHOULD WORK WITH APPROPRIATE MAG OFFICIALS TO DEVELOP A CONTINUING INFORMATION SYSTEM FOR THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR. CURRENT USAID ATTEMPTS TO USE EXISTING PRODUCER ORGANIZATIONS AS AN ADDITIONAL MEANS OF REACHING SMALL FARMERS SHOULD BE ENCOURAGED AND EXPANDED.

"The student loan movement in Latin America is growing steadily in size and influence.  This study reviews A.I.D.'s experience in assisting education credit institutions to assess the strengths and weaknesses of student loan programs and provides comparative information as a basis for future program decisions and project design. In 1964, there were only four national credit institutions in Latin American and the Caribbean.  By 1973, there were 17 such institutions (with total budgets well over $30 million), with plans for two more underway.  The existence of these education credit institutions has stimulated a variety of new sources of education financing, including national government ministries, municipal governments, private businesses, interested individuals, and foreign donors, but has also helped to create acceptance for the idea that students should undertake greater financial responsibility for their own education.  Moreover, these institutions appear to be financing a larger proportion of students in key fields than are represented in the general student body and making it possible for students to finish their training within a shorter period of time.  Education credit institutions are most effective if they administer a wide range of programs and if they are involved as well in manpower planning, vocational and academic guidance, education-related research, job placement, and the development of imaginative proposals for further expansion of educational opportunities and financing. A review of published literature on student loan programs is included, along with a list of the characteristics and problems of representative institutions, an outline of education credit programs in Brazil, and summary tables.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1974 12:00:00 AM","","Educational finance|Financial institutions|Credit|Student loans","Latin America|Brazil|Caribbean|Colombia|Honduras|Dominican Republic","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAD114.pdf","2,488 KB","000108 - USAID.

"THE GOVERNMENT OF COLOMBIA (GOC) HAS REACHED A RELATIVELY ADVANCED STATE OF INSTITUTIONAL CAPACITY TO ATTACK ITS AGRICULTURE PROBLEMS. AID'S ROLE IN THIS PROCESS HAS BEEN SIGNIFICANT. THE SECTOR APPROACH, AS IT HAS BEEN CONCEIVED IN COLOMBIA, HAS RESULTED IN MORE INTEGRATED THINKING ABOUT THE PROBLEMS OF AGRICULTURE AND HAS PROVIDED A BASIS FOR CONSIDERING SIGNIFICANT QUESTIONS ABOUT APPROPRIATE AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT POLICIES FOR COLOMBIA. IN THESE RESPECTS, IT HAS DEMONSTRATED A DISTINCT SUPERIORITY OVER THE RESULTS OBTAINED IN AGRICULTURE UNDER THE PROGRAM LOAN APPROACH. THE ADVANCES TO DATE HAVE NOT YET SUCCEEDED IN OBTAINING NEEDED INCREASES IN OVERALL AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION, PRODUCTIVITY, AND INCOME, ALTHOUGH THE INCOME OF SOME INDIVIDUAL FARMERS HAS INCREASED. A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF WORK HAS BEEN DONE ON A SECTOR ANALYSIS WHICH PROVIDED AN INFORMED BASIS FOR MAKING SOME POLICY DECISIONS, BUT TO DATE, IT HAS NOT RESULTED IN A COMPREHENSIVE, INTEGRATED, AND INTERRELATED SECTOR ANALYSIS WHICH IS ADEQUATE AS A BASIS FOR CHOICES ABOUT STRATEGIES OR SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS.

THE TWO PRIMARY ENDS ARE UTILIZING CREDITS AS A MEANS OF CARRYING OUT A BROAD PROGRAM OF MUNICIPAL REFORM AND IMPROVING THE CAPACITY OF MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENT TO MEET THE NEEDS OF RURAL PEOPLE. THESE ENDS WILL BE MET BY: (1)INTRODUCING A MORE CONSOLIDATED, COORDINATED PROGRAMMING SYSTEM IN IFAM; (2)UTILIZING THE SHARPER FOCUS OF THE PROGRAMMING SYSTEM AS A BASIS FOR EVALUATING CHANGES ATTHE MUNICIPAL LEVEL; AND (3)INSTITUTING EVALUATION AT THE PROJECT LEVEL, FOLLOWED BY SUBSEQUENT STUDIES AS WORKS ARE PUT INTO OPERATION.

"THE PURPOSE OF THE EVALUATION WAS TO DETERMINE WHETHER AN EXTENSION OF THE TERMINAL COMMITMENT AND TERMINAL DISBURSEMENT DATES WAS CONSISTENT WITH THE BASIC OBJECTIVES OF THE LOAN. THE PRINCIPAL OUTCOME OF AN APRIL 1972 EXAMINATION OF THE LOAN WAS TO AMEND THE LOAN AGREEMENT BY MAKING UP TO $1.5 MILLION AVAILABLE FOR LOCAL CURRENCY FINANCING. AFTER THIS, THERE WAS A DRAMATIC UPSWING IN THE UTILIZATION OF THE LOAN. ASTUDY BY PEAT, MARWICK, AND MITCHELL STATES THAT AN ADDITIONAL 15-17 MONTHS WILL BE NEEDED BY THE INSTITUTO SALVADORENO DE FOMENTO INDUSTRIAL (INSAFI) TO COMMIT THE REMAINING LOAN FUNDS AND 21-27 MONTHS TO COMPLETELY DISBURSE THE FUNDS.

"PROGRESS TOWARD JAMAICA'S STATED INTERIM GOAL MUST BE GREATLY ACCELERATED IF THAT GOAL IS TO BE ACHIEVED. UNTIL RECENTLY, THE PROGRAM WAS CONFINED ESSENTIALLY TO A CLINIC-ORIENTED ""FAMILY PLANNING"" APPROACH. WITH THE ADVENT OF THE COMMUNITY HEALTH AIDES, THE CONCEPT OF OUTREACH FUNCTIONARIES BECAME ESTABLISHED, AND FAMILY PLANNING BECAME ONE OF THE FIVE MAJOR TASKS OF THESE MULTIPURPOSE OUTREACH WORKERS. WHILE PROGRAM SUCCESS HAS BEEN LIMITED IN TERMS OF CONTINUING ACCEPTORS AND IMPACT TO DATE ON NATIONAL FERTILITY STATISTICS, THE PROCESS OF INSTITUTION BUILDING BY THE RELEVANT GOVERNMENT, ACADEMIC, AND PRIVATE AGENCIES INVOLVED HAS BEEN ACCOMPANIED BY THE PROGRESSIVE ACQUISITION OF THE POLITICAL, ADMINISTRATIVE, AND TECHNICAL CAPABILITIES REQUIRED IN ORDER THAT SELF-SUFFICIENCY MAY ULTIMATELY BE ATTAINED. IN SPITE OF OBSTACLES, SOME PROGRESS IN BUILDING NATIONAL AWARENESS OF THE PROGRAM HAS ALSO BEEN MADE.

THE GENETIC BASE IS IN PLACE, AND CONTRACT RESEARCH SUGGESTS THAT TEN-TO-TWENTY-FOLD INCREASES IN RANGE FORAGE PRODUCTION CAN BE REAL IZED BY MODIFYING MANAGEMENT PRACTICES. FUTURE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE ON THE ALTIPLANO MUST, HOWEVER, NOT ONLY CONTINUE TO DISCOVER AND EXPLOIT TECHNICAL RELATIONSHIPS, AND MAINTAIN THE GENETIC BASE, BUT ALSO DEAL WITH INSTITUTIONAL CONSTRAINTS. ONLY WITH INSTITUTIONAL CHANGES IN MANAGEMENT CAN THE EXTENSIVE RANGE RESOURCES OF THE ALTIPLANO BE BROUGHT TO THEIR PRODUCTIVE POTENTIALS. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE IN RANGE MANAGEMENT AND SHEEP PRODUCTION AS WELL AS HELP IN DEVELOPING FORMAL ACADEMIC PROGRAMS SHOULD BE GIVEN. IN ADDITION, THE GOVERNMENT OF BOLIVIA SHOULD GIVE HIGH PRIORITY TO INCREASED SUPPORT OF AGRICULTURE PROGRAMMING.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","9/1/1974 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural extension|Animal husbandry|Forage legumes|Agricultural training|Educational materials|Agricultural product marketing|Agricultural research|Forage crops|SHEEP|WOOL|Range management","Bolivia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAA104A1.pdf","1,435 KB","008515 - USAID.

"REPORT ON THE EVALUATION OF AFGRAD AND INTERAF PROGRAMS BY ELDON L. JOHNSON AND CLIFFORD S. LIDDLE, DECEMBER 1974. THE EVALUATORS PROVIDED A BACKGROUND ABOUT THE AFRICAN GRADUATE FELLOWSHIP PROGRAM (AFGRAD) AND THE INTER-AFRICAN UNIVERSITIES SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM (INTERAF) AND ABOUT EFFORTS TO MEET AFRICA'S NEED FOR HIGHLY TRAINED INDIGENOUS PROFESSIONAL MANPOWER. THEY EXAMINED AFRICA'S CHANGING NEEDS FROM THREE PERSPECTIVES: (1) THE FOREIGN ASSISTANCE ACT OF 1973; (2) THE AFRICAN COUNTRIES THEMSELVES; AND (3) FOREIGN ASSISTANCE SPECIALISTS. FROM THESE PERSPECTIVES IT IS CLEAR THAT SUFFICIENT NEED EXISTS FOR CONTINUATION OF AID-FUNDED GRADUATE SCHOLARSHIPS FOR AFRICA THROUGH 1980. THAT NEED IS MOST ACUTE QUALITATIVELY AND IN THE DEVELOPMENTAL FIELDS. THE KIND OF MANPOWER NEED IS CHANGING AND WILL CONTINUE TO CHANGE. FOR ALL COUNTRIES, THE APPROPRIATE STRATEGY FOR DETERMINING COUNTRY-SPECIFIC NEEDS, BOTH IN PRACTICAL TERMS AND IN THE SPIRIT OF THE FOREIGN ASSISTANCE ACT OF 1973, IS RELIANCE ON LOCAL DETERMINATION THROUGH EXISTING OR ESTABLISHED LOCAL MECHANISMS WHICH COMBINE EDUCATIONAL AND PLANNING/DEVELOPMENT REPRESENTATION. IT IS THROUGH SUCH LOCAL DETERMINATION, RATHER THAN SOME PRIOR LISTING, THAT COUNTRY-SPECIFIC NEEDS MUST BE DERIVED. THE EVALUATORS DISCUSSED FOUR POSSIBLE OPTIONS FOR AFGRAD AND INTERAF PROGRAMS: (1) KEEP BOTH PROGRAMS ON THEIR PRESENT GLIDE PATHS OF TERMINATION; (2) KEEP BOTH PROGRAMS AS SEPARATE OPERATIONS AT THE PRESENT INTAKE LEVELS WITH A COMPLETION DATE OF JUNE 1984; (3) WIND DOWN SOME FRACTION OF AFGRAD BY ADDING AN EQUIVALENT GRADUATE COMPONENT TO INTERAF, WITH RETENTION OF THE AFGRAD REMAINDER MORE SPECIFICALLY FOR MONITORED USE IN PREPARATION OF SPECIALIZED TALENT FOR CRITICAL, DEVELOPMENT-RELATED POSITIONS IN AFRICA; AND (4) SHIFT PROGRAMS TO AFRICA AND AFRICAN INSTITUTIONS BY PHASING OUT AFGRAD AND BUILDING UP INTERAF WITH A GRADUATE COMPONENT.","Evaluation period: 1 Jan 1963-1 Dec 1974","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/afr-608","","12/1/1974 12:00:00 AM","","Graduate education|SCHOLARSHIPS|Teacher training|Adult education|Beneficiary count","Africa","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAA581A1.pdf","5,689 KB","001397 - American Council on Education.

"Completion report evaluates the Farm-to-Market Access Road Program in Honduras, 11/25/65 - 9/13/74.  The original loan called for engineering and construction of 600 kms of access roads.  Scope of loan was reduced in 7/71 to cover construction of 4 access roads totaling 113.8 kms and preparation of final engineering plans for 9 subprojects totaling 286 kms.  Revision in scope was made in order to reflect increased construction costs and additional work within subprojects since the original loan authorization. Report is based on USAID staff engineering inspection made in 8/74 to evaluate road maintenance and usage. Construction of the 4 access roads was satisfactorily completed. Nevertheless, since construction, the Highway Maintenance Department has not given proper maintenance to most of the roads.  This is causing deterioration of road surfaces as a result of erosion and slope slides. For instance, an inspection of the Maraita-Yuayape subproject revealed that the sub-base course is washing out and many ruts are forming.  Side ditches are blocked as a result of slides and erosion.  Also, a main bridge structure has not yet been built.  This has limited road use to 4-wheel drive vehicles. On the other hand, the Government of Honduras is making good use of the engineering designs prepared under this loan.  Report estimates that 7 of the 9 proposed subproject designs will be used, and the roads constructed by the end of 1978. The Government is undertaking complementary investment programs for highway construction and improvement in most of the areas of influence of the farm-to-market roads built under the USAID loan. During the next 5 years, the Farm-to-Market Access Road Program will start producing the benefits contemplated when this loan was made.","Evaluation period: 25 Nov 1965-13 Sep 1974","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","9/1/1974 12:00:00 AM","","Road maintenance|Transportation system design|Road construction|Farm to market roads|Roads|Project change","Honduras","","","008563 - USAID.

"Evaluates performance of the agricultural sector analysis and simulation modeling effort jointly undertaken by the Korean National Agricultural Economics Research Institute (NAERI) and Michigan State University (MSU) during the period 6/71 - 2/74.  The objective of the project was to adapt and test the computer simulation model developed previously by MSU in Nigeria. The evaluation is based on interviews with government and MSU officials in Seoul during 1/28/74 - 2/2/74. There is a good possibility that the NAERI/MSU agricultural simulation effort will lead to a significant step forward in Korean Planning capability.  At a minimum, bureau chiefs will have a tool for more easily examining alternative policies. The author questions the quality of the basic data used in constructing the model.  Overly optimistic biases to official data estimates may have been more widespread than anticipated by MSU experts. This calls into question the accuracy of parameters and of model specification. Ambiguities have appeared during the many model runs, each producing slightly different and sometimes contradictory outcomes. Testing of model results, data reliability, and technical assumptions can be facilitated by expanding the forum of technical papers, seminars, etc. Regarding utilization of the model, most potential users have only a vague idea of what the simulation model is all about.  As yet, there is little inclination at higher policy levels to shift to a multisectoral modeling approach.  A major sales promotion effort should be made by Koreans, with consultant and training assistance from foreign donors. Greater confidence in the model itself, however, should precede greater promotion efforts.  Development work on the model should continue for at least another 2 or 3 years with MSU participation. USAID should not attempt a similar effort in other LDC's at this time.  This is because of the high cost involved and because other LDC's have even less reliable and extensive data. Also, a comparative evaluation should be conducted first of the Iowa State effort in Thailand and the modeling work in Mexico by the World Bank.","Evaluation period: 1 Jun 1971-1 Feb 1974","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","2/1/1974 12:00:00 AM","","Simulations|Computers|Technical assistance|Project change|Limited data","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAA478A1.pdf","6,613 KB","008566 - USAID.

"Evaluates USAID assistance to the Royal Thai Govt (RTG) to improve the managerial & operational skills of the Thai Natl Police Dept (TNPD). USAID assist is being terminated in compliance with Sec 112 of the 1973 Foreign Assistance Act.  The eval team examined proj records, interviewed US proj team & RTG officials and visited TNPD installations. Counterinsurgency received primary emphasis, with the majority of assistance provided to the provincial police & the border patrol police. Overall, most proj goals have been met or are on-target.  Shortcomings can be attributed in part to budgetary limitations.  Also, TNPD's capability to deal with smuggling & narcotics traffic was significantly improved. USAID assist began in 1957 & falls into 3 distinct phases.  From 1957 to 1964, USAID provided 124 man-yrs of tech services, partic trng & commodity inputs.  The border patrol's 5900 officers were supplied with radios, vehicles & trng; and a small TNPD air wing was estab.  In 1965-1970, US assist rose sharply with 269 man-yrs of direct hire advisory services, 164 man-yrs of contract personnel, trng for 551 participants & commodities costing $41.9 mil.  The marine police expanded their floating assets from 56 to 174 vessels & both USAID & RTG inputs to the aviation div were sizable. USAID purchased 43 aircraft & RTG procured 39. In addition, RTG constructed a major aviation complex at Don Muang Airport & established 18 field stations. During 1971-74, new policy guidelines were adopted limiting commodity support to police units in areas seriously threatened by insurgency.  200 police districts & 300 village police stations qualified for cont'd assist. The evaluators cite the need for adoption of modern mgmt practices, incentives to improve personnel performance & greater personal contact between senior police officials at all levels & police in the field as principal problems.  Evaluators recommend a variety of changes & improvements in the organizatn & admin operations of TNPD, as well as increasing specialized mgmt trng for its mid & executive level personnel.","Evaluation period: 1 Jan1957-31 Dec1974","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","7/1/1974 12:00:00 AM","","Counterinsurgency|Illicit drug trade|Anticontraband enforcement|Police|Vocational training|Police services|Public administration|Public safety|Training|Limited data","Thailand","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAQ732.pdf","23,036 KB","003222 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to assist the government of Guatemala in developing an effective police force capable of providing internal stability and citizen protection from 8/56 to 9/75.  Evaluation was based on review of pertinent background documents, interviews with ministerial and police officers,and onsite visits to police installations.  A separate telecommunications report is included. Project emphasis was on increasing the operational and managerial capabilities of the government of Guatemala law enforcement agencies. The project made a significant contribution to betterment of law and order conditions at a crucial time.  Improvements included organizational improvement and training of the national police, development of improved methods for controlling illegal entries and contraband, establishment of a records bureau, training in crime analysis, improvement in crime detection methods by upgrading the crime lab and training personnel and improvement in traffic control through safety education, control devices, and training. Recommends continued budgetary support by the government of Guatemala for the new police school, for pay increases.  Equipment procurement, and for implementing civil service coverage or an alternative promotion system.  Recommends that human resource developments include improved administrative proficiency of national and treasury police, 1-year personal service contracts for police recruits, and assignment stability.  Other recommendations include reorganization of operations and control of civil disturbances.  Review of the public safety communications program indicates that the original objectives of upgrading the national and treasury police telecommunications in organization, logistics, and training have been met.

"Evaluates seminar on project management held in Yaounde, Cameroon from 1/21/74 to 3/6/74.  Evaluation was conducted through questionnaires administered at the beginning and at the end of the seminar & through interviews with faculty, staff, sponsors and host govt officials. Questionnaire results indicate that the pedagogy was rather good and appreciated by the participants.  As at the Yaounde seminar I, however, most thought that the seminar had been too heavily weighted on the theoretical side.  Almost all participants thought that the teaching methods had been adapted to the kind of material being presented, and to their own needs.  Participants also felt that the seminar would be of help to them in their training of others in project management. Overall, participant satisfaction concerning the seminar was above average. Several problems were noted, however.  These included inadequate per-diem, inadequate advance notice to participants concerning attendance, logistics and lack of a means of transportation. Participant recommendations for improvement of future seminars include:  1) A truly residential seminar where the participant can be reached by his office; 2) available photo-copy machines; 3) uniform per-diem rates for everyone; 4) per-diem that truly covers expenses; 5) better organized field trips and instructional staff better informed about project being studied in the field; 6) notification of participants at least a month in advance and giving them reading material to prepare them; 7) distributing reading material for theoretical reading so that less class time could be devoted to theory.","Evaluation period: 21 Jan 1974-6 Mar 1974","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","3/1/1974 12:00:00 AM","","Financial management|Seminars|Development project evaluation|Technical training|Management training|Participants|Beneficiary interviews","Cameroon","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAA458A1.pdf","971 KB","000035 - U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)","","","English","application/pdf","Indepth evaluation|Onsite evaluation","","SPERLING, PHILIP","","1 Mar 1974","","","","EVALUATION OF THE YAOUNDE SEMINAR II","","PD-AAA-458-A1","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc1MzQz","Sahel Regional","6250905"
"Evaluates project to develop agricultural exports and marketing in Vietnam from FY72 and FY74.  Evaluation also covers study of forestry and fishery potential under proj# 730017007 -- export expansion. 3 participants are currently studying in the US for MS degrees in Agricultural Marketing. 25 GVN officials participated in the investigation of export opportunities for crops, livestock, and forestry and fishery products in a number of foreign markets.  Forestry products appeared to have the greatest potential. Singapore and Japan were shown as profitable markets for about 16 species of fish and shell fish.  Immediate opportunities existed for the export of manioc starch, monosodium glutamate, papain, vegetables in brine, fruit puree, castor beans, and coffee. Evaluators note the potential for reducing imports through local production and processing of manioc starch, monosodium glutamate, yeast, infant foods, and dairy product substitutes. Exportation of bananas to Japan was investigated, and production was observed in Taiwan and the Philippines.  However, this was not pursued due to security problems in the Vietnam countryside. Concerning domestic marketing, a number of studies were directed at improvement in the handling and storage of rice. Market analyses of sorghum, pork, and edible oils were also undertaken, and seminars and workshops were conducted with private sector and GVN participation. Total exports increased from US $12 million in CY71 to US $24 million in CY72 and US $60 million in CY73.  However, the impact of the project was judged smaller than expected, due to restriction of activities by military hostilities. Project terminated on 6/30/74. Recommendations include the following: 1) tech assist should be provided to food processors in developing export and import substitution products; and 2) quality control and grading should receive more attention. Bibliography and discussion papers are included.","Evaluation period: 1 Jul 1971-30 Jun 1974","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","7/1/1974 12:00:00 AM","","Forest products|Forestry|Fishing industry|Food marketing|FISH|Agricultural production|Agricultural product marketing|Livestock|FOOD PROCESSING|AGRIBUSINESS|Balance of trade|Marketing research|RICE|SORGHUM|Export promotion|Limited data","Vietnam","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAF355A1.pdf","1,543 KB","008623 - USAID.

"Evaluates demographic component of the Korean Agricultural Sector Study (KASS). KASS's models and demographic literature were consulted in conducting the evaluation. KASS's effort to deal with farm and non-farm, rather than rural &amp; urban populations is deemed commendable and plausible, however its first approximtn in sector models is judged technically unsound in demographic theory and needs to incorporate sex, regional breakdowns, aging, survival, birth rates, migratn patterns, and mortality patterns. Evaluator questns KASS's: low estimate of future birth rates due to family planning (FP) efforts and later marriages; failure to distinguish variatns in birth rates in different areas of Korea; and accuracy in calculating population projections obtained by applying the Hathaway model. KASS maintains that FP between 1970 to 1985 will not effect employmt levels during this period despite evidence that fertility and labor force participatn are closely related. KASS has filed to address the problem that migratn level change when agricultural price and developmt policies change. In examining KASS's manual, evaluator questions certain assumptions made, incldg: age/sex distributn of the populatn does not effect consumptn levels; urban and farm sectors ftn independently of each other; urban populatn growth is greatest; and off-farm migratn and wages are not affected by differences between farm labor and supplies. Recommendations include the following: 1. a migration model based on investigation of Korea's various regional areas be developed; 2. KASS improve and/or develop interaction models between: size and composion of populations; size, demographic composition, and income levels; outputs of the public and private economic sectors; 3. findings of Park, Kim, and local researchers be incorporated into KASS's program; 4. a long term consultant be hired to develop a migration model; 5. the labor force question and interaction between farm and non-farm sectors be reexamined, and the effects of education on the labor force be studied; and 6. project be refunded if the above are followed.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/CSD-2975","","3/1/1974 12:00:00 AM","","Economic models|Economic demographic interaction|MIGRATION|FAMILY PLANNING|Demographic research|DEMOGRAPHY|Agriculture|Sector evaluation|Technical assistance|Limited data","Korea R","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAF400E1.pdf","1,024 KB","001427 - U.S. Dept. of Commerce.

"EVALUATES AID'S UNIVERSITY SERVICES AGREEMENTS (USA) WITH JOHN HOPKINS UNIVERSITY, UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN, AND THE UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA FOR THE PERIOD 6/30/71 - 6/30/74. THE USA PROGRAM PROVIDES FUNDS TO MOBILIZE THE UNIVERSITIES' INTERDISCIPLINARY RESOURCES IN THE FIELD OF POPULATION AND FAMILY PLANNING, AND TO USE THESE RESOURCES TO HELP LDC'S DESIGN AND IMPLEMENT SUB-PROJECTS - BOTH THOSE ADDRESSING SPECIFIC PROBLEMS AND THOSE FOR BUILDING INSTITUTIONS. THE THREE UNIVERSITIES ARE MAKING VALUABLE AND SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE ACHIEVEMENT OF AID'S POPULATION/FAMILY PLANNING OBJECTIVES. THE SMALL CORE STAFFS AT THE UNIVERSITIES ARE STIMULATING AND MOBILIZING EFFECTIVELY THE RICH, CAMPUS-WIDE, INTERDISCIPLINARY RESOURCES. SUB-PROJECT QUALITY IS GENERALLY EXCELLENT. AID SHOULD CONTINUE BOTH CORE AND SUB-PROJECT FUNDING TO THE THREE UNIVERSITIES. THE ORIGINAL INTENT OF THE USA FORMAT WAS TO USE THE UNIVERSITIES AS AN EXTENSION OF AID/PHA/POP, THEREBY REDUCING THE PHA/POP WORKLOAD. THIS INTENTION WAS NOT REALIZED TO THE EXTEND IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN. AID AHOULD DELEGATE MORE RESPONSIBILITY TO THE UNIVERSITIES FOR CARRYING OUT SUB-PROJECTS. FOR INSTANCE, THE POPULATION CENTER STAFFS AT EACH OF THE USA UNIVERSITIES ARE NOW CAPABLE OF TAKING OVER RESPONSIBILITY FOR MONITORING SUB-PROJECTS.

"ANALYZES THE ECONOMIC VIABILITY OF PROPOSED FARMER-OWNED AND OPERATED AQUACULTURE ENTERPRISES IN NORTHEAST BRAZIL. THE EVALUATION PRESENTS ESTIMATED FIXED AND VARIABLE COSTS AS WELL AS AN ILLUSTRATIVE PROFIT AND LOSS STATEMENT. FIGURES ARE BASED ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT EACH FARMER WOULD BUILD AND OPERATE A SINGLE, 1-HECTARE POND NEAR AN IRRIGATION LATERAL ON LAND THAT WOULD BE PROVIDED ON A LONG-TERM LEASE OR GRANT ARRANGEMENT. POND AND WATER SYSTEM CONSTRUCTION AS WELL AS NETS AND EQUIPMENT WOULD REQUIRE A DIRECT INVESTMENT OF ABOUT CR$ 17,000 PER HECTARE. THE REPORT ESTIMATES A SUBSTANTIAL OPERATING PROFIT OF CR$ 4,912 PER YEAR. IN ADDITION, THE FARMER WOULD ALSO RECEIVE A SMALL CASH INCOME OF CR$ 312 FOR HIS OWN LABOR,AND HE WOULD BENEFIT FROM A CAPITAL GAIN AVERAGING ALMOST CR$ 800 PER YEAR FROM PAYMENT OF PRINCIPAL ON REAL ESTATE DEBT. CASH INCOME AND CAPITAL GAIN WOULD TOTAL ABOUT CR$ 6,000 PER YEAR. THIS REPRESENTS A PROFOUND IMPACT ON THE FARMER'S EARNING CAPACITY. EXCLUDING LABOR INCOME, THE ENTERPRISE WOULD PRODUCE A TOTAL INCOME OF CR$ 5,709 FROM PROFIT AND CAPITAL GAINS. THIS IS AN ANNUAL RATE OF RETURN OF 34% ON A TOTAL INVESTMENT IN PLANT AND EQUIPMENT OF CR$ 16,855. CONSIDERING THAT THIS VENTURE INVOLVES NO MORE (AND PERHAPS LESS) RISK THAN TERRESTRIAL CROP AGRICULTURE, THIS RATE OF RETURN IS EXTREMELY ATTRACTIVE. ALTHOUGH NO COMPARABLE RATES OF RETURN ARE AVAILABLE FOR TERRESTRIAL CROPS,THEY ARE PROBABLY MUCH LOWER.

"Evaluates contract performance of the Smithsonian Instit's Interdisciplnry Communic Progrm (ICP) in Analysis & Eval of Populatn Policies & Dynamics from 1972 to 1974.  Under the contract, the ICP establshd the Internatnl Progrm for Populatn Analysis (IPPA) to adminstr the scope of work. Of the 20 satisfactory work agreemnts in force, high-level policy-makers from all continents have expressed particulr interest in 18. Future rsrch proposls should be handled with more attention to cross-nationl or comparatve issued such as the impact of family planning progrms on fertility, determinants of fertility in which several key variables are simultaneously treated, administrative variables, & communication & motivation.  While transferral of rsrch findngs to policy makers through the Populatn Dynamics Quarterly (PDQ) & through workshps & conferences is satisfactory, improvmnts such as more intensive concentratn of PDQ on formulatn of populatn policy in LDC's should make the publicatn more relevnt. Conferences & workshps should be led by more highly qualified scholars & professionls.  Rsrch also should be carried out by experts instead of inexperienced young scholars. The 20 work agreemnts were only 2/3 of what had been anticipatd in the contract.  Shortfall occurred because of gradual projct momentum & bureaucratc time lag between receipt of proposl & final signing.  Less time should be spent with unacceptable proposls. PHA/POP must make clear to USAID's that they should review proposls only on grounds of politcl sensitivty & fitness with AID country priorities. Subcontracts should be sent to the AID Contracts Office only when the Smithsonian Contracts Office seeks advice on specifc provisns. A panel with social scientists has been formed to review individl proposls. An Advisory Committee, lacking suffic social scientists, was named 9 months after the start of the contract.  It met at the end of the first & second years of the contract. A brochure with a progrm descriptn will be reissued to inform persons & instits not reached in previous mailings.

"ASSESSES THE WORK PERFORMED BY THE INTERNATIONAL CONFEDERATION OF MIDWIVES (ICM) FROM 1975 TO 1/78 UNDER ITS USAID GRANT TO PROMOTE GREATER UTILIZATION OF MIDWIVES IN LDC FAMILY PLANNING PROGRAMS. THE ASSESSMENT IS BASED ON DISCUSSIONS WITH AID PERSONNEL, INTERVIEWS WITH ICM STAFF, AND REVIEW OF PROJECT DOCUMENTATION. SINCE THE GRANT WAS FIRST AWARDED IN I972 ICM HAS COLLABORATED WITH THE INTERNATIONAL FEDERATION OF OBSTERRICIANS AND GYNECOLOGISTS (FIGO) THROUGH AN ICM/FIGO JOINT STUDY GROUP. THE ICM, WITH THE SUPPORT OF THE JOINT STUDY GROUP, HAS CONTINUED TO INVOLVE LEADING LDC MIDWIVES, PHYSICIANS, AND MINISTRY OF HEALTH OFFICIALS IN PROMOTING MIDWIFE AND TRAINED BIRTH ATTENDANT (TBA) INVOLVEMENT IN FAMILY PLANNING (FP). ICM HAS IMPROVED ITS ABILITY TO PLAN AND CONDUCT WORKING PARTIES AND FOLLOW-UP. POOR RESPONSE TO THE EARLIER WORKING PARTIES IN SOUTH AND CENTRAL AMERICA AND FRANCOPHONE AFRICA IS ATTRIBUTED IN PART TO LACK OF FOLLOW-UP. IN SOME CASES, FREQUENT CHANGES IN TOP MOH PERSONNEL HAVE NEGATED WORKING PARTY ARRANGEMENTS FOR CURRICULUM REVISION AND TRAINING. IN ADDITION TO WORKING PARTIES AND AS A RESULT OF FOLLOW-UP, TWO REGIONAL FP TRAINING SEMINARS HAVE BEEN CONDUCTED BY ICM STAFF. A 3-WEEK SEMINAR ON FAMILY HEALTH TRAINING FOR ANGLOPHONE WEST AFRICAN SENIOR MIDWIVES, TEACHERS, AND SUPERVISORS WAS CONDUCTED IN SIERRA LEONE. A SEMINAR ON INFORMATION, EDUCATION, AND COMMUNICATION FOR MIDWIVES OF NEPAL, SRI LANKA, AND BANGLADESH WAS CONDUCTED IN BANGLADESH.  TWO TBA TRAINER-TRAINING SEMINARS WERE ALSO CONDUCTED, ONE IN BANGLADESH AND THE OTHER IN AFGHANISTAN.

"Evaluates the police telecommunication effort under the direction of USAID Public Safety Division in Nicaragua from 2/71 to 5/74. Data is derived from an in-country review.  After the 1972 Managua earthquake had eliminated what organizational, operational, and equipment capabilities the Managua police had, new radio networks and communication procedures were designed to implement more modern police communication concepts. A communication operations control and dispatch center was formed in the headquarters of the Managua police.  The police and their Traffic Division are now assigned independent frequencies to avoid message congestion.  Both networks are controlled from a common radio communication room for maximum coordination. A new telephone console with switchgear equipment has also been installed at the headquarters. Within the metropolitan area, a maximum of 17 precinct stations are being equipped with base station radios to permit instant situation reports to and from the communications center. Patrol sedans and jeeps are equipped with mobile radios and are assigned patrol routes throughout Managua.  Motorcycle units utilize hand-held portable radios which remain with the officer when away from his motorcycle. An operational plan is in use to coordinate all police radio elements into a smoothly functioning group and to permit the most effective employment of the radio system. Future expansion of police jurisdiction in rural areas should be accompanied by plans to expand radio communication services to assigned police units appart from the National Guard.  Installation of an emergency generator plant for the Police Communication Center should proceed quickly.  A 3-digit phone number for citizen calls to the police should be pursued with phone authorities and a public information program about it should follow. Procedural techniques should be developed to periodically check the location of patrol and traffic cars by the radio operators.  A police candidate should be selected for additional training in the Telecommunication Management Course of the International Police Academy of AID/W.","Evaluation period: 1 Feb 1971-1 May 1974","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","5/1/1974 12:00:00 AM","","Electrical system maintenance|Vocational training|Communication control systems|Communications specialists|Technical training|Telecommunications technology|Communications technology|Police","Nicaragua","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAR596.pdf","422 KB","003222 - USAID.

"EVALUATES PROJECT TO STRENGTHEN AND IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF THE AGRICULTURAL COOPERATIVE MOVEMENT IN THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC (DR). EVALUATION COVERS THE PERIOD 1970-1974. NO METHODOLOGY IS INDICATED. THE PRIMARY LOAN ACTIVITY WAS THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A REVOLVING CREDIT FUND THROUGH WHICH THE ADMINISTERING DR AGENCY, THE INSTITUTE OF DEVELOPMENT AND COOPERATIVE CREDIT (IDECOOP), COULD PROVIDE AGRICULTURAL SUBLOANS TO FARMERS PREVIOUSLY WITHOUT ACCESS TO CREDIT. AS OF 6/18/74, 42 SUBLOANS HAD BEEN APPROVED, EXTENDING CREDIT TO SOME 15,000 FARMERS. THE FUND IS ADEQUATE TO PROVIDE THE NORMAL CREDIT REQUIREMENTS OF AGRICULTURAL COOPERATIVES IN THE DR WITH NO URGENT NEED TO CREATE A SEPARATE BANK FOR COOPERATIVES. IMPLEMENTATION OF THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE, TRAINING, AND SCHOLARSHIP ELEMENTS DESIGNED TO ENABLE THE COOPERATIVES TO BETTER UTILIZE THEIR FINANCIAL RESOURCES, WHILE SUCCESSFUL, HAS OFTEN LAGGED BEHIND SCHEDULE. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO IDECCOP RESULTED IN THE REORGANIZATION AND IMPROVEMENT OF ITS DEPARTMENTS OF CREDIT, COLLECTIONS, AND PROJECT ANALYSIS, AND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A STATISTICAL DEPARTMENT. TRAINING, ALTHOUGH NOT BEGUN UNTIL 1973, HAS PROVED VIABLE AND HAS IMPROVED STEADILY. TWELVE STUDENTS HAVE RECEIVED BS-LEVEL TRAINING IN COOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT, FOUR REGIONAL TRAINING PROGRAMS FOR COOPERATIVE MEMBERS AND MANAGEMENT STAFF PERSONNEL WERE HELD, ONE PROGRAM WAS GIVEN FOR 55 POTENTIAL COOPERATIVE ORGANIZERS, AND SOME 175 EMPLOYEES OF IDECOOP AND AGRICULTURAL COOPERATIVES ARE RECEIVING OR WILL RECEIVE DOMINICAN UNIVERSITY SHORT COURSE TRAINING IN COOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT AND ACCOUNTING. THE GOVERNMENT OF THE DR'S FAILURE TO CONTRIBUTE COUNTERPART FUNDS ON TIME FOR THE FIRST THREE YEARS AND THE SLOWNESS OF IDECOOP IN IMPLEMENTING PROGRAMS AND MAKING ADMINISTRATIVE CHANGES TO EXPEDITE THE SUBLENDING PROCESS HAVE BEEN MAJOR PROBLEM AREAS. HIGHER PRIORITY FOR TRAINING IDECOOP STAFF IS NOW SEEN AS ESSENTIAL FOR FUTURE OPERATIONS.

DURING THE SAME PERIOD, THE NUMBER OF CLIENTS MORE THAN TRIPLED, INCREASING FROM 3,831 TO 12,528; AND THE AMOUNT LOANED NEARLY DOUBLED, RISING FROM 30,650 TO 58,128 CORDOBAS. OF 12,528 SMALL FARMERS FINANCED, 12,008 WERE FINANCED FOR BASIC CROPS. THE PRODUCTIVITY OF BNN-FINANCED FARMERS WAS GREATER THAN THAT OF FARMERS NOT SO FINANCED. UTILIZATION OF LOAN FUNDS WAS GREATLY FACILITATED BY A LOAN AGREEMENT REVISION WHICH REMOVED INHIBITING PROVISIONS OVER WHICH BNN HAD NO CONTROL, E.G., THE LEVEL OF TAX TARGETS. ALL COVENANTS HAVE BEEN MET. IN PARTICULAR, BNN HAS RECEIVED FROM GON CAPITALIZATION FUNDS OF $8,694,000, ROUGHLY THE EQUIVALENT OF THE AMOUNT SPENT BY BNN TO PROCURE AGRO-CHEMICALS ($8,870,000). PERIODIC AND ANNUAL REPORT REQUIREMENTS HAVE BEEN OR WILL BE MET. BNN'S LOAN EVALUATION REPORT, SUBMITTED TO USAID 6/25/74, SATISFIED THE REQUIREMENT OF A FINAL PROJECT REPORT. IN ORDER TO DETERMINE COMPLIANCE WITH THE COVENANT CONTAINED IN SECTION 5.1 OF THE AMENDED LOAN AGREEMENT, IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT BNN CONTINUE TO PROVIDE AID WITH AN ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT; A PLAN FOR EACH CROP YEAR, INCLUDING ESTIMATES BY CROPS FOR AREAS, QUANTITIES OF AGRO-CHEMICALS, CLIENTS, AND AMOUNTS OF CREDIT TO BE MADE AVAILABLE FOR BASIC CROP LOANS; AND AN ANNUAL SUMMARY OF LOANS MADE FOR ELIGIBLE BASIC CROPS AS DEFINED IN LOAN DOCUMENTS. RESIDUAL MONITORING WILL REMAIN THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE RURAL DEVELOPMENT OFFICER.","Loan no. 524-L-022|Evaluation period: Through 11 Nov 1974","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","11/1/1974 12:00:00 AM","","Cereals|Crop production|Agrochemicals|Small farms|Farmers|Agricultural production credit|Beneficiary count|Limited data","Nicaragua","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAG290A1.pdf","210 KB","008584 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to integrate family planning (FP) curriculum into LDC home economics (HE) programs.  This special evaluation covers the period 1/73-12/73 and is based on reports by the implementing agent, the American Home Economics Federation (AHEA). During the past year, AHEA has contacted 2,104 concerned professionals in 47 LDC's. Five field consultations were conducted, including consultations with Indian leaders on future FP activities and discussions with Taiwanese representatives on future surveys and workshops (WS).  As a result of the latter, a conference in Thailand, a follow-up consultation in Liberia, and the surveys noted below were held. All economists contracted during the WS have became active in FP efforts. AHEA also consulted with the Food and Agricultural Organization/International Federation of HE on its ""Planning for Better FP Program"".  Consultations should continue in order to mobilize domestic efforts. In-country FP surveys were held in South Korea, Sierra Leone, and Malaysia and at least 59 agencies were contacted.  These surveys, which should be preceded by field consultations, indicate that the communication network is developing. In-country counterparts should receive FP survey materials in advance to enable them to serve as survey contacts. Five in-country WS's were held.  Two WS's in Taiwan acquainted country leaders with FP materials and prepared them to sponsor their own WS's.  Taiwanese personnel assisted participants. Continuance of this type of training is recommended, as is grouping together countries with similar problems and geography.  India's WS discussed integrating FP and HE programs. Media and curriculum consultants should be sent to these WS's.  WS's in Panama and Turkey were directed at extension agents and teachers.  To date, home economists are advancing FP progams in LDC's. Five institutes, attended by 67 foreign and 20 domestic students, were held in the United States.  Follow-ups on returned trainees are recommended. LDC home economists have generally been more open to AHEA than anticipated.","Evaluation period: 1 Jan1973-30 Dec1973","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/CSD-3623","","4/1/1974 12:00:00 AM","","Institution building|Family planning services|Associations|Delivery systems|Family planning education|FAMILY PLANNING|Educational materials|Household management|Seminars|Participants|Private voluntary organizations|Workshops|Information storage and retrieval systems|Curriculum design|Indigenous education|Limited data","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAA516A1.pdf","787 KB","001398 - Pennsylvania State University","","","English","application/pdf","Indepth evaluation","","RAY, ELIZABETH","","1 Apr 1974","","","","EVALUATION REPORT #2 FOR INTERNATIONAL FAMILY PLANNING PROJECT","","PD-AAA-516-A1","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc3MzEy","Population and Humanitarian Assistance","9320980"
"Evaluates project to strengthen the capability of the International Center for Aquaculture at Auburn University (AU) to provide expertise in all phases of aquaculture.  Special evaluation covers the period 1970-1974 and is based on document review and discussions with AU officials. The project has established AU as the premier institution in the world in the area of warm-water aquaculture.  AU has provided excellent on-campus training and educational opportunities (49 students trained), although funds for Ph.D.-level research by LDC students are lacking. On the other hand, although AU has done everything requested, it has demonstrated little initiative and has had insufficient communication with AID/W, other donors, and other institutions involved in aquaculture.  Moreover, AU, in focusing on fishery production, has made little effort in broader areas (such as the importance of aquaculture to LDC national goals or rural development).  AU has made little use of social science disciplines and and has made only limited efforts to define state-of-the-art aquaculture technology.  In addition, AU's annual reports have not adequately documented the achievement of project objectives. It is recommended that the grant be extended with emphasis on the following areas:  (1) broadening the discipline base AU applies to aquaculture and strengthening AU's total systems competence; (2) expanding AU's capabilities in project and national planning; (3) defining specific training and research outputs; (4) establishing linkages; (5) preparing a comprehensive state-of-the-art examination of potentials, accomplishments, limits, and impediments in LDC aquaculture development, with emphasis on questions concerning the rural poor (e.g., low-input, low-cost, energy-saving technology; income distribution; employment generation; and knowledge transfer techniques) and on interrelated, country-specific, fishery development policies; and (6) developing a complementary relationship with the University of Rhode Island fisheries program.  Finally, recruitment of a full-time fisheries expert is deemed essential. Attached to the document is AU's response.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","10/1/1974 12:00:00 AM","","Universities and colleges|Institution building|Fisheries|Fishing industry|Fishery management|Management training|Technical assistance","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAM602.pdf","1,639 KB","000197 - USAID.
