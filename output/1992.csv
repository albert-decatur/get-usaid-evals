"Evaluates the Population Information Program (PIP), implemented by Johns Hopkins University, which provides up-to-date, comprehensive information on population, family planning (FP), and related health issues in several languages to policymakers, service providers, researchers, and others worldwide.  Interim evaluation covers the period ending 10/91. Interviews with users, data from readership surveys, and user reports confirm that PIP products are highly regarded. ""Population Reports"" and ""International Family Planning Perspectives"", PIP's two major publications, are described as authoritative, valuable, and highly informative; their timely coverage of FP topics is especially appreciated.  Users suggest that the publications, especially ""Population Reports"", include guidance on ways to extend their local use, e.g., for training purposes.  Both publications could have far greater impact if: (1) the budget were increased to allow for wider distribution; (2) they were translated into more languages, such as Arabic, Turkish, Hindi, and some African languages. The POPLINE database has long played a strategic role, and its most recent development, a CD-ROM distributed regularly to 160 sites, has greatly increased and facilitated use of the database. However, the disc is not being properly used at all 160 sites. The sites that are working well have people who have been trained in both the use of information and in CD-ROM technology.  This makes the development of a training manual important.  Also, some users feel that the database underrepresents the experiences of developing countries. The Informed Choice Task Force presented a set of recommendations to USAID and the FP community in a 1989 report, which included criticisms of the lengthy procedures for informed consent in many countries.  To combat this problem, PIP created a slide show for FP associations, service providers, program managers, and policymakers in developing countries. The Population Resources Center, PIP's mechanism for handling requests for information, documents/publications, or online database searches, was given high marks by users but is underused.  Its use should be encouraged. Because the FY 1992 obligation will not be allocated until the project is extended or succeeded in 8/92, $600,000 is needed to fund publication and database activities until that time. Given its comprehensive scope and highly respected character, PIP can serve as an intellectual bedrock for USAID population programs in the 1990's.  To do this, it -- or its successor -- will have to take a more proactive role in three areas: gathering information; improving coordination among cooperating agencies; and gearing activities more closely to USAID's evolving strategy.","Project title: Population technical assistance (POPTECH)","Special Evaluation","Documents","DPE-3024-Z-00-8078-00","","1/1/1992 12:00:00 AM","","Family planning|Population planning|Information and referral services|Information dissemination|Publications|Computer technology|Databases|Family planning research","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABD651.pdf","1,666 KB","006243 - Dual & Associates, Inc.|000673 - International Science and Technology Institute, Inc.

"Evaluates a research project to combat iron deficiency anemia. The evaluation covers the period from the late-1970's to 11/91. The project, which funds three separate programs, has generated many impressive achievements that would not have been possible without USAID support.  (1) The program at the International Center for Control of Nutritional Anemia (ICCNA) at the University of Kansas has been a leader in identifying conditions that enhance iron absorption, developing new systems for delivering biologically available iron via iron supplementation and fortification strategies (of which fortification is the more effective approach).  The use of iron EDTA as an iron source holds considerable promise in bypassing the effect of major absorption inhibitors found in many foods.  ICCNA has also developed methods to evaluate iron status and has trained developing country personnel to monitor and evaluate iron improvement programs. (2) The program at Rutgers University has made notable progress in dealing with the difficult technological problems in the iron fortification of rice without sacrificing color, flavor, texture, and acceptability.  If proven successful, the technology should be applicable to other foods and should benefit from the scientific resources of ICCNA. (3) The International Nutritional Anemia Consultative Group (INACG) at the Nutrition Foundation, Inc. has been effective in heightening professionals' awareness of the iron deficiency problem and in communicating developments in this field through international meetings and scientific reviews.  These programs have involved professionals from developing countries, bilateral and multilateral organizations, NGO's PVO's, and the food industry.  However, their role in influencing policymakers and in advocating fortification programs has been limited. All three programs have involved professionals from developing countries, bilateral and multilateral organizations, NGO's, PVO's, and private food companies. Progress to date strongly warrants continuation of support. Specific recommendations are as follows.  (1) Given the importance of iron deficiency research, USAID should spearhead an international coalition to support such research.  The project needs an advocacy component to reach USAID decisionmakers, in Washington and in the field, to galvanize their support.  (2) USAID should support field trials with a direct impact on the iron deficiency problem, in particular the iron delivery systems developed at ICCNA and the fortification methods developed at Rutgers.  (3) To sustain the project's achievements, all three grantees need to be involved in capacity building at the developing country level.  (4) The Agency should consider fortifying Title II commodities and blends using systems developed at ICCNA, and should seek country-level approval for use of iron EDTA through the Codex Alimentarius Commission in order to facilitate iron fortification in developing countries.","Delivery order no. 3|Project title: Food security and nutrition monitoring (IMPACT)","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-5110-I-00-0070-00","","1/1/1992 12:00:00 AM","","Iron deficiency anemia|Vitamin deficiencies|Nutrition research|Nutritional status|Iron|Assimilation (nutrient)|Research centers|Universities and colleges","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABD636.pdf","405 KB","006994 - Casals and Associates","","006941 - USAID.

"Mid-term evaluation of a project to support collaborative research between Indian and U.S. scientists in contraceptive development and disease-related immunology at 4-6 institutions and to finance scholarships for Indian scientists.  The evaluation covers the period 1988-7/91. The project has experienced major implementation problems which have significantly delayed proposed activities.  Three years after the project launch, collaborative research is just beginning.  Delays have occurred in:  defining the management structure for day-to-day activities; reviewing collaborative research proposals; and executing the participating agency services agreement with the U.S. Office of International Health/National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases. The project still faces problems in defining intellectual property rights, procuring U.S. scientific equipment, and transferring funds to the Government of India. The project secretariat is partly at fault.  It did not systematically implement the instruction of the joint working group or give the project continuous, focused attention at critical points.  The secretariat took a less than active role in promoting the project among the participating Indian institutions and failed to expeditiously address managerial and procedural issues. Despite these problems, the collaborative research projects submitted for funding are conceptually very good and scientifically significant, the researchers involved are qualified and motivated, and the four participating Indian research institutes have good infrastructure and research capabilities.  Six of eleven collaborative research proposals have been approved and funded; seven new collaborative research relationships have been established; eight research fellowships have been awarded; and several scientific publications have been prepared. Five major lessons were learned.  (1) A program that has dual scientific foci complicates the management structure, divides scarce resources, and reduces the prospects of achieving significant results. (2) Project designs should be consistent with the timeframe of the project and the funds available.  (3) When multiple agencies are involved, the roles and responsibilities of each must be clearly defined and systems for communicating and coordinating fully elaborated.  (4) Collaborative research projects require that procedures and timelines for peer review, approval, and funding be defined at the start of the project and strictly followed.  (5) If intellectual property rights issues cannot be resolved, the Mission must refocus projects, perhaps on training scientists or strengthening research institutions.","Cover date incorrectly listed as: February 5, 1991|Companion Evaluation Summary: PD-ABD-687|Project title: Population technical assistance (POPTECH)","Special Evaluation","Documents","DPE-3024-Z-00-8078-00","","2/1/1992 12:00:00 AM","","Research collaboration|Contraceptive research|Disease research|Research centers","India","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABD687.pdf","1,878 KB","006243 - Dual & Associates, Inc.","","006988 - USAID.

"Interim evaluation of a project to help El Salvador's Program for Small and Microenterprises (PROPEMI) increase the number and profitability of small and microenterprises (SME's).  The evaluation covers the period 8/85-11/91 and is based in large part on a survey of 244 PROPEMI loan recipients. The target of creating one new job per loan recipient has been surpassed by 35%.  Earnings have also increased at a much higher rate than anticipated; 82% of those interviewed reported that their earnings had increased and 68% attributed this increase entirely to project loans. PROPEMI's minimum loan is colones 1,000 (vs. 5,000 in most of the established financial system).  This fact, plus several loan eligibility requirements explains why the project has not achieved its targets in terms of capitalization, number of loans, and number of people graduated to the established financial systems.  In fact, 69% of borrowers have received loans of less than colones 10,000.  These small loans take as long to formulate as larger ones, especially as PROPEMI's staff often has to take physical inventories to determine the size of the business. The net percentage of ""graduate"" beneficiaries who received first loans from banks after initially borrowing through PROPEMI is only 2.6%. PROPEMI's training program has reached about 5,000 people.  No other private sector program in El Salvador is as extensive as PROPEMI's administrative training program for SME's, which offers five core courses in accounting, costs, administration, marketing, and sales and investment projects.  As to whether or not trainees retain the information given them, survey results were positive in 49% of cases regarding administration and 66% of cases regarding costs.  In order for the training component to break even, an average of 4.5 courses per week would have to be given with an average enrollment of 15 individuals. Currently, one course a week is offered with an average enrollment of 10 people.  PROPEMI TA basically relates to preparing credit applications, and to credit follow-up or supervision.  Very few survey respondents stated that technical advice had helped increases earnings or employment. During the past 2 years, PROPEMI's income has grown faster than have its costs, about 66% of which are related to salaries and fringe benefits.  The credit component is the only activity that can lead PROPEMI to true self-sustainability, but to achieve sustainability, PROPEMI must attain a portfolio of about colones 75 million.  At present, PROPEMI has colones 36 million available for lending, and about 15 million of these represent its outstanding portfolio.  Delinquency is 12.4%.  It is estimated that PROPEMI has a credit market share similar to FIGAPE (a public sector counterpart institution). A I.D. should continue to support PROPEMI; however, it is first necessary for the directors of FUSADES and PROPEMI's Commission to reconsider PROPEMI's priorities, taking into account the conceptual and operational changes recommended in this report. Future efforts should focus on lending to small enterprises instead of micro-businesses, and training and post-credit TA should be de-emphasized. Several lessons were learned.  (1) A credit demand survey (not a demographic study) designed by senior credit specialists should be carried out at the project design stage.  (2) The selected credit institution should ""match"" the characteristics of the target group.  (3) The type of human resources needed to conduct the credit program should be identified during the design stage, along with the external TA required to upgrade their skills.  (4) In the case of new credit institutions, it is best not to impose too many eligibility rules on loan applicants before the institution has developed its portfolio.  (5) The permanent monitoring of the impact of the project activities should be instituted at the beginning of the implementation stage.","Delivery order no. 38|Companion evaluation summary: PD-ABF-136","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-0085-I-00-9060-00","","2/1/1992 12:00:00 AM","","Private enterprises|Small scale enterprises|Microenterprises|Commercial credit|Business support services|Loan administration|Management training|Income|Employment|Beneficiary count","El Salvador","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABD650.pdf","4,344 KB","000356 - Checchi and Co.

"PACR of a project (1981-1990) to assist the Government of El Salvador in restoring infrastructure destroyed by guerrilla activity. The project provided implementing agencies with the resources to rapidly repair vital public works.  The project also reduced the impact of continuous interruptions of vital public services by guerrilla activity, thus preventing further deterioration in El Salvador's economy.  This gave stability and credibility to the government in its effort to maintain and improve its democratic initiatives. Major accomplishments include the following:  (1) 3,241 transmission lines were repaired; (2) a 22.1 megawatt standby generator plant was installed in San Miguel; (3) 104 bridges were repaired and 41 rapid temporary-bridge replacements were built; (4) emergency generators were put in place to provide standby power for hospitals, water pumping stations, telecommunications, and other essential services; (5) 242 units of heavy construction equipment were provided to the Ministry of Public Works to replace equipment destroyed by guerrillas and permit rapid repair of damaged bridges and highways; (6) 97 repairs were made to locomotives (several were completely rebuilt), as well as 346 repairs to rolling stock; (7) 118 emergency/backup power systems were installed by the telecommunication authority, in addition to repair of the telephone system; and (8) 288 water supply pumping stations were kept functioning, through more than 350 repairs. Even though the project did not include a substantial institutional development component, the use of host country contracting for commodity procurement had a significant impact, since many Salvadoran officials learned and put into practice contracting procedures based on highly competitive rules.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1992 12:00:00 AM","","Economic infrastructure|War damage|Electric power generation equipment|Bridges|Transmission lines|Public works","El Salvador","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABD744.pdf","276 KB","008540 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of two grants to the Interamerican Institute of Human Rights to promote human rights and fair elections in Latin America and the Caribbean.  Activities include training, TA, research, conferences, and information dissemination. The evaluation covers the period 8/86-2/92. The Institute has made great progress since 1988 and is well positioned to respond to the challenges of the 1990's.  The Executive Director and her excellent staff have improved administrative procedures and practices, built a senior management team, and melded projects into a more coherent program.  The Institute now enters its second decade as a human rights organization of enormous moral suasion in both governmental and nongovernmental circles, unsurpassed in its ability to provide highly professional consultant services and in the volume of services it provides and the countries its programs include.  Vital to the Institute's ability to respond to political demands while maintaining impartiality is the diplomacy of the Executive Director and staff. Major organizational changes have been made to integrate the election assistance program into the Institute's structure, consolidate administration and finance under a new director of administration, and create an education unit.  The new structure also reflects the Institute's attempt to balance functional and client needs.  While the reorganization has solidified the program base and started to integrate programs across functions, some additional fine-tuning needs to be done. High demands on staff time have resulted in frequent travel and contribute to the episodic, sometimes frantic, nature of their work. Too often authority is not clearly delegated in the absence of the individual in charge, resulting in a lack of workload coordination and an inability of units to make necessary decisions. At the management level, creation of an Executive Committee and regular meetings with staff in the work units have improved internal communications.  An administrative procedures manual has been prepared and circulated to all staff.  The Institute has also prepared an excellent manual to standardize and communicate personnel policies. Personnel turnover has been very low.  There are few non-Costa Ricans on the staff, but this is in spite of the Institute's effort to recruit foreigners. A modern computer-based accounting system is being installed, and the Institute is also updating its management information system. Although the Institute's financial base still rests almost entirely on grants, it has widely diversified its funding.  The number of donors has increased from 11 in 1987 to 29 today. The Institute has been successful in focusing education activities and linking them to the Institute's vision.  Since 1985, the Institute has trained 1,221 individuals in courses held in 18 countries.  The interdisciplinary course is the most highly valued activity.  The course has been strengthened by adding relevant and focused subject matter, increasing opportunities for informal discussion, and including films. Follow-up continues to be a concern, but a bulletin is being used to maintain a network among graduates. Education is also integral to the election assistance program of the Institute's Center for Electoral Assistance and Promotion (CAPEL). Activities include training for pollwatchers, political party representatives, and other election functionaries; civic education campaigns to motivate participation in elections; and courses and seminars on topics related to elections.  The Institute's NGO Unit organizes specialized conferences, regional seminars, training workshops, courses, and TA assignments. The Institute also established a Women's Program in 1989.  So far, the program has organized courses and workshops and prepared a five-year research and education plan. However, the area of women and human rights still lacks institutionalization and legitimacy in Latin America. The Institute has produced a prolific number of high-quality publications for use in teaching and promoting the legal, judicial, social, and political bases of human rights.  The publications are widely read and have had a strong positive impact on improving the depth and breadth of discussion on human rights issues.","Delivery order no. 8|Project title: Advancing basic education and literacy (ABEL)","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","PDC-5832-I-00-0095-00","","2/1/1992 12:00:00 AM","","Human rights|Elections|Civil and political rights|Civic education","Latin America|Caribbean","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABD757.pdf","4,013 KB","001341 - Creative Associates International, Inc.

"Mid-term evaluation of a cooperative agreement with the Association for Voluntary Surgical Contraception (AVSC) to enable developing country institutions to provide high-quality voluntary surgical contraception (VSC).  The evaluation covers the period 8/88-11/90. In general, AVSC has executed its complex responsibilities quite satisfactorily.  Activities have included projects (146 subagreements in 40 countries and 76 small grants in 24 countries), TA, training courses and workshops, and publications and program materials.  Outputs in terms of service expansion, free and informed choice, medical safety, and program improvement have been achieved on time or ahead of schedule. For example, 14 regional training centers have been established and 134 training courses held, versus respective targets of 10 and 80. AVSC has performed with sensitivity and flexibility.  Although it has definite preferences for certain methods and approaches, it has expanded its scope beyond interval sterilization to include other surgical methods (e.g., Norplant, postpartum sterilization, and IUD insertion). AVSC has shown leadership in quality assurance and counseling, and provides an international model with its focus on free choice. Additionally, AVSC communications with A.I.D./W and Missions are good, and the Association maintains extensive links with other cooperating agencies and multilateral agencies. AVSC needs to make improvements in several areas.  (1) Greater attention could be given to information and education efforts and outreach activities.  (2) Lack of systematic follow-up of participants in training courses makes it impossible to assess the true effect of training activities.  (3) The management information system provides little of value, and there is little systematic effort to utilize evaluation to improve projects or management.  (4) Strategic planning is limited to only a few areas of activity.  (5) AVSC supports a disproportionate share of small projects, which are administratively time-consuming.  (6) Lack of field experience and hands-on technical expertise in the Program Management Division hampers links between headquarters and the field. In the future, AVSC should devote more attention to the private for-profit sector, focus more on sustainability, and increase managerial efficiency by continuing the present trend toward decentralization. Further, as sterilization moves into the contraceptive mainstream in the 1990's, AVSC will not only have to expand its focus from local projects to national programs, but also relax some of its standards of perfection in non-critical areas.  It will also have to replace its current impartiality toward policy issues with a stance of scholarly advocacy of progressive VSC laws and regulations.","Project title: Population technical assistance (POPTECH)","Special Evaluation","Documents","DPE-3024-Z-00-8078-00","","3/1/1992 12:00:00 AM","","Sterilization (birth control)|Family planning services|Contraceptive methods","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABD780.pdf","3,030 KB","006243 - Dual & Associates, Inc.|000673 - International Science and Technology Institute, Inc.

"Final evaluation of a project to provide long- and short-term technical training in the United States to disadvantaged Guatemalans. The evaluation covers the period 1985-2/92. The project was highly successful.  Participants included a significant number of disadvantaged Guatemalans, including women, those with limited education or from rural areas, and indigenous peoples. These individuals, almost all of whom exhibited leadership characteristics, would not have otherwise had the opportunity for technical training and travel to the United States. Both short- and long-term trainees reported that the program has had a significant impact on their lives.  They have higher levels of employment than average, and feel that the training contributed to higher efficiency, satisfaction, and income. Trainees are heavily involved in a wide range of community activities and organizations and report a positive change in their attitudes toward the United States and in their own values and world outlook. Project follow-on activities included investment in community-based development projects and the establishment of a small project fund. Both of these provided resources for returned trainees to work concretely to improve their communities.  An alumni association was also established and enjoyed initial interest.  However, sustainability of the association has been weakened by its dependence on the CLASP I implementing agency, internal dissension, and lack of organizational training. Nonetheless, a reinvigorated association can come about through strong Mission support for the special seminars to be offered by the Experiment in International Living.","V. 2: PD-ABD-832","Special Evaluation","Documents","LAC-0661-C-00-0046-00","","2/1/1992 12:00:00 AM","","Participants|Technical training|Disadvantaged groups|Education for development|Leadership training|Scholarships","Guatemala","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABD831.pdf","3,332 KB","012322 - Aguirre International","","000114 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of a project to strengthen the capacity of the Indonesian National Family Planning Board (BKKBN) to expand the country's family planning (FP) program.  The evaluation covers the period FY83-11/91. Overall, the project was highly successful.  The BKKBN has received international acclaim for its achievements, innovative approaches, and dynamic leadership.  During the 1980's, contraceptive prevalence nearly doubled from 26% to 50%, while the total fertility rate declined from 5.6 children per woman in 1970 to 3.0 children in 1991.  A rapid increase in the share of couples seeking contraceptive services through the private sector offers good evidence of the potential for this market and for the sustainability of the national FP program. In the component to expand village and sub-village level FP services, the project trained field workers and volunteers to distribute information and contraceptives and initiated cost recovery efforts.  By project end, the BKKBN will have over 300,000 field workers and village volunteers in place, with future plans to train up to 10,000 village midwives annually.  On the negative side, failure to collect baseline data made it impossible to measure the project's impact in the low-prevalence subdistricts identified in the Project Paper. The urban component increased private sector participation in FP by initiating a contraceptive social marketing (CSM) program, along with an information and training program for private doctors, midwives, pharmacists, and the general public.  These activities were followed by a mass media advertising campaign for the Blue Circle line of contraceptives, which may now be distributed by private providers. Problems included, inter alia, some decrease in efficiency due to the involvement of more organizations in FP management; inconsistencies between public and private sector promotion of FP; concerns about the feasibility of extending CSM beyond the largest cities; and the potential threat to the profitability of Blue Circle products from the subsidized sale of contraceptives by public providers. To promote voluntary sterilization (VS), the project renovated 380 hospitals and 230 clinics, and trained 386 doctor and paramedical teams, 1,060 counselors, 240 field workers, 2,109 BKKBN and MOH staff, and 148 community leaders.  This component was constrained by the high cost of VS, despite BKKBN subsidies; lack of information about VS on the part of many women; frequent transfers of doctors, resulting in a need for continual training; and limited government funds for quality assurance systems. To improve management capacity, the project provided 130 computers for BKKBN (which previously had only one). headquarters and provincial offices.  Funds were also provided for graduate-level training in the United States and Indonesia, short-term U.S. training. and establishment of an international center for foreign visitors to BKKBN.  The training program succeeded only because of the presence of a full-time U.S. advisor, and plans to expand long-term training with World Bank support may cause BKKBN some management difficulties. The R&D component supported 51 local projects as well as a contraceptive prevalence survey.  The component was hampered by problems with staffing, administration, and coordination, along with poor quality extramural research proposals.  Nor was BKKBN's research focus well-defined.","Project title: Population technical assistance (POPTECH)","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","DPE-3024-Z-00-8078-00","","3/1/1992 12:00:00 AM","","Family planning services|Contraceptive distribution|Family planning education|Family planning promotion programs|Health professional education|Health research|Beneficiary count","Indonesia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABD835.pdf","2,986 KB","006243 - Dual & Associates, Inc.|000673 - International Science and Technology Institute, Inc.

"Evaluates a malaria control program (MCP) in Pakistan.  Interim evaluation covers the period 1982-9/91. The current strategy has been very successful.  Using case detection to target insecticide spraying has reduced insecticide usage and dependency.  Malaria has been contained:  levels in Punjab are very low, and though they are higher than previously recorded in Baluchistan because of neighboring political unrest, cases are not widely distributed.  Although high enough in Northwest Frontier Province and Sindh to cause concern, especially since many cases are falciparum malaria, malaria incidence is not greatly different than when insecticide use was much higher. There are challenges.  Since intensive post-World War II studies of malaria and its mosquito vectors provided the knowledge necessary for effective disease control, many social and environmental changes in Pakistan have rendered current control measures less potent.  New, effective measures for future malaria control operations are dependent on an understanding of how these changes have altered malaria transmission dynamics.  What is necessary now to minimize host-parasite contact. Available human resources and talent were impressive.  If experienced health and malaria staff are organized to collect the necessary data on disease transmission and mosquito species and populations, if more staff are given the necessary training, and if operational research is given sufficient priority and support, malaria foci and the factors that influence transmission can be fully identified and this knowledge employed for its control. Then problems such as the recent findings suggesting that drug resistant forms of falciparum malaria are spreading can be confronted without widespread and expensive drug therapy. Integration of MCP activities into the basic health services is well along; 25% of all blood slides and 60% of all cases now come from health, not malaria, posts.  Microscopy services are becoming more widespread and the area under passive case detection is gradually being expanded. Conditions are not as promising for entomological services and research.  Entomology is currently one of the least effectively organized elements in the MCP.  Information about current vectors and the extent of insecticide resistance are inadequate; in particular, issues such as the importance of Anopheles stephensi as a vector, adequate information on anopheline breeding sites and densities, and evidence linking vectors and malaria outbreaks receive much less attention than needed. Microscopist training and training of spraymen in safe handling of insecticides has been emphasized recently, but a shortage of funds for trainee travel and per diem remains a constraint to more widespread and effective training programs.  There are some encouraging developments in the operational research program at the National Institute of Malaria Research and Training, but that institution continues to be handicapped by a shortage of scientific staff. Major conclusions are as follows.  (1) Gains in malaria control can be sustained but external assistance must be continued.  (2) Districts are a critical operational level.  District health officers must be better indoctrinated on malaria.  District and subdistrict disease surveillance and reporting and entomological monitoring must be strengthened.  (3) Training and operational research deserve much higher priority in the future.

"Mid-term evaluation of a project to establish foundations in Alexandria and Cairo, Egypt, to provide credit, training, and TA to small and microenterprises.  The evaluation covers the period 9/88-1/92. Both foundations are now in solid financial positions.  The Alexandria Businessmen's Association (ABA) has developed into a strong microenterprise lending institution after 2 years of lending.  It has a solid capital base and has reached operational self-sufficiency. Portfolio quality is excellent, and the organization has experienced no loan losses.  ABA's credit delivery system is efficient, with over 6,000 loans disbursed. Preliminary results indicate that ABA borrowers have experienced increases of 10% in permanent employment, 35% in temporary employment, and 86% in production.  The ABA's progress is partly due to a dedicated Board of Directors, which includes many prominent business people, and a competent Director.  The final 9 months of TA will enable ABA to finish computerizing its accounting and financial functions, assume the financial management responsibilities required of a large credit organization, and establish at least two branch offices. Although start-up of the Cairo foundation, called Egyptian Small Enterprise Development Foundation (ESED), was delayed, a new Executive Director hired in 4/91 has accelerated progress.  After only 1 year of lending, ESED has achieved nearly 50% operational self-sufficiency.  The portfolio has suffered from some delinquency problems, partly because of poor legal follow-up to loans made during the initial months.  Legal follow-up has improved recently, as has the effectiveness of extension officers at preventing delinquency.  The portfolio quality appears to be improving, and a planned staff incentive system should increase the productivity and efficiency of the lending process. The foundations' success is partly due to several features of the project design.  (1) The collateral fund is held in dollars, which protects against devaluation.  (2) Portfolio funds are obtained from local banks to whom the foundations pay commercial interest rates.  This has instilled financial discipline and given the foundations an incentive for charging realistic interest rates.  (3) As USAID/E covers the operating costs of the foundations, their interest revenues are deposited in their accounts with the local banks, thereby reducing interest payments and contributing to self-capitalization. Although a two-to-one leverage of the collateral fund by the end of the project was anticipated in the design, this appears unlikely; uncertainty within the financial sector makes the possibility of future leverage impossible to predict. Lessons learned include the following.  (1) While manufacturing may have the greatest potential for direct employment generation, the foundations should also consider lending to commerce and services as a means of increasing borrower concentration and decreasing portfolio risk through diversification.  (2) As new foundations are initiated, the possibility of coordinating ongoing TA through an association or network should be investigated, as should the feasibility of working through private foundations instead of banks.  (3) The percentage of women borrowers could be increased through lending for services, trade activities, and nonformal enterprises.","Project title: Growth and equity through microenterprise investment|(GEMINI)","Special Evaluation","Documents","DHR-5448-Q-40-9081-00|DHR-5448-Q-00-9081-00","","3/1/1992 12:00:00 AM","","Small scale enterprises|Microenterprises|Business support services|Credit|Loan administration|Financial institutions|Institution building","Egypt","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABD879.pdf","2,665 KB","006076 - ACCION International|006727 - Development Alternatives, Inc.

"Mid-term evaluation of a component of the Small Business II project to strengthen the capacity of Asesores para el Desarrollo (ASEPADE), a PVO, to provide credit and other assistance to micro- and small-scale enterprises in Honduras. The evaluation covers the period 1988-2/92. Although ASEPADE has nearly met targets in loans made and jobs created, the institution's management deficiencies have impeded the development of the organizational structure and human resources needed to fulfill its obligations.  There is no real separation of power between the Board and management, and authority is exercised in a highly personalized manner.  Efforts to professionalize management through the appointment of qualified top management have failed, owing to the leadership's reluctance to permit independent decisionmaking.  Financial and administrative procedures, while established on paper, are not carried out in practice.  Follow-up and collection procedures have also been poor.  As a result, portfolio performance is substandard, with loan delinquency rates exceeding 60% in one region (Choluteca) and probably in excess of 40% in total. Training programs have concentrated on administrative procedures rather than production and have been of limited effectiveness. With considerable difficulty, the project has installed a computerized management information system that can identify problems in the portfolio, but the system is rarely used.  TA, although well designed, has been of limited impact, since ASEPADE directors are unwilling to accept necessary changes. As of 6/91, funds to ASEPADE have been suspended.  It is recommended that no more funds be disbursed unless ASEPADE shows conclusive willingness to modify its organizational setup and practices.","Project title: Growth and equity through microenterprise investment|(GEMINI)","Special Evaluation","Documents","DHR-5448-Q-35-9081-00|DHR-5448-Q-00-9081-00","","2/1/1992 12:00:00 AM","","Financial institutions|Loan administration|Credit|Small scale enterprises|Microenterprises|Management operations|Institution building","Honduras","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABD880.pdf","1,531 KB","006727 - Development Alternatives, Inc.

"Mid-term evaluation of a project component to strengthen the capacity of Honduran PVO's to support small and micro businesses. The component is implemented by the National Industrialist Association/Small and Micro Enterprise Program (ANDI/PYME). The evaluation covers the period 1988-2/92. The institutional capacity of the Honduran PVO's was far lower at the onset of the project than anticipated.  Most had only rudimentary financial, administrative, and credit policies.  As a result, PYME has had to concentrate its efforts on fewer institutions than was planned. Although considerable progress has been made, the number of PVO's attaining financial self- sufficiency by the end of the project will be far below target. In addition, PVO boards of directors have resisted the establishment of effective credit policies.  There is little understanding of the benefits of market interest rates and effective collection practices.  Efforts to influence PVO policies in this area have been hindered by the project's failure to link the PYME program with sources of credit. PYME has functioned well with regard to technical and administrative matters, including management information systems. Training has been beneficial for both the PVO staffs and beneficiaries.  However, more emphasis should be placed on product-related TA for beneficiaries, and training for PVO staff could be improved.  TA to PYME from the Project Technical Unit has been both effective and essential.  This assistance continues to be needed. At the current rate of expenditure, $2 million will be left over at the end of the project.  Thus, it is recommended that PYME hire new staff members, shorten the approval process for PVO subprojects, and consider establishing a second-tier credit facility to channel credit funds to eligible PVO's. ANDI/PYME's prospects for financial self-sufficiency are nonexistent without any extraordinary new source of funding.","Companion evaluation summary: PD-ABG-172|Project title: Growth and equity through microenterprise investment|(GEMINI)","Special Evaluation","Documents","DHR-5448-Q-35-9081-00|DHR-5448-Q-00-9081-00","","2/1/1992 12:00:00 AM","","Small scale enterprises|Business support services|Credit|Private voluntary organizations|Institution building","Honduras","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABD881.pdf","1,891 KB","006727 - Development Alternatives, Inc.

"Final evaluation of a project to reduce water- and sanitation- related diseases in Benin by providing health education and constructing wells, latrines, and cisterns. The evaluation covers the period 1978-6/91. Project initiation was delayed for years, with the actual duration of project activities being only about 3.5 years. In the end, the project achieved all of its quantitative targets, and surpassed expectations in several instances. Achievements were largely due to the quality and high level of commitment of all involved. The project created or reactivated over 500 socio-health committees in 312 villages; installed 309 handpumps; drilled 417 boreholes; and constructed 109 public and 261 family latrines. As a result of these efforts, the annual incidence rate of guinea worm infection dropped by over 30%. The handpump maintenance system, which relies on village funds, village watchmen, trained artisan repairmen, and spare parts supplied through private entrepreneurs, appears to be functioning well. Most project villages quickly collected the initial minimum funds required and established an account as a precondition to the drilling of a borehole and installation of a handpump. Health messages were clear and understood by villagers to the extent that they could repeat and explain them. Some were being put into practice. The eventual application of all these messages can be assessed only over a longer period of time. The project's openness to the integration of other approaches and activities, such as adult literacy, strengthened the community development component.","WASH task no. 268|Evaluation summary: PD-ABH-178","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","DPE-5973-Z-00-8081-00","","3/1/1992 12:00:00 AM","","Water sanitation|Toilet facilities|Pumps|Small bore drilled wells|Community participation|Health education|Dracunculiasis","Benin","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABD903.pdf","2,486 KB","000333 - Camp Dresser and McKee, Inc.

"PACR of a project (8/87-5/91) to assist in the construction of on-farm irrigation systems and to provide training and credit for small farmers in Quimiag, Ecuador. Despite initial difficulties (see last paragraph, below), project objectives were widely accepted by the target beneficiaries and construction work was completed.  The primary irrigation system was installed and an indigenous technician was trained to operate and maintain it.  Small farmers participated in the construction of the secondary irrigation system, and 56 modules of the tertiary irrigation system were installed in the Quimiag area. The project achieved great participation in agricultural promotion through community meetings, observation trips, and the establishment of user boards (for irrigation and soil conservation).  A major training effort was undertaken to increase the technical know-how of farmers and technicians. Farmers are now working closely with agricultural technicians and have made significant progress in growing labor-intensive crops (i.e., vegetables and fruit).  The production of new crops, such as carrots, beets, and garlic have improved the local diet and provided additional income for farmers who sell their goods at local markets. Soil conservation activities were also widely accepted.  Through community participation it was possible to incorporate into the production process land that had been left out as unproductive. Credit totalling 19.5 million sucres was provided for agriculture, livestock, and irrigation. The project initially achieved poor results due to a lack of commitment by community groups.  Farmers were manipulated by local politicians and needed to be convinced of the potential benefits of TA and irrigation.  Some of the problems faced should have been anticipated during the project design phase. lessons learned are as follows.  (1) The responsible public entity should be committed to long-term support. (2) The various implementing agencies must be well coordinated.  (3) An environment assessment should be conducted before supporting this type of project.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","3/1/1992 12:00:00 AM","","Irrigation system construction|On farm water management|Farmer participation","Ecuador","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABD920.pdf","93 KB","008538 - USAID.

"Evaluates activities conducted by the International Executive Service Corps (IESC) under USAID/M's Private Sector Export Promotion Project. The evaluation, which is based in part on a survey of IESC clients, covers the period 7/86-9/91. Overall, one cannot draw a positive conclusion about the effectiveness of IESC's Volunteer Executive (VE) program.  One hundred American VE's have worked with a large number of Moroccan industrial producers and exporters over the past 5 years.  There are a few outstanding success stories, some with large and direct benefits to the firm, and indirect benefits to the economy, but overall impact is neither evident nor statistically verifiable. One reason for the less than optimum impact is that IESC management did not exercise adequate controls to resolve individual problems as they arose.  Lack of continuity due to the turnover of six IESC country directors in the 5-year period has had negative effects.  These problems have been compounded by USAID/M's efforts to exert excessive management control, resulting in a loss of confidence by each party in the other. Lack of official organizational status for IESC has not been a major factor, but it has added to costs and caused inconvenience. More positively, the IESC Trade and Investment Service (TIS), which began operations in 1989, has been among the most effective private sector export promotion efforts on record.  TIS can document 22 exporters who have been assisted in obtaining firm, valid export orders to the United States in the aggregate amount of $6,558,333.  The Moroccan producers see the TIS's most important contribution as the contacts and referrals provided to U.S. importers and brokers, and the credibility they derived from association with TIS. TIS clients do not see TIS as having played a major role in their investment decisions, but the observed reality is that TIS has indeed generated new investment by its clients, and seems to be close to achieving two joint ventures.  The exports generated by TIS are also reaching backwards to positively affect other segments of the Moroccan economy. TIS is performing the services and covering costs that are characteristic of ""entry costs"" in penetrating new markets.  Once a sufficiently large flow of product has been established, TIS assistance will no longer be needed.  It is not clear that client fees would serve any useful purpose.  Moreover, it could expose IESC and USAID to claims for damages from dissatisfied Moroccan clients.

"Presents final evaluation of a 1987-92 grant to the African Wildlife Foundation (AWF) to support wildlife management training at the College of African Wildlife Management (CAWM), Mweka, Tanzania. AWF met or exceeded targets in all four areas of the grant and proved itself a model of transparency in implementing and reporting on grant activities.  Specific achievements were as follows.  (1) AWF supported 14 scholarship students at CAWM during the grant period, vs. a target of 10.  These included certificate, diploma, and post-graduate candidates from Uganda, Ethiopia, Tanzania, Botswana, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, and Zambia. All students were satisfied with the level of scholarship support, judge their training to be appropriate and effective, and feel that AWF has treated them in a professional manner. AWF purchased over 200 texts for the CAWM library, as well as countless reprints of journal articles and other documents. However, the library still needs a qualified librarian to oversee operations and determine how the library may best serve the needs of faculty and students now and in the future. AWF provided CAWM the full range of teaching aids and field equipment called for in the grant -- binoculars, cameras, videos, a photocopy machine, slide synchronizer, camping gear, mapping equipment, etc.  This did not solve all of CAWM's equipment needs, however, and the problem is compounded by rough and careless handling of equipment by the students themselves and still further by the lack of a reliable nearby repair service. This problem admits no easy solution, especially in light of CAWM's increasing enrollment.  In any case, responsibility for keeping field equipment in working order devolves on CAWM authorities alone and not on AWF or any other donor. Finally, an AWF consultant designed a ""Man and Wildlife"" course as the newest addition to the CAWM curriculum.  Students are satisfied with the course, although efforts to keep it up to date suffered a setback in early 1991 as a result of the departure of the Peace Corps volunteer charged with its revision.","Attached to PD-ABD-948","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","3/1/1992 12:00:00 AM","","Natural resource management|Wildlife resources|Environmental education|Universities and colleges","Africa south of Sahara","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDABD948A.pdf","329 KB","000026 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to ensure an adequate supply of contraceptives and family planning (FP) services through Ghana's Ministry of Health (MOH) and through development of the Ghana Contraceptive Social Marketing Program (GSMP) in the private sector. Final evaluation covers the period 9/85-3/92. The project has faced difficult problems, yet its efforts in two areas -- training, and strengthening the GSMP -- have been outstanding. The breadth of training accomplishments, both in Ghana and abroad, have provided FP and communications skills to personnel numbering in the thousands:  170 persons were trained in short courses abroad, while in-country training has been provided to, among others, 2,949 traditional birth attendants, 238 private sector midwives and 435 public sector midwives, 20 physicians and 50 interns (in minilaparotomy), 50 private physicians (in IUD insertion), 689 personnel (in logistics and information management), and 5,154 Level B health service providers (in IEC and FP). Achievements related to the GSMP have included:  3,500 retail outlets for barrier methods and orals; sales increases of 29% between 1988 and 1990; and development of a market research program. Good progress was also made in expanding FP delivery through the public sector.  Services are now available at 584 MOH clinics (up from 87 in 1987), and a public sector IEC campaign has provided excellent materials to health professionals and consumers alike. And yet the project is far from meeting its goals for increased contraceptive prevalence.  A number of factors have contributed to this outcome, including the lack of strong budgetary or personnel support from the Government of Ghana (in fact, there are no full-time professionals assigned FP responsibilities at MOH central, regional, or district levels); conflict between GSMP's social objectives and its profitmaking nature; problems with product delivery in the private sector; limited USAID staffing; failure on the part of both U.S. and Ghanaian parties with respect to procurement and port clearance of contraceptives as well as MOH problems with inventory and supply; regulatory restrictions on oral contraceptives; and the need for systematic evaluation of the training received by Level B personnel. The project teaches several lessons.  (1) Social marketing programs must realistically appraise the practical commercial objectives of the cooperating private sector enterprise.  (2) An effective national FP program requires government commitment that goes beyond policy statements.  (3) The need for local cost financing must be clearly recognized.  (4) FP programs should intensify their efforts in  the areas of greatest population density.  (5) There can be no quality FP services without a full and constant supply of contraceptives.","Companion Evaluation Summary: PD-ABF-152|Project title: Population technical assistance (POPTECH)","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","DPE-3024-Z-00-8078-00","","5/1/1992 12:00:00 AM","","Family planning services|Paramedical education|Social marketing|Contraceptive distribution|Commercial retail sale of contraceptives","Ghana","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABE002.pdf","3,609 KB","006243 - Dual & Associates, Inc.|000673 - International Science and Technology Institute, Inc.

"Evaluation of reproductive health training provided to health professionals in Brazil by the Johns Hopkins Program for International Education in Reproductive Health (JHPIEGO) under four separate projects. The evaluation covers the period 1979- 9/91. JHPIEGO's training of more than 5,000 physicians, medical and nursing students, and community health workers over a 12-year period stands as a major accomplishment.  Highlights include the following.  (1) In-service training at Centro de Pesquisas de Assistencia Integrada a Mulher e a Crianca (CPAIMC), a private family planning provider, made voluntary surgical contraception services available for the first time in Brazil through a private institution, extended services to poorer areas of the country, created clinical sites to use as training laboratories, and introduced the concept that women should have access to all methods in institutional settings.  (2) In-service training at BEMFAM, the local International Planned Parenthood affiliate, increased and improved the quality of family planning services provided by physicians and community health workers.  JHPIEGO's work also contributed notably to meeting the needs of the country's poorer areas (the Northeast) and integrating family planning into maternal/child health services.  (3) Pre-service training resulted in three university-affiliated training centers having curricula that include reproductive health. One area of need not addressed to date has been the training of non-medical staff (social workers, psychologists, etc.).  Also, despite its efforts to broaden its image, JHPIEGO remains closely associated with sterilization. JHPIEGO has consistently provided solid administrative support to its projects in Brazil, but due to the small size of JHPIEGO's U.S. headquarters staff, technical support in such areas as curriculum development and clinical backup during training has not always been adequate.  Also, JHPIEGO has not developed strong ties with professional medical groups in Brazil, nor has it done as good a job as it might have in cultivating its ties with its own alumni. A new project under negotiation would mark a significant shift in JHPIEGO assistance, since it is designed solely to train public sector personnel.  This is in response to the phasing out of A.I.D. assistance to nongovernmental organizations (including assistance to CPAIMC, which risked its own public image by doing pioneering work in sterilization as a result of JHPIEGO training), the development of a new Ministry of Health women's health care program, and JHPIEGO's new emphasis on institutionalization in the public sector.  The new project also responds to a considerable need in Brazil, where family planning services are provided almost exclusively by the private sector.","Project title: Population technical assistance (POPTECH)","Special Evaluation","Documents","DPE-3024-Z-00-8078-00","","5/1/1992 12:00:00 AM","","Family planning services|Health professional education|Physician education|Nurses|Community health workers|Reproductive health|Beneficiary count","Brazil","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABE003.pdf","1,367 KB","006243 - Dual & Associates, Inc.|000673 - International Science and Technology Institute, Inc.

"Interim evaluation of a commodity import program (CIP) to promote food and agriculture policy reform in Mozambique.  Complementary TA is also provided.  The evaluation covers the period FY89- 12/91. The Government of Mozambique (GOM) has met virtually all policy reform targets.  The program is well-conceived and has realistic policy objectives.  However, the inclusion of petroleum in the policy agenda and in CIP eligibility, while in response to a GOM request under special circumstances, diluted the focus on the agricultural sector. Agricultural price policy reforms have been successful in eliminating the fixed price system, and removing the illegality of selling above the GOM price.  The new floor price system serves the function of a reference price rather than as a true government price support.  There is evidence that producers have responded positively to the price incentives, although the removal of price restrictions on inputs and consumer goods has meant that overall producer terms of trade may have worsened in the short run. USAID/M has correctly emphasized the need for more rapid divestiture of state farms.  Divestitures so far have not reflected the application of a coherent plan or process, and transfer of land ownership to the private sector is still not allowed.  The current GOM priority appears to be to reduce the budget drain caused by state farms, rather than to increase productivity by putting land in the hands of private producers. Private sector growth has been stimulated by allowing private agents to import all agricultural commodities procured through the CIP. Progress has also been made in deregulating commercial transactions to strengthen private marketing channels. The program has been successful in supporting the introduction and use of the secondary market for foreign exchange and has played a useful role in assessing alternative market-based allocation mechanisms. USAID/M is to be commended for adhering to market-based principles in the pricing and allocation of foreign exchange and for being suitably cautious in not joining the System for the Non-Administrative Allocation of Foreign Exchange. TA activities have evolved from monitoring to capacity building and policy implementation support.  TA now in place through resident specialists, short-term support, research, and training is already making an important contribution, for example, by providing market information that has been useful in improving policy decisions. However, the GOM is an unequal partner, lacking the quantitative and qualitative policy and technical capacity to develop its own strategy. The full impact of program reforms will only be felt over the long term.  In addition to the ongoing civil war, numerous other obstacles impede the recovery and development of Mozambique's agricultural production and marketing systems.  USAID/M should continue to support the monitoring of prices and other factors that influence agricultural production and marketing.  USAID/M should also develop a new non-project assistance program that concentrates on implementing the policy decisions of the present program.","Companion evaluation summary: XD-ABF-056-A","Special Evaluation","Documents","DAN-4084-Z-00-8034-00","","3/1/1992 12:00:00 AM","","Nonproject assistance|Agricultural policy|Policy reform|Commodity import programs","Mozambique","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABE009.pdf","2,581 KB","006381 - Abt Associates, Inc.","","008580 - USAID.

"Since its inception in 1984, the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) project has become the pre-eminent source of comparative demographic information for the developing world.  Under the second five-year phase of the project, DHS-II (1988-1993), which is evaluated in this report, major achievements include the following.  (1) DHS-II has become highly efficient in implementing and processing surveys in a wide range of developing country contexts.  (2) It has set new standards for turnaround time, with a preliminary report appearing within 3 months of fieldwork and a final report within 12 months, making possible completion of a survey in 2 years from initial contacts.  (3) It has been very responsive to data requests from both academic and program users, and has managed to satisfy a range of data-using constituencies in areas of questionnaire content, basic tabulation and reporting plans, and distribution of data files. (4) It has had great success in dealing with implementing agencies in the participating countries, in some cases smoothing long-standing inter-agency quarrels.  The program has also been successful in negotiating data release agreements with host countries. DHS data are being used widely.  The United Nations and the World Bank population projection activities use DHS data both to provide estimates of fertility in the late 1980's and to provide estimates of child mortality.  Publications of comparative world indicators, such as The United Nations Children's Fund's ""State of the World's Children,"" the UN's ""Social Indicators,"" and the World Bank's ""World Development Report,"" include data from DHS in basic tabulations.  The data are also being used extensively for more analytical purposes.  For instance, the National Academy of Sciences' Panel on Population Dynamics of Sub-Saharan Africa is making extensive use of DHS data for analyses of fertility and child mortality.  The DHS World Conference in 8/91 attracted over 200 papers describing analyses using DHS data. The data have also been used for program purposes.  For example, the Zimbabwe data, particularly the community module, were used to show that the coverage of the community-based distribution program was far greater than supposed, a finding with far-reaching implications for project design.  In Indonesia, data from the 1987 DHS were used as a yardstick to calibrate the existing service statistics, and the data from DHS-II in Indonesia are being used to evaluate regional program performance. The breadth and depth of use of DHS data are impressive and are still increasing. A consequence of the highly efficient and increasingly standardized procedures of DHS has been some lack of flexibility shown in completion of non-standard tasks, such as in-depth surveys or analytical programs.

"A.I.D.'s child survival program in Haiti, which includes efforts in Expanded Program of Immunization, diarrheal disease control, family planning, and nutrition and breastfeeding, has had a positive impact on the health of children and has helped reduce overall rates of infant and child mortality.  The infant mortality rate has dropped from 144 per 1,000 live births in the early 1970's to roughly 100 per 1,000 live births in the late-1980's.  In some areas where A.I.D. funding is concentrated, such as the Cite Soleil slum in Port-au-Prince, infant mortality rate declines have been especially dramatic.  These improvements have occurred despite zero or negative economic growth, a decaying public sector infrastructure, and social and political instability and decline, and are therefore attributable to efforts in health education and promotion, and increased access to primary health care, with a particular focus on outreach and child survival interventions.  Some of A.I.D.'s notable contributions include the following:  (1) support of public and private policy formulation that established child survival as a health priority; (2) development of a new outreach approach to health service delivery that has expanded access to care, particularly in rural areas; (3) financial support of an array of PVO's that now provide health services to roughly 30% of the population; (4) fostering of a partnership between public and nonprofit health sectors; (5) establishment and support of a core of indigenous organizations that provide research, training, and technical assistance to the health sector; and (6) human resource development training for health care providers and managers within the public and private sectors.

"Interim evaluation of 23 projects (many of them still ongoing) funded in FY90 to support the transition to democracy in Poland, the Czech and Slovak Federated Republic, and Hungary. Many of the projects in the program, which was excellently administered by the National Endowment for Democracy, were critical to the immediate process of transition from communist, authoritarian states to democratic systems.  The vast majority had a positive impact and no major problems occurred.  Some of the most successful activities were those surrounding the first democratic elections.  This support took the form of equipment necessary for campaigns and elections, election observation teams, and support for nonpartisan ""get out the vote"" campaigns. Although these programs could have been more effective if funding had arrived earlier, they were nonetheless well targeted and very helpful according to recipients. Various types of training programs were also very effective. Principal among these was the Foundation in Support of Local Democracy in Poland (sponsored by Rutgers University) which trains local government officials and support staff in their responsibilities in a democratic society and in the administration of local programs.  Union training programs, funded either directly through the Free Trade Union Institute or in conjunction with the American Federation of Teachers, were cost-effective and of substantive value in promoting democracy. For example, an organizing/recruitment campaign undertaken by Hungary's democratic union federation contributed to a rise in membership from 55,000 in early 1990 to 250,000 in mid-1991. Among the less effective projects, the most common problems were poor project monitoring, poor targeting, and objectives that were set too low in relation with funding levels. Future projects should focus on ethnic and minority issues, civic education, the creation of civic organizations, and improving the central bureaucracy.  In Hungary and the Czech and Slovak Federated Republic, programs that instruct local government officials in their democratic functions are needed.  A.I.D. also needs to determine whether support should be provided to ex- or post-communist political parties, voluntary organizations, and trade unions and whether assistance should be provided for projects that are more economic than political, e.g., those of the Center for International Private Enterprise.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-0085-I-00-9061-00","","2/1/1992 12:00:00 AM","","Democracy|Government reform|Political development|Political systems in transition","Poland|Czech Republic|Slovakia|Hungary","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABE122.pdf","7,393 KB","000223 - Academy for Educational Development, Inc.

"PACR of a project (1987-1992) to assist the Dominican Republic's State Sugar Council (CEA) in planning and implementing a sugar diversification program.  The CEA's Agro-Industrial Operations Division (DACEA) implemented the project. The project faced enormous problems from the beginning and was constrained by a lack of cooperation from the Government of the Dominican Republic (GODR).  First of all, it was delayed more than two and a half years because DACEA did not meet conditions related to financial management and controls.  TA was also delayed, with the senior resident advisor arriving about 16 months after the project start-up. Then, two Presidential decrees were issued which significantly undercut project goals. The first called for the expropriation of certain lands that had been leased by CEA to private investors.  These lands were then divided up and turned over the campesinos.  The second decree called for a review to determine appropriate compensation for the private leaseholders.  To date, however, most leaseholders have received no compensation. In light of the GODR's lack of commitment to privatization of sugar production, the project was terminated in 3/91. Of the project target of six CEA sugar mills to be closed, only two were shut down.  However, at these two sites, free trade zones were developed which generated employment opportunities for displaced workers and other previously unemployed or underemployed people.  Otherwise, there was little progress towards project objectives. Two major lessons include the following.  (1) The location of DACEA within the CEA created a conflict of interest, since the diversification process which DACEA was to carry out would have eventually led to the reduction of CEA personnel and management authority.  (2) Despite local sugar shortages, the project rationale for continued diversification into other crops is still valid.  The local shortages are not from lack of available supplies, but rather due to contraband shipments to Haiti, profit-taking by middlemen, and hoarding of low-priced sugar by major industrial users.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","5/1/1992 12:00:00 AM","","Sugar|Privatization|Agricultural diversification|Crop pricing|Land expropriation|Peasants","Dominican Republic","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABE128.pdf","1,463 KB","008537 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (6/83-12/91) to provide scholarships in agriculture to Dominican Republic students. The project provided participant training in the United States and Mexico to 105 professionals -- 10 more than the original target -- from 11 Dominican institutions, including universities and various public agencies and research organizations.  Sixteen trainees received Ph.D.'s, 89 received M.S.'s, and 5 did not complete their degrees.  Returned participants are being employed by agricultural organizations and universities, where they are applying newly acquired knowledge and skills.  These returnees have generally been promoted to higher paid positions in both the public and private sector.  Their influence on training and education has elevated the level of debate over agricultural policy reform and their influence on technology generation has been utilized by the increasing number of nontraditional agricultural export firms.  However, returned participants were unable to fulfill the project target to establish M.S. programs in agriculture at Dominican universities, due in part to lack of funds for equipment and reference materials. Virtually all of the participants expressed satisfaction with the technical and academic content of the program, as well as with the knowledge gained from personal and cultural exchanges.  The project made a special effort to include women and met the 20% female enrollment requirement.  Women were provided the same salary as male trainees, which allowed them to keep their dependents with them during the training. One negative aspect of the project was that implementing agencies lacked a clear understanding and definition of their responsibilities. For example, it was unclear as to which agency was responsible for follow-up and monitoring of participants, so specialized TA had to be brought in to fulfill this role after project completion. Key lessons included the following.  (1) A system for the organization of returned trainees, such as an alumni association, is necessary to maintain program continuity and instill a sense of Dominican ownership.  (2) Trainees should be encouraged to join international professional societies.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","5/1/1992 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural education|Participants|Institution building|Beneficiary count","Dominican Republic","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABE129.pdf","208 KB","008537 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (7/84-10/91) to strengthen the capacity of the Dominican Republic's National Council of Agriculture (CNA) formulate sound, coherent agricultural sector policies. The project established an Agricultural Policy Analysis Committee within the CNA with three public sector members and four private sector members.  Beyond this, however, the project was unsuccessful.  A major constraining factor was the 1986 change of government.  Whereas the CNA had considerable authority under the previous administration, it became far less influential as the new government assigned the task of agricultural policy analysis to other organizations and private consultants. Other problems include the following.  (1) Inflation and the low government salaries for economists made it extremely difficult to attract and retain well-qualified personnel.  (2) Neither USAID/DR nor TA personnel had a direct role in the ongoing management and administration of activities.  (3) The project lacked an institutional base on which to provide policy follow-up and long-term support.  (4) The CNA's analytical unit lacked the ability to carry out the planned 50-70 high-quality policy studies.  Instead of limiting the number of studies conducted, the unit tried to meet the target with poor-quality studies of dubious importance. Several key lessons were learned.  (1) Determine which public entity has the primary authority and best ability to set agricultural policies. (2) Involve well-qualified economists who have the capacity for substantive policy research.  (3) Identify individuals (usually within universities) who are trained and experienced in agricultural policy analysis.  Place more emphasis on the individuals than on particular universities.  (4) Assess and secure several modes of financial support. (The project was unsuccessful in this area.)  (5) Balance the agricultural policy research agenda with intersectoral as well as sectoral policy issues.  (6) Perform policy studies and provide short-term TA in response to needs perceived by local policymakers.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","5/1/1992 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural policy|Policy analysis|Policy reform|Institution building","Dominican Republic","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABE130.pdf","732 KB","008537 - USAID.

"The Hillside Agriculture Project (HAP) in Jamaica officially started in 2/87 with a life-of-project of seven years.  USAID obligations are authorized up to $10 million.  Technical assistance and physical inputs for tree crops are provided to farmers in the Rio Cobre and Rio Minho watersheds through subprojects funded and supported by a central Project Management Unit. HAP has introduced technical packages which typically include farm planning, fertilizers, increased plant density, improved plant stock, pest and shade management and weed control, as well as low-cost soil conservation techniques.  The aftermath of Hurricane Gilbert in 9/88 reoriented the project towards rehabilitation of trees and away from the planting of new seedlings.  Cocoa and coffee figure as the two most important crops in the project, with fruit, timber, and coconut enterprises playing a lesser role. The impact of HAP on both productivity and production is clearly positive.  Pre-project productivity levels of participating farmers were on the order of 8-12 boxes per acre for coffee and 6-12 boxes for cocoa, well below national average yields of about 50 boxes per acre for both coffee and cocoa.  Taking 50 boxes as reasonable estimate of yields after HAP assistance, participating farmers should realize increases of 300-400% for these two crops. As of 12/91, some 4,444 farmers have received benefits from 13 subprojects.  Data on farm and non-farm income, input costs, and demographic characteristics are sparse.  Nevertheless, by using available information and ""best guess"" estimates, a 14% increase in income is a reasonable expectation for the average farm family. Up to the end of 1991, cocoa planting for all subprojects was 517 acres, cocoa resuscitation 1,949 acres, coffee planting 163 acres, and coffee resuscitation 232 acres.  The net present value of incremental production forthcoming from these activities is estimated at Ja$24.2 million, evaluated in constant, 1990/91 Jamaican dollars.  This is a crude estimate of the contribution of HAP to the Jamaican economy; it also is a very tentative estimate because of the previously mentioned lack of good data and because of ongoing changes in the macro economy. The project areas were chosen because they are composed of hilly, easily erodible terrain and because degradation of these lands due to agricultural practices is readily apparent.  HAP has promoted both ""engineering"" and ""agronomic"" measures to reduce degradation of the environment in the targeted watersheds. Participating farmers have adopted these practices, resulting in a positive environmental impact. HAP has focused its data collection efforts on agronomic variables. Information on farmers and farm characteristics is sketchy.  Physical and biological measures used to reduce soil erosion, and the measures used to manage and reduce pesticide use are the most meaningful environmental indicators; data on these measures could be extracted from administrative files or collected in sample surveys.  All these types of data could be organized and entered in a management information system (MIS) for easy access, analysis, and reporting.  Development of the MIS began as early as 1988, but has lagged badly.  Consequently, the wealth of data already collected by the various subprojects cannot be effectively analyzed without an inordinate expenditure of time on the part of the analyst.

"Evaluates the Institutional Development Support Grant Program (ISGP) to strengthen food assistance programming on the part of PVO's that administer Food for Peace Title II projects as cooperating sponsors (CS's).  The ISGP was developed by the Bureau for Food and Humanitarian Assistance to replace and consolidate predecessor Outreach and Development Grants.  During the period FY89-FY91, some $20 million was granted to the following CS's:  CARE, Food for the Hungry International, Catholic Relief Services, Adventist Development Relief Associations, Save the Children Federation, and World Share.  A coordinating Food Assistance Management (FAM) project was also funded. The program is succeeding.  ISGP has contributed substantially to the expansion and improved use of food in the development programs of CS's. CS's believe the most important ISGP contribution has been to fill gaps in their funding of food assistance activities, while A.I.D. believes ISGP's most significant contributions have been improvements in the design and institutionalization of developmental food aid by CS's. However, specific impacts are difficult to attribute solely to ISGP funding because ISGP funds usually have been blended with funds from other sources, especially at the field level; nor have PVO monitoring and evaluation efforts been very specific.  The ISGP's most significant weakness has been the lack of a detailed prior assessment of the problems it is to help solve.  Also, the grants to some CS's were larger than they were able to absorb. ISGP financial support will be needed indefinitely to enable CS's to maximize the efficiency and development impact of their food assistance and to support CS innovation.  Several specific recommendations are made.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-0085-I-00-9089-00","","6/1/1992 12:00:00 AM","","Institution building|Food for Peace Title II|Private voluntary organizations","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNABL278.pdf","3,239 KB","006434 - Devres, Inc.","","007028 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of a 1987-92 project to increase the incomes of producers of vegetables, vanilla beans, fish, and handicrafts in Tonga through improved marketing and exporting of their products. The project achieved its overall objective.  For example, due to the market power of the project-supported Friendly Island Marketing Cooperative (FIMCO), vanilla bean producers received an average of $4 more per kg for their beans in 1987; it is estimated that since 1986 they have realized an additional $2 million in income due to the increased competition for yellow tip beans generated by FIMCO's marketing activities.  Also, for the first time, in 1991, FIMCO's fish sales in Tonga were profitable. All growth indicators for FIMCO are positive.  Since 1986, FIMCO has increased its share of vanilla exports from 5% to 70%, business volume has increased over sevenfold, membership has increased from 164 to 1,880 and total member equity has nearly doubled to $605,000, member services have increased (vegetable marketing and some farm supplies have been added), management capability has improved, and FIMCO has gained acceptance by the business and government (it no longer has difficulty getting marketing loans from the Tonga Development Bank). The sustainability outlook for FIMCO is also positive.  Based on a 12/31/91 financial statement, all operations except vegetables, are profitable, with net profits from 1986 to 1991 averaging $82,000 a year. Efficiency, in terms of operating cost, is satisfactory, with expenses amounting to 23.5% for the 6-year period.  In surpassing the government-owned Tonga Commodities Board to become the leading exporter of vanilla beans in Tonga, FIMCO has demonstrated the advantages of private enterprises over government-operated businesses; it is also increasing its market power in vegetable exports. A brief assessment of the Tonga Cooperative Federation shows that it continues to be highly successful; it is now the largest wholesale grocer in Tonga, doing over 75% of the total business. USAID's management of the project has been excellent, facilitating and supporting the project while allowing the Agricultural Cooperative Development International (ACDI) some flexibility in the implementation process.  The project has been highly cost-effective; the $972,000 in assistance provided by USAID has produced considerable returns.  The project has good replicability prospects in the South Pacific region, and possibly in Madagascar, the world's largest vanilla producer. To protect its investment, USAID should continue to monitor FIMCO's performance after the 4/92 PACD; it is recommended that USAID and FIMCO discuss arrangements for additional short-term TA, possibly through ACDI.  Also included are recommendations for future directions for FIMCO in terms of products, training, and management.","Title supplied by cataloger|Attached to PD-ABE-158","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","6/1/1992 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural income|Income generation|Agricultural cooperatives|Agricultural product marketing|Vanilla","Tonga","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDABE158A.pdf","4,304 KB","007215 - USAID.

"For over two decades, developing countries and donor organizations have made substantial investments in vocational education and training. This study identifies lessons learned from these efforts, based on a literature review and an examination of more than 50 USAID projects conducted from 1973 to 1989. Of these projects, 24 were selected for intensive review, and 2 (in Honduras and Jamaica) for case studies. Following an introduction, Chapter II outlines issues surrounding investment in vocational training, while Chapter III compares various formal and nonformal training alternatives and examines the training needs of small and medium-sized employers. Chapter IV looks at the organizational and operational requirements of vocational training projects, focusing on management issues, instructional staff, and instructional resources. Chapter V evaluates funding options: general public revenues, payroll taxes, user fees, and student loans. A summary chapter offers recommendations for investing in vocational training, with emphasis on the Latin American and Caribbean, and guidelines for strengthening project design. References, project descriptions, and the case studies are appended.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","LAC-0032-C-00-9036-00","","1/1/1992 12:00:00 AM","","Vocational training|Formal education|Nonformal education","Latin America|Caribbean|Honduras|Jamaica","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNABL294.pdf","7,052 KB","000709 - Juarez and Associates, Inc.|003970 - Management Systems International, Inc.

"In general, too little attention is given to the design of participant training programs.  This study identifies design and implementation measures to increase the contributions that trainees can make to economic and social development over the course of their careers.  Two general types of training programs are discussed and compared.  The first is the standard participant training program, in which individuals are selected and trained to meet specific human resource needs in an institution or country.  The second is leadership training, which is exemplified by the Caribbean and Latin American Scholarship Program (CLASP).  CLASP is distinctive in that it selects participants who are socially and economically disadvantaged, while also meeting the human resource needs of the economy and because all training is conducted in the United States to promote understanding of a pluralistic society and market economy.  The report is organized according to the different stages in the program and project cycle -- program context, project design, implementation, and evaluation.  A final section reviews topics of special concern, such as USAID management issues, women in development, and CLASP.  The study concludes that while many of the lessons relating to participant training are well known, they are not consistently applied by Missions.  In general, participant training is designed and implemented on a project by project basis rather than viewed within the larger context of Mission policy and standards.  Moreover, the management structure of the Missions inhibits the development of program-level, cross-sectoral approaches to human resource development.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","LAC-0032-C-00-9036-00","","1/1/1992 12:00:00 AM","","Participants|Participant program administration|Education for development|Development project design","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNABL295.pdf","3,956 KB","000709 - Juarez and Associates, Inc.|003970 - Management Systems International, Inc.

"During March-May 1992, a mid-term evaluation was conducted of the Agriculture and Rural Development Technical Services project (LAC TECH). LAC TECH is a regional service activity that provides technical experts from private and public sources to USAID missions throughout Latin America and the Caribbean.  In addition, LAC TECH augments the technical capabilities of LAC/DR/RD direct-hire staff by providing long-term expertise in eight selected fields involving agriculture and natural resources management.  The evaluation covers the period 8/88-5/92. The project is meeting its objectives.  Services provided under the project have significantly improved the ability of both field missions and LAC/DR to carry out substantive, technically sound programs in the agriculture and forestry/natural resources management area.  It has also enabled LAC/DR to be responsive to external requests for technical studies. Responses to interviews and questionnaires given to USAID staff in Washington, missions, and field posts were overwhelmingly positive in their assessment of project services.  The principal reasons given for the success of the project are:  a talented group of technical advisors; easy access to services; timeliness and responsiveness; and the fact that the cost of services is borne primarily by the project and not by the missions. LAC/DR/RD's management of the project has been good.  An internal review of project management conducted late last year identified several areas for improvement, and progress is being made in implementing those changes. To date, the LAC TECH team has carried out more than 80 TDY assignments for USAIDs, as well as numerous assignments for LAC/DR/RD. Assignments have involved both technically specific subjects (e.g., agriculture quarantine inspection) and issues of broad program direction (e.g., consideration of Title III assistance).  Specific outputs included a concept paper on policy analysis for private agricultural development projects, a synthesis of agricultural research, extension, and education in the LAC region, agribusiness marketing studies, and a natural resources management strategy. A broader issue, highlighting the need for a LAC TECH type response, is the continued erosion of technical agricultural capacity in Washington and the field.  If the LAC Bureau hopes to continue to develop and implement technical programs in the manner it has, some critical level of technical expertise in USAID/W is necessary.  LAC TECH can help provide that capacity, but adequate DH staff are necessary to backstop such a program and provide it with substantive direction. The evaluation team strongly recommends a follow-on project to maintain the level and quality of services that LAC TECH has demonstrated to be so critically necessary.  In the simplest of terms, if LAC TECH did not already exist, it would have to be invented.  This mid-term evaluation considers LAC TECH to be an invaluable activity for the LAC Bureau in particular, but also for USAID more generally.  LAC TECH has thus far successfully stayed abreast of the reorientation of LAC mission programs toward a changing economic and political environment.

"Evaluates a project to establish community-based, self-sufficient tree nurseries in Northern Ghana.  The project, called the Collaborative Community Forestry Initiative (CCFI), is implemented by the Adventist Development Relief Agency (ADRA) in cooperation with the Peace Corps and the Government of Ghana. Interim evaluation covers the period 1988-4/92. Accomplishments have been quite impressive; although only in its third year, the project has established 11 community nurseries, which produced almost 700,000 seedlings in 1990.  Each site successfully outplanted seedlings, with high survival rates -- sometimes topping 90%. Demand for species varied with location, but fruit and nut trees were consistently popular, as was teak, while in some areas, neem was the preferred species. The collaborative aspect of the project is one of its greatest strengths, as it provides the project management with a system of checks and balances.  Particularly noteworthy was the dedication of participating groups, communities, and individuals. However, some persons interviewed expressed a concern that the quality of collaboration had decreased over the last two years.  As the annual review workshop is an excellent forum for fostering improved collaboration, it should be continued, and timed to allow incoming Peace Corps volunteers to attend.  Also, the CCFI Community Committees should be reconstituted. Findings concerning project management were somewhat contradictory, but the general feeling was that it had improved in the two months prior to this evaluation.  Most complaints concerned financial management, which was described as unpredictable; this may be due in large part to the fact that funding comes through a variety of different channels.  At one point, interruption in the disbursement of funds brought the project to the brink of disaster, and Peace Corps volunteers had to use their personal money to pay workers.  It is recommended that the project develop its own separate budget and budget process against which all project expenses are charged, and that an assistant for the Coordinator should be hired to keep records and an accounting for individual project sites.  In general, the concept and the management of the food aid program was viewed positively. The following are identified as priority issues:  training, sale of forest tree seedlings, cash generation, compensation for CCFI Community Communities, appointment of nursery managers, information dissemination, budget preparation, traditional versus pilot approach, and selection of seedling species and future sites.","Cover title: A shared vision : evaluation of the CCFI project for|Northern Ghana","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","4/1/1992 12:00:00 AM","","Agroforestry|Nurseries|Trees|Seedlings|Community participation","Ghana","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABE164.pdf","5,942 KB","000408 - U.S. Dept. of Agriculture.

"Since 1983, A.I.D. has provided support valued at $53 million to a broad range of family planning programs in Kenya.  These programs have now begun to succeed.  The country's population growth rate has fallen from a high of 3.8% in 1979 to about 3.6% in 1990, the fertility rate has dropped from about 8 children per woman to about 6.5, and contraceptive use -- the most important factor in recent fertility decline -- has almost quadrupled.  The programs have also helped reduce maternal and infant mortality by reducing the incidence of high-risk pregnancies and births, and have had economic benefits, in that smaller families are better able to afford to feed, clothe, shelter, and educate their children.  According to this evaluation, A.I.D. played a major role in the above achievements, providing support for fertility surveys, family planning training for health workers, community-based family planning, employer-based family planning services, voluntary surgical contraception, and improved management of contraceptive logistic and of nongovernmental organizations.  Of special importance have been the presence of strong A.I.D. technical staff and the willingness of A.I.D. to take on logistic and institutional development tasks.  Finally, by using central as well as bilateral funding mechanisms, the A.I.D. Mission was able to tailor technical assistance directly to local needs.","Summary highlights: PN-ABG-005","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","6/1/1992 12:00:00 AM","","Family planning promotion programs|Domestic government programs|Contraceptive prevalence|Population growth","Kenya","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAX257.pdf","64 KB","006917 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of a project (5/88-6/92) to help the Government of Morocco (GOM) to control the desert locust invasion. The project succeeded in protecting Moroccan crops and livestock from desert locusts without serious harm to human health or the environment. Some 4.8 million ha were treated against locust adults and hoppers, using aerial and ground methods, in three campaigns.  The GOM's aerial spraying capacity was significantly enhanced, especially through USAID-provided DC-7's.  Also, although not fully tested due to the cessation of locust invasions, a functional, comprehensive national organization was developed with more than adequate capacity to deploy personnel and equipment quickly to repel locust swarms.  The project has thus left the GOM well positioned with respect to locust surveys and treatment (although some technical adjustments in pesticide and equipment use are suggested).  Moreover, USAID made significant contributions to human safety through the provision of protective clothing, cholinesterase test kits, and training in testing. Important lessons include the following.  (1) Successful monitoring and control of desert locusts requires a regional approach and cooperation among all concerned countries. Currently, the GOM is cooperating with Mauritania in surveying locust breeding zones.  (2) The national organization that was developed specifically for locust control proved functional and could serve as a model for similar programs.  (3) With regard to the procurement of pesticides for similar programs, and given the potential harmful impact of unused pesticide stocks, as well the costs of their storage and disposal, quantities should be ordered on an as needed basis, and the procurement of surplus or emergency stock should be avoided.  A detailed pesticide management plan must be a part of any future projects in which pesticides are provided.  (4) Although spraying with large aircraft is sometimes considered as posing too great a risk to the environment and human health, given their much larger treatment capacity, the use of large aircraft in large unpopulated and non-agricultural areas is effective and should be considered for future operations.  (5) The provision of cholinesterase kits and training in their use should become integral components of future desert locust control programs. (6) Accurate per ha cost of the locust control campaign is very difficult to calculate, $19-$20 per ha being a rough estimate.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","3/1/1992 12:00:00 AM","","Pest control|Locusts|Safety|Pesticide spraying|Institution building","Morocco","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABE180.pdf","3,340 KB","001690 - Development Assistance Corp.","","008579 - USAID.

"Evaluates a project implemented by the International Executive Service Corps (IESC) to provide TA and support services to small and medium-size Guatemalan enterprises (SME's).  Mid-term evaluation covers the period 12/90-5/92. Despite weaknesses in marketing its services in Guatemala and in providing follow-up, IESC appears to be meeting key project objectives. It has completed 59 of 100 TA assignments for smaller firms, and 46 of 50 for medium-size firms, and has also provided TA to some 40 larger firms without USAID subsidy.  It has delivered one more than its required 26 research and information reports -- American Business Linkage Enterprise (ABLE) and Quick Business Information (QBI) reports -- and others are in the pipeline.  It claims to have created 3,000 of the targeted 4,500 jobs, and to have generated investments far in excess of the $450,000 life-of-project objective.  It has carried out 4 of 6 volunteer executive (VE) sector surveys, generated $68,000 in verified exports, and conducted workshops and seminars.  IESC does not keep records of the amount of U.S. equipment purchased by its clients. IESC's recent survey found that of the 71 companies responding, 41 had increased their profits, by an average of 10%; 35 had increased production, by an average of 24%; 37 had improved sales, by an average of 15%; 44 (80% of target) had improved product quality, by an average of 13%; and 25 had increased wages, by an average of 17%.  Of the 149 TA agreements, 36% were in rural areas, and 18% were with enterprises owned or managed by women -- probably an underestimate, since projects that are both rural and women owned or managed are reported in the computer only as rural. On the negative side, the market access program -- finding U.S. joint or co-venture partners for Guatemalan businesses -- is seriously deficient.  Although IESC cited nine successes in its recent presentation to USAID/G, in only one case can the success of a venture definitely be attributed at least in part to the program; the degree to which the others have been successful is attributable to a variety of factors, such as extensive VE efforts, work conducted in association with other organizations, or the fact that the projects are still in the long-term experimental stage.  Also, membership in CIGUA, the venture capital club organized by IESC, has fallen from over 100 to about 15, and IESC is re-examining the viability of the concept. A reduction of $864,000 in project funding by IESC's home office in Connecticut has created financial strains within IESC/Guatemala, leading it to increase the fees it charges to clients.  The situation may further result in IESC focusing its services on the larger companies that need them the least.  It may also constrain team-building and adoption of a more aggressive marketing approach.","Project title: Implementing policy change (IPC)","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-5451-I-00-1026-00","","6/1/1992 12:00:00 AM","","Business enterprises|Small scale enterprises|Medium scale enterprises|Investment promotion|Business support services|Beneficiary count","Guatemala","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABE198.pdf","4,170 KB","001335 - Chemonics International Consulting Div.","","008550 - USAID.

"Evaluates a project to improve wastewater collection and treatment systems on the West Bank of Cairo, Egypt.  The interim evaluation, which covers the period 9/84-9/91, was delayed nearly a year due to the Gulf War. The project is moving ahead in an appropriate manner.  Design and construction was found to be of high quality, and while delays have been encountered, implementation has been good overall, especially given the magnitude and complexity of the program. While significant problems and constraints were identified, these issues were in large measure already being addressed by the responsible agencies. As of 9/91, construction of West Bank facilities was approximately 70% complete, and construction of all major facilities except the Western Desert Sludge Disposal Facility should be completed by the 9/94 PACD.  The Zenein Treatment Plant was completed in 1990 and is now operating at its full capacity of 330,000 cubic meters daily (cmd), with excess flows (estimated at 400,000 cmd) being bypassed after receiving only preliminary treatment.  The Zenein plant and completed screw pump stations are currently under maintenance contracts with U.S. firms. Construction of major collectors for the West Bank system, as well as of many minor collectors and relief sewers, has also been completed. Due to the unavailability of treatment and effluent disposal facilities on the East Bank, the East Bank relief system has not been put into operation and raw sewage is being diverted to the Zenein Treatment Plant, at an estimated rate of 292,000 cmd. This situation is expected to continue until early 1993. Although the completion of the new Abu Rawash facility will greatly increase sewage treatment capacity, the expansion of the collection systems and urbanization and population growth in the areas it will serve will necessitate full utilization of capacity by 1995, within 2 years of the date of full operation.  This issue, and others, are addressed in recommendations.","Delivery order no. 12|Companion evaluation summary: PD-ABF-506","Special Evaluation","Documents","ANE-0249-I-00-9022-00","","1/1/1992 12:00:00 AM","","Sewage systems|Sewage system construction|Sewage system maintenance|Sewage treatment|Wastewater","Egypt","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABE200.pdf","5,409 KB","007233 - ASCG Inc.|000555 - Harza Engineering Co.|003327 - Ahmed Abdel-Warith Consulting Engineers","","008539 - USAID.

"Interim evaluation of a project component to upgrade the Egyptian Customs Authority (ECA).  The component has been implemented through a PASA with the U.S. Customs Service (USCS).  The evaluation covers the period 3/90-3/92. The component had a slow start which undermined relations with ECA. Delays were due to difficulties in securing accommodations for the two-person USCS team, as well as to problems in meeting A.I.D. procurement requirements.  To make matters worse, USCS undertook two minor initiatives meant to be confidence-building activities but which proved to be failures.  The Alexandria Filing Project was handicapped by procurement problems that reduced the value of the product, and the Export Documentation Project had a lack of response.  The ECA became increasingly impatient and requested a new implementing agency, while the Ministry of Finance subsequently requested project termination. USCS, on the other hand, was frustrated by the ECA's failure to respond positively to recommendations.  If implemented, these recommendations could benefit both Egypt and the international trading community.  They would probably form the basis of the approach of any TA team, and would enable ECA to move toward a risk-based system of customs control.  However, ECA has not shown full commitment to implementing the recommendations.  The ECA has also tended to give inaccurate or partial information. Difficulty in obtaining passes to wharves, for example, has been particularly vexatious. After some negotiation, the ECA agreed to proceed with the project with a revised focus that accords more fully with the economic liberalization underway.  However, it is recommended that a new implementing agency be engaged, since the current one has lost ECA's confidence.","Companion evaluation summary: PD-ABF-495","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-0095-I-32-9097-00","","3/1/1992 12:00:00 AM","","Customs operations|International trade|Consultants|Host country cooperation","Egypt","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABE204.pdf","675 KB","006727 - Development Alternatives, Inc.

"Final external evaluation of a 1983-92 project to strengthen India's agricultural research system. The overall goal of the project -- to increase agricultural productivity, production, employment, and income -- was too ambitious. However, the project was certainly successful in achieving its purpose, to strengthen the capacity of the Indian agricultural research system in selected key areas, through its investments in 8 subprojects and 7 preprojects.  Particularly impressive were:  (1) training of Indian scientists; (2) inputs of U.S. consultants; (3) procurement and installation of modern equipment; and (4) Government of India (GOI) contributions of staff, land, and facilities. Tremendous strides were made in training and updating Indian scientists in the various agricultural fields associated with subprojects.  Altogether, more than 300 scientists spent from 2 weeks to 18 months in the United States, for a total of 1,600 person-months of specialized training, research experience, and interaction with scientists in their areas of interest. U.S. consultants added invaluable expertise to the project; 51 of them provided 115 person-months of consultation, training, and direct contact with their Indian colleagues. Essentially all of the equipment purchases and installations that were planned under the subprojects were carried out.  State-of- the-art laboratory and field equipment from the United States has given Indian scientists the capability to conduct agricultural research at the cutting edge of their specialties. The research results and possible commercialization of any developed products varied greatly among programs.  The Forestry Faculty Training (FTT) subproject trained a record number of scientists to establish forestry research and education capabilities at 14 agricultural universities.  The Soybean Processing and Utilization, Post-Harvest Technology, Blood Protista, and Conversion of Biodegradable Animal Wastes subprojects hold considerable commercial potential.  Although the project contributed only limited support to the 7 preprojects, the preproject on plant germplasm has led to a major stand-alone project. On the negative side, there are serious questions about the sustainability of some of the Forestry Departments established under the FTT subproject, and true commercialization of most research results is still a long way off. The GOI demonstrated great enthusiasm for the project, providing personnel, living up to commitments to provide up-to-date facilities to house the ongoing programs, and including in its 5- year plan funding to sustain all the project's programs. However, Indian counterparts repeatedly voiced concern over the total cessation of U.S. support, particularly in the areas of consultant services and foreign exchange to purchase spare parts for imported equipment.  USAID is urged to reconsider its decision to terminate all financial assistance beyond the current agreement.","Delivery order no. 12","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","PDC-1406-I-00-0034-00","","5/1/1992 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural research|Applied research|Institution building|Technology transfer|Scientists|Technical training|Product development|Beneficiary count","India","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABE220.pdf","4,171 KB","006958 - International Resources Group (IRG)","","008557 - USAID.

"Evaluates a project to promote growth in Bolivia's small enterprise sector by strengthening the Bolivian National Federation of Credit Unions (FENACRE), the Bolivian Foundation for the Development of the Microenterprise Sector (PRODEM), and the Bolivian National Federation of Small and Micro Enterprises (FEBOPI).  Interim evaluation covers the period 1989-4/92. The FENACRE component has suffered from design problems.  In particular, the institutional analysis carried out in the design stage failed to disclose serious weaknesses in FENACRE's financial health, which surfaced during an audit conducted in FY 1989. Because of the tenuous financial position of FENACRE and the credit union system in general, USAID/D has delayed disbursement of funds for credit, and external TA has been concentrated on (1) dismantling FENACRE's deposit mobilization program (an action necessitated by FENACRE's insolvency); and (2) convincing credit unions of the need for state regulation. Additionally, the project design's emphasis on creating new credit unions affiliated with Departmental Associations of Small and Micro Industrialists (ADEPI's) was flawed.  Recommendations are presented for redesigning this component, and downsizing FENACRE, which should become a simple representational and lobbying institution, stripped of financial intermediation functions. PRODEM's transfer of its lending functions to BancoSol is progressing smoothly; conversion by stages has permitted the development of a positive consensus by all levels of PRODEM personnel towards the formation of a new for-profit bank.  ACCION International's TA has contributed greatly to the development of PRODEM's institutional capacities; PRODEM is providing credit to increasing numbers of clients while maintaining almost negligible delinquency.  BancoSol, for its part, should give priority to developing its voluntary savings mobilization program.  A computerized system is being developed which PRODEM/BancoSol can use to measure the progress of microenterprises receiving credit. FEBOPI's achievements include raising government and public awareness of the problems faced by small and micro businesses, becoming the recognized spokesman for this constituency; developing a basic business training program through its eight affiliated ADEPI's; conducting research into policy constraints facing the sector and participating in policy dialogue with the government to ameliorate these constraints; helping to organize two national trade fairs to exhibit small business and micro industrial products; and providing TA to help make the ADEPI's institutionally stronger. On the negative side, FEBOPI membership represents only a small fraction of the potential constituency, and has recently declined to approximately 1,100 small businesses; also, no substantial policy reforms have taken place.  FEBOPI has not yet developed services that address the two most pressing needs of the small and micro industrial sector:  (1) in-shop TA, including technology assessments, preparation of business plans, and help with arranging credit; and (2) direct intervention to help member companies make contact with prospective customers and close sales.  This report outlines several ways in which FEBOPI's services could be improved, and also recommends for study four new services. FEBOPI's management information system is inadequate, which is probably why its reports to USAID are often incomplete and late. A series of performance indicators are recommended to improve both management and reporting.  FEBOPI's funding from USAID is due to end in December 1992, and it has prepared a self- sufficiency plan for presentation to USAID.  The report sets out several options for USAID consideration.","Companion evaluation summary: PD-ABG-091, Spanish evaluation:|PD-ABG-092|Project title: Growth and equity through microenterprise investment|(GEMINI)","Special Evaluation","Documents","DHR-5448-Q-00-9081-00","","6/1/1992 12:00:00 AM","","Microenterprises|Small scale enterprises|Business associations|Credit unions|Institution building|Business support services","Bolivia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABE227.pdf","3,037 KB","006727 - Development Alternatives, Inc.

"Evaluates the Johns Hopkins Program for International Education in Gynecology and Obstetrics (JHPIEGO).  Final external evaluation covers 5/87 to 7/92.  PACD is 4/94. JHPIEGO is in the process of a major transition from a program whose dominant components were a Baltimore location, a focus on laparoscopic female sterilization, and training of university- based ob-gyns to a more diversified program with a stronger public health approach to family planning (FP).  Excellent progress is being made.  Since 1988 JHPIEGO has launched several new initiatives and is uniquely positioned to have an impact in important clinical areas.  These initiatives include: standardization of the teaching of manual clinical skills; efforts to make training more efficient; activities to revive the IUD; and development of national clinical standards for training, service delivery, and quality control.  Perhaps JHPIEGO's most significant contribution has been the development of prototype training and reference materials for clinical training in minilaparotomy and management of the copper-T 380A IUD and NORPLANT, along with the development of two reference manuals, one on preventing infection and one on managing genital tract infections,especially in relation to the use of IUD's. On the negative side, JHPIEGO has not sought to evaluate the overall impact of its work, or even to document it in such a way as to facilitate evaluation by others.  Also, development of the above initiatives has largely taken place in the context of in- service training.  JHPIEGO has no clear strategy for institutionalizing FP in pre-service education, its efforts in this area frequently being isolated and without either follow- through or documented impact. JHPIEGO has also failed to develop clear strategies for allocating resources across the different components of its program (e.g., training of doctors vs. nurses or midwives). Activities too often flow from historical relationships with leading gynecologists and their institutions.  Decisions concerning which countries in which to work and which activities within a country to support are too often made on the basis of targets of opportunity.  This may have been appropriate in earlier decades, but is no longer so. Other findings are as follows.  (1) JHPIEGO's management structures are in a state of evolution.  Staffing is thin at the leadership level and not adequate to carry out the current program, much less an expanded one.  Steps are being taken to hire more people and improve management, but it is too early to predict the outcome.  (2) JHPIEGO's experimental efforts with OPTEL (interactive PC teleconferencing) remain questionable.  At this point, OPTEL appears to be primarily a sophisticated technology searching for an application.  (3) JHPIEGO's decreased use of Baltimore training has had mixed results.  The regional/international centers supported by JHPIEGO have trained substantial numbers of health care providers and trainers, but JHPIEGO's limited efforts to evaluate the training provided leave the question of its impact unanswered. Recommendations address the above issues.","Project title: Population technical assistance (POPTECH)","Special Evaluation","Documents","DPE-3024-Z-00-8078-00","","7/1/1992 12:00:00 AM","","Health professional education|Physician education|Nursing education|Paramedical education|Obstetrics|Gynecology|Sterilization (birth control)|Reproductive health","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABE267.pdf","9,918 KB","006243 - Dual & Associates, Inc.|000673 - International Science and Technology Institute, Inc.

"During the five years since 1987, the Get Ahead Foundation (GAF) has built a large and pioneering microenterprise program centered on the Stokvel Loan Program.  GAF was the first PVO to introduce group lending for microenterprises into the black townships in South Africa, which it did with financial and technical support from USAID.  It was also the first PVO to carry out such a program on a significant scale anywhere in Sub-Saharan Africa. For most of its history, GAF has operated in an environment hostile to its aims.  When the Stokvel Loan Program began, many of its features, such as the interest rate, were illegal and brought regular harassment from government authorities.  The black enterprises that GAF hoped to promote were also illegal and the target of official harassment.  The townships in which GAF operates were highly politicized, often violent settings.  GAF leadership and staff showed courage and ingenuity in carrying out the terms agreed to with USAID. Against this background, GAF has accomplished a great deal over the past five years.  Under the Stokvel Loan Program, it has disbursed 12,658 loans in 22 areas throughout South Africa with a 90% recovery rate.  This exceeds the performance targets established in the original grant agreement of 7,000 loans and an 85% recovery rate.  The loans have contributed to improvements in the financial status of client enterprises and to increases in employment.  Institutionally, GAF has strengthened its organizational structure by separating its social and commercial activities, trained staff in credit delivery and administration, and expanded its resource base. As the first agreement between GAF and USAID draws to a close, the stance of government toward black enterprise and black-directed PVO's has become more positive.  Moreover, there is a tremendous surge of interest by PVO's, development finance institutions, and banks in providing financial services to the majority population.  New entrants into the microenterprise finance field are appearing, and many of them have learned from the example of GAF that group lending can succeed in South Africa. Similarly, GAF has influenced organizations elsewhere in Africa to consider group lending. In the context of these changes, GAF can expect to achieve even more in the future.  In doing so, however, it will face new organizational challenges.  It will have to establish more ambitious goals and targets for portfolio quality, good management and, ultimately, financial independence.  Now that the authorities are no longer working against it, GAF has more freedom to concentrate its energies on improving quality.  It can shift into higher gear. The evaluation team recommends that USAID continue to fund GAF to promote its future growth, stability, and financial independence. To this end, GAF will need to introduce new performance indicators and aim for higher standards in critical management areas and in the quality of its loan portfolio to reduce the portion of loans currently at risk. The first and most important step is for GAF to make some immediate changes to improve loan repayment rates.  The next round of funding should be contingent on the initial demonstration of commitment during the next few months.

"The Zambia Natural Resource Management (NRM) Project supports the Administrative Management Design for game management areas (ADMADE) through a grant agreement with the Republic of Zambia and a cooperative agreement with the World Wildlife Fund. The project appears to be meeting its objectives to demonstrate that wildlife can be a profitable land use and to promote institutions for natural resource management and the distribution of its benefits.  The project has made some progress towards its objectives to increase local welfare, to increase the participation of women, and to return benefits from local wildlife use to communities.  The project has not yet established self-sustaining wildlife management programs or influenced government to give proprietorship of wildlife to communities. The project is unlikely to demonstrate that local communities can manage wildlife by themselves but has already begun to show that communities can manage local development projects. The strongest positive effects of the project through ADMADE have probably been to increase local employment, to train and deploy wildlife management staff, to decrease illegal hunting in game management areas, and to convince local residents to support wildlife conservation.  This last achievement is largely attributable to the community development projects that have been completed.  The major needs that the project should address are to conduct adequate wildlife monitoring and research, increase communication within ADMADE, improve the consistency of management and recordkeeping in the areas, persuade officials and leaders at all levels to share more authority with those at lower levels, improve financial accounting, increase revenues, and improve vehicle maintenance. Zambia has retained viable populations of most of its large wildlife species and regions of attractive natural habitat. However, this wildlife heritage has been heavily depleted by hunting during the past 20 years and is now vulnerable to loss. The ADMADE program is at present the most promising attempt to conserve wildlife in Zambia for the benefit of its people.  The Zambia NRM project represents the most important source of outside support for ADMADE and deserves to continue.

"Presents final Bureau report on a project (FY70-88) to finance volunteer management TA through the International Executive Service Corps (IESC). A.I.D. has provided support to IESC since its inception as a collaborative effort between the U.S. Government and the U.S. business community.  A.I.D. support provides over 2/3 of IESC's annual budgetary requirements and is essential for the funding of IESC's worldwide operations. The project came under the jurisdiction of the Bureau for Private Enterprise (PRE) in FY82.  PRE encouraged IESC to coordinate its services with USAID Missions and to help Missions develop and implement their private sector strategies.  To this end, IESC has negotiated numerous Mission-funded grant agreements.  IESC's services have been directed to the private sector of host countries and in some cases to privatizing state-owned enterprises. Two programs developed under the PRE project -- American Business Linkage Enterprise and the Joint Venture Feasibility Fund -- were combined and funded as a separate project, the Trade and Investment Services Project. An impact evaluation produced in 1988 documents high Mission and client regard for IESC services. positive effects in many economic sectors, including textiles, agribusiness, banking, utilities, chemicals, and land development.  The lessons learned from this project have helped PRE to develop several new kinds of project assistance. PRE has decided to continue to fund IESC at a level of about $5 million per annum.  A follow-on (9400012) began in FY89.  Cost benefit analysis will be used to better determine project strategy.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1992 12:00:00 AM","","Management training|Business support services|Private enterprises|Private voluntary organizations","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABE293.pdf","40 KB","007005 - USAID.

"Presents final Bureau report on a project (FY85-89) to provide TA to USAID Missions, host governments, and the private sector to promote divestiture and privatization. Although the initial scope of work called for the contractor (Analysis Group, Inc.) to design privatization strategies for 5 countries, by the completion of the project, A.I.D.-assisted privatization efforts had taken place in 46 countries.  A report summarizing privatization strategies, efforts to date, barriers to reform, and the economic conditions facing privatized industries was written for each country.  Specific TA was provided as well in most of the countries.  Reference works on privatization strategies were also published for USAID Missions and the Bureau for Private Enterprise (PRE), respectively. The project succeeded in implementing the process of reducing the state-owned sector of the economy in 10 of the 46 countries, and was able in some degree to assist in the process in several others.  Many times political and social barriers to privatization proved tougher than did economic ones.  However, the benefits of privatization are becoming widely known to developing country governments. Project experience shows that several factors must be addressed in designing a country privatization strategy.  (1) A process of divestiture and privatization must be established.  This process must include:  political as well as economic motives, realistic valuations of state-owned enterprises (SOE's), and the sequential privatization of SOE's.  (2) Country objectives (e.g., greater economic efficiency, the raising of revenues or investment levels) should be precise.  (3) Legislative reform is necessary at an early stage.  (4)  Strategy and implementation must be taken seriously if the proper signals are to be sent to local governments, the local private sector, and the international business, development, and political communities. A new privatization project, Privatization and Development (9400016), was initiated in FY 91, with Price Waterhouse as primary contractor.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1992 12:00:00 AM","","Technical assistance|Privatization|Divestiture|Economic reform","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABE294.pdf","454 KB","007005 - USAID.

"Presents final Bureau report on a project (FY85-89) to provide advisors to developing country governments and USAID Missions to recommend policy, legal, and regulatory changes needed to improve the local financial sector. The project, which was implemented by Arthur Young and Company, was initially expected to provide support in 10 countries, but the number was expanded to 27.  A financial markets survey was conducted in each, and various other TA services were provided in most countries.  The project demonstrated that financial sector development has enormous potential and that financial market development is necessary to allow developing nation private sectors to become viable economic entities in the global market. However, due to the short-term nature of project TA, the development impact of the project was limited. The following lessons were learned.  (1) Financial expertise is especially critical at early stages of local private sector development as USAID Mission staffs often lack knowledge about capital markets.  The Bureau for Private Enterprise (PRE) should sponsor regional training programs in capital mobilization and should provide long-term TA and other help needed to strengthen financial markets. (2) Information acquired through the financial markets project was not shared adequately and consistently within PRE and other A.I.D. offices; this resulted in duplication of effort.  Heavy personnel turnover at Missions is another factor necessitating consistent ongoing information sharing. (3) Mission buy-ins to A.I.D./W projects work better than IQC's to promote long-term commitment to financial market development. (4) Capital market development strategies should include attention to the capital requirements of private enterprises, to A.I.D.'s ability or inability to fill these requirements, and to involvement in this area by other agencies, international organizations, and financial institutions. A follow-on project, the Financial Sector Development Project (9400014) was initiated in FY89 with Price Waterhouse as primary contractor.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1992 12:00:00 AM","","Technical assistance|Economic surveys|Capital markets","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABE295.pdf","197 KB","007005 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to increase contraceptive prevalence in Burundi. Midterm evaluation covers the period 10/88-7/92. The project is constrained by a lack of human and material resources. The Ministry of Public Health (MOPH) has not yet provided the professional staff envisioned; USAID/B lacks adequate staff for the project; and a replacement will soon be needed for the resident advisor. Nonetheless, the project is making good progress and benefits from the high level of awareness of population problems shown by both political leaders and the bishops of the Catholic Church. Individual components have fared as follows.  (1) A broad range of human resource development and training activities appropriate to program needs have been undertaken.  Unfortunately, there is little follow up or supervision of trained personnel.  (2) Information, education, and communication (IEC) activities are progressing more slowly but are well-focused.  Efforts to date include training of IEC agents and completion of a knowledge, attitude, and practices (KAP) study.  The absence of an IEC plan as well as of high-level IEC management expertise in the MOPH is expected to hinder this component. (3) As for service delivery, the logistics, management, and supply system has been strengthened, while the information system is evolving more slowly due to a lack of a management information system specialist; service protocols developed with project assistance have yet to be implemented.  Burundi's health care system, which is almost the sole source of FP services, suffers from organizational weaknesses and lack of clear policies, and provides a narrow range of contraceptive choice. These weaknesses are reflected in what appears to be a high drop out rate.  A feasibility study has uncovered three alternative, yet ambitious, new contraception distribution channels.  (4) Although lacking a policy component, the project has worked with the Ministry of Plan in developing a formal population policy. Movement towards the contraceptive prevalence rate goal of 7.6% has been slow; current figures place prevalence at 2.6%. However, movement towards other goals has been modest but encouraging.  (1) Service quality and availability are good in health centers where personnel have been trained and contraceptive supply flow is stable, although personnel are limited by the narrow range of available contraceptive methods, a heavy workload, and deficiencies in the health care delivery system itself.  (2) A 50% increase in reported users during each of the first 2 project years makes attainment of the goal of 90,000 users realistic, provided attention is paid to the apparently high drop-out rate.  (3) While the capacity for planning, managing national training, and IEC efforts has increased, institutionalization will require a greater number of professional staff members. The project's impact has been facilitated by its effective use of scarce resources (e.g., the use of service providers as trainers and of multi-sectoral IEC agents), but constrained by a lack of professional leaders, supervision, and strategic IEC planning. The central problem, however, continues to be the lack of adequate resources.","Project title: Population technical assistance (POPTECH)","Special Evaluation","Documents","DPE-3024-Z-00-8078-00","","7/1/1992 12:00:00 AM","","Family planning promotion programs|Contraceptive distribution|Contraceptive prevalence|Family planning services|Beneficiary count","Burundi","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABE307.pdf","2,114 KB","000673 - International Science and Technology Institute, Inc.

"Final evaluation of a project to develop Honduran institutions capable of providing small farmers with agricultural credit, inputs, and marketing services.  Final evaluation covers progress since the interim evaluation (in 1989) through 5/92, about a year and a half before the PACD. The Financial Development Fund (FDF), created as the project's implementing agency, proved an effective vehicle for dealing with small farmer organizations.  However, the FDF's legal and organizational status continue to be problematic.  It is recommended that ownership of the FDF continue to be vested completely with the Honduran government, but also, to avoid politicization, that FDF be removed from the trusteeship of BANADESA and be established as an independent trust managed by a private institution.  It is also recommended that:  (1) FDF charge market interest rates and fees for prerparing financial stabilization plans; (2) emphasize management improvement; and (3) undertake changes to ensure its sustainability, including assuming the roles now played by the TA team and focusing on cost-recovery and sound financial management. Activities with agricultural cooperatives and their second level organizations were slow at first, but accelerated during the last year. Efforts to improve management capabilities were especially successful, largely because project assistance was linked to the co-ops' acceptance of specific reforms.  The greatest weakness has been in analysis of co-ops as part of the agribusiness system.  Nonetheless, the strategy in the coffee sector has worked much better, not only because of the project's systematic treatment of the sector, but also because of its focus on an area (quality improvement) where co-ops have a comparative advantage.  The follow-on project should continue focusing on management development, and also focus resources on economically competitive co-ops -- even to the point of letting unsuccessful ones fail.  The strategy of developing UNIOCOOP as a wholesaler of services should be more fully developed. The credit union (CU) component correctly identified and significantly helped redress the key constraints facing CU's -- poor management skills and financial policies and reluctance to invest in fixed assets.  However, the project lacks the entrepreneurial perspective to help CU's participate and succeed in an open and competitive world and thus ensure their long-term survival.  Once all 42 CU's have been evaluated for their participation, the financial stabilization program should be closed with great fanfare to make clear that the bailout phase is over.  The follow-on project should retain the major CU activities virtually unchanged, but should eliminate operating support for FACACH, the implementing organization for this component, and thus make FACACH look to its affiliates for its long-term survival; profitability criteria should guide all relationships between FACACH and participating CU's. The replacement of DIFOCOOP (the Direccion de Fomento Cooperativo) by IHDECOOP (Instituto Hondureno de Cooperativas) in 1988 was initially a positive event, as IHDECOOP had greater autonomy and more secure funding.  However, while it retains a competent staff, IHDECOOP's situation has deteriorated sharply in the past 2 years.  Even at its best, its professional and financial resources allowed it to audit only about 10% of the co-ops under its jurisdiction, and it could not even fill all the requests for audits from co-ops willing to pay; in addition, its role as a supporter of cooperative development undermined its will to enforce its own audit recommendations.  IHDECOOP should end its monopoly on external audits of co-ops and reorient itself to an oversight function, while ensuring that the results of such audits be made available to any interested parties, especially members and creditors.  In the follow-on project, the FDF should provide training for IHDECOOP auditors, while also providing matching grants to cooperatives to purchase external auditing services.","Companion evaluation summary: PD-ABH-924","Special Evaluation","Documents","522-0252-C-00-2001-00","","5/1/1992 12:00:00 AM","","Small farms|Agricultural credit|Credit unions|Agricultural cooperatives|Institution building|Management development|Financial management|Auditing|Political aspects|Economic self sufficiency","Honduras","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABE308.pdf","2,914 KB","004022 - Interamerican Management Consulting Corp.","","008555 - USAID.

"Final external evaluation of a project (8/85-6/92) to rehabilitate locomotives for Zambia Railways (ZR). Targets for locomotive availability (75%), wagon availability (90%), and wagon productivity (300,000 net tonne per km per wagon per year) were met over the 15 month period from 1/91 to 3/92. Moreover, comparison of USAID-rehabilitated units with the total ZR fleet showed that availability was 25% higher for rehabilitated units, and the number of kms run between failures was 46% higher.  On the other hand, the locomotive utilization target of 105,000 km per year was not met: USAID-rehabilitated locomotives ran an average of 270 km per day, resulting in 75,555 km per year. The project's successes are not likely to be sustained.  USAID should have exerted more control over the process of rehabilitation.  For example, decisions regarding the locomotives selected for rehabilitation and the extent of rehabilitation for each locomotive were not made in a consistent manner.  Also, used or rehabilitated parts were often applied where replacement with new components was necessary.  The results of these practices were locomotive failures soon after rehabilitation.  In fact, several locomotives experienced repeated failures.  These problems were caused by decisions made at the ZR shop; they could have been avoided if a USAID-sponsored technical specialist had been stationed on site. In addition, there are serious shortcomings in ZR maintenance and overhaul procedures.  Inspections are done only when there is a problem with performance and not as a matter of course, and there are also indications of inadequate running repairs. Recommendations are to:  strictly follow periodic maintenance procedures; and eliminate the ZR practice of excessive idling of locomotives, which causes engine damage.

"In the last 10 years USAID has provided approximately $500 million to trade and investment promotion organizations in Latin America and the Caribbean.  This study assesses the merits of ten such organizations in Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, Guatemala, and Chile, and identifies programs that have the greatest impact on exports and investment. Overall, promotional institutions provide services which the assisted firms, especially those in the agricultural and manufacturing sectors, consider highly valuable to their export growth; they also provide an attractive rate of return to A.I.D.'s investment (conservatively estimated at 25% in real terms).  Despite the benefits to individual firms, however, the programs' overall impact on nontraditional exports at the national level is generally not dramatic.  Nor can promotional institutions serve as effective substitutes for policies favoring export-oriented investment.  The most important services rendered by promotional institutions are informational; while needs vary from country to country, requests for market information and contact names seem to be universal.  However, the data tentatively suggest that firms both foreign and domestic are most likely to benefit not from information customized to a targeted clientele -- as conventional wisdom would have it -- but from information standardized in the form of handbooks, short courses, and brochures.","V. 2: PN-ABG-989|Summary highlights: PN-ABG-004","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-0095-I-00-9096-00","","6/1/1992 12:00:00 AM","","Export promotion|Investment promotion|International trade promotion organizations|Foreign investment","Latin America|Caribbean|Costa Rica|Dominican Republic|Guatemala|Chile","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAX258.pdf","55 KB","000833 - Robert R.

"Midterm evaluation of a project to strengthen primary health care (PHC) in Honduras, with emphasis on child survival (CS) and rural water and sanitation (WS).  Evaluation covers 6/88-6/91. Despite the project's enormous complexity, all components except operations research have begun and many are on or ahead of target.  In the CS component, pneumonia control, growth monitoring, and breastfeeding promotion have been delayed by lack of guidelines and insufficient training; other efforts, e.g., immunization, have exceeded target.  The threat of cholera has stimulated progress in disease control despite lack of local planning. As for other health care activities, the women's health and birth spacing component has adopted a ""reproductive risk"" approach and is ready to begin operations; support for tuberculosis control is minimal, but satisfactory; AIDS control is in a formative stage; and vector control has met targets, although hindered by a horizontal management structure. Most WS targets are being met despite coordination problems. Both the Ministry of Health's (MOH) Environmental Sanitation Division and PVO's have been productive.  The National Autonomous Water and Sewer Authority's (SANAA's) Rural WS Program improved operations and is expected to become equally productive. Human resource development is the least developed component. Training strategies are inadequate and coordination poor.  Health education and mass communication have progressed well at the central level, but not the regional and subregional levels. Private sector involvement has been limited to PVO subgrants and engineering contracts.  PVO WS projects have reached remote areas and are the most cost-effective water systems being constructed. PVO's have also worked well in CS, especially in promoting community participation. However, these experiences are not being shared systematically with the MOH. Several systems and technologies have been introduced to promote sustainability; many require further development.  Community WS have the best chance at sustainability due to efforts to organize users and collect fees.  Women are heavily involved in most project activities (except senior management). Major problems include the following.  (1) Except for immunization, little has been accomplished in developing community-based PHC.  (2) Due to lack of epidemiological criteria, most maternal/child health (MCH) strategies are inadequate.  Integration of primary and secondary MCH care is almost totally lacking.  (3) The MOH (and to an extent SANAA) has been decentralized to the regional, but not the local level.  No clear model of decentralization exists yet in Honduras.  (4) The project lacks a unified management structure. Authority is dispersed among five agencies, and coordination mechanisms are deficient.  In this vacuum, USAID/H has made unilateral decisions normally reserved to host country agencies and has withheld (mainly financial) information necessary for decisionmaking.  The MOH is seriously handicapped by its undefined organizational structure. Project experience also points to the importance of, inter alia: committed, adequately paid health workers; local development of PHC strategies and norms; and constant central supervision of local programming.  Other lessons are:  political influence can be a great obstacle; personnel changes cause disruption even when they are for the best; close relationships between advisors and the host agency can both help and hinder, in that significant influence can be exerted in either direction; and TA should be provided on the basis of identified needs, not the availability of individual advisors.","Companion evaluation summary: PD-ABH-925","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-5929-I-00-0108-00","","3/1/1992 12:00:00 AM","","Primary health care|Child survival activities|Water sanitation|Health care administration|Maternal child health care|Water supply structures","Honduras","","","001036 - Research Triangle Institute (RTI)","","008555 - USAID.

"Evaluates program to support economic and institutional reforms in Niger aimed at increasing agro-pastoral exports.  Interim evaluation covers the period 8/88-7/92 and includes recommendations for a planned amendment. Funds were disbursed under three tranches.  The principal condition precedent (CP) for the first disbursement was elimination of tariffs and certain other taxes on agro-pastoral exports.  While this was met, the Government of Niger (GON) continued to collect a ""statistical tax"" computed at 3% of the valeur mercuriale, ostensibly to defray its costs in obtaining essential information on exports.  (Prior to the program, certain agropastoral exports had been taxed at rates as high as 20%.) Having achieved a major policy reform at the beginning of the program, USAID sought to maintain progress by requiring the GON to meet more numerous, but less significant conditions for the second and third tranches.  In general, CP's for the second tranche required the GON to make specific policy decisions, and those for the third required actions to implement them.  None of the later CP's had the potential impact of the tariff elimination measure, none was so well defined, and none was easily met. Above and beyond the fulfillment of CP's, several factors pertinent to future program design (including design of the amendment) have emerged.  (1) Assumptions about the GON's political commitment to policy reform were overly optimistic; while reform is deemed necessary by most GON officials, the ""control mentality"" associated with central planning still prevails.  (2) Since the criteria identified in the PAAD for measuring the impact of policy reform are likely to be influenced by a variety of economic and social factors, they should not be viewed as definitive evaluative measures of the program, but should be weighed in conjunction with other evidence.  (3) The timeframe of 3 years was unrealistic.  It is highly unlikely that the program could have generated in such a short time sufficient economic activity to replace the revenues lost by eliminating agro-pastoral export tariffs.  (4) Policy reform alone is unlikely to persuade informal sector operators to enter the formal sector, especially since the costs of operating in the latter far exceed the benefits derived from the former.  Indeed, the tendency today is to abandon the formal for the informal sector.  (5) The present evaluation, conducted in the first half of 1992, is unlikely to produce conclusive evidence of the program's effectiveness.  (6) In the course of the program, sharply deteriorating economic conditions have diminished the GON's ability to provide the annual baseline data called for in the grant agreement -- data necessary for undertaking a full-scale evaluation of the program.

"Midterm evaluation of a grant to Aid to Artisans (ATA) to help Hungarian artisans (especially women) increase their exports to U.S. markets.  The evaluation covers the period 5/91-5/92. The project has successfully completed its first year of operation within Hungary's challenging and fluctuating conditions.  The Yale School of Management assessed artisan cooperatives, providing ATA the information it needs to target receptive and potentially successful beneficiaries.  With one exception  -- Hungaracoop, the former state export cooperative, which refused to provide data -- the Yale team was able to establish favorable rapport with Hungarian cooperatives.  The Yale team also assessed foreign trade organizations (FTO's), though some lack of objectivity was noticeable in its opinion of the role of the FTO's generally.  ATA was able to detect this, however, and has identified Folkart Trading Company as the primary FTO it will work with. Assisted by workshops conducted by ATA design consultants at 15 sites, local artisans have developed some 50 new, U.S. market-sensitive products, including embroidered linens, felt Christmas ornaments and accessories, decorative gifts, home furnishing accessories, high fashion apparel, Hungarian black pottery, and majolica pottery.  These products have been introduced into the U.S. market using a mixed strategy which targets influential, trend-setting wholesalers and retailers and which includes presentations at ATA's Design and Marketing meetings and the New York International Gift Show.  ATA has also initiated a Buyers-to-Hungary program, which recruits U.S. firms to undertake product development at their own expense; five buyers (in addition to The Sandor Collection) are participating. export orders for Year I are substantial, totaling $182,737. ATA has also taken steps to analyze the business training needs of artisans, artisan cooperatives, and FTO's, and has provided business management assistance, especially in regard to pricing and export order preparation, to selected cooperatives. Preliminary plans have been made with the State University of New York (SUNY) for a cooperative program in artisan-related business training.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","5/1/1992 12:00:00 AM","","Artisans|Women|Cooperatives|Product development|Employment|Export promotion|Marketing|Business support services","Hungary","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABE385.pdf","927 KB","","","007012 - USAID.

"Final external evaluation of a project (1985-92) to improve the capacity of Malawi's Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) to conduct agricultural research and extension (AR&E) aimed at increasing and diversifying smallholder production. The project substantially strengthened the AR&E system's agroforestry, horticulture, and economic analysis components, and the project's large training component, which included 48 Ph.D. and M.Sc. programs, had a great effect on the MOA,  Project training, complemented by on-farm trials, led to the release of two flint type maize hybrids in 1990,  This is a remarkable achievement, which will contribute to major increases in maize production.  Nonetheless, the AR&E system has been perturbed by a series of donor interventions and external shocks from which it will need time to recover.  Retention of trainees has also been a problem. Specific findings are as follows.  (1) The unconventional system of project management, under which a U.S.-based project coordinator and the MOA controller of agricultural services were responsible for overall management -- rather than an onsite chief-of-party -- worked quite well. (2) The adaptive research program focused attention on the need for regionalized recommendations and substantially improved MOA ability to collect and analyze farm-level data, but has not yet been integrated into the overall AR&E system.  (3) Despite the project's major investments in infrastructure, training, and laboratory equipment, recurrent costs remains a problem -- the government has failed to provide even modest operating funds for many activities.  (4) The project significantly strengthened the MOA's Visual Aids Unit and Extension Aids Branch.  (5) The Women's Program had great success in integrating women farmers and professionals into extension, credit, training programs.  For example, the amount of credit going to women through farmers groups increased from 8.3% in 1983 to 34.4% in 1991. The Program also implemented a series of income-generation projects and trained both male and female extensionists to work with women farmers. However, women farmers' influence on the research agenda is still nowhere near commensurate with their massive contributions to agriculture in Malawi.  (6) The objective of diversifying smallholder production and income was generally not achieved.  Research priorities should be revised to focus on crops with greater drought resistance, such as cassava and sorghum-millet, and substitution of maize by other crops such as sorghum, sweet potato, cassava, and banana should be encouraged. The project was relatively well designed, except for three things: the lack of attention to soil science, an overestimation of the number of new technologies to be extended to smallholders, and its greatly reduced support (compared to the predecessor project) for the maize program, just at the time the program was in a position to start producing new technology.  This last lesson has direct implications for the agroforestry and horticulture programs, now that they are able to start producing technology.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","8/1/1992 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural research|Agricultural extension|Small farms|Institution building|Government departments|Beneficiary count","Malawi","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABE388.pdf","4,011 KB","001335 - Chemonics International Consulting Div.","","003992 - Mali.

"This mid-term evaluation of APAP II limited its focus to research, TA, training, and administrative activities, and provides commentary and guidance for a possible follow-on project, APAP III, in terms of possible redirection of policy focus, management structure and coordination, and other areas of interest. The APAP II design concept was based on synergism between the following three strategies:  (1) a core state-of-the-art research program; (2) providing timely policy-related TA to Missions, Bureaus and host governments; and (3) training and dissemination activities to provide information on policy reform and experiences and widely available analytical methods.  The project had 5 focus areas:  (a) international trade; (b) the impacts of economic adjustment programs; (c) natural resources; (d) improving policy-analysis activities; and (e) the political dynamics of agricultural policy making. In terms of strengthening agricultural policy making through TA and training provided to USAID Missions and regional Bureaus, and for the AID/W seminar series initiated over the last year, the project was well regarded among most individuals contacted. However, only some of the project's objectives relating to linkages and synergism among the strategies were wholly achieved. More attention to management details by the primary contractor could have averted inefficiencies.  The implementation of a bonafide core research program has not been realized:  the approach to conducting core research may need to be reassessed. The lack of a focus for agricultural policy research generates a similar lack of focus within the TA and training activities. As always, both Missions and the contractors need to be mindful of the time required to process requests for project services. Included are recommendations on improving project management, re-thinking the capacity and purpose of the core research program (including making research strategies more additive), improving dissemination activities, and more fully engaging subcontracting institutions in project activities.  Suggestions for additional areas of future project emphasis include policy implementation (rather than policy dialogue), regional trade and integration, resource management and environmental quality, sector development and productivity strategies, agrarian reform and transition, and agricultural-sector commercialization, privatization, and competition.

"Evaluates project to improve maternal and neonatal health and nutrition in developing countries (MotherCare project).  Midterm evaluation covers the period 5/89-3/92. To date, MotherCare has initiated long-term activities in Bolivia, Guatemala, Indonesia, Nigeria, and Uganda; provided short-term TA to numerous countries; organized and hosted workshops and meetings; and developed assessment tools, policy guidelines, training manuals, and numerous other publications. These efforts have raised awareness of maternal/neonatal health and nutrition problems and filled gaps in the state-of-the-art regarding specific interventions.  They are also likely to influence host government policy.  Indonesia, for example, has already incorporated MotherCare data into its own definition of ""low birth weight"". MotherCare works with and adapts itself to the local health delivery system, while introducing a broad range of services for the care of mothers and newborns, with referral of women with complications a key strategy.  MotherCare's adaptability has improved service provision and augurs well for project sustainability.  It is expected that the impact of project interventions will be well documented by project end. The time and resources allocated to behavioral research and social marketing have varied widely by country.  The Tanjungsari project in Indonesia, for example, has lagged in the areas of communication and social marketing, while similar projects in Bolivia are contributing to the state of the art and should be more fully documented.  The use of women's groups and organizations is a promising outreach mechanism, but so far has realized its potential only in Bolivia and Bangladesh. Applied research has focused on issues critical to reducing maternal and neonatal mortality in the next decade, such as prevention and treatment of anemia, provision of care during pregnancy and labor, and reduction of perinatal and neonatal mortality. The extent of the research is especially laudable in view of A.I.D.'s procedural requirements for approving funding for subcontracts.  Future A.I.D. research should build on the experience and comparative advantage that MotherCare has established, placing highest priority on innovative techniques for providing adequate care during pregnancy and labor. The use of modern techniques to provide training in midwifery and obstetric skills is a key project activity.  ""Life-Saving Skills Manual for Midwives"" is an excellent document that deserves to be broadly promoted and disseminated.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","DPE-5939-C-00-7003-00","","7/1/1992 12:00:00 AM","","Maternal health care|Infant health care|Health research|Applied research|Paramedical education|Social marketing","Bolivia|Guatemala|Indonesia|Nigeria|Uganda","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABE431.pdf","2,646 KB","000981 - Pragma Corp.","","006943 - USAID.

"Evaluates a project to help ASINDES, a consortium of Guatemalan and international PVO's, to build its capacity to provide technical and financial assistance to the Guatemalan NGO community, and administer a program of subgrants for NGO development subprojects.  Final evaluation covers the period 1986-1992. While its basic philosophy and principles are sound, ASINDES is characterized by a general lack of strategy.  Poor definition of the role of ASINDES' Board of Directors and a lack of planning and strategy development by this body -- conditions documented in two midterm evaluations -- continue to be a problem.  ASINDES' financial sustainability is another major concern; a lack of effort devoted to fundraising, and unsophisticated financial management systems and procedures were the main problems. Although ASINDES has thus far managed to retain key personnel, this continuity is threatened by low salaries and poor salary structure. Though the selection of subprojects for funding, overseen by an independent selection committee, has been good, the committee's efforts have been hampered by a lack of information concerning both individual NGO's and the overall NGO picture, and particularly, by poor feedback concerning the success of funded subprojects; inadequate subproject monitoring and auditing are partly to blame.  The subproject success rate has been adequate, but there is room for improvement; ASINDES has adjusted proposal guidelines to help ensure a higher rate of success. NGO participation has been uneven, with ASINDES's membership fluctuating from a low of 23 to a high of 47 organizations.  The sector organization carried out by the Department of Technical Assistance and Training, has progressed, albeit slowly, and some NGO's have benefitted from the effort; many are sharing problems and solutions with each other for the first time.  Other NGO's seem to feel that ASINDES has provided little of value.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","2/1/1992 12:00:00 AM","","Community development|Private voluntary organizations|Institution building|Indigenous private voluntary organizations|Development projects","Guatemala","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABE466.pdf","2,219 KB","007308 - Prodesarrollo S.A.|008818 - Private Agencies Collaborating Together (PACT)","","008550 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to expand family planning (FP) services in Honduras, primarily through assistance to ASHONPLAFA, the Honduran affiliate of the International Planned Parenthood Federation.  Midterm evaluation covers the period 1989-92. The project has made good progress toward national contraceptive coverage despite substantial criticism from the Catholic Church. ASHONPLAFA now provides FP services in over 2,200 locations in all 18 departments and in 265 of 291 counties. Regionalization is also progressing; high-quality clinical services, especially voluntary surgical contraception, are being provided in 6 ASHONPLAFA clinics, and in a network of 8 private clinics supported by ASHONPLAFA.  These regional clinics also back up the widespread Community Services Program (CSP) of community-based contraceptive distribution.  With the help of MANDOFER, one of Honduras' largest pharmaceutical distributors, orals and condoms are being sold in 533 pharmacies and medicine stores under the Social Marketing Program (SMP), as well as by CSP distributors. All told, the project extended 210,000 couple years of protection (CYP's) during 1991, about 86% of target. In regard to self-sufficiency, ASHONPLAFA has increased locally generated funds by 54%, largely through client charges, and SMP and CSP surpassed their respective targets of 100% and 50% self-sufficiency during 1991.  Other accomplishments include, inter alia, development of an information, education, and communication (IEC) strategy; training of 1,491 persons in country and abroad, as well as assistance (through contracts with PLAN International and the Population Council) to PVO's in training another 1,500 community workers; and completion of fieldwork for the 1991 Epidemiology and Family Health Survey. Due to a combination of factors -- devaluation, inflation, cost containment, delays in some activities -- only 25% of the budget has been expended to date.  Low expenditures of both foreign exchange and lempiras have slowed performance in various areas, e.g., overseas training, TA, and SMP promotion.  Also, the regionalization effort has made insufficient progress in developing lower-level management skills, and volunteer participation in national and regional boards of directors needs to be revived if ASHONPLAFA is to achieve long-term self- sufficiency.  Finally, both PLAN International and the Population Council have been slow in developing subprojects with other local PVO's. In sum, the project is generally on track in meeting its geographic coverage and CYP targets, while moving more slowly in a number of areas. However, none of the latter have problems so intractable as to preclude success. Three significant lessons have been learned.  (1) Clear policy directives are needed to resolve conflicting objectives within a project, e.g., extending geographical coverage vs. cost containment. (2) Achieving cost savings at the expense of implementing essential program components is false economy.  (3) Significant institutional change is a long process.","Companion evaluation summary: PD-ABF-978|Project title: Population technical assistance (POPTECH)","Special Evaluation","Documents","DPE-3024-Z-00-8078-00","","8/1/1992 12:00:00 AM","","Family planning services|Institution building|Private voluntary organizations|Beneficiary count","Honduras","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABE471.pdf","6,300 KB","006243 - Dual & Associates, Inc.|000673 - International Science and Technology Institute, Inc.

The SP has been redesigned three times in an effort to respond to problems in implementing the NPC/TS component, the need to improve coordination with the UN Fund for Population Activities (UNFPA), and emerging institutional priorities. Implementation, which was very slow during the first 2 years, intensified greatly in 1990 with the arrival of a resident management advisor and the appointment of an active Project Director. Achievements in the NPC/G and NPC/TS components have varied noticeably.  The SP has strengthened NPC/G's capacity to plan, coordinate, and monitor population activities, and has significantly increased its technical and leadership skills.  The SP is also well on its way to meeting the target for the number of Development Support Grants awarded to Governorates.  Progress is due to a committed project staff and TA, an excellent training program, and the responsiveness of NPC/G office directors and staff. It is expected that NPC/G activities will be completed by project end. Efforts at NPC/TS have been less successful, despite substantial SP investments.  Achievements include:  training of some permanent staff members from key departments and units; substantial progress in completing the Population Information Center display/library rooms and media center; and production of an atlas of family planning centers and of Phase I of the Population Data Base.  However, a key component -- to develop ready access to computerized service statistics -- has faltered due to overly optimistic estimates of earlier UNFPA achievements in this area.  Nonetheless, with steady TA and a lack of further technical obstacles, both the Information Center and the Data System should be operational by 5/93.  The work of the Research Management Unit (RMU), charged with managing research proposals and coordinating biomedical and programmatic research by Egyptian institutions, is also behind schedule. RMU only became operational in 1991 and it is unlikely it will realize all its output targets.  Its major problem is its isolation from other activities at NPC/TS.  Overall, the slow pace of progress at NPC/TS stems from longstanding problems such as high turnover rates of key personnel and the shortage of counterparts; poor coordination and internal information flow; difficulties in coordinating with UNFPA; overcentralization of authority; and unhealthy competition between project staff and other NPC/TS personnel. A follow-on project focused to reflect the strengths and weaknesses of the current SP is the major recommendation.","Companion evaluation summary: PD-ABP-108","Special Evaluation","Documents","DPE-3035-C-00-5047-00","","7/1/1992 12:00:00 AM","","Institution building|Family planning policy|Government departments|Population policy","Egypt","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABE473.pdf","5,595 KB","001131 - The Futures Group International, Inc.

"Presents final Mission report on a project (7/83-9/88) to provide the physical and social infrastructure needed for socioeconomic development in Costa Rica's Northern Zone.  The three major project activities were road improvement, community development, and land titling/purchasing. The information in this report is mostly drawn from a 2/87 evaluation. Project start-up was delayed until 3/84, due mainly to the Government of Costa Rica's adherence to the letter of the law regarding formal ratification of the loan agreement.  As a result, targets were not fully met. Only 103.7 km of roads were upgraded, compared to 152 km targeted, and of these, 22.7 were financed through P.L. 480, not the project.  The shortfall in road improvement was due partly to a change in specifications and hence higher costs. Community development activities were more successful.  The project supported 31 existing Development Associations and helped to form 21 more, for a total of 52, covering virtually 100% of the project area. Construction of community infrastructure included 3 classrooms, a community center, two meeting centers, a health center, and a water system.  In addition, six agricultural projects were undertaken, including establishment of windbreaks and plantings of cocoa, cardamom, black pepper, vanilla, and maraguya. The land purchase component, implemented by the Agrarian Development Institute (IDA), succeeded in helping small and medium sized farmers (i.e., those owning less than 100 ha) to secure legal land titles.  IDA purchased 4,291 ha with P.L. 480 funds, and created 12 new asentamientos from this land, with an estimated capacity of 548 families.  Between 340 and 370 of the plots were occupied and/or being worked as of 1/87.  As for farmers who already had topographic plans, 117 titles were registered and awarded as of 1/87, 5 others were ready for registry, and 65 were in the field inspection phase.  Property censuses were underway (as of 11/86) in 2 of the 5 zones targeted for this activity. The project design did not expect actual economic development to occur and in fact there seems to have been no noticeable change, or even the beginnings of progress in such crucial development areas as income or unemployment reduction.  There are some signs (as of 2/87) of incipient new economic activity, but signs of an economic take-off are notable for their absence.  A Phase II project, focusing on production, has been recommended. The project delays should serve to remind future projects to allow ample time for formal ratification of loan agreements, and not to expect any real action until this process is completed.","Loan no. 515-T-041","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1992 12:00:00 AM","","Economic infrastructure|Community development|Regional development|Land ownership|Road construction|Land titling","Costa Rica","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABE602.pdf","231 KB","008533 - USAID.

"Evaluates the fourth and final phase of a project to help Eastern Caribbean governments organize and deliver non-formal skills training and job placement programs for unemployed youth aged 15-25.  Evaluation covers the period 10/1/89-6/30/92. The project achieved most of its objectives.  Country programs are being administered without external assistance and have become institutionalized within national technical training systems, as is evident in the appointment of permanent staff and the commitment to finance training at least through 12/92. However, none of the staffs possess the technical skills needed to conduct labor market surveys, training needs assessments, or tracer studies.  While all countries value the programs, a debate is brewing about how they fit into each government's overall technical training system; in view of fiscal pressures, governments are seeking to rationalize their systems to eliminate overlap. The project achieved its goal of making youth more employable. About 4,100 youth (representing about one-sixth of all unemployed youth in the region) were enrolled during Phase IV, with 3,208 completing training. While women trainees comprised 66% of the total (vs. a target of 40%), most were trained in traditional trades (industrial sewing, data processing, and crafts), and only 9% in non-traditional areas (vs. a target of 20%).  The overall job placement rate of 70%, though short of the 80% target, was commendable given the regional economic situation. However, the expectation that trainees could graduate to self-employment after 8-12 weeks of training and without credit and TA was not well-founded. Although most training was in direct response to a need identified by local employers and community leaders, the programs are not as demand driven as they could be.  They could benefit from regular input from the employer community regarding course content and design, as well as from knowledge of other available training programs. On-the-job training -- which accounted for nearly half of all training -- was cheaper than workshop training, and resulted in a higher employment rate.  Quality of training was found to depend largely on individual instructors.  For example, most business skills instructors had little no experience or education in small business development. Instruction in social skills was highly valued by employers and seems to have a real impact on attitudes, work performance, and motivation. Finally, the programs would benefit from better collection and analysis of data on training outcomes, and especially by automation of their management information systems.  Some programs are already using computers, but, due to lack of staff training, not to their full potential.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","9/1/1992 12:00:00 AM","","Vocational training|Technical training|Nonformal education|Youth|Women|On the job training|Employment|Beneficiary count","Eastern Caribbean","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABE608.pdf","2,937 KB","007223 - USAID.

"This interim evaluation of Indonesia's Municipal Finance Project was conducted to provide a basis for considering the design of a possible new Housing Guaranty loan (HGL) program, and possible amendments and changes to the current project.  The project's goal is to improve the shelter conditions of the urban poor by developing the means by which municipal governments can more effectively finance shelter-related urban services and infrastructure.  The evaluation entailed review of urban sector documentation provided by the Government of Indonesia and written products from the project, and interviews with counterparts, consultants, and trainees. The project has made, and continues to make, substantial progress. Major accomplishments include:  decentralizing and coordinating (across sectors) the urban infrastructure programming process; substantially improving the management and yields of the property tax and other local own source revenues; setting a sound base for expanding private sector participation in urban services; establishing the Regional Development Account (RDA) as a major step toward an effective credit finance system for local government; and institutionalizing ministerial coordination at the central level.  The TA and training component has been effective in advancing priority program initiatives and interagency collaboration. The project's accomplishments are sustainable. Even so, national urban infrastructure investment is falling behind national targets and decentralization has proceeded slowly in some areas.  To respond to this situation the program should give priority to developing a strategy for local finance reform that goes beyond better tax administration, preparing an action plan for building the RDA into a market-based credit system, and establishing an indigenous system for building local capacity in urban management.  It is also critical that policies to address urban environmental degradation be added as a high priority. USAID support has played an influential role in the program to date and the potential payoff from further assistance is high.  A new HGL program and substantially expanded TA and training efforts are warranted to extend sector progress. USAID should continue to support the integrated urban program as a whole, but give special emphasis to the achievement of new goals in urban environmental management and infrastructure provision, local government finance, and private sector participation. Lessons learned included the following.  The project provides a model for operating a policy-based sectoral HGL.  It shows how long-term involvement in an integrated program with clearly focused sub-objectives can lead to important and measurable policy change while avoiding the risks of fragmentation inherent in more narrowly defined projects.

"Evaluates grant to Fundacion Natura to increase environmental awareness and promote resource management and conservation activities in Ecuador.  Midterm evaluation covers the period 7/88-3/91. The project has been mostly successful and has helped make Fundacion Natura one of the most effective and widely recognized NGO's in the hemisphere.  Some planned activities, however, remain unfulfilled due to time, funding, and personnel constraints. The environmental awareness component has prepared databases, surveyed the public's knowledge of environmental issues, developed radio and TV public service announcements, produced radio programs, published booklets, and pamphlets, and conducted 18 seminars for people in leadership positions.  The latter have contributed substantially to national dialogue on environmental protection and management.  A concrete manifestation of achievements under this component has been Ecuador's progress toward passage of a national environmental law. A major accomplishment of the industrial pollution component has been the publication of Potencial Impacto Ambiental de las Industrias en el Ecuador, the first compendium of its kind in Ecuador.  This publication has heightened awareness of industrial pollution problems.  The time and effort needed to collect data on the entire industrial sector were underestimated, however, with data collection complete so far on only 14% of 164 industrial processes.  Also, contacts with industry have been spotty; only after publication of Potencial did many industries become aware of project activities.  The project has the opportunity to overcome some of these problems as it prepares and distributes detailed reports on individual industries (vademecos). The project's greatest accomplishment has been under the environmental education component and consists of the signing of the Convenio, an interministerial agreement to institutionalize environmental education at the preschool, primary, and secondary school level.  The Ministries of Health, Social Welfare and Education have contributed extensive staff and other resources to establish a decentralized administrative structure in 21 offices throughout the country, while the project has contributed educational materials and staff to conduct seminars and promote other educational activities, such as ecological clubs and local research.  To date, schools have received more than 300,000 units of material, and more than 200 seminars have been held for over 8,000 teachers (the number of seminars was doubled at the request of the Ministry of Education). Several efforts have been undertaken in the community development component, including a major information and outreach campaign in Quito, credited with improving citizens' handling of garbage and in improving litter control on the streets. Additionally, training for the Ecuadoran Association of Municipalities (AME) has sensitized AME staff to environmental concerns, which are now dealt with extensively in AME's own training. Finally, the project has successfully established the Fundacion Natura document center, which houses over 15,000 documents and 700 periodicals, and is used by over 300 people every month. Lesson learned include:  (1) the need for performance benchmarks (lacking in this project); and (2) the need for NGO's to consider offering competitive employment packages as a means of attracting and holding experienced professionals.","Delivery order no. 10","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-5517-I-00-0105-00","","7/1/1992 12:00:00 AM","","Information dissemination|Environmental education|Pollution|Industrial wastes|Community development|Information centers|Indigenous private voluntary organizations","Ecuador","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABE641.pdf","2,513 KB","005072 - Tropical Research and Development, Inc.","","008538 - USAID.

"Presents final Mission report on a project component (8/85-9/91) to strengthen the capacity of El Salvador's private sector to promote irrigated farming and nontraditional exports. The original plan to develop a private sector irrigation association (CORPREX) was not successful and in 6/87, responsibility for the component was given to FUSADES -- the Salvadoran Association for Social and Economic Development. Activities were carried out in four areas. (1) Using demonstration farms established by its agricultural research and extension arm, the Agriculture Diversification Program (DIVAGRO), FUSADES taught irrigation and farming practices to farmers.  As a result, 1,582 farmers are applying their new skills, and precision irrigation has been adopted on 2,727 ha for the production of high labor, or high value, nontraditional export crops.  DIVAGRO also set up a data base and library that are the best in the country for irrigated agriculture.  (2) FUSADES trained 45 private sector field agents (agribusiness and farm employees) to support farmers in precision irrigation technology. (3) FUSADES established a credit fund to support the development of irrigated agriculture and the export of irrigation crops. Loans (through FIDEX, the FUSADES lending arm) were made to farmers and to packing and processing enterprises.  Thirty-nine Salvadoran enterprises are using FUSADES to export nontraditional agricultural products to extraregional markets. DIVAGRO and FIDEX greatly benefitted from in-country training and international short courses and study tours. While the project component has ended, DIVAGRO continues to have an active TA program for farmers and food processors, and FIDEX continues its credit program.  USAID/ES will continue to support the development of private sector irrigated agriculture through FUSADES. The following lessons have been learned.  (1) Irrigation is a complex technology that takes considerable time to institutionalize, but it seems to be the only viable approach to profitable nontraditional agriculture.  (2) Due to constraints upon the Salvadoran government, it is up to the private sector to develop and transfer irrigation technology.  Fortunately, FUSADES/DIVAGRO now has the technical capacity to promote nontraditional agricultural exports, not only in irrigation techniques, but also in postharvest operations and marketing. (3) Nonetheless, farmers are reluctant to invest in precision irrigation due to its high costs.  Alternatives, such as furrow irrigation, must be promoted.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","519-0303-G-00-5510-00","","6/1/1992 12:00:00 AM","","Irrigation|Irrigated farming|Private sector|Agricultural extension|Crop diversification|Nontraditional agricultural exports|Beneficiary count","El Salvador","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABE670.pdf","125 KB","008540 - USAID.

"Presents final Mission report on a project (5/86-5/90) to convert a target group of large collective agricultural cooperatives in El Salvador into self-sustaining and profitable enterprises. Technoserve (TNS) was the implementing agency. The project was amended and extended in 8/88 to increase its emphasis on direct -- rather than intermediated -- assistance to co-ops.  An evaluation conducted in 10/89 showed that TNS provided valuable TA in production, farm management, accounting, financial management, and marketing.  Of 36 co-ops assisted, 20 (vs. 17 targeted) achieved the status of self-managed, self- sustaining enterprises.  TNS met or exceeded almost all the project's numerical targets.  The TNS approach is a highly participatory process that is tailored to the particular needs of each co-op.  Constraints on converting the co-ops into self- managing, profitable enterprises were found to be largely at the co-op level. The project teaches that the most important factor in agrarian reform is the quality and quantity of the training of the affected campesinos. Co-op members must be actively involved in recognizing the co-op's problems and planning solutions.  Project personnel should identify strongly with the co-op members' needs and the success of the organization as a business enterprise. Projects of this nature involve a constantly changing matrix of recipient groups as well as changing political, social, and economic parameters, and thus need to be evaluated frequently by the implementing organization.  Also, because of their political and social ramifications, projects such as this need to keep relevant policymaking institutions informed. A follow-on project, 5190382, was authorized in 6/90.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","519-0312-G-00-6376-00","","5/1/1992 12:00:00 AM","","Agrarian reform|Agricultural cooperatives|Agribusiness|Management development|Management training","El Salvador","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABE671.pdf","119 KB","008540 - USAID.

"Midterm evaluation of a grant to the Agromart Outreach Foundation in Sri Lanka to implement an agricultural entrepreneurship program for women in the Northwestern Province.  Agromart was created by the Sri Lankan Women's Chamber of Industry and Commerce (WCIC) in 1988 and received NGO status in 1989.  The USAID grant runs from 4/90 to 5/93. Agromart's Entrepreneurship Development Training Program has exceeded expectations.  The program provides 2 days of training every month for some 125 competitively selected participants, covering both business and technical skills.  As of the end of 1991, a total of 2,378 persons had participated -- nearly double the goal set in the grant agreement.  Each trainee receives follow-on support.  Agromart staff have responded indefatigably to problems and felt needs by seeking solutions for new ideas. USAID has also funded a pilot entrepreneur training program in the Southern Province, and AGROMART is now seeking USAID funding for expansion of this activity. The Agromart Foundation is directed by an active and responsible Board, headed by a chairwoman and managed by a dedicated staff of 12. The Foundation grew out of trade fairs which were first sponsored by WCIC in 1985 and are now an annual event. Initially subsidized, the fairs now turn a profit.  Agromart also operates several activities funded by other donors, including an economic literacy training program; a ""training for everyone"" program to motivate (particularly) women to undertake self-employment projects; a seminar series on environmental hazards in the rural sector; a ""liberal access to markets"" program, which encourages a street vending approach to agricultural marketing; and a crafts skills development program.  CIDA, SIDA, NORAD, and the Marie- Schlei Foundation are among the sponsoring donors.  The Foundation is endeavoring to become self-sufficient in each activity it undertakes. There is no question that Agromart has had a powerful influence on people.  Participants feel that Agromart provides an essential service in skill-building and linking farmers to markets, and their confidence in Agromart and loyalty are clear.  It is also clear that Agromart builds self-esteem and fosters community linkages.  Economic benefits have been demonstrated as well. Agromart should be supported to the fullest extent, and even encouraged to undertake new challenges. Lessons learned include the following.  (1) Sri Lankan women tend to be well educated and when given the opportunity and technical skills, they can overcome cultural barriers and become entrepreneurs.  (2) In a program targeting women, it is important to include men.  Once they perceive that their spouses can be powerful income earners, men are happy to share in the work.  (3) Small entrepreneurs in Sri Lanka lack access to credit and must generate their own capital.  (4) Entrepreneur development programs should concentrate on marketing.  Agromart's insistence on identifying a market before producing a product has proven quite successful.  (5) Entrepreneur development cannot be done in a vacuum; many other aspects of community development, such as health care, language training, and environmental awareness, are also needed. (6) The impact of an NGO can be sustainable if follow-on institutions are created.  (7) NGO's, to be effective, rely a great deal on dedication and a commitment to the voluntary spirit.  As a result, there is danger of dependency on charismatic leadership. The evaluation includes recommendations for USAID to increase funding and for Agromart to proceed cautiously with its expansion plans.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","8/1/1992 12:00:00 AM","","Women in development|Indigenous private voluntary organizations|Agricultural enterprises|Management training|Entrepreneurship|Institution building|Agricultural product marketing|Beneficiary count","Sri Lanka","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABE686.pdf","2,156 KB","","","008606 - USAID.

"Presents final Mission report on a project (8/85-9/90) to expand family planning (FP) services in El Salvador. The project achieved or exceeded several of its targets.  For example, a large mass media campaign was developed to promote FP services offered by public health agencies and the private sector Salvadoran Demographic Association (SDA), and some 4.4 million pieces of educational materials (vs. a target of 1.9 million) were prepared.  All training targets were met, and in addition, Johns Hopkins University trained 3,190 Ministry of Agriculture field workers to promote FP in their communities.  The project was also instrumental in the development of a new National Population Policy and it established an FP supply management system, trained paramedical personnel in maintenance of laparoscopic equipment, and equipped an Infertility Clinic (though at 90% of the planned level). Lessons learned are as follows.  (1) Projects to build institutions and especially a capacity for coordinated planning require at least a 5-year time-frame.  (2) Whenever possible, complicated bureaucratic structures (e.g., this project's Special Administration and Training Unit) should be avoided.  If they are required, substantial administrative and financial management assistance are essential.  (3) In El Salvador, integrating FP with other health programs increases public acceptance, However, within the integrated health care system, FP requires special attention.  (4) To improve service delivery, attention must be given to training local policymakers and decisionmakers to organize and prioritize services.  (5) IEC programs must blend mass media and interpersonal communication; interpersonal campaigns require considerable time and energy.  (6) Every effort should be made to strengthen the private sector, which has proven the more effective FP implementor in El Salvador.  (7) The TA team should have offices inside the institution it is working with.  (8) Whenever possible, each major institution should have a separate project.  (9) Logistics are essential and should always receive a high degree of attention. USAID is funding follow-on FP assistance under project 5190308 for the public sector and 5190363 for SDA.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","8/1/1992 12:00:00 AM","","Family planning services|Public health care|Private voluntary organizations|IEC|Family planning promotion programs|Beneficiary count","El Salvador","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABE698.pdf","302 KB","008540 - USAID.

"Presents final Mission report on a project (8/81-12/85) to strengthen the energy planning and management capacity of the Government of Tunisia's (GOT) Societe pour la Maitrise de l'Energie (SME), a semi-autonomous entity of the Ministry of National Economy. The project was a success, its purpose achieved and all EOPS and outputs completed.  Significant progress was made in institutionalizing capabilities in energy sector analysis, planning, and policy formulation through the GOT's creation of the SME, and TA from the U.S. contractor, Resources Management Associates (RMA).  The professionally staffed SME quickly developed into a well functioning organization making an important contribution to increased understanding of Tunisia's energy supply and demand options.  RMA assisted the SME and the GOT Directorate General of Energy in the development of energy supply/use baseline data, data analysis by sector, and energy audit capability.  GOT progress in analytical skills development, analysis of energy use data, incipient policy formulation capability, and access to energy analysis methodologies and U.S. institutions in the energy sector was also significant.  RMA's TA effort comprised 46 short-term assignments totaling 28 person- months of effort. Specific accomplishments include the following:  (1) energy audits of 6 Tunisian hotels, 4 GOT office buildings, 2 department stores, 1 school, 2 hospitals, 4 transport companies, 1 textile plant, 1 oil refinery, and 1 dairy plant; (2) a 10-day seminar on energy management in commercial and institutional buildings attended by 30 Tunisians representing 14 organizations; (3) preliminary designs of prototype solar water heating systems for 2 hotel buildings; (4) in collaboration with the national power utility, an energy consumption survey initiated in 3,000 households, with data used to develop energy supply and demand models; (5) development of transportation modeling methodologies, and U.S. training in this area for SME staff; and (6) an agricultural sector energy use study.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","3/1/1992 12:00:00 AM","","Public administration|Energy planning|Energy policy|Parastatals|Institution building","Tunisia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABE700.pdf","68 KB","008616 - USAID.

"Evaluates agribusiness credit activities under three programs in the Dominican Republic:  the Agribusiness Promotion (APP) Project (5170186), which began in 1986; the Commercial Farming Systems Project's Bridge Credit component (5170214), which began in 1987; and the P.L. 480/Section 108 Program, which began in 1990. The loans made under the programs covered a diversity of economic activities.  APP loans, generally smaller than those under the other two programs, were used primarily for crop and livestock production; Bridge Credit loans went primarily to processors of farm products; and P.L. 480/S.108 loans went to producers, processors, and other agro-industries, with a slight concentration on crop production. Administration of the programs differed widely.  (1) Operation of the APP fund, by the Central Bank's Economic Development Investment Fund (FIDE), was overscrupulous, as FIDE continued to review the creditworthiness of borrowers even though commercial banks carried the full risk for repayment, and despite USAID's insistence that FIDE forbear in this area.  Some borrowers had to spend large sums on feasibility studies to satisfy FIDE.  When loans were finally disbursed, their utility was greatly reduced because costs had increased in the interim.  (2) Banco de Reservas managed the Bridge Credit fund much more efficiently, accepting the intermediary banks' decisions and limiting supervision to checking eligibility and verifying the use of funds for stated purposes.  (3) P.L. 480/S.108 Program operations were handled entirely by six commercial banks. Most borrowers (all were medium to large agribusinesses) were satisfied with the loans' rates and terms.  APP borrowers tended to complain about delays in disbursements, and P.L. 480/S.108 borrowers about delays in adjusting for falling market interest rates.  However, loans were cited only occasionally as factors in enterprise success, which was seen as depending primarily on borrowers' managerial abilities, or in the case of enterprise failure, on the Dominican economy in general and the borrower's subsector in particular.  Half the borrowers said they would have proceeded with their projects even without the loans, largely because of the availability of other financing.  FIDE borrowers were the most likely not to have proceeded without program financing. The diversity of the enterprises financed and the general level of borrowers' managerial and technical abilities leads to the subjective judgment that developments in nontraditional products, agricultural exports, generation of foreign exchange, and the creation of employment were favorable. USAID had a small degree of influence on the evolution of government thinking on subsidized interest rates. However, invoking such a change in a system where political authorities have long controlled the entire market economy is difficult.","Delivery order no. 20","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-1406-I-00-0033-00","","9/1/1992 12:00:00 AM","","Agribusiness|Investment promotion|Commercial farming|Food for Peace Title I|Agricultural credit|Industrial credit|Agricultural production credit|Agricultural enterprises","Dominican Republic","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABE707.pdf","28,955 KB","001335 - Chemonics International Consulting Div.","","008537 - USAID.

"Final external evaluation of an institutional support grant (9/89-9/92) to the American Society of Agricultural Consultants (ASACI). The evaluation focused on two issues:  (1) ASACI's success/failure in promoting agribusiness in the Asia/Near East (ANE) region through the establishment of joint ventures between U.S. investors and local agribusinesses; and (2) ASACI's progress in becoming a self-sustaining organization. Taking into account difficult circumstances (including management and administrative problems within ASACI, political turmoil in countries in the region, and turnover of key ASACI and USAID personnel), ASACI's approach to agribusiness development has generally been successful in inducing U.S. investments.  However, this was true only in those countries where Mission staff had a clear interest and commitment to fostering private agribusiness development.  On the other hand, the grant has contributed little, if anything, to strengthening ASACI's ability to become financially self-sufficient. In regard to USAID's management of the grant, the following findings are noted.  (1) The ANE Bureau did not adequately promote the grant and ASACI's role to USAID Missions, nor did it provide adequate monitoring of ASACI to ensure optimal and efficient use of grant funds.  (2) The grant agreement did not clearly specify guidelines as to ASACI's approach, use of funds, the timing of disbursements, or reporting obligations, nor did it incorporate a buy-in mechanism which would have facilitated the ability of Missions to engage ASACI's services for follow-on activities, resulting in long delays in follow-ons. Future projects of this type should be designed to complement Mission-funded long-term agribusiness development projects.","Delivery order no. 13","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","PDC-1406-I-00-0034-00","","9/1/1992 12:00:00 AM","","Agribusiness|Foreign investment|Joint ventures|Investment promotion|Economic self sufficiency","Asia|Middle East|USA","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABE709.pdf","1,996 KB","006958 - International Resources Group (IRG)","","007355 - USAID.

"During the life of the project malaria transmission has been contained at an acceptable level while insecticide usage was gradually reduced.  The project has not reached the stated nationwide target of maintaining Annual Parasite Incidence (API) at or below 0.5 cases per 1,000 population, but reported an acceptable API of 0.89 for 1991, based on the rural population. In 1991 Punjab was the only province to maintain the incidence below 0.5 cases per 1,000, with a reported API of 0.3.  The proportion of slides taken by passive case detection was 25% in 1991, an improvement from previous levels but well below the target. Experience has shown that the malaria situation in Pakistan deteriorates whenever external donor assistance ceases.  The GOP must demonstrate increased self-reliance even as it seeks alternative sources of external funding for unavoidable imports such as insecticides, spare parts and other commodities, which it is estimated will cost about $5 million per year. As dependence on insecticide spraying is reduced, a new malaria control strategy must be based on better knowledge of the epidemiological situation.  An information system must be developed which is sensitive enough to provide early warning of epidemics and to monitor the situation.  Operational research must be given higher priority so that control efforts are focused on localities at highest risk.  Studies must be conducted to gain an understanding of various risk factors.  The role of Anopheles stephensi and other domestic anopheline mosquitoes in malaria transmission must be clarified. The transmission of Plasmodium falciparum must be carefully monitored, as this species now constitutes 40% of all malaria cases and chloroquine resistance is widespread.  A reduction in the number of houses programmed for spraying has been gradually attained since 1988, in accordance with the adopted policies. The percentage of houses to be sprayed is already well below 25% of existing houses, without noticeable negative effect. The process of integrating malaria control into the health sector, which is under way, must be extended throughout the rural areas of all provinces of Pakistan, both to obtain information and to make diagnostic and treatment capabilities more widely available.  The reduction in entomological surveillance is acceptable as long as emphasis is placed on increased case detection and treatment.  However, as insecticide coverage is held level or increased, surveillance activities will need to be strengthened. Well-established malathion resistance in An. stephensi and the potential for increased resistance in the primary vector, An. culicifacies, present serious problems.  Because of the diminishing efficacy of malathion, routine insecticide susceptibility testing must be increased, and extended to other classes of insecticides that may be required in the future.  The cost-effectiveness of any new insecticide should not be calculated on cost per ton or per applied area, but expressed in terms of reduction of transmission in comparison with malathion. For this analysis, detailed epidemiological and operations research is essential. There is a need to provide better career opportunities to malaria control staff.  Some senior staff posts remain vacant and few young people are available.  With the termination of donor support, malaria control operations face many difficulties, but the staff problem must be given high priority. Intersectoral coordination must be established with agriculture, irrigation, education, and other relevant areas of national and provincial governments. Links should also be established with academic institutions.  The team believes that under the present conditions -- GOP budget cuts, withdrawal of donor funds, and increased rainfall and flooding -- the GOP will find it difficult to sustain an effective malaria control program.

"This report assesses the administration of the PVO registration process by USAID Missions in the Africa Bureau.  Its purpose is to assess the impact of the registration process on USAID relationships with local PVO's and determine if the process serves as a disincentive for African NGO's to work with USAID Missions.  Based on interviews, document review, and visits to four countries (Kenya, Uganda, Mali, and Senegal), the report discusses the growing interest of the Africa Bureau in working with indigenous private organizations, describes the registration process and the standards that are applied when registering an applicant organization, and reviews several issues and problems that most Missions will deal with when designing and applying registration procedures.  Missions tend to regard registration as a Washington-imposed requirement which necessitates a heavy burden of monitoring and recordkeeping for small, understaffed PVO's, as well as on Missions themselves. some registration requirements are not suited to local conditions.  Local PVO's by and large feel that the registration requirements are reasonable and that the process is essentially constructive.  At the same, they note that it is costly, time- consuming, and often frustrating.  Particular problems include inappropriate registration criteria, unclear criteria, and intrusive documentation requirements.  Several recommendations are made.

"Midterm evaluation of project to increase the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of primary education in Honduras.  The evaluation covers the period 1986-8/91. To date, 75% of disbursements have gone toward components to improve the educational process (textbook development, teacher training, and construction), and only 25% toward components to improve information (research, evaluation, and management information system).  As a result, the first set of components are showing major accomplishments in terms of planned outputs and the second set is not.  The interactive instructional radio component has been canceled. The textbook component produced new texts and guides for grades 1-2, and then was redirected to produce materials more suitable for multi-grade classrooms, under a new program called Innovacion Escolar. While production has generally been successful, the component has not been coordinated well with the teacher training or evaluation components.  The evaluation component did not even develop learning objectives for grades 1-3 until 1991, while teacher training has been theoretical, removed from the realities of the classroom, particularly the challenges of the multi-grade classroom.  However, the evaluation and teacher training components are shifting focus under the reforms of Innovacion Escolar. The Ministry of Education has been very successful in carrying out a community-based, low-cost approach to school construction, with over 400 new classrooms built and over 1,000 existing classrooms renovated.  The only aspect of this component not successfully completed was the preventive maintenance program designed under a previous USAID project. The research component has produced only 4 of 20 targeted studies and no conferences.  As for the MIS, there is no consensus about the role it is to play and there is concern about the quality of the data being produced. Overall, with the textbook, training, and construction components mostly on the track, prospects for improving student performance in Honduras are favorable.  Further, the MOE's new Innovacion Escolar represents a significant attempt to address the needs of rural schools with multi-grade classrooms.  The changes it has brought in the textbook and teacher training activities are likely to enhance the effectiveness of the project,  The less successful activities (evaluation, research, and MIS) have suffered from poorly planned and coordinated TA and from lack of Honduran expertise. It is recommended that the project focus on the educational input components and consolidate the information components into one unit. Lessons learned are as follows.  (1) Monitoring provides the crucial link between the various stages of project design, implementation, and evaluation.  Successful monitoring and evaluation require a clear delegation of responsibility and establishment of baseline conditions to show project impact.  (2) Accurate assessment of the host country's human, physical, and financial capabilities is essential for implementing and institutionalizing project activities.  (3) The TA team let the need to meet very demanding production schedules outweigh training concerns.  (4) Results of studies and activities must be widely publicized in the national language.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","LAC-0032-C-00-9036-00","","3/1/1992 12:00:00 AM","","Educational development|Primary education|Educational materials|Textbooks|School buildings|Educational reform|Building construction|Teacher training","Honduras","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABE740.pdf","32,432 KB","000223 - Academy for Educational Development, Inc.

"Evaluates the GEMINI project, which provides research and expert services to A.I.D. and intermediary organizations that assist microenterprises.  Midterm evaluation covers the period 9/89-9/92 This valuable project has established itself as A.I.D.'s primary activity in the field of small and microenterprise development; it has a highly regarded technical capability and is a vast improvement over previous A.I.D./W efforts in this field.  The project has had an impact on shaping the policies of U.S. and host country PVO's/NGO's that implement small enterprise programs on a business-like basis, and has influenced the choice of some organizations to take a more business-like path.  The project has also served to broaden understanding of financial issues in small enterprise development, e.g., self-sufficiency, market rate lending, and commercial savings and credit services, and it has contributed to wider use of subsector analysis in the design and implementation of small/microenterprise assistance. Management and staffing have been excellent, both on the part of A.I.D./PRE, the prime contractor (Development Alternatives, Inc.), and its subcontractors, which include Michigan State University and several PVO's.  Perhaps for the first time in an A.I.D./W project, a private consulting firm, a university, and a group of nonprofit organizations have joined together, amicably, to serve A.I.D.'s needs both in Washington and in the field. Also unusual is the fact that the same A.I.D./PRE project manager has been involved in the project from its design to the present time. The following issues need to be addressed.  (1) The number of buy-ins (almost 2 per month) has exceeded expectations, requiring considerable management resources from project personnel.  (2) Requests for project TA from Central and Eastern Europe and the New Independent States have also necessitated the use of considerable staff resources.  (3) In Africa, project efforts have been productive at the Mission level but appear fragmented at the Bureau/regional level.  (4) With A.I.D.'s attention shifting to trade and investment programs, some are questioning the rationale for microenterprise assistance. Recommendations are made in these areas.","Delivery order no. 7|Project title: Growth and equity through microenterprise investment|(GEMINI)|Project title: Implementing policy change (IPC)","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-5451-I-00-1026-00","","9/1/1992 12:00:00 AM","","Microenterprises|Small scale enterprises|Management research|Economic analysis|Business support services","Central and Eastern Europe|New Independent States|Africa","","","001335 - Chemonics International Consulting Div.","","007087 - USAID.

"Evaluates the International Center for Economic Growth (ICEG), whose major activity is to promote market-oriented economic policies in the Third World.  ICEG, which was established by the Institute for Contemporary Studies of San Francisco, receives most of its funds from A.I.D. ICEG's work has proven valuable in changing the perspectives of economic policymakers in poor countries.  It does this primarily by nourishing indigenous ""correspondent"" institutes (242 of them in 94 countries) that use applied economic analysis and empirical research to demonstrate that free markets can improve the economic conditions of the poor.  ICEG maintains intensive contacts with 30 of these corresponding institutes, most of which are well-established research and policy organizations, many of them in Latin America. ICEG has allocated the largest share of its resources to subsidizing the publication of books, monographs, papers, etc. To date, 136 publications have been disseminated, covering a wide range of subjects. The authors are highly reputable, and the style is accessible to policymakers.  The publications do not break new ground, but this is not their primary objective.  ICEG also:  organizes conferences and regional meetings; arranges joint research projects and special projects with correspondent institutions; and distributes a quarterly newsletter to some 20,000 recipients. Despite its excellent performance, ICEG's impact could be increased. ICEG should continue its current intention of reallocating effort from the publication program to the correspondent institutes, because achievement of favorable policy may be more effectively promoted by stronger local institutions than by emphasis on publications.  Research projects should also be cut back.  More allocations should be made to institutes in poorer countries.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-0095-I-33-9097-00","","8/1/1992 12:00:00 AM","","Market economy|Publications|Private organizations|Economic policy|Institutional linkages|Policy analysis|Advocacy|Economic research|Institution building|Resource allocation|Information dissemination","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABE779.pdf","1,617 KB","006727 - Development Alternatives, Inc.

"A characteristic feature of A.I.D.'s foreign assistance program is the in-country presence of direct-hire A.I.D. personnel.  This study examines the advantages and disadvantages of this in-country presence and identifies ways to make it more cost-effective.  The study finds that A.I.D.'s traditional system of in-country presence provides two chief advantages:  influence and program accountability.  The system provides for the development of personal relationships between A.I.D. foreign service officers and host country counterparts and, in turn, allows program delivery to occur with a unique sensitivity to host countries' political and cultural atmosphere.  Program accountability benefits from a higher quality of implementation, faster disbursement rates, and prompt decisionmaking. The study also found disadvantages with in-country presence, particularly a tendency toward a paternalistic approach that thwarts recipient governments' ability to handle their own affairs; excessive use of U.S. experts, even when qualified local experts are available; and over-bureaucratization of medium-sized and large Missions.  However, the study concludes that A.I.D.'s in-country presence gives the United States a competitive edge in delivering economic and development assistance and should be retained as the cornerstone of A.I.D.'s operational mode.  At the same time, there are several ways in which A.I.D. can maintain the benefits of in-country presence while reducing operating costs:  by being more selective about the functions direct hires perform overseas, reducing documentation requirements, distinguishing more clearly between development and political programs, and making more concerted efforts to lead recipient countries to self-reliance.  A series of action recommendations are presented in conclusion.","Summary: PN-ABG-009|Summary: PN-ABG-041|Related document: PN-ABN-023|Related document: PN-ADX-547","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","10/1/1992 12:00:00 AM","","USAID|Personnel management|Development program management|Development program implementation|Development administration","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAX260.pdf","5,411 KB","006917 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to reorient agricultural policy toward medium and small farm production in Ecuador.  The evaluation focuses on the period since 6/90, when the project was amended to focus explicitly on institutional development of the Ministry of Agriculture (MAG) and the private Institute for Agricultural Strategies (IDEA). Although still fragile in many respects, the project has already had significant impacts on public understanding of agricultural policy issues and the process of formulating market-oriented agricultural policies in Ecuador.  IDEA has contributed to the formulation of agricultural policy in several areas, the three most conspicuous being regional economic integration, basic grains marketing, and natural resources policy. the MAG's Division of Policy Analysis (DAP) produces regular crop monitoring and outlook reports, which are not only utilized in MAG decisionmaking, but are disseminated widely and broadly beyond the Ministry.  The introduction of formal annual planning has been a very positive development, giving a sharper focus to both IDEA and MAG activities. As for specific outputs:  (1) the Market News Reporting System has been noteworthy for continuous dissemination of market information, but the quality of its data could be improved; (2) the Crop and Livestock Reporting System is on the right track, but at least 3 more years will be needed to ensure sustainability; (3) the Agroclimatic Impact Assessment System has just begun to produce bulletins that trace relationships between climatic variables and agricultural production; (4) the Computer System Support Activity has evolved into an effective organization, but the long-term sustainability of service quality in a public sector environment is dubious. Management is an area of concern.  From the beginning, there have been problems with the placement and relationships of the function of policy analysis within the MAG -- problems attributable in part to a failure to distinguish clearly between policy analysis and planning and in part to larger problems with organizational structure.  While IDEA's management is improving markedly, there is still room for progress, especially with respect to staffing.  For both institutions, however, financial sustainability is the most critical issue.  Even though much of MAG's and IDEA's output is a public good, it is unrealistic to expect user fees to cover full costs.  The MAG continues to depend heavily on external funding -- P.L. 480 local currency -- to finance operating costs.  Steps must be taken now to start transferring responsibility for funding to the MAG.  IDEA has launched a number of initiatives to expand its funding base, but the only way to guarantee financial sustainability is to establish an endowment that would generate enough income to cover half the Institute's operating costs.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","6/1/1992 12:00:00 AM","","Institution building|Agricultural policy|Policy analysis|Private organizations|Government departments|Agricultural production|Small farms","Ecuador","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNABM577.pdf","1,684 KB","001335 - Chemonics International Consulting Div.","","001244 - U.S. Dept. of Agriculture|007275 - USAID.

"Evaluates the human resource activities of two Africare projects in Guinea-Bissau -- the Vocational Skills Training Project (6570014) and the Tombali Sustainable Rural Initiatives Project (6570020) -- and assesses how Africare could use its human resource capabilities to contribute to USAID/GB's Trade and Investment Support (TIPS) Program. Africare has performed well in carrying out both participant training and vocational skills training, although both activities took a long time to get off the ground.  The participant training courses gradually evolved to target the private sector, and Africare has worked for the past several years in direct contact with private enterprises without a government counterpart.  The courses appear to have been well organized and relevant, the participant selection process was appropriate, and the costs of the courses were reasonable. The vocational training project focuses on the support of two government training centers and their transition to financially sustainable market driven operations.  The work at the experimental Community Training Center in Bedanda was particularly successfully in achieving a new orientation on the part of the center's administration. The level and appropriateness of the courses also improved and the center is now meeting an existing demand for training of this type.  The activities at the other center, the Experimental Agricultural Training Center in Empada, were less successful, and activities ceased in 3/92. The Tombali project suffered a long delay in initiating activities due to Government resistance in allowing Africare to work directly with private sector associations, without a government intermediary.  Nine association trainers are now working with four village-level associations to identify new commercial activities and organize themselves to achieve the desired outcomes.  Africare trainers have worked in close collaboration with these groups, providing basic business skills training and other organizational development skills. The groups appear to be positioned to take advantage of market opportunities, although the expansion of economic activities has not yet occurred.  The next phase of operations, in which credit will be extended to some of the associations and the number of associations expanded, will be critical for the success of the project.  Things appear to be on track, although care must be taken not to move too fast. It appears that Africare's experience and expertise could be very valuable to the TIPS program.  The contact with and understanding of the private sector that Africare has acquired through work at the base of the economic pyramid should be tapped by the new program as an input into policy decisions and a reality check for program activities. Africare's experience in organizational development and in providing training for the private sector could also be valuable.  It is recommended, inter alia, that Africare expand its activities to work at a higher level, where the multiplier effect will be greater.

"Evaluates project, implemented by John Snow, Inc. (JSI), to support USAID's worldwide child survival (CS) program.  Interim evaluation covers the first 2.5 years of the 4 year project, which began in 1989. The project overlapped one year with its predecessor, REACH I, which was also implemented by JSI.  This circumstance had negative and positive aspects.  The overlap created managerial difficulties; for example, the director of REACH II was at times also the Deputy or Acting Director of REACH I.  Also, while there are advantages in planning, authorizing, and contracting for follow-ons before the completion of predecessors, in instances such as this -- where the successful bidder on the follow-on also implements the predecessor, and there is substantial funding remaining in the earlier project -- there is a risk that the follow-on may get off to a slow start.  On the other hand, one of the project's strengths has been its capacity to draw upon the experience of REACH I and other projects managed by JSI, such as MotherCare and SEATS. Neither the project paper nor the contract specified how the project's impacts on health were to be measured; in fact, the contract calls upon JSI itself to establish progress indicators. The indicators which JSI have identified have usually been qualitative and refer to process and outputs rather than health as such.  Due to nature of the project, and the difficulty of describing its results in terms of indicators such as immunization coverage, disease incidence, and morbidity and mortality, such indicators may be appropriate.  Given this, REACH II has performed well in the technical areas in which it is involved. The project has many strengths, mostly notably its contributions to management of immunization programs, but also in the area of acute respiratory infection control.  JSI has proven itself responsive to unanticipated requests, culturally sensitive, capable of providing high-quality TA and of effectively collaborating with other donors and in-country entities, and able to provide strong management even in the face of political instabilities in host countries (as well as A.I.D.'s own uncertain funding and policy environment).  REACH II also provides a leading example of co-funding with other donors in providing TA.  In many cases, the project's contribution to, say immunization logistics management or cost analysis, is complementary to existing programs. In contrast to REACH I, the follow-on project has suffered from diminishing Mission buy-ins.  The reasons for this range from changes in funding priorities and the buy-in process itself, to factors specific to health and CS interventions (e.g., the large numbers of other donors active in the field).  USAID missions in four CS emphasis countries -- Haiti, Kenya, the Philippines, and Yemen -- have used buy-ins to finance a full time presence in their programs; the project has also been active in providing emergency TA to four Central Asian republics of the former Soviet Union, and is beginning new initiatives in Nigeria, Morocco, and Kenya. While  the discrete and short-term nature of most activities has limited the project's ability to systematically promote institution building, the project has consistently given attention to sustainability within the context of specific activities, e.g., by promoting routine service delivery systems rather than one-shot immunization campaigns. Some outstanding concerns about the project include the following: (1) self-evaluation requirements have been overshadowed by day-to-day operational demands; (2) the unique capabilities of REACH II subcontractors have been underutilized; (3) the project has been slow to engage the for-profit sector in its programs; (4) attention to IEC has been limited, by direction of USAID; (5) activities proposed for the remainder of the contract may overextend REACH capabilities; and (6) competition with contractors for other, overlapping projects has, on occasion, discouraged collaboration.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","DPE-5939-C-00-7003-00","","5/1/1992 12:00:00 AM","","Technical assistance|Child health care|Child survival activities|Immunizations|Health care administration","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABE867.pdf","2,087 KB","000981 - Pragma Corp.","","006943 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of a project to strengthen the institutional capacity of the Government of Jamaica to attract foreign investment in nontraditional export crops.  Evaluation covers the period from 1985 to 9/92, one year before the revised PACD. The project has had only marginal effects on nontraditional agricultural production and exports.  Agro-21, which implemented the project from 1985-89, failed to attract large agribusiness investments into the project area.  However, Agro-21 efficiently rehabilitated the Rio Cobre Irrigation Works (RCIW), which increased productivity for traditional crops.  In addition, AGRO-21's policy initiatives led to the creation of a National Irrigation Commission (NIC), which assumed project implementation in 1989 and achieved notable successes in restructuring water user rates and collection procedures in its work on RCIW rehabilitation subprojects. The NIC is still weak institutionally, however, and lacks the capability to coordinate programs with other government agencies for crop diversification or small farmer linkages.  During the RBIC rehabilitation, insufficient funds were provided for farmer education, and as a result efficiencies in on-farm irrigation are much below acceptable engineering standards.  Moreover, the NIC's extension department is understaffed and is not likely to be effective in providing training programs to increase water efficiency in the near future.  On the other hand, sustainability of the NIC's operations and maintenance system is promising because of low energy costs associated with RCIW's gravity-fed surface water system. The Agricultural Development Corporation's divestment program was efficiently implemented for irrigable land in the RCIW area, but due in part to the collapse of the Rio Cobre Dam and in part to increasing urbanization (as the Kingston Metropolitan area extends into the divested area), it is unlikely that the project will have any future impact on crop diversification. Lessons learned include the following.  (1) Project designers should be certain that the targeted country possesses all elements essential to the success of nontraditional export-oriented agriculture before proceeding with planning.  In this project, unrealistic goals were based on cursory assumptions about Jamaica's attractiveness to foreign agribusiness investors.  (2) Agricultural irrigation success is determined by two factors: the cost-effectiveness of water delivery, and the efficient use of water once it has been delivered.  (3) Development projects should include budgeted line items for baseline data management, measurement of impact, and maintenance of management information systems.  In this project, although baseline data were collected, there was no continuous systems for monitoring changes in performance.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","532-0123-C-00-2037-00","","10/1/1992 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural investments|Crop diversification|Nontraditional agricultural exports|Private sector|Institution building|Agricultural development|Irrigated farming|Irrigation system construction","Jamaica","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABE897.pdf","4,916 KB","005072 - Tropical Research and Development, Inc.","","008563 - USAID.

"In response to a request from USAID/Bolivia, the Vector Biology and Control Project sent a team of four scientists to conduct a technical evaluation of the Chagas' disease control project, a pilot project, supported under the Community and Child Health (CCH) project, designed to develop and field test community-based control methods for eventual use in a national program for the control of Chagas' disease. Chagas' disease is endemic and widespread in Bolivia and represents a critical national public health problem.  A national program must aim for sustainable disease control through community-based activities for house and peridomicilary improvement, health education and judicious use of insecticides. Other components of a national program are a safe blood supply to eliminate infection through transfusions and control of congenital transmission of the disease. The evaluation team met with USAID, Ministry of Health, and project staff in La Paz, and reviewed project activities and accomplishments as well as plans for future activities.  The team also reviewed project baseline data, visited project sites to inspect house and peridomicilary improvement, and reviewed laboratory facilities and the health education and community participation activities in Cochabamba, Chuquisaca and Tarija, including those managed by collaborating PVO's. This complex and multi-faceted pilot project has made important progress during a year and a half of activities.  Extensive baseline data detailing the magnitude of the disease in the pilot communities have been collected.  Low-cost operational schemes for house and peridomicilary improvement have been pretested, and manuals documenting these activities have been written. Laboratory work on insecticides and other aspects of vector control has been accomplished.  Community organization and motivation and health education have received a great deal of attention as well. In general, the evaluation team felt that the project had made significant achievements.  Many of the components necessary for a national Chagas' disease control program have been effectively pretested.  In reviewing future project plans with project staff, evaluators made several recommendations which appear in detail in the report.  The team strongly believes that the pilot project should be extended so that all of the technical information required for a national Chagas' disease control program can be obtained.

"Project assistance completion report on a project (5/83-12/89), implemented by Escuela Agricola Panamericana (EAP) under three OPG's, to (1) develop cost-effective integrated pest management (IPM) technologies for dissemination to farmers in Honduras, and (2) upgrade EAP's regional IPM training and publication programs. The project was an impressive success, in many cases exceeding its research and training targets.  The research component:  (1) developed 5 crop-specific IPM programs (for corn, beans, cucurbits, and crucifers), as planned; (2) produced 29 extension bulletins, 19 over target, as well as a dictionary of rural Honduran terminology for use in extension work; (3) added 45,000 new specimens (5,000 over target) to its insect collection, one of the largest in Central America; (4) collected/catalogued over 20,000 pest species (including several exotic insects for biological control of particularly harmful agricultural pests), vs. 0 targeted; and (5) conducted 59 special studies, vs. target of 23.  The research, which successfully incorporated the expertise of anthropologists and other social scientists, yielded a total of 181 books and scholarly papers (a list is appended to the PACR). The training component:  (1) produced 6 library guides, 50 audiovisual programs, 17 teaching documents, and 550 permanent teaching aids, vs. targets of 5, 18, 15, and 200; (2) trained 75 Central American teachers (half of them Hondurans), 741 students, 1,885 farmers, and 900 technicians from the Ministry of Natural Resources (vs. targets of 70, 720, 190, and 0); and (3) developed 7 new courses, 3 over target.  It is believed that about 20% of Honduras' vegetable producers have adopted at least some IPM practices as a result of the project. EAP now has a 24-person IPM staff (vs. 2 in 1983) and has established IPM centers for pesticide use, biological control, diagnostics, agrocecological inventory, pedagogical materials development, and training.  Two planned outputs -- the development of 2 video programs and the training of 2 Honduran IPM consultants -- were dropped, in large part due to the excessive costs involved. EAP's IPM program is widely regarded as the most complete and innovative such program in Central America and has kept its operations intact since the cessation of A.I.D. support.  Prior to project closeout, EAP signed a contract with ROCAP to serve as a subcontractor under the RENARM project, and also signed important contracts with four other private and public entities. The project's success is attributable to:  (1) EAP's status as a private educational institution with a proven track record in practical, agricultural education and a vested interest in institutionalizing a strong academic department; (2) EAP's investment of its own resources through matching contributions, and its ability to attract support; (3) an excellent project leader and management team; (4) the project's interdisciplinary orientation; and (5) almost 7 continuous years of A.I.D. assistance.  However, the shifts in financing arrangements over the 7-year span did not benefit the project, but led to frustration and increases in paperwork and overhead costs. Similar changes in funding mechanisms should be avoided in future projects, especially those financed from local currency generations.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","6/1/1992 12:00:00 AM","","Integrated pest management|Agricultural research|Agricultural training|Agricultural schools|Institution building|Agricultural technology|Beneficiary count","Honduras","","","008555 - USAID.

"Presents final Mission report on a local currency grant (1985-91) to finance scholarships for financially disadvantaged Honduran students at Escuela Agricola Panamericana (EAP), a regional 4-year agricultural secondary school also known as El Zamorano. The project was a success.  A total of 378 1-year scholarships to EAP were financed; of these 83 went to women, the remainder to men. Twenty-six of the female recipients and 114 of the male recipients completed the entire 4-year program and received their degrees.  EAP has a rigorous academic program, but also provides excellent practical preparation for the world of agricultural work.  Graduates are highly sought after. Perhaps the simplicity of the grant is what contributed most to its success.  It was not encumbered by numerous components or unreachable outputs.  Also, the grantee is an educational institution with well-established standards, and very capable of determining the eligibility of potential scholarship students as well as their financial need.  Third, EAP's excellent training ensured that the grant would over time have a positive impact on Honduran agriculture.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","6/1/1992 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural schools|Higher education|Scholarships|Disadvantaged groups","Honduras","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABE946.pdf","105 KB","008555 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to provide rehabilitative health services -- orthopedic surgery, prosthetics, and physical therapy -- to disabled persons in Uganda.  Evaluation covers the period 1989-2/92. Each component is moving at a different pace.  Orthopedic surgery -- implemented by Health Volunteers Overseas (HVO) -- has progressed the furthest and has the fewest problems; this element is almost ready for transition to local operation.  The prosthetic/orthotic component -- implemented by the British Red Cross (BRC) -- is struggling in some areas, but has increased production of artificial feet and knees from 6 to 20 per month, although the target of 100 is not possible.  The A.I.D.-financed revolving fund has allowed access to prostheses to those previously unable to afford them.  BRC also produces and fits orthotic braces, orthopedic shoes, crutches, and a much sought after three-wheel wheelchair of local design and materials.  It also operates a patient hostel outside Kampala.  The third component, comprising physical therapy and up-country prosthetic workshops -- implemented by the International Service Volunteer Association (AVSI) -- has not really gotten off the ground yet due to lack of trained staff.  Unfortunately, staff training is also behind schedule, and AVSI, for reasons that are not clear, has been reluctant to use physical therapy volunteers who have been offered through HVO. The relative success of the orthopedic surgery component appears related to two factors:  a dedicated, energetic leader, and the fact that it is newly designed and has a new implementor, whereas the other components are an attempt to change service-provider, emergency-mentality organizations into institution building trainers, a role they have accepted slowly and with difficulty. The Ugandan government is pleased with the program and wishes it to continue, with expanded external support.  USAID/U is also pleased:  the project has been highly visible and photogenic (visited by Senators Leahy and Mikulski and U.S. Health and Human services Secretary Sullivan).  Moreover, it is a popular activity in the health sector, where the Mission has larger investments in the more controversial areas of family planning and AIDS, and the management burden is slight. Although physically close, the three components do not intertwine, despite the efforts of a Committee chaired by the HVO director.  USAID/U has taken a relaxed position in regard to management, and views the HVO director as de facto project manager (a view in which the director, justifiably, does not concur).  A similar project in Mozambique, though generally progressing faster than this one, has similar problems with lack of Mission involvement.","Assignment no.

"Between 1968 and 1988, the Philippine national family planning (FP) program and FP activities supported by A.I.D. through three projects were virtually identical.  The effectiveness of these efforts, a major aim of which was to support an outreach program initiated in 1976, is assessed herein. On the positive side, the FP program established a delivery system which provided easy access to affordable FP services, while the outreach effort, although it fell into disarray in the late 1980's, transformed an urban, clinic-based program into a national community-based delivery system.  Costs were quite high (especially for outreach), but analysis reveals a break-even by 1985 and a 5:1 benefit-cost ratio by the year 2000. However, declines during in population growth rates and in total fertility rates were not a result of the methods in which A.I.D. made its greatest investment.  The outreach program was unable to increase demand for reversible methods (despite massive promotional efforts), apparently due to lack of appeal, a fact reflected in higher discontinuation rates for these methods in the Philippines than in neighboring countries.  The only methods evidencing increasing use and demand -- voluntary surgical contraception (VSC) and the various forms of rhythm -- were not especially promoted by the program, though A.I.D. did play a major role by training doctors and nurses in VSC.  The increased demand for these two methods was due in large part to the promotional efforts of nongovernmental organizations (NGO's), who served as a major force for innovation and training for the FP program. Over and above individual weaknesses (e.g., inadequate training of field workers in contraceptive methods, failure to develop a long-term strategic plan and establish realistic targets), the program lacked financial sustainability; from the outset it was largely dependent on external assistance, most of it provided by A.I.D., whose too early withdrawal of funds for training further undermined sustainability. This teaches the importance of developing a financial strategy systematically.  It also shows that developing countries cannot shoulder an increasing part of huge FP programs without sustained economic growth.","Summary: PN-ABG-007","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","10/1/1992 12:00:00 AM","","Family planning services|Family planning promotion programs|Health outreach services|Contraceptive agents and devices|Contraceptive prevalence|Private voluntary organizations|Community based delivery","Philippines","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAX261.pdf","4,065 KB","006917 - USAID.

"Final report on a grant (9/89-11/92) to Save the Children Federation (SCF) to conduct child survival activities in Sudan's Eastern and Kordofan States. SCF's first step was the compilation of family rosters through home visits by trained village volunteers.  These rosters were computerized and used for targeting at-risk populations (malnourished children, pregnant women), and for monitoring and following up on interventions. The rosters are continually updated and form the basis of the project's information system. Future information efforts will focus on increasing communities' awareness of and responsibility for health information. SCF has worked closely with the Ministry of Health (MOH) at all levels and is currently implementing the MOH immunization program in 34 villages.  The MOH is committed to providing a reliable source of vaccines, and SCF will be working with village health committees to take on their own vaccine transport and increase their responsibility for monitoring the program. Mothers are being trained informally to use oral rehydration salts (ORS) and fluids available at home to combat diarrhea as soon as it starts.  Referral of prolonged cases and continued feeding and breastfeeding both during and after diarrhea are also being urged.  SCF distributes ORS sachets -- 10,000 the last project year alone -- which are provided by the MOH free of charge, although there seems to be a community willingness to pay for them.  The possibility of adding a slight charge, which SCF believes would improve the appropriateness of ORS use, will continue to be explored. Nutrition efforts have focused on informal education of mothers and demonstrations of locally available foods.  Mothers' ignorance regarding breastfeeding and weaning practices was found to be a major cause of malnutrition in children aged 6-35 months, with lack of food and poor food hygiene as contributing factors. Growth monitoring has been discontinued as a primary focus of the nutrition program, although it will continue to be used as an evaluation tool.  The project recently began providing Vitamin A supplements to children under age 3 and lactating mothers. It has been impossible so far to implement child spacing due to the sensitivity of the issue.  However, SCF trainers have now gained a level of trust with villagers and are ready to begin a very conservative program which stresses the health benefits of child spacing and identifies sites for distribution of supplies. With malaria endemic and medicine in short supply, SCF has instituted a chloroquine revolving fund; it is currently in place in the four villages where there are MOH workers and should be extended to the remaining villages in the coming year with the help of VHC's.  The latter have been established in each village in which SCF is working and form, along with the MOH-appointed community health workers, the basis for the long-term sustainability of the program. Finally, a survey was conducted 8-9/92 of the knowledge and practice of mothers of children under age 2 in regard to nutrition, malaria, diarrhea disease control, immunization, maternal care, child spacing, and water and sanitation.  In general, survey results showed higher than national rates. (Complete findings are included in this report.)","Evaluation period: 1 Sep 1989-30 Nov 1992","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","OTR-0500-A-00-9149-00","","10/1/1992 12:00:00 AM","","Rural areas|Child survival activities|Community health care|Child health care|Community participation|Health committees|Beneficiary count","Sudan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABF007.pdf","1,067 KB","001407 - Save the Children (U.S.)","","006982 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to expand community-based maternal/child health interventions into two slum areas of Nairobi,  The evaluation compared information from a 1992 rapid assessment survey and routine and community based information systems with data from a 1990 baseline survey. The circumstances under which the project has taken place have made achievement of its purposes difficult.  For example, improvements in sanitation and reductions in child diarrhea have been impeded due to a water shortage caused by drought. Deterioration in the purchasing power of slum residents, attributed to structural adjustment, has frustrated efforts to improve children's nutritional status.  Problems in coordination between the Nairobi City Commission and the Provincial Commissioner's Office have also limited achievements. The immunization program has been a bright spot.  Coverage is at 87%, surpassing the objective of 65%, and resulting in a great reduction in vaccine-preventable diseases.  Although malnutrition is low, the goal of reducing the percentage of malnourished children to 30% cannot be said to have been achieved since data show an overall deterioration in children's growth patterns; the high incidence of diarrhea and diminished purchasing power of families are mainly to blame.  The percentage of eligible women using family planning services did not change from 1990, remaining at about 46%.  While data on clinic attendance for pregnant women were not available, about 67% of women had registered at a health facility for prenatal care, and it was felt that attendance had increased; the recent introduction of fees may trigger a reversal of this trend.  HIV/AIDS prevention activities were incorporated into the project during implementation, and have contributed to an increase in condom use by a factor of over 100.  AIDS prevention has utilizing an innovative approach in which AIDS patients participate as facilitators in community AIDS awareness workshops.  In regard to malaria prevention and control, the project has begun to establish a laboratory capacity, and has initiated community activities to clear drains and other potential mosquito breeding places. There have been enough community health workers (CHW's) trained to achieve an average of 38 households per CHW (vs. a target of 60), but due to a high dropout rate, the current ratio is 62 households per CHW. A need for financial compensation was a common underlying reason for dropouts.  For this and other reasons related to project sustainability, arrangements should be made to begin implementing cost recovery and community co-financing strategies.  Finally, though the community-based health information system developed by the project has been useful, high turnover among administrators has detracted from its usefulness. It is recommended that USAID extend the project 3 years to allow time to complete the processes which have been successfully initiated, and provide financial support for income generating activities.  Improving sanitation and helping slum residents generate income to support health activities will be crucial to success.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","OTR-0500-A-00-0106-00","","8/1/1992 12:00:00 AM","","Child survival activities|Maternal child health care|Infant health care|Community health care|Slum areas","Kenya","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABF009.pdf","1,551 KB","002940 - African Medical and Research Foundation (AMREF)","","006982 - USAID.

"Midterm evaluation of the Africare Child Survival Project in Ganzourgou Province, Burkina Faso.  The evaluation team, which included Ministry of Health (MOH) representatives, the Africare Child Survival Coordinator from Washington D.C., and a child survival consultant, visited villages, meet with project staff and government officials, and conducted group and individual interviews, observed activities, and reviewed documents. The main project accomplishments are 205 well trained neighborhood ""counselors"" who are functioning effectively at the household level in oral rehydration interventions and vaccination mobilization.  Each woman is supporting approximately 15 households, providing education and rehydration support when children in her neighborhood get diarrhea.  The project has also achieved a very high participation rate for growth monitoring, but this is attributable to the efforts of health promoters hired and trained by the project.  Lastly, the project has trained 23 health center nurses and midwives in oral rehydration and nutrition interventions; nurses in the impact area health centers report changing their practice in the treatment of diarrhea as a result of the training and their subsequent experience. While it is too early to truly determine the success of the model, training neighborhood women to actually carry out the interventions appears very promising, both in terms of achieving behavioral change at the household level, and in terms of being able to carry out the activities on their own with minimal support.  The messages have been kept very simple and a lot of up front training time has been invested in order to make this possible. Primary recommendations focus on the need to increase the project's interface with the MOH.  While the emphasis so far has been on the establishment and training of counselors, the project now needs to work more actively and closely with all levels of the provincial health structure in order to assure maximum impact as well as to achieve sustainability.  The project also needs to begin developing village-level structures to support and maintain the health activities of the counselors and village health teams. The project needs to expand the view of its work to one of more integrated development; this is particularly important with Africare's beginning a new water project in the area.  Lastly, the nutrition program should begin to shift its emphasis away from the weighing activity to defining and emphasizing simple messages about food intake that the counselors could carry out at the household level.

"The Honduras Vitamin A Program is being implemented in three peri-urban areas which correspond to the catchment areas of the health centers (CESAMO) in Las Crucitas, San Francisco, and 3 de Mayo. Objectives, strategies, and activities were designed in 1990 and direct field interventions began in the program's three target areas in January 1991.  This external midterm evaluation covers the first year and a half of implementation.  The six-person evaluation team visited 12 settlements in six days, and interviewed 85 persons. A primary conclusion of the evaluation is that the IEF/Honduras Vitamin A program is achieving the goals and objectives proposed and reviewed in different documents with USAID.  The level of achievement of objectives is in relation to the level of investment and efforts and shows adequate effectiveness.  The program has an important meaning for the development of the peri-urban settlements, and especially for women in these areas. The program has been flexible enough to respond to design modifications required by the community and the Ministry of Health (MOH).  An adequate information system has been developed which responds to implementation needs, though some refinements are still needed.  The most fully developed component is health education and communication.  Its activities are very efficient and adequately adapted to the cultural environment.  A large proportion of mothers have access to important CS information. Some of the diarrheal disease control (DDC) and nutrition messages need to be updated.  Program staff are well trained and supervised through an adequate information system, though information from the health information system (HIS) could be better utilized. The program has expended only half its budget in two thirds of its planned life; additional activities will be needed to utilize all project funds.  There are good relations with MOH and interesting community participation strategies are in motion that need to be reinforced. The most important recommendations focus on:  (1) refining the management of information, supervision, and personnel training; and (2) concentrating efforts on nutrition and DDC, as well as reinforcing health education and community participation.

"Evaluates Housing Guaranty (HG) program to promote the decentralization of urban services and infrastructure provision in chartered Philippine cities.  Evaluation covers FY 1992. All program goals, if not fully achieved, have been significantly advanced.  Of great benefit program was the 1991 passage of the Local Government Code, which transferred responsibility and resources for local development to local governments.  However, even with the passage of the Code, national and local leaders have not fully faced up to the challenge of urbanization, which is certain to dominate the Philippine social agenda in the coming decades. Progress on specific policy measures has been impressive. Especially significant have been:  (1) a one-third increase in city real property and business tax collections; (2) a growing number of initiatives involving the private sector in urban service provision (water supply, garbage collection and disposal, public market operations, slaughterhouses); (3) the start of a process to inventory idle public lands as a basis for converting them to productive use; (4) substantial progress in joint government-private sector housing production, with private firms having completed construction in 9 cities vs. a target of 6; and (5) the provision of land tenure and services to poor households under the Community Mortgage Program, which has initiated 65 projects in 14 cities vs. a targeted 20 projects in 8 cities. Though many of these accomplishments are impressive, targets as stated in the second tranche of the policy matrix were achieved in only three of the ten program elements.  These delays do not appear to constitute a major problem, however:  in each case the responsible agencies are moving actively to complete program requirements and no major barriers exist that seem likely to prevent full achievement in the next few months. Policy studies under the complementary training/TA project have contributed directly to several accomplishments under the policy matrix. The training/TA project has also taken other steps to facilitate the overall decentralization process, including:  a ""Sharing Program"" by which city officials have the opportunity to learn about innovative techniques from the officials of other cities who have successfully implemented them; development of the national ""Urban Development Sector Review;"" and a program to train 15-20 NGO's in developing 200 sites for 10,000 households under the Community Mortgage Program.","Urban Institute project no. 6304","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-1008-I-00-9067-00","","11/1/1992 12:00:00 AM","","Urban development|Public administration|Decentralization|Housing investment guaranty|Housing policy","Philippines","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNABM942.pdf","1,691 KB","002711 - Urban Institute (UI)","","002960 - USAID.

"Bolivia's infant and child mortality rates are the highest in South America, at 96 and 142 deaths per 1,000 live births, respectively.  In the late 1980's, Bolivia was designated a USAID Child Survival (CS) ""emphasis country"", and by 1992 CS represented about 60% of USAID's development assistance to Bolivia.  This report evaluates the impact of that assistance, with emphasis on three key initiatives:  the Community and Child Health project, USAID's major activity with the Ministry of Health (MOH); a series of Self-Financing Health Care projects, which targeted the creation and expansion of a private primary health care organization, PROSALUD; and support for Programa de Coordinacion en Supervivencia Infantil (PROCOSI), which has developed a coordinating organization for health private voluntary organizations.  Major findings include the following. (1) The MOH program has greatly expanded coverage of some basic CS services; in particular, basic immunization coverage has risen from less than 10% in 1986 to 55% in 1991.  However, the MOH was unable to distribute USAID-provided oral rehydration salts on a national level; as a result, diarrhea continues to be the leading killer of children under five.  (2) Coverage by the private sector entities, PROSALUD and PROCOSI, is relatively small, but both provide quality services.  PROSALUD in particular provides better services than the MOH and at somewhat lower costs.  (3) A major breakthrough is the achievement of sustainability of CS services in several different projects.  PROSALUD has shown the feasibility of recovering costs through user fees, even with low-income clients; encouraged by PROSALUD's success, the MOH has also begun to collect fees. Additionally, a USAID-funded debt-for-development swap will generate interest income for PVO health activities on a permanent basis.  (4) There is evidence that USAID's CS program, though arriving late on the scene, is beginning to have an impact on reducing child mortality.  The greatest opportunities for further reductions lie in the area of diarrheal disease control, and USAID should adjust its program towards this priority.","Summary highlights: PN-ABG-006","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","11/1/1992 12:00:00 AM","","Child survival activities|Infant mortality|Child mortality|Public health care|Private health care|Child health care|Private voluntary organizations|Project sustainability","Bolivia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAX262.pdf","7,975 KB","006917 - USAID.

"Evaluates non-project training (NPT) activity to train middle and senior level employees of Egypt's government and public and private sector firms in priority economic sectors. Overall, NPT is very successful, both in terms of its management and achievements.  Trainees voice unanimous praise, giving countless examples of improvements in their professional performance and citing technical, managerial, cross-cultural, language, and attitudinal changes.  Managers agree that participants work and think differently after their U.S. training, resulting in improved relationships among colleagues and with clients, higher standards, greater efficiency, and increased productivity. The project has trained 650 persons, and all have been highly qualified employees with potential to contribute to their organizations and to their country's development.  NPT has been relatively successful in recruiting private sector employees and women, and placing participants in historically black colleges and universities.  About 17% of trainees have come from the private sector -- not an minor accomplishment, given Egypt's history of public sector ownership of industries and service organizations.  Approximately 18% of participants have been women, again a significant accomplishment.  The distribution of trainees among subsectors closely mirrors Egypt's Five Year Plan, especially the trend toward privatization.  NPT has been successful in recruiting individuals to study management, marketing, and other business-related topics. Recommendations are made to further facilitate the recruitment of women and private sector employees, to improve trainee placement, and upgrade orientation, monitoring, and follow-up activities.

"The Private Enterprise Development Program (PEDP), which began in 1984, has operated more as a flexible, responsive and, at times, innovative task-oriented funding mechanism for both overseas Missions and AID/Washington than as a program with clearly defined and achievable development goals in AID recipient countries.  In any case, it has been a generally flawed program, lacking focus and the concentration needed for producing directly attributable impact on private sector development in the countries assisted, alternately, by the Near East Bureau, the Asia and Near East Bureau, the Europe and Near East Bureau and, after they split, the Near East Bureau again. This evaluation includes tables and charts covering the various functional and geographic emphases of the program, then an analysis of the five priority programming areas (trade and investment, financial markets, private sector support, training and business exchange, and privatization).  This is followed by an analysis by country and region, and analysis of program organization and administration, and a set of analytical reviews of 37 illustrative subprojects. PEDP's purpose, goals, and objectives have been too grandiose for the way the program has been structured and operated.  Even its acknowledged advantages of flexibility and timeliness of response have been blunted by inadequate staffing and inconsistent supervision and management.  In many respects, much of the PEDP's value has been in assisting AID in overcoming its own structural and procedural inadequacies.  Seen from a more broad Bureau managerial perspective, the PEDP was useful in providing the Regional Bureau with a flexible proactive programming arm with which to stimulate and implement innovative activities and promote top level Agency policy initiatives. Of the PEDP's 101 subprojects, a number were well designed and professionally implemented.  However, their impact and effectiveness cannot be measured with any certainty, mainly because no recognizable systems for project evaluation, reporting, monitoring, and follow-up were ever put into operation on a consistent basis.  Moreover, at the Mission level, the PEDP was plagued by the Agency-wide malaise of a lack of institutional memory. On another plane, the degree to which host country governments and, especially, local private sector leaders and institutions, were involved in the design and implementation of the overall program and individual subprojects -- a sine qua non for truly effective private sector development projects -- is not readily apparent from available documentation. The program has been gradually transformed by USAID policy makers over the eight years of its life from an initial concern with host country priorities to more concern for U.S. commercial interests and comparative advantages and, finally, from essentially a program of assistance to Missions' programs for private sector development to greater emphasis on Regional Bureau-perceived optimal economic development strategies, plans, objectives, and initiatives.  PEDP subprojects were frequently funded jointly by Mission funds and, more particularly, major Central Bureau-sponsored programs.  Not infrequently, the PEDP effort and subprojects have been peripheral in relation to the efforts of larger, more focused, and better financed programs and, on occasion, not in consonance with Mission or country programming priorities. The following lessons were learned:  (1) Programs with a multiplicity of participating institutions and contractors cannot function effectively with inadequate in-house staffing and organization.  Good supervision is needed to ensure optimal use of public funds.  (2) Too much was asked of the PEDP, which was actually more of a funding mechanism than a development-oriented program.  (3) Scattered efforts are hard to manage and harder to guide.  (4) Without enthusiastic Mission support and participation, subprojects' potential for success will be diminished. The major recommendations include continuation of the program (but only after thorough restructuring and reform), and changes for improved management, and greater focus.

"The Farming Systems Research (FSR) Program began in 1984.  The project was implemented in four communes in the Ruhengeri Prefecture: Nyamugali, Nyarutovu, Cyeru, and Butare. The final evaluation team found the project's training efforts, improvements to infrastructure, and work with women farmers were beneficial.  However, the project suffered as a result of poor management, the implementation team's lack of expertise in FSR, and because recommendations from previous evaluations were not followed. Positive aspects of the project were the training program and AFRICARE's construction of infrastructure.  A total of 22 Rwandans earned Ph.D., M.S., or B.S. degrees from U.S. universities, and more than half of these graduates were employed by Institut des Sciences Agronomiques du Rwanda (ISAR).  However, because of GOR policy constraints, their future in ISAR is uncertain. AFRICARE, for a modest sum of $750,000, repaired roads, installed potable water systems, built training centers, and constructed storage hangars in the project area.  These improvements will be of continuing value to the rural community. The project had a significant impact upon women though women were not specifically targeted.  The 1992 evaluation's rapid reconnaissance survey (RRS) revealed no difference between men and women's access to project personnel, resources, or information. Unfortunately, the project's failure to collect data on the number of women participants rendered impossible any disaggregation of project impacts comparatively between women and men.  However, the project worked with women farmers, who composed an estimated 40% of all farmers; women were recruited as extension agents, and were represented among Rwandan counterparts for long-term training. One constraint to project success was that the FSR/Extension (FSR/E) team that was to implement the project had no experienced leadership, nor were they qualified to practice FSR.  They conducted no complementary diagnostic or verification surveys to explore further findings of the project's preliminary survey and, thus, failed to characterize recommendation domains or identify and prioritize real constraints and problems of farmers.  Since FSR methodology was not implemented practically none of the developed or proposed technologies were subjected to requisite socioeconomic analysis.  Consequently, these technologies, such as the Lime + NPK treatment and the agroforestry species Sesbania were found to be unacceptable to farmers.  Much on-station testing and even some on-farm trials conducted could be classified as upstream research; only a few on-farm trials fell under the category of downstream research or research oriented towards solving problems and constraints of farmers. A series of evaluations, internal and external, were performed, but most recommendations of the evaluating teams were not followed.  The 1986 evaluation led to the fourth project amendment in which, unfortunately, USAID unilaterally eliminated the extension component and the extension advisor's position, compromising the project's relevance to FSR/E.  In 1988, the inspector general found the changes in the fourth amendment unacceptable and recommended an evaluation to determine the significance of extension for continued project implementation. The 1989 project evaluation that followed led to a fifth amendment, in which the extension component was reinstated. Project management by the University of Arkansas (UOA), USAID,and ISAR was unsatisfactory throughout the project.  With a few exceptions, the UOA was not able to provide a TA team that was adequately trained and experienced in FSR/E or with multidisciplinary capabilities, nor were the TA teams representative of required disciplines, including agricultural economics.  The team was unable to integrate itself fully with ISAR.  Administrative and financial management problems plagued the UOA. USAID management was poor throughout the project.  Some salient management errors were use of project funds for USAID management costs that were not budgeted and for revision of the 1986 mid-term evaluation, with subsequent elimination of the extension component. Effective implementation of the project was rendered extremely difficult by the advent of armed hostilities in October 1990, which led to the evacuation of the expatriate staff from the Rwerere Experiment Station in November 1990.  Subsequently, the expatriate staff made monthly or bimonthly visits to the stations from Kigali, which led to a commensurate reduction in levels of effort by research station staff. The station was directly attacked in June 1992 and activity at the station had ceased at the time of this final evaluation. ISAR was unable to provide counterparts to the expatriate team. Those counterparts who were assigned were continually replaced, resulting in a lack of continuity and commitment to sustained research.  Because of the absence of an experienced FSR economist, the socioeconomic program was seriously compromised.  The sociologist who was appointed as a socioeconomist was unable to fulfill the task of adequate economic analysis or even partial budgeting. This problem was likely the reason that the economic analysis contained in the final project report was prepared without his knowledge and/or participation. Because technologies tested among farmers did not undergo rigorous scrutiny, their sustainability was not fully assured. Although the higher yielding varieties of beans, wheat, and potatoes continued to be used by farmers, the value of the much preferred bean variety G2333 was compromised by the onset of a fungal root disease.  Other technologies, such as the Lime + NPK treatment and the agroforestry species Sesbania were either abandoned or recognized as inappropriate.

"This PACR, prepared by an outside consultant, assesses the 13-year history of the Agricultural Development Support Program in Yemen.  The ADSP, most of which was phased out in early 1991 as a result of the Gulf War, included five subprojects (SP's):  the Core SP; Agricultural Education and Development (AEDS); Poultry Extension and Training (PETS); Horticulture Improvement and Training (HITS); and Faculty of Agriculture (FOA).  Due to the war, the Core and FOA SP's had to be terminated prematurely; the others were more or less completed by that time. Planned outputs were generally met for all SP's, which is commendable considering the program's difficult working conditions and the need to deal with slowly reacting bureaucracies.  However, accomplishments fell short in most cases of full sustainability and institutionalization. The most critical problems were lack of strong management skills and adequate funding within the various Ministries.  On the bright side, a major accomplishment, from both technical and political viewpoints, was U.S. degree (or higher) training of 95 persons. Returned participants have not been fully integrated into Yemen's agricultural management system, but all express a desire to keep lines of communication to the United States open. General lessons from the program are three.  (1) Adequate operating and maintenance budgets for facilities and equipment must be established and kept up from the beginning.  (2) The umbrella concept and central management model were effective in theory, but roles and responsibilities should have been better defined.  (3) If U.S. equipment must be used, a system for assuring a spare parts' supply must be in place. Lessons from the SP's include the following.  (1) Core -- Institution building requires:  (a) a contractor with long experience in this activity, a commitment to continuity of staffing, and some bilingual capacity, and (b) performance benchmarks, a socioculturally sensitive monitoring system, and financial controls that limit spending on unsustainable activities.  (2) AEDS -- U.S. training of Yemeni teachers would have been more effective at lower cost than was Egyptian training; Yemen's curriculum approval process was not fully considered during SP design; the World Bank's standard secondary school design requires extensive adaptation for secondary agricultural schools.  (3) PETS -- SP design did not focus sufficiently on economic policies; participant training was begun without designating which jobs returned participants would fill. (4) HITS -- SP management had many shortcomings; roles and responsibilities for institutionalization were ill-defined; USAID was understaffed.  Also, a Yemeni quarantine department is urgently needed; citrus production cannot be expanded until major diseases are controlled; and ways to increase water use efficiency must be fully assessed.  (5) FOA -- water availability must be carefully assessed, not assumed. Although USAID/Y has been directed by the State Department to disengage from agricultural activities, the Mission, having invested $106 million in the program, should make every attempt to encourage the involved ministries to assure sustainability by implementing the evaluation's key recommendations.  The most important of these are to: provide adequate funding for facilities and equipment; assign returning participants to challenging positions where they can use their new knowledge and skills; formally approve the curricula developed under AEDS; and make plant protection programs developed under the program fully operational.  The Mission has decided that the 44 participants already in training should be allowed to finish their degrees.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","5/1/1992 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural development|Agricultural management|Institution building|Project sustainability|Participants|Agricultural education|Agricultural training|Horticulture|Agricultural schools|Poultry","Yemen","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABF096.pdf","2,330 KB","007493 - Potential Unlimited, Inc.","","008624 - USAID.

"At the end of its fourth year, the Fertilizer Sub-Sector Reform Program (FSSRP) in Cameroon continues to operate successfully under very difficult economic conditions.  Extremely tight bank credit limits importers' access to subsidies to those with substantial assets.  The purchasing power of coffee farmers, the principal users of subsidized fertilizer, has been greatly curtailed by low coffee prices.  However, a general decline in subsidized fertilizer consumption over the past 3 years seems to have been arrested.  Indications are that farmers have increased fertilizer use on food crops, which produces a better return on fertilizer expenditures than does coffee.  Importers have also increased sales to banana and green bean growers, further diversifying the market.  Increased participation in the FSSRP by importers, banks, and distributors has opened up the market, making it more transparent and responsive to demand than early in the program when large coffee cooperatives dominated distribution.

"Mozambique began receiving commercial food aid in 1983 to assist in meeting food requirements in the major city centers and adjacent provinces.  In Maputo and Beira, the aid was distributed under a system known as the Novo Sistema de Abastecimento (NSA) which controlled the eligible recipients of the food aid, quantities to move into various areas, and most importantly, prices. For distribution of food, the government created the Empresa de Abastecimento de Cidade de Maputo (EACM) and an equivalent state firm in Beira.  EACM acted as a warehousing agent and wholesaler and distributed to cooperatives indicated by the Ministry of Commerce, which acted as retailers. The system, which was defined for a Maputo population of approximately 800,000, quickly began to stretch the installed capacities as people moved into urban centers.  Irregular supplies of aid meant that sufficient stocks were often followed by shortages.  These irregularities of supply created opportunities for speculation, particularly considering the fixed subsidized prices applied by the government. While the government tried to control this situation, the capacity of regulatory agencies was minimal.  Further, with liberalization of the economy in 1987 giving opportunity for a burgeoning private sector to develop, the need for a state-owned and operated distribution and retail network became limited if not nonsensical. The move to a more liberal economy also coincided with the donor community requiring greater financial responsibility by consignees in the payment of counterpart funds.  Despite increased control, by 1990 many of the state consignees owed millions of meticais to the Treasury for outstanding food aid received but not paid. Consequently, and in a move to further liberalize the distribution of commercial food aid, the government introduced in 1991 a pre-qualification system to register potential future consignees, including private sector enterprises. The purpose of this study is to review the application of the pre-qualification system since its introduction in November 1991 with reference to U.s. maize shipments.  The study analyzes three key aspects; pre-qualification procedures; distribution issues; and accountability and the payment of counterpart funds.

"Presents final Mission report on a project (7/86-1/90) to help El Salvador's Center for the Support of Maternal Lactation (CALMA) to promote breastfeeding and other improved child nutrition practices. The project's most important accomplishment was the institutional strengthening of CALMA, a PVO which has earned the support of the health community and achieved a record of determination and survival in difficult circumstances.  CALMA has developed sound management and accounting procedures and has provided high-quality training to more than the targeted 4,700 persons from both the public and private sectors.  Its training program emphasizes work in small groups, simulation, and heavily participatory techniques.  Other activities under the grant have included reproduction of breastfeeding pamphlets and design and reproduction of a manual on mother care, basic materials suitable for illiterate as well as literate women. Four lessons were learned.  (1)  To survive, CALMA was forced to cut expenses, even to its own detriment; some staff members were lost to better paying jobs.  (2) CALMA must identify potential donors, particularly Salvadoran ones.  (3)  There still remains a need for more training of health care providers and policymakers in the advantages of breastfeeding.  (4) Because more and more women are working outside the home, breastfeeding suffers.  There is no legislation to ensure nurseries in workplaces or time out for breastfeeding, and maternity leave is inadequate for lactation.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","519-0329-G-00-6446-00","","9/1/1992 12:00:00 AM","","Breastfeeding|Nutrition education|Child nutrition|Medical education|Indigenous private voluntary organizations|Beneficiary count","El Salvador","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABF147.pdf","132 KB","008540 - USAID.

"Evaluates three family planning (FP) subprojects (SP's) in Egypt: the Comprehensive Family Care SP of the Coptic Association for Social Care (CASC); the Upper Egypt FP and Community Development SP of the Bishopric for Public, Ecumenical, and Social Services (BPESS); and the Rural Community-based FP SP of the Coptic Evangelical Organization for Social Services (CEOSS).  The CASC approach features family life education; the BPESS approach links women's development, literacy, and income generation with FP; and the CEOSS SP provides FP within a comprehensive community development framework. Although all three SP's have been hampered by bureaucratic and financial delays, they are now underway and have met some of their objectives.  CASC has met 52% of its target for new contraceptive acceptors, BPESS 58%, and CEOSS 66%.  Systems have improved in CASC, and CEOSS has done excellent work in training, informational meetings, and outreach and follow-up.  BPESS's work in literacy training appears to be statistically associated with the number of new FP acceptors.  On the other hand, little progress can be reported with respect to revenue generation and sustainability. Because funding and constraints were so great it is difficult to make generalizations about what has worked and why. Nevertheless, the following lessons can be drawn.  (1) Local social, cultural, and religious environments create special parameters. Projects in Egypt need more time, more flexibility, and a far more secure commitment of financial resources.  Project designs should include quantification of local inputs whether in cash or kind.  (2) Projects in remote or isolated areas require a certain degree of autonomy over their own resources.  At the same time, they require adequate financial, technical, and logistic support.  (3) From the very start, donors should instill a sense of project ownership into PVO's.  They should not intervene too directly in ongoing operations or impose excessive and/or changing bureaucratic requirements on the agencies.  (4) Both CASC and BPESS have relatively simple informal management systems at the service delivery level, which may in some cases be more appropriate and effective than more formal systems.  (5) Additional emphasis needs to be given to sustainability.  Although this was a major USAID focus in the BPESS and the CEOSS SP's, it is obvious that this was not fully understood by the two agencies.

"Evaluates project to develop an integrated forest conservation and development program for Corcovado National Park in Costa Rica's Osa Peninsula (BOSCOSA project).  Interim evaluation covers the period 1989-10/92. The project's most significant impacts have been in the areas of social and ecological sustainability.  Economic and political impacts are not notable, due in part to the project's short life span and its grassroots orientation.  Since project inception, eight grassroots organizations have been developed in the Osa community, and a more positive attitude towards forest conservation and sustainable management of forest resources has been successfully promoted, as is evident from the nearly 6,500 ha under improved land use.  As a result, the vulnerability of both public and private forests to agricultural development has noticeably decreased:  290 ha of degraded pasture lands have been reforested and almost 160 ha have been converted from annual to perennial crops by farmers who received TA from the project. Training has benefitted ten grassroots organizations.  All in all, 72 women and 114 men have received training in organizational development, accounting, administration, cultural arts, and handicrafts; over 80 training events have been conducted in handicrafts alone.  In addition, 11 young men are enrolled in a paraforester training program.  The project has led to the creation of 56 jobs, the majority of them in self-sustaining activities such as the CAM (Cooperativa Cogestionaria de Productores Agroforestal e Industrial de la Peninsula de Osa) nursery. Although there has been little change in  policies, economic incentives, and land tenure laws that permit deforestation on the Osa Peninsula, the project has increased institutional cooperation, serving as a liaison between governmental bodies and helping establish a coalition of groups and interests committed to the preservation of the forests of Osa.  The project has also leveraged financial assistance from a variety of national and international sources, channeling almost $1 million to 11 grassroots organizations.","Summary in English and Spanish|Companion evaluation summary: PD-ABJ-128|Biodiversity support program (BSP)","Special Evaluation","Documents","DHR-5554-A-00-8044-00|DHR-A-00-88-00044-00","","11/1/1992 12:00:00 AM","","Forest resources|Natural resource conservation|Natural resource management|Beneficiary count","Costa Rica","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABF158.pdf","3,674 KB","001303 - World Wildlife Fund-U.S. (WWF)","","008533 - USAID.

"Final Mission Report on a project (8/85-11/90) to help the Swaziland Ministry of Health (MOH) improve its primary health care system, with emphasis on maternal/child health and family planning (MCH/FP). The project provided 77 outreach sites -- 49 of them new -- in all regions of the country with basic furniture and equipment. It also established oral rehydration therapy (ORT) corners in all clinics in Lubombo and Shiselweni and most clinics in Hhohho and Manzini regions. Service delivery was strengthened through an impressive clinic-based training (CBT) effort added after the 1989 amendment.  The CBT program -- which was largely hands-on training, using patients as case studies -- was implemented in all four regions of the country and trained:  (1) over 200 nurses and nursing assistants in immunization, acute respiratory infection, control of diarrheal disease, MCH/FP, and growth monitoring and nutrition; (2) 147 nurses in antenatal care for high-risk pregnancies; and (3) 51 clinic personnel in postpartum care, breastfeeding and FP.  Unfortunately, the sustainability of the CBT component may be hindered by lack of regional training facilities and full-time trainers, poor managerial capacity in the regions, and lack of regional resources.  The project also assisted the MOH in training all clinic nurses in the use of the drug formulary, clinic reference, and clinic orientation manuals developed by the project, helped implement a drug management system in all clinics, and trained clinic personnel in the maintenance and repair of generators.  Through the CBT model, clinic performance improved, as did morale, skill levels, and confidence. In a major contribution, the project used data from a survey of key health and FP indicators to help clinics develop outpatient reporting systems and to decentralize databases so that timely data are now available in each of the 4 regions.  Additionally, 600 MOH personnel were trained in health information system (HIS) procedures.  However, the MOH lacks a structure for analyzing and using HIS data for management purposes. The project also:  (1) strengthened the central MOH Statistics Unit by debugging the nursing register and the personnel system and establishing a central computer library; and (2) completed studies of user fees, unit costs, and MOH financial management. The third study resulted in production of a financial management manual, in which 386 personnel have been trained. The following lessons were learned.  (1) The project highlighted the MOH's major weakness -- lack of trained staff to undertake and sustain the multitude of activities laid out in the Project Paper.  The MOH's absorptive capacity should be assessed carefully prior to implementation of future projects.  (2) The scope of project activities needs to be realistic.  The mid-term evaluation revealed that some project activities, e.g., the proposed cost-recovery mechanisms, were not realistic for implementation within the Swazi government's financial system during the life of the project.  (3) The CBT program heightened awareness of the need to design and conduct in-service training based on actual field experience. The planned FP/MCH project (6450236) addresses many of the above-mentioned problems.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","12/1/1992 12:00:00 AM","","Primary health care|Child survival activities|Maternal child health care|Family planning services|Management information systems|Host country counterparts|Clinics|Health outreach services|Nursing education|Beneficiary count","Swaziland","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABF160.pdf","98 KB","008609 - USAID.

"The sustainability of the Benin Rural Water and Sanitation Project, scheduled for completion 9/92, is assessed.  The project has successfully constructed wells and demonstration latrines; provided training to village health committees, government extension workers, and pump repair workers; and provided health education in over 500 villages in the North Zou region of Benin. The project has also succeeded in setting up a maintenance system that depends upon private sector actions driven by market demand. The communities are responsible for managing their systems and for paying all costs of operation and repair, the latter being perrformed by regional repair workers using imported parts supplied by regional distributors.  While the system is well established, it is fragile, and continued monitoring by the government is called for.  A 9/91 final evaluation raised questions about sustainability. The assessment concludes that if the project ends in 9/92 as planned, it is probable that some pumps would fall into disrepair because of failures on the part of the community-level Comites du Developpement Socio-Sanitaire (CDSS's) to maintain their water systems.  If more than 25% of the pumps should fail, the entire operations and maintenance (O&M) system would be jeopardized, because spare parts suppliers and repair workers would lose interest due to the lack of a sufficient market. A continuation for 2 years with significantly reduced activities would increase the sustainability of the benefits achieved to date. However, because such an extension would violate A.I.D. regulations forbidding projects longer than 10 years in duration, a new 2-year project, focused on consolidating gains already made in project villages rather than on extending boreholes or latrines to new communities, is recommended.  The Peace Corps seems to be in the best position to manage the new project.","WASH task no. 377|Evaluation summary: PD-ABH-178","Special Evaluation","Documents","DPE-5973-Z-00-8081-00","","8/1/1992 12:00:00 AM","","Rural areas|Water supply|Water sanitation|Project sustainability|Health education|Hygiene|Outdoor toilet facilities|Community participation|Local groups|Water supply structures|Water supply structure maintenance|Pumps","Benin","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNABN080.pdf","1,389 KB","000333 - Camp Dresser and McKee, Inc.

"Final evaluation of Phase I (10/88-9/92) of a child survival (CS) project in Ogo Oluwa and in part of Orira Local Government Areas (LGA's) of Oyo State, Nigeria.  The evaluation, which was conducted by the grantee (World Vision Relief and Development), focused on the sustainability of the project, which sought to reduce infant and child morbidity and mortality due to diarrheal diseases, malnutrition, and malaria by supporting and strengthening the service delivery capability of community and local Ministry of Health (MOH) health systems. Results have been remarkable.  The project organized the communities into 61 village health committees (VHC's), and two representatives from each of these VHC's formed a larger body, known as the Village Health Council, which advises the various VHC's. Over 100 community members have been trained as volunteer village health workers/traditional birth attendants (VHW's/TBA's) and have remained active in CS activities in their various communities.  A total of 61 village health posts were established and serve as centers for the treatment of malaria fever, training of mothers in oral rehydration therapy (ORT), growth monitoring, infant and child nutrition, and other CS activities. Community members have been highly mobilized and sensitized to assume greater responsibilities for their health.  The project also helped to establish income-generating activities (IGA's) for the various communities and for the VHW's/TBA's who have been constituted into a co-operative association.  At the LGA level, the project supported the training of health personnel.  All of these activities have promoted the sustainability of effective CS activities. The project's competence in promoting sustainability is attested by the observable results of its activities.  The extension that has been granted (until 9/95) will enable the project to further consolidate its achievements. The following lessons were learned with regard to the sustainability of CS projects.  (1) Training VHW's/TBA's to keep simple and accurate records will ensure that community funds targeted for CS activities are not mismanaged.  (2) The proper management of IGA's should be linked with the well being of the person(s) responsible for them.  (3) Any program which improves the financial capability of communities will equally improve their health, and positive results of new healthy practices are bound to be absorbed and sustained by the community members.

"Interim evaluation of a grant to World Relief Corporation for a child survival (CS) project in the Francisco Morazan and Olancho Departments in Honduras.  The evaluation covers the period 9/89- 7/92. The project is achieving its objectives, meeting the needs of the target population, and is considered effective by the mothers who are its direct beneficiaries.  Specifically, 7 of 20 project objectives have achieved or exceeded the estimates proposed for the end of the third year -- full immunization of children under age 1, administration of two doses of tetanus toxoid vaccination to women, use of oral rehydration (ORT) by mothers to treat diarrhea, monthly weighing of children aged 0-23 months, exclusive breastfeeding up to 4-6 months, training of mothers in child nutrition, and prenatal care.  By contrast, the project has achieved only about 50% of targets for ensuring that mothers refer children with pneumonia and for training mothers to prepare oral rehydration solution (ORS).  Nonetheless, nearly 6,000 women are practicing ORT thanks to the efforts not only of the project, but also of the media and other concerned institutions. Initial project objectives have been expanded to include women's care, women's organizations, and promotion of women's income generation through the establishment of community women's banks. Community education has been the project's strongest point. Excellent skills in informal and participative methods of education can be found among project staff.  However, there is a shortage, both quantitative and qualitative, of teaching materials. There is also need for more TA in information and training and greater use of existing information. The project must strengthen its sustainability strategies in light of the Ministry of Health's (MOH) financial inability to assume responsibility for the project after the 1994 PACD. Achievements attained so far could be maintained to a certain extent if community structures are solidified and develop linkages with the MOH and other institutions.  Sustainability will require implementing each aspect of the program jointly with the MOH. Lessons learned include the following.  (1) A successful CS program requires a strategy for meeting nutritional needs.  An adequate management and surveillance system is also vital.  (2) Local health committees working hand in hand with health volunteers are key to ensuring community participation, although the volunteers should depend on the committees rather than vice versa.  There is also a need to diversify the type of volunteer employed.  (3) Volunteers cannot be expected to be efficient if they have to visit over 20 families.  (4) Weighing sessions of numerous children are ineffective, mainly because mothers have no time to be taught about their children's growth process and because they wear out the health volunteer.  The sessions should involve 5-8 children.  (5) Health volunteers should not only teach mothers how to prepare ORS, but should prepare and administer the first dosage with mothers and make a follow-up house call to ensure continued usage.

"Midterm evaluation of a project to provide prosthetic devices and services to the victims of Mozambique's civil war.  The evaluation covers the period 1989-12/92. Considerable progress has been made toward meeting the needs of amputees and some of the other physically disabled in Mozambique. Two very capable NGO's are providing prosthetic and orthotic services:  the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and Handicapped International (HI).  Prosthesis production is reasonably on target, the prosthetics repair program seems to be meeting demand, and training objectives are being met for both physical therapists and prosthetists. With the graduation of the prosthetist classes next year, a significant increase in production is expected. The one serious exception to this success is the transit center component -- construction of residence buildings for persons either awaiting or receiving prostheses -- which is well behind schedule, and is becoming a serious constraint.  Primary responsibility for the delay lies with Save the Children Federation (SCF), the implementor of this component, though the Mission could have exercised its leverage with SCF and the Government more effectively.  The facilities now in use are of very poor quality and demand is growing.  New construction is needed now, despite the Mission's understandable reluctance to undertake it. There is also a continuing management problem at the existing centers -- all are badly underfunded by the Government and require outside help from ICRC and HI. There has also been an inordinate delay in estimating the need for project services (although this delay is not threatening implementation of other parts of the project).  The field survey is now completed for all but two provinces, but the data remain in raw form.  Also, demand may surge when the cessation of hostilities permits the return of some 2-3 million refugees and potentially increases mine injuries as farmers return to abandoned fields. Transport and communication difficulties caused by the war persist, making it impossible to establish an effective prosthetics follow-up program.  Both ICRC and HI rely essentially on self-referral; the planned clinical follow-up program is unrealistic, as is the long-term rehabilitation plan called for in the Project Paper. The project's attempt to establish an orthopedic residency program at Maputo Central Hospital never materialized,  The new orthopedic plan focuses more on mid-level medical/technical professionals.  In addition, recruitment of surgeons with Portuguese language skills for short-term assignments is proving difficult.  (Spanish or Italian speakers would be able to work effectively.) Despite considerable efforts to achieve technical sustainability, the project continues to be financially unsustainable without continued donor inputs.  With its very limited financial resources and the relatively low priority it accords this activity, the Government is unlikely to allocate sufficient funds to assure sustainability. The project can expect to make only limited progress in increasing the economic self-sufficiency of the handicapped, especially in urban areas, where unemployment is high.","Assignment no.

"The Sahel Policy Project (SPAP) was authorized in July 1985 with LOP funding of $8 million.  Its goal was ""to carry out a program of economic policy studies, advisory services, and training that will strengthen the bases for appropriate economic policy in the Sahel"".  Its PACD was extended in 1990 to September 1995, with no increase in LOP funding.  It is a companion project to the Sahel Regional Institutions (SRI) Project (6250575), that provides support to the Permanent Interstate Committee for Drought Control in the Sahel (CILSS) and the Club du Sahel.  Present LOP funding for SRI is $15 million under a 1990 Project Amendment. The relative proportions of SPAP's components -- TA, studies, and training -- have changed over the LOP, with the emphasis after the 1990 PACD moving towards focused studies as Sahel Missions grew and had other options for TA.  While earlier SPAP-funded TA and long-term study programs led to the development of country-level policy projects, efforts after the shift in emphasis increased the number and variety of studies available to further policy dialogue and deepen understanding of regional and subregional issues such as trade, environmental management, food security, decentralization, and finance, and to catalyze the activities of A.I.D. and other donors in these and other cross-sectoral areas. The evaluation team found that SPAP-funded activities have had both direct and indirect impacts on policy selection and implementation both at the national level in targeted countries, and at the regional level, through interaction with the CILSS and Club du Sahel secretariats, and the Sahel Institute.  Leading examples are cereals marketing liberalization, marketing information systems, and broader economic policy reform in Mali; agricultural research improvement and environmental policy in Senegal; subregional livestock marketing reform; and private sector policy reform in the Sahel region and beyond. Using the SPAP project to buy into one or another centrally funded cooperative agreements with a land grant university or a non-university cooperator, A.I.D. Missions and the Sahel/West Africa (SWA) Office itself were highly successful in building up capacity and generating analytic products at the same time.  From 1988 on, although Missions buy-ins were fewer, the SWA Office used SPAP as a mechanism for buying into centrally funded activities to fund studies and some shorter-term TA to address particular problems that had been identified within A.I.D. or through the Club and CILSS Secretariats.  Recently, SPAP has served primarily to expand and reorient the policy analysis agenda at the regional level.  This seems an appropriate evolution given the changing political and policy environments in the Sahel and West Africa as a whole.  The team recommends that the project be extended, but combined with the SRI Project to reinforce the links between the policy analysis activities and other support to Sahelian institutions.

"This report, prepared upon the closing of A.I.D.'s Regional Housing and Urban Development Office (RHUDO) in Cote d'Ivoire in 6/92, presents a comprehensive account of four Housing Guaranty (HG) projects carried out in Cote d'Ivoire by RHUDO between 1967 and 1992, and examines pre- and post-HG activities, including the Municipal Development Support Project. Over the past 25 years, RHUDO concentrated on four project types: middle income home ownership, lower income neighborhood upgrading and servicing, community facilities, and municipal strengthening. By 1992, 36 subprojects had been implemented through HG programs, with investments totaling $70 million.  These brought direct benefits to 1,600 households through home purchase and 2,800 more through rental accommodations, and reached over one million beneficiaries through neighborhood upgrading and community service activities. Some of the subprojects showed a sharp departure from previous policies in city housing and urban development.  In some cases these new approaches, coupled with the difficulties of coordinating the various agencies working on the projects, brought difficulties and delays. Difficulties were related to: (1) institutional capacity; (2) attitudes towards cost recovery; (3) the reluctance of project agencies to seek lower, more affordable construction standards; (4) inter-agency project management; and (5) the integration of project components with programs and operations. HG investments in Cote d'Ivoire have had major impacts on how urban issues are analyzed, and on how solutions are formulated and implemented.  Evidence of impact is seen in the following areas:  (1)  a national policy of decentralization; (2) institutional development, training, and human development; (3) direct project benefits including poverty impacts; and (4) private sector shelter and service provision. Substantial momentum has been created by the more than two decades of RHUDO activity.  Urban development is now recognized as a significant part of the development process which generates national capital. Despite some problems, these projects provided valuable experience in such areas as municipal strengthening and financial management. Further, RHUDO's experience over 25 years with 36 subprojects demonstrates the importance of a long-term perspective on institutional and sectoral questions, particularly with regard to sustainability. Appendixes include subproject profiles.","Delivery order no. 9|Project title: Implementing policy change (IPC)","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-5451-I-00-1026-00","","12/1/1992 12:00:00 AM","","Housing|Housing investment guaranty|Public housing assistance|Low cost housing|Rental housing|Urban development|Low income|Middle income","Ivory Coast","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNABN290.pdf","4,256 KB","001335 - Chemonics International Consulting Div.","","004517 - USAID.

"Special evaluation of the ASEAN Private Investment and Trade Opportunities (PITO) project to increase U.S. investment and trade interests in the six ASEAN member countries -- Brunei Darussalam, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand.  Evaluation covered the period from 1990-1992. The overall conclusion of the evaluation team is that the PITO project is a success as demonstrated by what the project has put in place to:  1) assist further development of the ASEAN member countries; and 2) provide benefits to U.S. firms through increased trade and investment activity.  To appreciate what the PITO project has accomplished to date, it is important to bear in mind the highly ambitious nature of at least two of the project's goals:  1) to promote trade and investment on a six-country regional basis; and 2) to implement the project relying almost exclusively on the private sector in the countries involved rather than on the public sector. It was also the conclusion of the evaluation team that the AID/ASEAN office has managed a complex project involving 3 grantees and 6 countries in a highly effective manner.  While the major components of the project clearly are all related, they also encompass quite diverse activities.  As a result, the Project components are carried out by different organizations because no one organization could be expected to be equally qualified in providing services under two, let alone four, of the components. Carrying out PITO services at the country level also requires coordination with local business organizations and the U.S. Foreign Commercial Service officer, which further adds to organizational complexity and coordination requirements. The evaluation confirmed that the need and the demand for the services offered by PITO still exist.  If anything, they are more intensive than at the time the project was designed.  In the time since the PITO project was set up, the ASEAN member countries have agreed to creating an ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA).  The AFTA should increase intra-regional trade and investments significantly and will also provide major opportunities for U.S. investors who previously were put off by the small size of the local markets in ASEAN countries.  The PITO project can be of considerable help to U.S. firms renewing their interest in the ASEAN markets as well as to firms that are new to the region. The PITO offices in the ASEAN countries are now staffed adequately and organized to provide services in an effective manner. In view of the prolonged start-up for the offices, the evaluation team agreed that it would be premature at this time to evaluate the offices in terms of the number of inquiries or potential transactions they have handled.  This activity might be included, more sensibly, in the final evaluation of PITO.

"Since its inception in January 1992, the West Coast Business Outreach Program (WCBOP) has conducted an impressive array of activities in support of its overall objective to assist small and medium-sized U.S. firms interested in business opportunities in developing countries.  The WCBOP's activities have included executive briefing tours, seminars, and workshops on a variety of topics, individual business counseling, and information and referral services. According to the individuals interviewed for this evaluation, the WCBOP has produced significant benefits for its target audience, U.S. small and medium-sized firms, as well as for other U.S. government agencies, USAID Missions, and the developing countries in which they work.  The WCBOP provides the following three services directly to U.S. firms:  (1) information on trade and investment opportunities in developing countries; (2) assistance in working with USAID to develop new business opportunities in developing countries; and (3) information on USAID contracts, grants, and procurement opportunities and procedures. All of the individuals interviewed for this report believe that the WCBOP has played a vital role in disseminating trade and investment information to businesses on the West Coast; moreover, they believe that access to this type of information is the most valuable type of assistance a business can receive. The WCBOP has successfully introduced USAID to small and medium-sized businesses, resulting in increased awareness of USAID programs and the ways in which U.S. companies can benefit from them.  Generally, these include a more positive view of USAID and foreign assistance and specific transactions between companies in the United States and developing countries. The WCBOP has familiarized companies with USAID procurement opportunities and procedures and helped address the inexperience of many West Coast businesses in dealing with Washington bureaucracy. The WCBOP has also produced benefits beyond the U.S. business community.  In particular, the WCBOP has served to strengthen coordination among the West Coast offices of federal, state, and local government agencies, resulting in improved services by all agencies through increased knowledge of, and ability to refer businesses to other relevant government programs.  The WCBOP has also interacted positively with trade development centers and increasingly with USAID Missions. USAID Missions have supported WCBOP activities because the program helps them meet their own development assistance objectives through improved access to U.S. expertise and technology. The WCBOP's success is founded on four key factors:  (1) a local presence - the WCBOP's presence in California and Oregon makes it accessible and approachable for small and medium-sized businesses, due to which it can offer a personalized, hands-on approach that is extremely effective in reaching out to small businesses; (2) dynamic staff - the WCBOP's strongest asset is its people.  The staff are perceived to be dynamic and aggressive in reaching out to small and medium-sized businesses, and eager to work closely with other organizations; (3) WCBOP is recognized for responding to businesses with the information they need in a timely manner; and (4) ability to network - the WCBOP works closely with a number of government agencies at the federal, state, and local levels as well as trade and business development centers in California and Oregon.  As a result, the WCBOP has been able to successfully create a network of contacts for sharing information on business opportunities in developing countries. Part of what has made the WCBOP so successful is that it is small and flexible; moreover, the program has little structure, and hence, few bureaucratic constraints.  This mode of operation has been effective in the start-up phase of the program. However, over the past few months, the number of businesses contacting the WCBOP has grown dramatically. The WCBOP staff are increasingly stretched thin due to the growing demand for assistance.  The question remains:  Can the WCBOP sustain its record in providing quick response and personalized services in light of the rapid and continued growth in requests for business assistance? The WCBOP's continued success hinges on a number of critical issues. The most important of these is the need for a commitment from USAID to the business outreach effort.  At this time, the program's funding is scheduled to cease at the end of January 1993.  This creates a great deal of uncertainty about the program's future, not only for the staff of the WCBOP, but also for the businesses they serve on the West Coast. The level of uncertainty is exacerbated by the fact that support for business outreach within USAID seems mixed.  On the one hand, those who have had a chance to see the program ""in action"" have become strong supporters.  On the other hand, some officials question whether U.S. business outreach is a legitimate function for a foreign assistance agency. The current uncertain and temporary nature of the program is understandable in light of the fact that the WCBOP is a pilot program. However, now that the pilot phase is coming to a close, it is important that USAID make a decision regarding its willingness to support business outreach.  This evaluation recommends that USAID:  (1) make a commitment to supporting the Business Outreach Program for at least two years; (2) institutionalize the WCBOP in the Bureau for Private Enterprise to reinforce linkages with its recently established Center for Trade and Investment Services; (3) consider an expansion of the program to one other location (but not at the expense of California or Oregon); and (4) authorize an increase in support staff and funding for the program so that the WCBOP can continue to provide the services that businesses have come to expect.

"Midterm evaluation of pilot project to establish an institutional capacity for integrated coastal resource management in Ecuador. Evaluation covers the period 1986-1991. The project has succeeded in establishing integrated costal resource management as a topic of concern within the Office of the President of Ecuador, but regional and local government agencies, and even local representatives of national agencies have proven incapable of responding to this concern, leading the project to focus most attention on selected small special management zones (ZEM's), which make up only 7% of the Coast.  Consequently, coastal resource issues that can be resolved only at the regional or national levels have not received the attention they merit. Project issues have been selected in a public consultation process according to the interests of local participants, and as a result, emphasis has been on the preparation of Coastal Profiles, which identify many (mostly local) issues without much ranking as to importance, and on organization and planning in the ZEM's.  Complex issues of national concern which were planned to be addressed under the project, in particular Ecuador's shrimp mariculture industry and the associated clearing of mangrove forests, have been neglected.  Although the project did organize a Shrimp Mariculture Conference in 1986, it has ignored the issue since then.  Nor has it succeeded in significantly affecting the rate of mangrove forest clearing. Although the project is to be commended for developing a constituency of poor, local resource users, it is essential that this constituency be broadened to include major decisionmakers if the project and its local participants (particularly in the ZEM's) are to have a long-term influence on national policy. Experience in the ZEM's must be applied to the identification of research needs and the development of national plans for sustainable coastwide management. Funding is another concern.  A.I.D./W funding terminates at the end of 1994 and has already been reduced.  USAID/E provided less than half the funds it had promised, significantly reducing the activities the project could undertake.  Integrated management of coastal resources is not a USAID/E Strategic Objective, so additional funds are unlikely.  An Inter-American Development Bank loan (IADB) is expected during 1993, but it is possible this loan may continue the present focus on ZEM's. The key need now is to combine the strengths of the ZEM coastal management process with a plan to deal with issues requiring national or regional action -- shrimp mariculture, mangrove clearing, road and dam construction, oil transportation and pollution.  In addition, the project must plan for transition to IADB funding.  Given the economic significance of Ecuador's coast, however, USAID/E could consider continuing aid by making coastal management a strategic objective.","Contract number incorrectly listed on the document as|PDC-5451-1-11-1027-00|Project title: Implementing policy change (IPC)","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-5451-I-00-1027-00","","12/1/1992 12:00:00 AM","","Coasts|Natural resource management|Local level|National level|Sector policy","Ecuador","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABF275.pdf","2,865 KB","006727 - Development Alternatives, Inc.

"PACR of a project (1981-1991) to strengthen the capacity of the Honduran Coffee Institute (IHCAFE) to help small farmers increase their crop yields, thus enabling them to afford coffee rust control measures. The project was expected to reach 10,400 small coffee producers and have considerable spread effect to others.  Activities included credit, paratechnical extension agents, demonstration lots, rehabilitation of damaged lots, publications, characterization of soils in selected regions, and crop diversification. The paratechnicians played a critical role in helping extension agents decide farmer eligibility for the project.  These agents had extensive local knowledge as the majority were coffee farmers who had participated in the project.  Another method of technology transfer was an experimental model based on a group approach rather than traditional individual farm visitation. There was also a notable amount of technology transfer to non-participating farmers.  Fifty-eight percent of those asked had observed their neighbors using some of the practices they had implemented on their own farms. The project opened the door to credit for small farmers, 62% of whom had no credit experience before.  Many of these will be eligible for credit in the future.  Although smaller than expected, credit repayments were sufficient to enable continued lending after the PACD.  On-farm coffee processing facilities were upgraded with the help of credit, and regular bank loans to cover annual coffee maintenance costs were extended to almost half the beneficiaries. With few exceptions, the targeted outputs were met or exceeded. The project helped 12,519 farmers and provided formal training to 30,506; both numbers exceeded the target of 10,400.  The target of 13,000 manzana of land to be improved with technology was exceeded by 3,641. The proposed credit system was in place by the target date and will be viable for twenty years.  Targets amounts for new research plots, soil tests, trained extension agents, and postharvest quality control measures all were superseded. However, certain output goals were not accomplished.  Due to the dramatic yield increases and the resulting income it was difficult for the project to convince farmers to try crops other than coffee.  Only 200 manzana of coffee were converted (to cacao), while the target was 610. Both the Mission and IHCAFE consider the project successful.  In fact, IHCAFE has been considered as a case study in the area of supervised agricultural credit.  Lessons learned from the project are as follows:  (1) profitable technology must accompany credit; (2) intra- and extra-institutional communication and coordination are always necessary; (3) private financial institutions will lend to smaller producers when returns are adequate and risks manageable; (4) no apparently successful credit project can afford to ignore underlying reasons for loan delinquency; (5) the poorest farmers are the most difficult to reach successfully; and (6) a felt need, such as the presence of coffee rust, can provide strong incentive for project participation.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","6/1/1992 12:00:00 AM","","Small farms|Coffee|Farmers|Rusts|Crop diseases|Crop disease control|Agricultural credit|Agricultural extension|Crop production","Honduras","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABF297.pdf","240 KB","008555 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (7/85-6/91) to institutionalize a capacity for rural road rehabilitation and maintenance within the Government of Honduras (GOH), resulting in expansion of the country's all-weather rural road network by 1,000 km and proper maintenance of 1,500 km of access trails and roads reconstructed under a predecessor project (Rural Roads I -- 5220164).  The Ministry of Communications, Public Works, and Transportation (SECOPT) was the principal counterpart agency. The project achieved all output targets and achieved additional outputs.  The following planned outputs were achieved:  (1) construction of 1,061 km of rural roads, including 255 linear meters of concrete bridges; (2) maintenance of 2,630 km of rural roads, including 1,956 km of routine maintenance provided by the labor-intensive Peon Caminero program; (3) distribution of a rural roads design and construction manual to SECOPT technical personnel involved in construction and maintenance; and (4) improvement of professional engineering skills within SECOPT and preparation of feasibility studies as a result of training received under the project.  Unplanned outputs included:  (1) rehabilitation of 102 km of rural roads in southern Honduras; (2) issuance of the document ""Methodology for the Selection, Evaluation, and Prioritization of Rural Roads;"" and (3) the purchase of computer equipment to implement a road maintenance planning tool called HDM (Highway Design and Maintenance), which permits SECOPT to plan road maintenance according to traffic volume, economic importance, availability of funding, and other factors. Despite this successful record, the GOH has not fulfilled its commitment to fully fund a maintenance program.  This failure is part of a global problem generated by the economic recession and the lack of appropriate planning. Several lessons were learned.  (1) All road construction projects should be accompanied by a road maintenance component, including a strong, verifiable maintenance commitment from the host government, an institutional strengthening program, and a modern inventory and planning tool such as HDM.  (2) Except under special circumstances, road construction should be performed by private contractors, selected through public bidding processes, and chosen from pre-qualified firms. Pre-qualification should be updated every year.  (3) Unit price contracts must be enforced, except for small activities and contingencies.  Budgets should be as accurate as possible in order to anticipate contingencies and avoid the need for large Change Orders. (4) Project supervision improves when performed by private supervisors that report to the host country implementing agency.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","7/1/1992 12:00:00 AM","","Rural areas|Road construction|Bridge construction|Road maintenance|Access roads","Honduras","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABF298.pdf","154 KB","008555 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (8/88-8/91) to strengthen the ability of the Controller General of the Republic (CGR) of Honduras to apply modern audit techniques in carrying out its auditing functions, and to assist other government entities to implement internal control systems and related financial management practices. Overall, the project achieved its goals.  The following were considered to be fully accomplished outputs.  (1) Regarding CGR's institutional development, the project modernized CGR's administration, opened two new training classrooms, developed a personnel classification manual, and established a data processing department, with computer applications, within CGR. (2) The Generally Accepted Government Auditing Standards of Honduras and an auditing manual have been implemented.  (3) The project provided training to a majority of CGR's 225 employees in such subjects as in government administration and finance, accounting, auditing, preparation of audit reports, audit supervision, instructor training, and internal control; the total number of participants attending the various courses was 849 (surpassing the planned output of 317 by over 267%), indicating that many participants attended several courses. These objectives were considered to be partially accomplished. (1) Regarding the objective of more clearly defining CGR's role and relations vis-a-vis other state institutions, draft legislation was sent to the Congress to strengthen CGR's auditing mandate, but the legislation has not yet been approved.  (2) The CGR is successfully performing audits of GOH activities; with additional TA, CGR could become capable of performing audits in accordance with U.S. General Accounting Office standards.  As a result, USAID/H, RIG/A/T, and CGR will soon sign an agreement permitting CGR to audit GOH organizations managing USAID/H projects.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","12/1/1992 12:00:00 AM","","Government departments|Financial management|Auditing|Institution building","Honduras","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABF299.pdf","70 KB","007549 - Honduras.

"A frequent criticism of structural adjustment programs has been that they harm in the short term the very people -- the poor -- they intend to benefit in the long run.  This report evaluates an A.I.D. project to test the validity of this assumption by investigating the short-term impacts of macroeconomic policy reform on lower-income groups in sub-Saharan African countries. The project has three phases -- generation of a common methodology, application of this framework in 6-8 country case studies, and synthesis and dissemination of the results of the case studies.  The project is about 75% complete:  a conceptual framework has been developed and country studies are nearing completion; the third phase, however, has only just begun. The project has already made major contributions to understanding how African economies operate and how structural adjustment has affected the poor.  Especially valuable have been the collection and analysis of primary data for the country studies, and the advances made in applying complex modeling techniques to African countries, in which the available data leave much to be desired. The overall result has been the largest body of high quality, quantitative research on African economies in existence. The empirical evidence produced by the project supports the hypothesis that the poor have generally not been harmed by structural adjustment; instances in which this has occurred seem to be the exception rather than the rule.  During the remainder of the project, efforts should focus on:  (1) integrating the different analyses at the country level; (2) incorporating all research products into a single, definitive volume; and (3) examining more closely those cases in which structural adjustment has hurt the poor.  Descriptions of the country studies are appended.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-0095-Z-00-9053-00","","11/1/1992 12:00:00 AM","","Economic research|Structural adjustment|Economic policy|Policy reform|Economic impact|Impact assessment|Poor|Standard of living|Case studies|Research methodology","Africa south of Sahara|Cameroon|Gambia|Ghana|Guinea|Madagascar|Malawi|Mozambique|Niger|Tanzania|Congo DR","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABF301.pdf","2,191 KB","000553 - Harvard University.

"Since 1971 USAID/Swaziland has implemented 41 projects containing training components and supported numerous graduate and undergraduate degree programs in-country and abroad.  This study assesses the long-term impact of the training on Swaziland's development (impact is defined as change in quality of life) through case studies of:  (1) the National Curriculum Center; (2) the Swaziland Institute of Health Sciences; (3) Malkerns Research Station; (4) the Central Bank; (5) the Family Life Association of Swaziland and other NGO training; and (6) three private companies -- Usutu Pulp, the Gama Associates engineering firm, and Swazi Brake and Clutch.  While direct results were easily measured and obviously beneficial -- a total of 857 individuals have been trained, 32% of whom are women, and most have remained in the fields in which they were trained -- long-term development impact was more difficult to measure:  98 interviews were conducted, institutional in-house focus groups of training participants were held, and project documentation was reviewed.  Conclusions hold that while this training may not immediately have contributed to development, it has laid the necessary foundation for development in the future.  Training is most likely to have an impact when: it is regional or in-country, job-related, and includes practical activities; it is pervasive and affects large numbers of employees; employers actively monitor the program; family issues are minimal and long separations are avoided; and contractors are involved with both the organization and the individual. Lessons learned are also presented concerning preparatory and follow-on activities and contextual factors, and recommendations are provided in conclusion. Appendices include the evaluation instruments and project information.","Task order no. 17|Project title: Advancing basic education and literacy (ABEL)","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-5832-I-00-0095-00","","11/1/1992 12:00:00 AM","","Education for development|Evaluation methodology|Development program implementation|Impact assessment|Development programs|Graduate education|Technical training|Undergraduate education|Quality of life|Agricultural training|Medical education|Management training|Participants|Private voluntary organizations","Swaziland","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNABN387.pdf","364 KB","001341 - Creative Associates International, Inc.

"PACR of a project (1986-91) to provide participant training to faculty of selected public and private colleges and universities in the Philippines. Overall, the project achieved its goals, although quantitative targets were not met due to a slow start-up (the first year was used to identify a contractor and form a Steering Committee) and the decision not to extend the PACD. Quantitative achievements were as follows:  (1) 23 participants (vs. a target of 40) completed M.S. programs at various U.S. universities; (2) 105 faculty members (vs. a target of 180) were selected under the second component, which provided 1-12 month training for doctoral candidates and those needing continuing education in their fields; and (3) 82 participants (vs. a target of 150) were selected for 2-year M.S. degrees at local colleges and universities under the in-country training component, originally designed to provide one year of graduate studies in preparation for further studies in the United States. Most private institutions were unable to meet A.I.D.'s requirement that they pay the salaries of participants during the training period.

"PACR of project component (8/86-12/91) to establish a Field Epidemiology Training Program (FETP) for the Philippines' Department of Health (DOH). All major activities under the FETP are on schedule and physical accomplishments within target.  The program is housed in a building renovated by the project, and four sentinel sites are operational, having been provided with equipment and computers. The first two training courses have been completed and graduated a total of 15 physicians; the third course, with 7 trainees, is in its second year; and a fourth group of 7 trainees have been selected.  It is estimated that by the Terminal Disbursement Date in 9/92, 96% of the $2.2 million obligated for this component will have been expended, placing fund utilization levels within normal limits. Other significant accomplishments include:  (1) outbreak investigations conducted by FETP trainees and graduates resulted in recommendations that have contributed to DOH policy decisions, and (2) through the publication and presentation of their studies at local and international conferences, FETP trainees and graduates have gained professional exposure and recognition both locally and internationally. A 12/91 final evaluation of the component noted that FETP substantially achieved its objectives of investigating disease outbreaks, reporting and analyzing surveillance data, developing methodologies for disease prevention and control interventions, and using epidemiologic information for planning, managing, and evaluating health services programs. Because of the program's perceived effectiveness and its potential for strengthening the DOH's capabilities, FETP has been formally institutionalized as the Epidemiology Division of the Health Intelligence Service (HIS).  This action resolves previous concerns about permanent staffing arrangements, and provides a framework within which FETP staff can integrate their particular budgetary needs (which require a quick response mechanism due to the nature of outbreak investigations) into regular government budgeting and accounting channels.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1992 12:00:00 AM","","Training centers|Health professional education|Epidemiology|Government departments|Institution building|Beneficiary count","Philippines","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABF354.pdf","161 KB","008592 - USAID.

"PACR of the Real Property Tax Administration (RPTA) component (8/84-8/91) of the Local Resources Management project in the Philippines.  The report includes summaries of a 4/89 assessment and a 7/90 external impact evaluation. Although RPTA was authorized in 8/84, implementation did not begin until mid-1988 due to serious disagreements between USAID and the Philippine Department of Finance (DOF), and when it did, it concentrated solely on Region VI.  By the time of the 4/89 assessment, the project covered 56 local government units (LGUs) in Region VI, and the assessment found sufficient reason to extend the PACD, as well as to expand implementation into Region V.  At project end, the RPTA system for tax mapping, records conversion and management, and tax collection had been installed in all 130 LGUs in Region VI and 55 of 115 LGUs in Region V. For the most part, a decentralized management structure from the regions to the LGU level proved an effective implementation mechanism, as indicated by the fact that the various approaches taken by the provinces in the absence of detailed guidelines have produced equally successful results.  Provincial and city officials now have an adequate capacity to support RPTA operations and are becoming increasingly qualified through experience and training. The benefits of RPTA have included:  increased assessments, improved quality of records; trained staff; and increased awareness of RPTA processes.  It is believed that installation of RPTA is cost-effective, and available data indicate that there have been increases in local revenue in every LGU in which RPTA has been implemented. At a post-project workshop, recommendations were made for replicating the RPTA nationwide.  With the passage of the 1991 Local Government Code giving LGUs primary responsibility for RPTA, the DOF should play an active role in providing TA to the LGUs. Specifically, the DOF should encourage the LGU's to give priority to:  (1) continuous training in RPTA systems maintenance personnel, along with logistical and financial support for maintenance; (2) further simplification of RPTA procedures to increase cost-efficiency; (3) widespread installation of the computerized RPTA system tested under the project; and (4) continuing emphasis on tax collection.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","2/1/1992 12:00:00 AM","","Public administration|Local level|Decentralization|Financial management|Tax collection|Real property taxes|Taxation","Philippines","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABF369.pdf","626 KB","008592 - USAID.

"Final external evaluation of a project (12/83-8/91) to strengthen Kenya's National Cooperative Housing Union (NACHU) and Kenyan finance institutions participating in an A.I.D. Housing Guaranty program (HG07) aimed at the private sector. The project required 7 rather than the intended 4 years to implement, but delays were generally attributable to A.I.D.'s decision to slow the pace of project implementation pending the conclusion of negotiations for the related HG program -- which, as it happened, was never implemented and was ultimately deauthorized.  Nonetheless, the project largely addressed its original objectives, as follows.  (1) Project TA, training, and commodity support directly contributed to a strengthening of NACHU as a private technical services organization for the Kenyan housing cooperative system.  (2) NACHU was assisted in planning ten cooperative housing projects to benefit 2,962 low-income households. (3) Assistance to NACHU in the actual contracting and implementation of housing projects was not provided due to the failure of the HG loan to materialize.  However, NACHU has since gone on to contract five housing projects benefiting 474 households with construction financing from other sources, thus approximating production targets defined for the HG program.  (4) As a result of the project, significant resources were mobilized for mortgage lending to low-income households.  Project TA directly led to the establishment of a new, locally funded program for issuance of group mortgages to low-income communities through the private sector Kenya Cooperative Bank, with $1.96 million in initial funding.  Cooperative housing projects planned and implemented through NACHU will be among the first beneficiaries of this program.  The project had a less direct impact on the mortgage lending practices of more traditionally defined Kenyan housing finance institutions. Several lessons were learned.  (1) This project was handicapped by the failure of the design to distinguish carefully between its expected achievements and those of the related HG.  (2) The need vs. the demand for TA services must be carefully assessed. Despite the social need for expanded mortgage lending to low-income households, the housing finance institutions targeted for TA were unwilling to accept this TA to modify their mortgage lending practices in the absence of capital financing assistance planned under the HG.  (3) In ""software"" projects involving TA and training, precise benchmarks are required to channel progress toward project objectives.  Lacking such, RHUDO/ESA had little to guide it beyond the rather broad objectives of strengthening NACHU and increasing mortgage lending to low-income households. (4) RHUDO/ESA lost the opportunity to learn from the project's training component by apparently failing to collect feedback from trainees.  (5) More use of institutional contractors may be appropriate for RHUDO/ESA in this day of diminishing resources and staff.  The hidden costs of the labor-intensive contracting approach used on this project appear to have been significant.

"Mid-term evaluation of the cooperative agreement (ATI-III) between Appropriate Technology International (ATI) and A.I.D. Evaluation covers the period through 12/92. ATI was conceived inside A.I.D. with ideas and encouragement from the U.S. Congress and the broader development community.  It was intended to be an experimental agent of U.S. development assistance, and to play a complementary role to A.I.D. as well as be a source of learning for it. It was designed to be enterprise oriented, opportunity responsive, flexible, entrepreneurial and timely.  It would target populations most difficult for government bureaucracies to reach and use a modus operandi least characteristic of such organizations.  ATI has remained loyal to this vision through the years and has earned respect and appreciation among those who have been closest to its work in the field.  More importantly, it is emerging from an intense period of transformation from a grant-making institution to a facilitator and provider of strategic assistance.  Over the past 15 years, it has had an average annual budget of $4 million in A.I.D. funds, with changing degrees of flexibility in the use of these funds.  Recent successes in diversifying project funding have resulted in a five fold increase in non-A.I.D. funding. Since 1990, ATI projects have received support from 16 sources, including 5 A.I.D. Missions. While the goals of ATI have changed little during this period; its objectives, methods, staff, and vocabulary have been constantly evolving.  Recent focus on larger groups of beneficiaries and its newly articulated subsector approach are impressive and enhance ATI's comparative advantage.  That advantage is based on its widely recognized technical competence in selected hard technologies, analytical skills, its ability to introduce new technologies, and its complementary soft technology concerns such as credit, business planning, and marketing. The evaluation includes a wide variety of findings.  (1)  ATI's mission is highly relevant and its strategies are significant, effectively pursued, and have a high potential for impact on a greatly increased numbers of beneficiaries.  This view was amply supported by USAID Missions, other donors, local partners, and beneficiaries in the four countries visited during this assessment. (2) The ATI-III cooperative agreement is increasingly irrelevant. It needs to be totally rewritten to define terms, reconcile inconsistencies, recognize the legitimacy of current categories of leveraging funds from other donors, substitute realistic funding targets in these leveraging categories, establish more relevant indicators, and initiate new methods for facilitating sustainability and diversified funding. (3) A.I.D. should accept ATI as a complement to A.I.D. rather than exclusively as an agent of A.I.D.'s changing agendas. ATI should be funded from the top of the A.I.D. budget rather than from the budget of only one bureau with its own priorities and evaluative criteria.  It also implies that ATI should be viewed and utilized as an opportunity for flexible and innovative activities leading to mutual learning from experimentation.  This in turn suggests institutionalizing a collaborative relationship between the leaders of the two organizations. (4) There is within ATI a tendency to undervalue its significant contributions and the alternative styles which it manifests.  For example, the feedback loops from its own experience in implementing projects through adaptive, iterative, processes are not well incorporated in its own literature.  Also there is less involvement of other organizations in its analytical and planning activities than those organizations might desire.  Few research institutions have the grassroots experience of ATI and could benefit from more involvement while complementing ATI's skills. Another example is that ATI's own capability statements focus on the primary producers while, in fact, a major contribution is also being made by its innovative work with intermediary producers of equipment to be used by the primary producers. (5) Areas for improvement include:  moving to an overall management system which would better support the direction ATI is headed by integrating reporting, monitoring, and evaluation activities; budgeting improvements; improving reporting and monitoring of time allocation of all staff members in order to better communicate costs of operations and to make management tradeoffs; strengthening field/central office integration and mutual learning, and increasing field presence as resources permit. (6) This report recognizes the importance of on-going government funding, and it suggests the need for greatly increased resources. Suggestions include allowing ATI to be an ""investor"" capable of earning a return on some of its activities, and to open its own credit facility in support of its local partners and in order to recover some of its capital needs. (7)  Additional collaboration with other development organizations may have particular usefulness in expanding policy and environmental analysis in project development.  It may also open new revenue sources. Having time for this may require narrowing ATI's focus among subsectors, within a program, or geographically. (8)  ATI has shown an awareness of the changes needed in personal and corporate operating styles as project activities move from ATI-II such as demonstration projects to countrywide and regional programs. (9) Local capacity building remains a central requirement of any development activity and ATI has new opportunities to bring local organizations along with it in its subsector approach.  This observation will reverse the guidance provided by the 1982 A.I.D. evaluation to move away from local capacity building and emphasize commercialization of technologies through enterprise development.  ATI's success with indirect funding and instrumental leveraging reflects its continued concern about local capacity building even if it was deemphasized during ATI-II.

"External evaluation of the Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU's) Research Grants Program covers FY84-FY91. During the period reviewed, 152 research grants were awarded to 30 HBCU's.  More than half of the grants (83) were received by only 7 of the institutions.  However, the program is not designed as a cohesive research program.  Grants are awarded for discrete projects, and there is no system for ensuring that new grants will build on prior research results or will be related to other ongoing grants.  Such cohesion as exists appears to have been the result of the efforts of some HBCU's and principal investigators. The overall impact of the program, from the perspective of principal investigators and research directors, has been positive.  In only 8 years, a critical mass of HBCU scientists have developed expertise in international programs, and many HBCU's have strengthened their capabilities to work with A.I.D. However, the concept underlying the program contains an inherent conflict.  While the program's stated aim is to strengthen institutions, the research grants are often the result of the efforts of one researcher, or a very small group of researchers. These researchers often obtain multiple grants, often at different HBCU's.  As long as the principal investigators remain with minority institutions, the aggregate capacity and experience of HBCU's are increased.  However, the development of the capacity of a particular institutions often is thwarted by the movement of principal investigators. No drastic changes in the program are recommended, but it is recommended that HBCU's that have developed a critical mass of research resources (and, accordingly, can be expected to generate visible favorable results) be rewarded for their initiative by being designated centers of excellence.  Prospective centers would be expected to define a focused, long-term research plan, perhaps for 5 years, and to seek funding from non-A.I.D. sources to complement A.I.D. funding.  It is suggested that as a demonstration of the centers of excellence concept, grants of $200,000 annually be awarded to two such centers, one for health and one for agriculture.","Delivery order no. 11","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-0085-I-00-9087-00","","11/1/1992 12:00:00 AM","","Universities and colleges|Disadvantaged groups|Research grants|Research management|Institution building","USA","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABF428.pdf","463 KB","003366 - TvT Associates","","007065 - USAID.

"Summarizes final evaluation of the PVO Initiatives Project (PIP) to mobilize PVO-NGO collaboration in development activities in Africa. Evaluation covers the period 9/89-5/92. PIP was designed as a catchall which incorporated existing Bureau activities with PVOs with new activities.  As such, it was more a collection of activities or deliverables than a cohesive project.  While the project paper calls for a focus on institutional development, Africa is too big and PIP resources were too small to have measurable influence.  PIP tried to work in too many places with too little money, and too few staff.  Activities tended to be one-time, one-shot affairs with no follow-on, no sequencing, no consistent theme, and were not necessarily responsive to project objectives. Secondly, the project had no formal monitoring and evaluation system. While the project paper describes the project as focusing on institutional development, there were no indicators to show when progress towards this goal was being achieved. Datex (the contractor) measured success on the basis of completion of project activities.  A planned midterm evaluation was never carried out. Thirdly, PIP design did not lead to sustainability.  No efforts were made to house any of the components with a PVO or NGO; no additional funds were sought for corollary activities; no follow-on activities were conducted, either by PIP or participating PVOs/NGOs; and while there was a mechanism to distribute reports to those who requested them, there were no strategies to apply the findings and lessons from those materials to other activities. Despite these three design flaws, more could have been done to cluster activities and sequence events to increase effectiveness. The evaluation team found that among the 60 people interviewed, none were aware of more than two or three components of the project.  As described in the methodology section, individuals interviewed were selected from a PIP list of their most active supporters and participants.  The notable lack of knowledge about the project suggests a lack of participation on the part of the PVO and NGO communities and reaffirms that PIP is a loose set of activities rather than a coherent institutional development strategy. Participants in PIP workshops and those who received Partnership Initiative Fund grants did not recognize the project until the project was described by the evaluators and a copy of the newsletter was shown. At least ten U.S. PVO representatives approached by the evaluation team were not subsequently interviewed because they did not know the project. Datex had some flexibility to structure activities for greater effectiveness by sequencing activities, choosing target countries, integrating grants, workshops, and research papers around institutional development themes and other NGO strengthening activities.  Rather than promoting institutional development by clustering PIP components, the contractor chose instead to emphasize its corporate strengths which included data base development. One of the strengths of the design was the physical placement of the project within the Africa Bureau.  However, because of security issues and a shortage of space, the decision was made to house PIP in a Datex office outside the Bureau.  While this was a practical solution, it had the effect of marginalizing the project and left the Bureau without a strong internal advocate for PVOs and NGOs. As the project became increasingly marginalized due to Bureau staff turnover, the contractor became the de facto liaison with PVOs. As the current project will end September 15, 1992, the evaluation team recommends that the contractor finalize all activities already initiated or scheduled.  This includes completing reports and papers and holding scheduled workshops and training events.  Those deliverables not already started should not be undertaken. The evaluation raised issues of importance to the redesign of the project, including whether the Bureau wants to work through a centrally funded project with PVOs and NGOs.  This is not a decision that should be made without finalizing the PVO strategy paper and taking a careful look at what is already being done with PVOs and NGOs through Missions. It appears that there are unmet needs that can be met by a centrally funded project including regional activities such as workshops and exchanges of technical expertise between countries.  Small grants, if strategically used and dispersed quickly, would be extremely valuable to PVOs and NGOs. Other redesign issues include the involvement of PVOs in project design to increase their participation in the project, and whether the project is implemented by a for-profit or a non-profit firm (or some combination).  The evaluation team feels that the contracting mechanism itself plays a role in the success of this type of project.

"Evaluates PASA with the Peace Corps for a program to promote microenterprise development.  Midterm evaluation of the program, which is funded under projects 9311090 and 9365448, covers the period 1990-92. The PASA has spurred tremendous growth in the Peace Corps' Small Business Development (SBD) Sector (division), enabling it to: (1) increase its funding base by 200%, from $760,000 in FY 1991 to $2,225,500 in FY 1993; (2) launch activities in 23 new countries, raising the total number of countries being served to 28; (3) increase the number of SBD volunteers by 66%, from 279 in FY 1990 to 424 in FY 1992; and (4) provide training and networking opportunities to 6,550 host country nationals, 2,237 Peace Corps volunteers and trainees, and 206 Peace Corps staff. The Sector has an outstanding record of punctual response to field requests, groundbreaking word in monitoring and evaluation, and staff dedication. The program has demonstrated the impact that small amounts of money can have when used for innovative activities.  Although even traditional in-service training has affected program and project development (Mali), innovative training activities which either brought people of different interests together (Uruguay) or focused on meeting specific host country needs (Poland) have had the greatest impact in-country and have most closely matched the program's sector and institution-building objectives. In the previous PASA (1988-90) and early in the present PASA, an A.I.D. project officer and a presidential management intern served as effective links between A.I.D. and the Peace Corps. Now, however, cooperation and collaboration between A.I.D. and the Peace Corps in Washington appear to be at an all time low, in part due to the project officer turnover and a failure to address the program's information development and dissemination objectives. The rapid growth of the Peace Corps' SBD Sector and the subsequent increase in level of requests for assistance, along with the increased workload placed on SBD staff have prevented the SBD from completing an analysis of lessons learned.","Project title: Growth and equity through microenterprise investment|(GEMINI)","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-0085-I-00-9087-00","","12/1/1992 12:00:00 AM","","Microenterprises|Technology transfer|Voluntary organizations|Public sector|Development cooperation|Technical training|Beneficiary count","Mali|Uruguay|Poland","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABF432.pdf","5,210 KB","003366 - TvT Associates","","007222 - USAID.

"Presents final Mission report on a project (FY82-FY92) to provide nonformal technical training to unemployed out-of-school youths aged 15-25 in the six countries of the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS) and Barbados. This project was a success:  all participating governments have pledged to continue funding the programs (short-term, practical training, followed by help with job placement) initiated by the project. This has occurred even though several of the governments are struggling with economic adjustment programs and are looking to trim their technical training programs. In its final phase (FY89-92), the project met its overall training targets, and exceeded by far the 40% target for training of women.  Most training was in direct response to the needs of employers and communities, but the formal advisory committees, instituted to provide linkage with the private sector, were not functioning at the end of the project.  Moreover, staff were not skilled at analyzing labor market needs. The placement rate for trainees exceeded 70%.  Unfortunately, lack of tracer data has made it impossible to verify longer-term impact. Another strength of the project was the low unit cost, averaging $1.84 per participant hour of instruction. The Caribbean Development Bank has expressed interest in helping OECS countries expand their skills training.  To date, the training covers only about 15-20% of the potential target group. Two lessons were learned.  (1) The project's strategy of using diminishing subsidies to ensure institutionalization of innovative services into regular government portfolios worked. (2) Regional interaction (meetings, exchange visits, workshops) can strengthen the development of similar national programs.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","12/1/1992 12:00:00 AM","","Out of school youth|Vocational training|Project sustainability","Eastern Caribbean|Barbados","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABF414.pdf","58 KB","001757 - USAID.

"The Democratic Pluralism Initiative (DPI)/Women in Development (WID) portfolio is diverse and includes such programs as:  (1) female literacy in Peshawar, Quetta, Islamabad, Akora Camps No. 6 and 8, and Wardak and Jaghori provinces inside Afghanistan; (2) the International Rescue Committee's (IRC) formal education for females in Lycee Malalai and community based girls' primary schools in camps near Peshawar; (3) limited teacher training provided by IRC; (4) office skills and managerial training by IRC; (5) English language and journalism classes; (6) health educator training; (7) formal higher education at Ummahat-ul-Momineen Women's University in Hayatabad, Peshawar; (8) skills training integrated with adult female literacy (sewing, tailoring, and knitting) and health education in all funded projects except the women's university; (9) one poultry project, implemented by Save the Children in Nangarhar province; and (10) professional development for Afghan women through participation in international forums, one in Pakistan and one in the U.S. This report documents the progress made by seven delivery organizations (five Afghan and two foreign) in meeting their stated objectives under the DPI and serving the education and survival needs of Afghan women.  All the projects examined are managed by Afghan women and held in gender segregated facilities in accordance with the local cultural and religious values.  Most of the beneficiaries are refugee women living in Pakistan, primarily in Peshawar.  Only one organization, the Afghan Women's Resource Center (AWRC), has a camp female literacy program, in addition to its program in Peshawar.  Two organizations provide cross-border literacy education in two Afghan provinces:  the Rural Reconstruction and Development of Afghanistan's (RRDA) female literacy project in Wardak, and the Shuhada Clinic and School's literacy project in Jaghori. Some of the programs have been operating for years (e.g., the Lycee Malalai has been running for 5 years); others are just beginning. Several hundred girls and women have graduated from the various programs and over 2,000 are currently enrolled.  Many of the graduates are now in leadership positions in expatriate and Afghan NGOs, others are employed in various capacities serving female Afghan refugees and their families. Generally, all projects have made progress toward achieving their stated objectives and responding to the multiple educational, health, and economic needs of women in the refugee communities and inside Afghanistan.  Some are running smoothly, such as IRC's comprehensive Female Education Program in Peshawar and vicinity, the Afghan Women's Education Center's (AWEC) multi-faceted program for urban refugees in Islamabad, and the AWRC's camp literacy program.  Others are facing hardships.  The Muslim Sister's Organization of Afghanistan's (MSOA) university for women is struggling to achieve its ambitious objectives under severe human and physical shortages.  Save the Children's women's poultry project, which has a great success potential, was interrupted for several months because of the suspension of cross�border operations, but resumed when the suspension was lifted.  The female professional development program has been successful in many ways, but it has had its difficulties as well. The Wardak literacy project is just beginning with a lot of enthusiasm and energy among the management and staff of the implementing organization.  New developments are occurring in all programs as they attempt to respond to local needs and changing socio�economic and political conditions.  All the projects deserve continued financial support, from AID and other sources. This report includes many suggestions and recommendations to help both the implementing organizations improve their services, and AID and the Asia Foundation to provide them with needed technical and other support.  The report stresses the importance of improved and expanded literacy and income-generation projects to maximize their impact on a larger segment of poor Afghan women; they are the ones who will ultimately carry the burden of sustaining their families, improving living conditions in their communities, and rebuilding their war-devastated country. This report is divided into four sections.  Section I discusses the background of the WID program of DPI, purpose of the evaluation, and evaluation methodology.  Section II provides an assessment of each of the seven implementing organizations and their programs in terms of general program characteristics and institutional capabilities of the implementing organization; relevance, sustainability, and impact of the program; and recommendations for improvement.  Section III discusses the constraints and risks involved in providing programs for Afghan women, both on the client and provider sides.  Section IV provides a general conclusion regarding the DPI's WID portfolio, and recommendations to enhance the quality of the various projects, expand their services, and increase their effectiveness in serving their target papulation.","At head of title: Democratic pluralism initiative, Office of the|AID Representative","Special Evaluation","Documents","306-0200-S-00-1224-00","","2/1/1992 12:00:00 AM","","Women in development|Educational development|Refugee relief|Literacy instruction|Segregation|Cultural environment","Afghanistan|Pakistan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNABN477.pdf","3,371 KB","008505 - USAID.

"Evaluates the impact of economic assistance to Panama's private and public sectors following the U.S. invasion of 12/89. While USAID had set aside $108 million early in 1990 as a ""safety net"" to encourage the unfreezing of bank deposits, reflows of money into the banks during the first half of 1990 made it unlikely the safety net would be needed.  As a result, it was decided to use these funds to reactivate the economy.  Under a program designated FREN (Fondo de Recuperation Economica Nacional), USAID made the $108 million available to the Bank of Panama to purchase certificates of deposit from participating banks for the equivalent of 50% of medium-term loans (1-5 years). It turned out that FREN was implemented during an expansionary banking period.  For example, from mid-1990 to 3/92, loans of FREN banks increased by $284 million, while total loans of all private banks in Panama increased by nearly $1 billion.  Still, FREN resources accounted for 14% of total investment in 1991, and had an estimated impact of $125 million or 2.5% of the GDP for that year.  The program also had a positive effect on unemployment, though the latter remains substantial. Under the public sector program, USAID provided funds for priority investments in agriculture, health, education, justice, other social sectors, natural resources, and infrastructure.  Of the total available, $20 million was channeled through a Social Emergency Fund to fund a large number of small, labor-intensive, local social development programs.  Release of the second and third tranches was linked to conditionality set by two international financial institutions (IFI's) -- the World Bank and The InterAmerican Development Bank.  This strategy was appropriate; for USAID to have designed its own conditionality would have created confusion in Panama.  At the same time, USAID acted wisely in timing its disbursements differently than the IFI's and in giving somewhat greater weight to political considerations.  USAID also provided $130 million to help Panama settle its arrears with the IFI's, under conditionality once again linked appropriately to that of the IFI's. In many ways the Panama program represented a special case.  In per capita terms, it was the largest such program administered by USAID (surpassed only by Israel and Egypt in absolute terms).  It was organized in an extremely short time, in the wake of a military operation, without full knowledge of the economic situation in the country or the economic policies of the new coalition government. Moreover, the program was politically urgent and included numerous specifications, set by the U.S. Congress, which left USAID less maneuvering room than desirable. At various points, USAID had to choose between direct involvement in investment decisions or leaving these decisions to be made by either private banks or the government.  Wisely, USAID decided not to exercise excessive influence on the Panamanian economy. The criticism this provoked  -- that USAID did not know what happened to the money -- is fundamentally mistaken. Although USAID's Panama program is atypical, it teaches several general lessons.  (1) USAID can respond to lack of demand in host countries either by sponsoring a fast-disbursing domestic program or by pumping additional resources into banks for onlending.  In the latter case, USAID should be carefully not to assume loan risks (the CD approach in Panama met that test), and the government should leave the choice of debtors, terms, and projects to the banks.  (2) USAID funds to support banks' lending activities should return to the government as the loans are due for repayment (even it the borrower needs to repay) and this reflow should be considered a new aid program to which USAID can attach conditionality.  (3) When IFI conditionality substantially meets Agency objectives, USAID should piggyback onto it, while tailoring it to the particular situation (e.g., by exempting urgent subprograms).  (4) The Panama experience exhibits the drawbacks of a program that is rigidly allocated into parts long before the magnitude of need or the availability of other resources can be defined.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","525-9999-C-00-2278-00","","12/1/1992 12:00:00 AM","","Nonproject assistance|Cash transfers|Economic assistance|Economic recovery|Private sector|Public sector|Financial institutions","Panama","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABF458.pdf","1,036 KB","004304 - Nathan Associates, Inc.","","007222 - USAID.

"USAID's Office of Energy and Infrastructure and the Rockefeller Foundation are providing support to a U.S./Indian joint venture (Energy Conversion Devices (ECD)/Suryovonics) to assess the market potential for a large-scale facility for the manufacture of amorphous silicon (a-Si) photovoltaic (PV) modules in India. A general assessment of a-Si PV technology and of ECD technology, in particular, is necessary to provide a basis for supporting investment decisions for the ECD/Suryovonics joint venture manufacturing and market development efforts.  The purpose of this assessment is to identify and discuss the key issues related to the current and future commercial potential of the ECD a-Si technology. A detailed technical description of the technology is beyond the scope of this report.  The reader requiring more detailed information should refer to the references for this report and to the PV literature.

"PACR of a project (9/79-9/91) to establish a Private Investment Encouragement Fund (PIEF) to provide medium and long-term credit and equity capital to private companies in Egypt. Eight loans, totaling $17.8 million, were made under the PIEF; recipients included GM Egypt, Fayrouz Hospital, Pioneer Seed, Berzi Confectionary and Food Co., Arab Aluminum Co., Arab Medical Food Co., MISR Poultry Grandparents, and South Egypt Drug Company.  Six banks participated in the PIEF, and 50 million Egyptian Pounds (LE 50 million) were leveraged (if some lending which might have taken place anyway is included).  Average loan length was 5 years, which, while not long-term by U.S. standards, is long-term in the Egyptian context. Nevertheless, the project cannot be considered to have achieved its overall goal of encouraging financial institutions to make longer-term investments in the private sector.  The failure is primarily due to the restrictive climate created by both Egyptian regulatory practices and USAID lending requirements which were applied early in the project, including administratively set financial variables (i.e., credit allocations, interest rates, and exchange rates), and excessive regulations governing loan approvals which precluded banks from engaging in normal, market based financial intermediation.  Further, there is no indication that the project fostered greater collaboration among financial institutions, another of its stated objectives. About $15.2 million of the funds were disbursed through the PSCIP mechanism (adopted to circumvent delays in loan approvals), reflows from which were to accrue to a Local Currency Special Account; as of June 30, 1992, the account was still $3.74 million short of the required $15.2 million. A number of lessons were learned concerning credit projects. USAID should, as a rule, avoid directed credit projects, except in cases of serious market failure or to redress past discrimination in lending. Recommended is analysis of a host country's policy, legal, and regulatory framework as it affects the financial sector, coupled with policy-based non-project assistance to encourage liberalization of the economy and financial system; projectized assistance should be used mainly as a catalyst in a favorable policy environment.  USAID's regulations and administrative requirements compounded the burden of host country regulations; given the unpleasant experiences in adhering to and negotiating the complex web of rules and regulations which attended this project, USAID should stick to the maxim ""keep it simple.""","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","6/1/1992 12:00:00 AM","","Private sector|Commercial credit|Long term credit|Loan administration|Investment promotion|Financial institutions|Business enterprises|Regulations","Egypt","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABF497.pdf","280 KB","008539 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (1981-92) to establish the U.S. Investment Promotion Office (USIPO) under the auspices of the Egypt - U.S. Joint Business Council as a private nonprofit organization to promote U.S. business investment in Egypt. From 1981 to 1988 USIPO was primarily used by the General Authority for Investment and Free Zones (GAFI), a Government of Egypt (GOE) agency, as a private sector support organization for activities related to the GOE-managed Private Sector Feasibility Studies Project (PSFSP -- 2630112).  As a result, USIPO reacted to the needs of the GOE and was not a proactive organization with its own strategic plans, goals, and objectives.  From 1981 to 1988 USIPO's accomplishments were modest at best, providing very limited information on Egypt's investment environment to American investors who visited Egypt. From 1988 to 1989 USIPO was granted increased financial resources and independence.  USAID transferred the PSFSP to USIPO in 1988, a few months before a new A.I.D./USIPO follow-on cooperative agreement was signed in 1989.  USIPO managed to increase the rate of PSFS project activity and facilitated the activities of several U.S. investors to Egypt. With the new cooperative agreement in 1989, export promotion started as a small part of USIPO's mandate.  As it turned out, export promotion became very successful from 1990 to 1991.  In fact, an evaluation of USIPO conducted by SRI International in 1990 noted the tremendous effort and resources necessary to facilitate U.S. investments to Egypt and suggested USIPO expand its activity and resources in export promotion. In 2/92 A.I.D. designed the Export Enterprise Development Project, a $10 million follow-on project strictly devoted to export promotion, in effect postponing investment promotion until economic conditions were more favorable. The following lessons were learned:  (1) the GOE's economic policies, implementing procedures for foreign investment, and the projected returns on investments are the most important factors in determining foreign investment decisions; (2) a well-organized, focused, and independent private sector organization, not a GOE entity, that can provide accurate, reliable, up-to-date market information to U.S. investors, is the preferred vehicle to promote and facilitate U.S. investments in Egypt; (3) financial incentives -- such as feasibility study cost sharing or reconnaissance cost sharing trips to Egypt -- are useful to U.S. business executives but not critical to a decision to invest; and (4) any investment promotion activity requires highly skilled TA to support the implementing agency and patience on the part of the donor.

"Evaluates project, implemented by CARE, to strengthen the capacities of community-based, Egyptian NGOs (ENGOs) to initiate self-help development projects in the four rural governorates of Fayoum, Sohag, Qena, and Aswan.  Midterm evaluation covers the period 7/90-6/92. The project is a sound, well-managed program of impressive achievements that will exceed its target of 250,000 beneficiaries, most of them economically disadvantaged.  Progress in the two major components -- Community Sponsored Development Activities (CSDA) and Small Economic Activities Development (SEAD) -- has been as follows. CSDA, aimed at building ENGO capacity to establish and manage local infrastructure and community service projects, has made excellent progress.  The program has undertaken 561 of a targeted 600 projects, mobilized LE 1.61 million of a targeted LE 2.16 million in local cash and in-kind contributions, and benefitted 236,910 individuals against a target of 200,000.  While women's participation is short of target, this is attributable to in-country conditions, not the project.  ENGO leaders widely commend the project's approach, saying that the training has significantly enhanced their competencies in executing and promoting CSDA-type projects; objective evidence corroborates these claims. Community conferences organized by ENGOs and project staff as a public forum for needs assessment have been a seminal event in ENGO-community relations and in ENGO capacity building.  The project should now expand ENGO management training and development education extension. The SEAD component, aimed at building ENGO capacity to establish and manage credit programs in support of small/microenterprises, has also made impressive progress; all major targets should be met or exceeded by the 6/93 PACD.  Priority indicators -- e.g., loan repayment rates, percentage of loan funds active, interest rates, volume of delinquent loans -- meet or closely approach SEAD's ambitious targets, while secondary indicators -- e.g., number of loans disbursed, women as a percentage of potential borrowers -- should be at least 80% of target. Demand for loans is high and most ENGO credit funds are effectively managed; financial controls are in place and well-utilized.  More broadly, SEAD has promoted participatory decisionmaking, increased ENGO membership, improved ENGO program management and community relations, and expanded ENGO outreach to the poor.  The major issue now is to ensure sustainability by remedying deficient ENGO support for community volunteers and their role in credit outreach to women. A negative note in the project has been CARE's inability to develop the capacity of Regional Federations (RFs) to sustain training and support for ENGOs when CARE withdraws.  This has been due, however, to the RFs' own lack of commitment.  Given this, CARE should emphasize strengthening the capacity of ENGOs to sustain the programs themselves. The major recommendation is to extend the project at least 6-12 months and preferably 18 months; an abrupt end would be detrimental to the sustainability of project outcomes.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","263-0102-G-00-1012-00","","6/1/1992 12:00:00 AM","","Community development|Community self help|Small scale enterprises|Credit|Indigenous private voluntary organizations|Institution building|Project sustainability|Poor|Beneficiary count","Egypt","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABF499.pdf","2,316 KB","007592 - International CARE-Egypt","","008539 - USAID.

"Interim external evaluation of the Egyptian Child Survival (CS) project covers the period 1985-11/92.  The project aims to improve the health of mothers and children through four vertical interventions:  an Expanded Program of Immunization (EPI), acute respiratory infection (ARI), child spacing, and nutrition (later merged into child spacing). Because of administrative delays, most major activity has taken place since 1990.  Project agreements have been amended several times. Currently, the project is funded for $67 million with an ending date of 8/95.  A team of nine independent consultants (four from Datex, Inc., one from the World Health Organization (WHO), and four from Egypt) carried out the evaluation in Cairo and five governorates. Findings are as follows.  After a slow start, the project is organizationally stable and is progressing at working speed. Using a difficult national approach, it has succeeded in exceeding its target of 80% coverage of children for six immunizations and in maintaining a functioning cold chain.  As a result, the number of reported target diseases has declined. Progress is being made toward polio eradication. Training in all the components has been extensive.  More than 17,000 health workers have been trained in EPI; nearly half of all primary health care/Ministry of Health (MOH) physicians have been trained in ARI; and over 6,000 physicians and nurses have been trained in perinatal services.  Additionally, almost 4,000 dayas (traditional birth attendants) have received training.  Research and knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) studies have been carried out. Sustainability is a major concern.  The full institutional and financial resources for sustainability are not yet in place and need to be planned.  Constituencies for child survival are underdeveloped. Project activities are not yet well integrated into the MOH.  Although the GOE's in-kind contributions are extensive, it is not meeting its full share of promised cash contributions.  Meanwhile, the project has engendered new recurrent costs for vaccines, drugs, and consumables, which the GOE will have to finance if these vital CS activities are to be maintained without project support.  The eradication of polio alone will require an annual investment of several million dollars for several years. Management capacity at Governorate/district level needs to be strengthened.  The project's national approach is not succeeding at the lower levels of the health care system because of the project's centralized management.  Planning, research, and TA appear to be directed mainly at meeting central needs.  The project needs to move more of its resources to provide greater support and flexibility in management, supervision, and planning at the governorate/district levels to assure smooth service implementation and to assure quality services. Management information systems and indicators for monitoring project achievement need improvement.  The MOH has numerous information systems, such as birth and death registration, which can be used more effectively to manage and plan CS services. Project and MOH information systems are not fully coordinated. The project, through its need for data, has added to the burden of reporting at the point of data collection.  Many of the indicators for project monitoring in the project paper amendment are not suitable for measurement. Project management needs improvement in other areas also.  Steps should be taken to better coordinate training activities, establish a project-wide research review committee, improve MOH capacity in mass media, and utilize private media resources as well. Training can be further improved by still more emphasis on practical skills and on-site training, team-building, and more involvement of the universities.

"PACR of a project (5/80-1/90) to provide U.S. graduate training to Egyptian Peace Fellows. Two evaluations (conducted in 1983 and 1989) of the Peace Fellowship Project (PFP) indicate that the project has met and exceeded its targets.  Two thousand and fifteen training opportunities were provided for graduate-level study in the United States against a target of 1,900. Peace Fellows were found to be utilizing ideas, techniques, and knowledge they gained in the U.S. toward accomplishing developmentally related objectives and to be instrumental in the development of new knowledge. In addition, the PFP has provided support to and enhancement of the Government of Egypt (GOE's) capabilities for administration of graduate-level programs in the United States. The PFP and its successor (2630125.1) are essentially one program that was funded out of two different funding sources; the projects overlapped for almost 3 years (5/88-1/90) during which time they were being concurrently implemented by the same agency. The following lessons learned from the overall program will be addressed if a follow-on project is undertaken:  (1) Full academic degree programs (M.A., M.S., or Ph.D.) are more desirable and satisfactory to Peace Fellows.  This is the only A.I.D.-funded program that focuses on graduate-level training. (2) Private sector candidates should have opportunities for Master's degrees in business fields.  (3) As for practical or on-the-job training, PFP is not the appropriate vehicle since it is primarily an academic graduate study program.  (4) Split-funding of Ph.D.s should be discontinued -- problems encountered with visa extensions and financing of medical coverage are unjustified administrative burdens.  Also, GOE regulations allow for extensions of sometimes more than 7 years for Ph.D.s.  Some of the requested extensions may go beyond PACD.  (5) Postdoctoral research should be for periods of at least 18-24 months.  (6) Data/research programs (18-24 months) were found to be appropriate for completion of Egyptian Ph.D.s. There must be good coordination between Egyptian and U.S. universities.

"PACR of a subproject (SP) to develop the Government of Egypt's (GOE's) capabilities to collect and analyze data needed for energy policy planning, focusing on institutional development of the Organization for Energy Planning (OEP).  Final report covers the period 8/82-5/91. The SP succeeded in strengthening the GOE's institutional capacity to process and analyze energy data by precipitating the creation of OEP, and met nearly all its numerical targets. However, OEP's impact on the root problem of ineffective development and utilization of energy resources has been limited; while OEP has proved itself to be a competent analytical body, it lacks formal and informal mechanisms for feeding its analytical outputs into the GOE's energy policy planning and decision-making process. OEP is taking steps to become a more active participant. All training under the professional development component was successfully completed, and in some cases, outputs exceeded expectations.  An energy data collection system is in place and OEP has trained over 3,000 energy managers, primarily from the industrial sector.  Fifty full-time specialists have been trained, compared to an expected 10 or 15.  International experts conducted nine week-long training seminars on topics ranging from energy cogeneration policy to energy conservation in the transportation sector. Outputs of the special studies component included:  (1) analyses of energy conservation in industry, agriculture, transforation, and cogeneration; (2) a high efficiency lighting demonstration for Nasr City hospital; (3) sectoral policy studies of energy consumption in industry and transportation; and (4) 16 in-depth energy audits of Egyptian industrial facilities, 11 in conjunction with U.S. contractors and 5 with the Government of Sweden -- the audits are being put to use under the Energy Conservation and Efficiency Project (2620140.3) Lessons learned, taken from the 4/89 evaluation, include the following.  (1) Institution building of the sort attempted in this project is a long, complex process, requiring a commitment by A.I.D. well beyond the ""incubation"" stage.  (2) Personal factors and dynamics, though difficult to capture in project plans, are extremely important in determining the success of institution building, suggesting a need for attention to process variables in project planning.  (3) When choosing to use host country contractors, Missions should be ready to accept some loss of control.  (4) Intermediate evaluations are powerful instruments for keeping a project in line with objectives.  (5) For relatively long-term institutional development projects, plans should be written so as to allow considerable flexibility in responding to changing conditions; detailed plans can create problems for a project being implemented in the midst of uncertainty, because some of the partners are likely to take them seriously.","Cover date: July 1991","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","2/1/1992 12:00:00 AM","","Energy policy|Energy planning|Government departments|Institution building|Policy dialogue|Policy analysis","Egypt","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABF503.pdf","339 KB","008539 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (9/81-9/91) to reduce mortality due to diarrheal diseases among Egyptian children aged 0-5 years, mainly through the extension of oral rehydration therapy (ORT). Exceeding all targets, the project dramatically reduced child mortality due to diarrhea (from 33/1,000 in 1982 to 11.8/1,000 in 1991, a 64.5% decline) and has earned a worldwide reputation for its success. Specifically, the project:  (1) increased mothers' awareness of ORT to 99% since 1985 vs. a targeted 90%; (2) raised mothers' knowledge of proper mixing of oral rehydration salts (ORS) to 90% vs. a targeted 75%; and (3) raised mother's use of ORS to treat diarrhea to at least 66% vs. a targeted 50%. The training program was highly successful.  A total of 47 appropriately equipped governorate training centers offered hands-on ORT training to over 10,000 physicians and 15,000 nurses, while workshops for medical organizations -- the Pediatric Society, the Pharmacists Syndicate, and the Friends of Breast milk Society -- provided information on ORT to administrators, pharmacists, statisticians, social workers, and community leaders.  The project also helped add ORT to medical and nursing school curricula. Mass media -- primarily TV, accessible to 90% of the Egyptian population -- were used to introduce ORT to the public, resulting in increased awareness of and demand for ORT.  In response, USAID, in collaboration with UNICEF, worked with the MOH to ensure uninterrupted production of ORS (initially, UNICEF provided equipment and raw materials and USAID financed production).  The government pharmaceutical firm responsible for ORS production originally did so under a MOH administrative order, not because the activity was profitable.  Toward the end of the project, ORS prices were increased to ensure continued production. Project sustainability has been encouraged through the government's creation of a budgetary line item for ORT and through establishment of a directorate-level MOH administrative unit.  Nonetheless, sustainability is doubtful (some efforts have been relaxed already since the 9/91 PACD) unless creative financing measures can be utilized.  Also needed is policy dialogue on the turf battle within the MOH concerning the use of funds from the Child Survival project (2630203) to monitor diarrhea incidence (which has changed little over the life of the project). Research by UNICEF demonstrates that diarrhea can be prevented at the village level through the use of low-cost technology in sanitation, water supply, and community health education.  In this context, USAID needs to examine why its water and sanitation projects, costing millions of dollars, seem to have made no impact at all on diarrhea incidence. Project research also discovered that rice-based ORS has definite advantages over the regular glucose-based formula and that there are a small percentage of diarrhea cases that are not responsive to ORT.  More work is needed in these areas, and also in (1) discouraging inappropriate use of drugs (especially antibiotics) in treating diarrhea, and (2) overcoming continuing problems in mothers' incorrect ORS mixing/dosing. Several lessons were learned.  (1) The project was successful due to a unique set of physical and economic conditions within Egypt -- good leadership, plentiful resources, a culturally homogenous society, a settlement pattern which enhanced the use of media and project management, and an elaborate MOH infrastructure.  These conditions may not be easily replicable elsewhere.  (2) Vertically structured, semiautonomous interventions can be highly effective but are difficult to integrate into the health service system when external funding ceases.  (3) Pilot testing is important for programs intended for nationwide implementation. (4) Mass media are a successful, cost-effective means of increasing demand for child health services. (5) The use of one contractor throughout a project contributes to smooth implementation and results in the trust of local experts and authorities.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","9/1/1992 12:00:00 AM","","Diarrhea|Oral rehydration therapy|Child survival activities|Child mortality","Egypt","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABF504.pdf","570 KB","008539 - USAID.

"PACR of the Decentralization Support Fund (DSF), designed to accelerate administrative decentralization in Egypt by providing 21 rural governorates with money to procure U.S. capital and other equipment.  The DSF was initiated in 1980 as project 2630143, subsequently subsumed as subproject 04 under 263K605, and was completed under 2630161.04; a follow-on, Local Development II (LD II - 2630182) has been active since 1985. Report covers the period 9/80-9/91. Capital equipment supplied under DSF greatly increased the capacity of the 21 participating governorates to provide basic services to their rural populations, and especially to improve environmental conditions. USAID disbursements for DSF of almost $100 million enabled purchases of 1,776 major pieces of equipment, service vehicles, and associated spare parts, as well as smaller items such as pumps and laboratory equipment. DSF equipment is now providing enhanced fire protection, improved sanitation trough wastewater pump trucks and garbage trucks, expanded supplies of potable water, and other new/improved services in rural cities, markaz, and villages. The experience gained by local and central government entities through planning and procurement activities (e.g., preparing technical specifications, contracting for offshore procurement) also enhanced institutional capacity to deliver basic services and strengthened the decentralization process.  Inventory and control systems for spare parts, as well as operation and maintenance procedures, have been established and institutionalized under DSF and LD II at governorate and markaz levels. While equipment utilization and availability rates are generally satisfactory, there were some exceptions.  South Sinai, Red Sea, and New Valley have average utilization rates of 40%, 58%, and 51%, respectively, and availability rates of 76%, 74%, and 79%; however, these relatively low numbers can be explained in part by the isolation of these governorates from service/repair facilities, as well as the fact that most equipment is used for seasonal purposes.  Utilization rates in Fayoum and Qalubia, at 54% and 45%, are unsatisfactory, as is Fayoum's availability rate of 68%.  Low rates are indicative of poor maintenance management, leading to excessive work days spent on repair. LD II is addressing maintenance management in problem governorates. The following lessons were learned.  (1) Equipment assistance programs must be critically evaluated and corrected early in the implementation stage.  (2) There was a general lack of awareness at all levels of the importance and benefits of adequate operation and maintenance of equipment, as well as a lack of maintenance resources (tools, facilities, and especially trained staff); LD II is emphasizing these aspects.  (3) Monitoring under LD II has revealed that some items provided under DSF were severely underutilized, primarily refrigerator trucks, small asphaltic batch plants, and solid waste incinerators; the need for such unusual items should have been more thoroughly assessed.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","4/1/1992 12:00:00 AM","","Decentralization|Public administration|Commodity import programs|Equipment|Procurement|Rural areas","Egypt","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABF505.pdf","405 KB","008539 - USAID.

"Final evaluation, prepared by the grantee, Project Concern International (PCI), of the  Child Survival V (CS V) project in Guatemala.  The evaluation is based mainly on two large community surveys.  The first survey was conducted in 7/91 to determine vaccination coverage in the Santiago municipality, and the second in 10/91 to address the remaining child survival components.  In addition, data were collected from several small knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) surveys, small focus groups, and the health information system used by PCI and community health workers (CHWs).  This report refers to both sets of data. CS V funding has been used primarily to refine and improve existing PCI activities in the Santiago Atitlan area and to expand activities to San Jose Chacaya.  Funding has permitted PCI to increase its immunization coverage of infants and children in the region; conduct Expanded Program for Immunization (EPI) training for CHWs and traditional birth attendants (TBAs); increase the referral of women for tetanus toxoid vaccination; expand the enrollment of children in the growth monitoring program; and increase the number of at-risk pregnant women referred to health services. In 3/90, A.I.D. funding for EPI and oral rehydration therapy (ORT) was suspended due to problems with the Ministerio de Salud Publica y Asistencia Social's (MSPAS) financial management. While not directly affected, MSPAS-PCI relations were influenced and the supplies of vaccines and ORS impaired. The 1989 detailed implementation plan (DIP) sought an attendance rate of 90% for a six-session EPI training course for CHWs.  One hundred and thirteen CHWs participated in this course, 18% more than were required. In addition, 19 TBAs were to receive EPI training, with emphasis on tetanus toxoid vaccination for women of childbearing age.  The benchmark called for 90% of the TBA's (17 out of 19) to attend the training course.  Eighteen TBA's attended the course, one more than required. Important lessons learned include the need for greater emphasis on the improvement of the health information system and better supervision of the planning and implementation of the project components.  Barriers to change can be tremendous and surmounting them a time-consuming endeavor; these considerations should be factored into the formulation of the objectives of any community development program. Two recommendations are made to reduce dependency and promote program self-sufficiency.  (1) A thorough investigation of ways to improve the efficiency of hospital program resources should be conducted; this would enable the hospital program to generate more of its own funding.  (2) Members from both the hospital and community health programs should be trained in writing grant proposals, and on available funding sources.

"PACR of a project (9/79-12/88) to increase the access of rural households and industries in Honduras to new and improved technologies. The project was a resounding success, exceeding its numerical targets in all major output categories (e.g., enterprises assisted, farmers benefitted, jobs generated, homes improved), and reaching some 158,000 direct and indirect beneficiaries (6% of Honduras' rural population). By adopting the farming systems methodology (FSM) in 1984, the project was able to focus its efforts in the most profitable areas for mass dissemination of appropriate technologies.  Its activities were economically successful as well, with a cost/benefit ratio of 1:1.39. The average income increase per beneficiary was $195.00 a year. The project also generated several lessons learned.  These are some of the most important ones.  (1) The number of public sector implementing agencies should be as few as possible to avoid problems of coordination and destructive political interventions. Both project sustainability and staff continuity depend on safety from political intrusions.  In this case, it should have been required as a condition precedent that the Government of Honduras (GOH) specify how it would buffer the project from such intrusions. (2) A project should not divorce financial from administrative authorities.  The project unit for technology adaptation (UDA) was located within the Ministry of Natural Resources (MNR), but financially dependent on the project, leading to tensions and conflicts among the various parties.  (3) Most projects that link credit and technological change have failed; this one succeeded because it used FSM, which allowed farmers to have a voice in the design of technologies, and to a large extent, in the design of the credit program.  (4) While PVOs/NGOs increased project outreach, future contracts should ask that PVO/NGO technical staff be trained in accounting, computer use, and technology transfer practices.  PVO/NGO efforts would also have benefitted from financial links with umbrella organizations such as FOPRIDEH and ANDI/PYME. In the area of technology development and transfer, the project teaches that early use of professional social analyses can help to identify technologies that are wanted and needed by the target population.  Future technology design should closely attend to features that characterize this project's successes: affordability; life quality enhancement; risk reduction; comprehension and ease of access; income generation; good fit with existing farming and wage-labor patterns; and readily visible results.  In addition, future technology generation/dissemination projects should learn from this project's flexibility, openness to user feedback, habit of building upon local practices and technologies, and use of existing socioeconomic organizations when possible. Finally, several lessons are associated with the project's adoption of FSM in 1984.  The FSM process of beneficiary-based testing, which may take 1-3 years, conflicts with USAID's conventional way of setting numerical goals which must be achieved in yearly steps.  The staff of conventional projects face too much pressure to meet these quotas, and often pursue them with reckless desperation (as happened during the first 5 years of this project).  The returns from FSM are low in the short-term, but rise dramatically after 3 years -- technologies based on beneficiary participation spread quickly without much extension work. Staff training is very important in FSM, as is ongoing monitoring and impact evaluation. Since the project ended in 12/88 the GOH has continued to finance some of its activities as a rural technologies program which assists rural small industries and enterprises only.  Rural households and small farmers are assisted by several USAID/MNR projects.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","6/1/1992 12:00:00 AM","","Rural areas|Agricultural enterprises|Private enterprises|Farming systems research|Agricultural technology|Appropriate technology|Industrial technology|Technology transfer|Beneficiary count","Honduras","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABF508.pdf","248 KB","008555 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (8/82-12/90) to promote agrarian reform in Honduras by establishing a mechanism for granting fee simple property titles for national lands occupied by small farmers. The project covered 8 of the country's 18 departments and succeeded in meeting its most important targets.  A total of 40,288 titles (vs. a revised target of 40,000) were issued, covering 55,029 parcels on 330,424 ha of land; the title/parcel disparity reflects a decision made in the second project year to reduce the management burden by issuing titles by beneficiary rather than by parcel.  There were two unplanned outputs.  (1) A total of 9,576 of the titles were issued to women, demonstrating their high level of interest in agriculture, and potential access to credit.  (2) A total of 368,204 parcels, covering 3.7 million ha of national and ejidal lands, were delineated with administrative boundaries, information which has proven useful to municipalities in their efforts to increase property land tax collections. Because Honduran law prohibited titling parcels of under 5 ha, the project focused on parcels 5-50 ha in size; however, two-thirds of the parcels delineated under the project were 1-5 ha in size.  A midterm evaluation recommended lowering the limit to 1 ha, an action which is now being approved through the Agricultural Modernization Law. On a more general level, the project aimed to create a collaborative mechanism between the National Agrarian Institute (INA) and the National Cadaster to effectively and accurately issue titles.  Whether the project's accomplishments in this regard are sustained and expanded upon will depend on the priority that the Government of Honduras gives to the titling activities as demonstrated by financial support to INA and the National Cadaster. A number of lessons were learned concerning the importance of (1) an appropriate legal framework (e.g., allowing titling of smaller parcels), (2) tight quality control when using air photography for delineation and mapping, and of training for delineation technicians, (3) baseline data; (4) the use of mass media to promote the program among beneficiaries, and (5) the provision of timely financial support to technical activities.  The project also demonstrated the added value to land when titles were issued, the willingness of banks to extend credit when properly informed of title benefits, and the feasibility of creating coordination between independent technical and legal entities.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","7/1/1992 12:00:00 AM","","Land titling|Small farms|Land ownership|Farmers|Land reform|Beneficiary count","Honduras","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABF509.pdf","567 KB","008555 - USAID.

"Presents final Mission report on a project (1982-91) to support, in conjunction with four other projects, the Government of Egypt's policy of economic and administrative decentralization. The five projects were originally known collectively as Decentralization Sector Support (DSS). When DSS ended, the present project continued under the Local Development II (LD II) program. While the project provided useful support to decentralization efforts and its training efforts increased local capacity and management, the overall objective of facilitating fiscal and administrative decentralization was not realized.  DSS's basic assumption -- that the decentralization trend that started in the 1960's would continue and be significant -- did not hold true during the life of the project, but suffered a setback in the late 1980's due to a mounting need for the central government to control the budget deficit and due to continued security concerns.  However, by the project's last year (1991), decentralization and change in local administration law were again being debated. More than 40% of the original project budget was to be used to provide start-up TA to an important local government training center that the GOE was building at Sakkara.  Construction was considerably delayed, however, and when the center was finally ready to begin operations, its management was put in the hands of a central GOE ministry, which refused project TA and which also failed to acquire appointed staff or a regular budget for the center.  Given this lack of GOE commitment, funds programmed for the center were shifted to other training activities, where they were effectively applied. The project's major training effort took place under the Training Block Grant (TBG) activity, which is now operational under the LD II program.  More than 32,000 persons, including governorate officials, local leaders, and PVO members, have received management training under TBG; 16% were women.  A recent assessment of TBG was very positive and urged its continued support.  The project also funded a number of research activities, most notably the successful rural small-scale enterprise pilot credit activity, which, beginning with $750,000, disbursed 9,519 loans totaling $2.53 million at market rates, and has now been expanded into a full-blown project. The project teaches these lessons.  (1) Given the problems with the Sakkara Center, future funds should not be allocated to support operations of GOE projects under construction without a firm national commitment.  (2) USAID policies that forbade paying honoraria to GOE officials who taught TBG classes proved counterproductive because GOE policies allow officials to receive honoraria for special duties (even if performed during normal working hours).  Henceforth, training programs using GOE officials either should be funded by the GOE or USAID honoraria regulations should be waived at the design stage.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","4/1/1992 12:00:00 AM","","Decentralization|Local level|Government policy|Management training","Egypt","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABF512.pdf","117 KB","008539 - USAID.

"Interim evaluation of the Management Training and Economics Education Program for Central and Eastern Europe (MTEECEE) to assist participating countries in the transition to a market economy.  Evaluation covers the period from 1991-92. The first year of activities was successfully completed --  11 U.S. universities have conducted 572 activities, including traditional courses, lectures, seminars, workshops, and conferences, in the six Eastern European nations of Albania, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland, and Romania.  In general, the program has been a broad-based institutional success and has enjoyed enthusiastic participant support. The most frequently offered activities, market economics courses and train-the-trainers programs, have had immediate educational impacts throughout the region.  Grantees have tailored market economics courses to meet the specific needs of local populations (e.g., basic micro and macroeconomics courses in Albania, and graduate level econometrics and statistical methods courses in the Czech and Slovak Republic). Emphasis on train-the-trainers programs indicates a commitment to program sustainability.  Trainers represent the largest group (31%) reached in the program.  In each project where training of trainers has played an important role, plans have been made for local faculty to teach basic courses during Year Two, freeing U.S. faculty to teach more advanced and varied courses. Despite the importance of privatization, banking, and environmental management in the region right now, courses in these topics were the least frequently offered.  Therefore, it is recommended that the program place more emphasis on training of government officials in the areas of privatization and legislation related to business and banking regulation.  In addition, real gains can be made if the grantees advise financial institutions, which are reluctant to offer loans to small businesses because of the lack of adequate regulatory legislation, in the areas of risk assessment, credit procedures, and interest. Pollution abatement and waste disposal management should also be given a higher priority in the program curriculum, given the inextricable relationship between economic growth and a healthy environment. MTEECEE has reached a total of 15,485 participants, the majority of whom have been traditional students, teachers, and business people. However, journalists in Bulgaria and the Czech Republic, Solidarity workers in Poland, farmers in the Slovak Republic, and government officials in Albania have also received instruction. Participants have reported that the quality of instruction, characterized by interactive instructional methods, is excellent. Many of the participants have achieved significant business successes. Student contact hour measurements show that contact hours were greatest in the Czech and Slovak Republic (250,994), least in Hungary (26,901).  The cost of a student contact hour ranged from $8.60 to $85.87.  Where projects have an in-country presence, as with the University of Delaware in Bulgaria, the cost is significantly reduced. The discrepancy between MTEECEE starting funding level ($14,845,785) with actual expenditures during Year One ($11,515,691) can be attributed to late project start-up, and the need for grantees to modify their projects to suit local conditions.  A.I.D.'s contribution accounted for 78% of the total program allocation, including cost sharing. A.I.D. could not have chosen a more appropriate moment to begin this program than the volatile and sometimes harrowing months of 1991-1992. Operating in the region has indeed been a difficult task for the grantees.  The program has demonstrated remarkable flexibility in light of the changes now taking place in the region.  The available data reported herein is an account of a successful A.I.D. program, containing the necessary learning experiences for an improved second year of operations.

"Evaluates the U.S.-Egyptian Cooperative Health Program, which consists of 17 health projects conducted in partnership between Egypt's Ministry of Health (MOH) and three U.S. public health agencies:  the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and the National Institutes of Health. Midterm evaluation covers the period 12/90-6/92. Due to the Gulf War, the program did not really get underway until the second half of the first year.  Nonetheless, with few exceptions the projects have made substantial progress and most are sustainable.  Staff are highly enthusiastic and competent, levels of cooperation between U.S. and Egyptian principal investigators are high, and the Office of International Health (OIH), which is managing the program, and USAID appear to have an excellent relationship in Egypt. Some of the projects (vaccine development, cancer and genetic research, medical equipment repair, food and drugs quality control, and health information systems) built on earlier cooperative efforts. Others are new projects, including activities concerning rheumatic fever, filariasis, arboviruses in children, diabetes, hypertension, injury control, and sexually transmitted diseases, as well as feasibility studies for an Egyptian Center for Disease Control and National Library of Medicine System. The projects are progressing well both as individual activities and as an umbrella program.  As individual efforts, the projects' abilities to combine the provision of services (such as genetic counseling) with research are of special note.  Even when such linkages do not yet exist, the projects are gathering the raw data needed by health planners in designing scientifically sound interventions.  As a whole, the projects are providing numerous benefits to the U.S. agencies as well as to Egyptian counterparts, e.g., experience gained in Egypt can be applied to FDA's efforts to harmonize pharmaceutical regulations as part of the GATT (General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs).  The projects are also making an important, coordinated contribution to improving the health and quality of life of the Egyptian population.  In fact, such a rich mix of diverse projects in multiple organizational settings may have a greater impact on the MOH's institutional aims and processes than would any single vertical project of equivalent funding. Continued funding is strongly recommended.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","263-0102-P-HI-1013-00","","6/1/1992 12:00:00 AM","","Health research|Disease research|Research collaboration","Egypt","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABF569.pdf","8,512 KB","001441 - U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Services.

"Evaluates cooperative agreement (1989-92) with the African American Labor Center (AALC) to strengthen the Egyptian Trade Union Federation (ETUF). AALC's work with ETUF began in 1979. Major conclusions are as follows. The labor movement in Egypt continues to be an important, democratically inclined sector which will feel the stress from structural adjustment and privatization and is worthy of A.I.D. funding. AALC is both acceptable to the labor movement and capable of carrying forward programs and projects on labor's behalf. It has met with a challenging set of external constraints and has overcome them well. A major shortcoming, however, has been AALC's inability to make any strides toward sensitizing ETUF to the need for programs aimed at women workers. Relationships between AALC's representative, and ETUF, constituent unions, other donors, and the State Department appear to be excellent. By contrast, the relations between AALC and USAID/E have, at times, been in need of improvement. USAID appears to have given inadequate attention to the labor sector in its current country strategy. An opportunity to provide for labor may exist in the new Democratic Initiatives Strategy now in preparation.","Work order no. 14|Companion evaluation summary: PD-ABG-739","Special Evaluation","Documents","OTR-0000-I-00-0035-00","","11/1/1992 12:00:00 AM","","Labor force|Women in development|Female labor|Trade unions|Labor unions|Labor relations","Egypt","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABF571.pdf","1,189 KB","000436 - Development Associates, Inc.","","008539 - USAID.

"In Africa's diverse and rapidly changing environment, USAID must continually reassess its approach to private sector development. The challenge facing the Africa Bureau is complex, ranging from promoting a general business environment favorable to large firms and financial institutions to developing microbusiness support for small farmers, women in development, and tradespeople.  This document describes the Bureau's experiences supporting private sector development and the lessons -- some general, some very specific -- it has learned.  These lessons are arranged under the following headings:  economic reform; government-donor relationships; the investment environment; reform through trade; networking and organizations; privatization; finance, debt swaps, and venture investing; and microenterprise development. Following are a few of the lessons.  (1) Reform without pain does not work; partial reforms may be more damaging than none at all. (2) The success of assistance must be more important to the local participants than to the donors.  (3) Reforms often founder due to informal barriers to business (corruption, uncertainty).  (4) The major constraints to trade growth are government policies and regulations, bureaucratic inefficiency and corruption, transport problems, and banking -- not supply and demand.  Traders are the backbone of African entrepreneurship, and liberal trade policy is the key to structural adjustment and the creation of an enabling environment.  (5) Lack of sophisticated business networks is a key constraint; the African entrepreneur works in isolation.  (6) Privatization is primarily a political decision and the handling of opposition central to its success.  (7) Most of Africa lacks the prime conditions that usually attract and maintain capital: a sufficient rate of return and predictability.  (8) As a response to government suppression of entrepreneurism, small enterprises have been forced to adopt a no-growth strategy to avoid unwanted intervention from the state.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","AOT-0438-C-00-3011-00","","10/1/1992 12:00:00 AM","","Economic development|Private sector|Private enterprises|Small scale enterprises|Economic policy|Investment promotion|Investment environment|Privatization|Entrepreneurs","Africa south of Sahara","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNABN753.pdf","860 KB","005159 - Labat-Anderson, Inc.","","006899 - USAID.

"Evaluates a series of business promotion/investment missions to African countries sponsored jointly by the AID/AFR/Office of Operations and New Initiatives (ONI) and the U.S.s. Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC). With substantial financial support and inspiration from AFR/ONI, OPIC conducted four missions to Africa over a 20-month period (1/91-9/92). (By comparison, in the 3-year period 1987-90. OPIC and A.I.D. separately conducted only three structured visitation programs to sub-Saharan Africa).  More than 100 U.S. firms participated:  37 in the mission to West Africa (Ghana, Ivory Coast, The Gambia, and Senegal); 32 in the mission to East Africa (Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania); 20 in the mission to Southern Africa (Botswana, Zimbabwe, and Namibia); and 18 in a mission which focused on Zambia.  Participating firms ranged from Fortune 500 companies to small, minority-owned businesses. The missions were well organized and generally received high marks from participating U.S. business representatives and A.I.D. field offices, but they were also quite costly.  The average direct cost to A.I.D was over $150,000 per mission, or about $50,000 per country visited, accounting for $600,000 of the $622,000 budgeted by A.I.D. for this activity.  By comparison, the direct cost of similar trips to non-African countries, such as a trip to Russia, or a trip to the Philippines organized by the U.S.-Philippine Business Committee, is estimated to have been $50,000 to $70,000. Results of the missions are uncertain but encouraging.  Committed U.S. investments generated by the missions are estimated at between $5-10 million.  Potential U.S. and foreign investment is conservatively estimated at $100-$150 million.  Potential sales of U.S. goods and services to Africa are estimated at about $60 million. Selection of representatives to participate in the tours was reasonable, given the difficulties inherent in persuading most U.S. business executives to consider operations in Africa (by contrast, the trip to Russia was oversubscribed).  Intangible benefits of the missions have been significant; forging partnerships between the American and African private sectors and enlightening local governments about their attractiveness to foreign investment is an important U.S. objective. A new A.I.D/OPIC memorandum of understanding has been arranged for eight investment/business missions during FY 1993-1994, including four visits to South Africa.  The evaluation recommends efforts to reduce the average cost of these missions, which is estimated at $125,000 or more.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","11/1/1992 12:00:00 AM","","Investment promotion|Foreign investment|Investors|Joint ventures","Africa south of Sahara","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNABN754.pdf","3,077 KB","005159 - Labat-Anderson, Inc.","","006899 - USAID.

"PACR of the TA/training component (""the project"") of a Housing Guaranty (HG) program to provide low-cost housing and basic infrastructure in Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras, and to strengthen the institutional capacities of participating agencies. The report covers the period 1986- 6/30/92.  Of the program's other two components, the Development Assistance (DA) loan, to finance infrastructure projects, was deauthorized on 6/5/90 due to implementation difficulties, while the HG loan is scheduled to continue until 1996. While the project did approach or exceed its numerical targets, the fact that its success was inherently linked to progress in the other two components limited its impact in terms of policy change and housing output.  Only $2.4 million of the $4 million TA/training grant was actually obligated.  The planned output of 177 months of TA was achieved, and the training of 1,063 professionals from national and regional agencies involved in shelter and urban development issues was satisfactory, though short of the target of 1,500. It was difficult to determine the extent to which the goal of institutionalizing improvements in participating national and regional agencies was achieved.  Suspension of HG disbursements in 1990 due to concerns about the liquidity of the Central American Bank for Economic Integration (CABEI) and the deauthorization of the DA loan essentially negated the aim of expediting implementation, and also limited the project's ability to promote policy changes on the part of national governments and housing finance institutions.  Nevertheless, the project was able to assist CABEI in implementing important policy and operational changes to improve its financial management, including approval by the CABEI Assembly of Governors to restructure along the lines of the recommendations contained in a 9/89 evaluation by Deloitte, Haskins, & Sells. Even though the project was not able to focus on implementation to the extent envisioned, the policy dialogue it promoted has led to support for decentralization in municipal development under subsequent projects as a means of expanding democratic governance in Central America; the policy dialogue process begun under this project needs to be continued on a long-term basis to assure the changes in attitudes which are necessary for policy and institutional changes. Approval to resume HG disbursements was received after the PACD. RHUDO/CA will adjust the median income for the two CABEI sub-programs, review other disbursement requests from CABEI, and de-obligate the remaining project grant funds.  It is recommended that policy dialogue become an integral part of the HG component, and that the restructuring plan mentioned above be fully implemented.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","9/1/1992 12:00:00 AM","","Housing investment guaranty|Urban development|Municipal level|Low cost housing|Housing administration|Public services|Housing policy","Central America|Costa Rica|El Salvador|Guatemala|Honduras","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABF657.pdf","638 KB","002290 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (9/85-12/91) to strengthen the financial and institutional capability of the Central American Bank for Economic Integration (CABEI) to provide and/or mobilize commercial credit to agribusinesses and other export-oriented enterprises in the region. CABEI's administrative and financial viability have been greatly improved as a result of the financial and technical assistance provided by project; continual policy dialogue with the U.S. government, the International Development Bank, the World Bank, and other creditors and donors; and, most importantly, the strong direction provided by CABEI's recently installed new administration in instituting internal reforms. The project's agribusiness component was successful in that all planned training and TA were completed, and all of the loan funds, including CABEI's counterpart contribution, have been disbursed to end borrowers.  Various institutional strengthening measures have also been completed:  CABEI has a permanent agribusiness lending unit; intermediate credit institutions have received the scheduled training; a mechanism to liquidate private sector debt in arrears has been approved by CABEI; CABEI's personnel administration has been improved; and personnel have been reduced by 70 and the operating budget by 34%. During the project, USAID had become increasingly concerned with CABEI's financial viability, particularly the growing country member debt and the overall liquidity of the Bank, and the implications of this for CABEI's ability to service $270 million in A.I.D. and A.I.D.-guaranteed debt.  CABEI's new administration has demonstrated a serious intent to restructure the Bank and deal with its financial problems, and has made progress in doing so.  Extraregional members (Mexico, Venezuela, and Taiwan) have been officially incorporated into CABEI's Board of Directors, contributing to an increase in the Bank's liquidity.  Under the Bangkok agreement (3/91), member countries agreed to negotiate payment plans to improve country contributions and to reduce debt service arrears.  Costa Rica has resumed payment of its capital contribution to the Bank. Lessons learned include the following.  (1) Projects with CABEI should condition disbursements on accomplishments rather than intentions.  (2) Extraregional membership on the Board of Directors remains the key to CABEI's success, as it reduces the impact of regional politics and increases the transparency of the Board's decisions.  (3) Because the President and Central American members of the Board of Directors are politically appointed in each country, it is essential that donors and extraregional members press the countries to appoint highly qualified Directors.  The quality of the Presidents and Directors has been uneven throughout CABEI's history.  (4) Third tier lending mechanisms such as the agribusiness lending component should be avoided, as they add an unnecessary layer of supervision and regulation.  (5) CABEI should be considered for inclusion in future debt rescheduling agreements between the individual countries and the multilateral and bilateral donor community.  (6) Given the volume of donor assistance which CABEI has a role in administering (up to $270 million in loans and housing guarantees through the U.S. government alone), it is essential ROCAP continue to monitor CABEI, whether there is a current project or not.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","5/1/1992 12:00:00 AM","","Regional development|Export promotion|Agribusiness|Development banks|Institution building|Capital assistance|Commercial credit","Central America","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABF658.pdf","636 KB","002290 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of a grant (1981-92) to Save the Children Federation (SCF) to support child survival social marketing activities in the Gorkha district in rural Nepal. The project has achieved a high level of success.  Most objectives were accomplished beyond targets -- a good achievement given the difficult mountainous terrain in the area and the fact that rural communities are usually conservative about purchasing health care products. Most notable is that awareness of family planning and the need for child spacing, and knowledge about diarrhea as the major killer of children, are high among all communities in the project area.  SCF's skillful and enthusiastic use of group discussions and mass media promotional activities has desensitized communities to contraceptives and family spacing so that now villagers speak freely about these issues, even in group situations.  A great variety of communicational materials (charts, leaflets, videos, audiocassettes, etc.) were produced. Drama was found to be an extremely effective means of mass communication. Sales of both pills and condoms through the project have increased, and contraceptive prevalence has risen significantly, although the latter is partly due to increased use of Depo Provera, which is becoming the method of choice for family planning throughout Nepal.  The project has achieved good contraceptive continuation rates, with regular use exceeding targets. The project has also led communities to realize the importance of oral rehydration salts (ORS).  Sales of Jeevan Jal ORS rose well (initially 14% higher than targeted), but were adversely affected by a sudden, steep price increase which was beyond the control of the project. The product distribution system works well.  The project has ensured a regular supply of products to sales agents and consumers.  Further training on storage is needed, however.  The school health program is also going well, and should continue. The main failure of the project has been its inability to achieve a phase-over of key activities to Contraceptive Retail Sales Ltd. (CRS), or to any other institution, to ensure future sustainability.  Despite this failure, relationships with CRS at the middle management level have been excellent.  CRS has provided the project staff with advertising materials, timely distribution of products, and useful marketing advice. Efforts are still needed to reach the poorest of the poor, who remain underserved.  The project teaches that start-up costs for a social marketing project are high.  Costs have to be incurred for staff training, liaison with other agencies, and in gaining the support and interest of the community.  In contrast, recurrent costs are low.","Attachment: XD-ABF-889-A","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","OTR-0535-A-00-7215-00","","10/1/1992 12:00:00 AM","","Family planning services|Social marketing|Contraceptive agents and devices|Condoms|Oral contraceptives|Contraceptive distribution|Diarrhea|Oral rehydration therapy|Health education|Family planning education","Nepal","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABF889.pdf","8,743 KB","001407 - Save the Children (U.S.)","","006982 - USAID.

"Evaluates a component of the RENARM (Regional Environmental and Natural Resources Management) project in Central America.  The component, implemented by the Interamerican Management Consulting Corporation (IMCC) under contract with ROCAP, aimed at developing higher value wood products from underutilized tree species in Guatemala, while simultaneously providing for sustainable forest management.  Ad hoc evaluation covered the period 1989-6/92. For an overview of the success and importance of this component, see PD-ABF-893.  Detailed accomplishments have been as follows. (1) While IMCC's strategy of initiating a large number of small activities (none of which are implemented in depth) has met with criticism, it has also been the primary vehicle through which ROCAP's presence has been felt throughout Guatemala.  (2) IMCC's manager, Mr. Molinos, has been a great asset.  He has played a key role in the formulation of a vastly improved forestry law and has acted as both a facilitator and a mediator between agencies involved in the forestry sector, although people in some U.S. agencies consider his work to be too political.  (3) IMCC is credited with introducing the country to borate treatment of wood products, a process which, if widely adopted, could be a key factor in changing people's attitudes towards wood as a renewable long-lasting resource.  However, to truly affect the forests of the region, the work with borate treatment will require a great deal of effort on the part of ROCAP. (4) IMCC has stimulated the interest of many artisans and larger industrialists in increasing the use of lumber from non- or underutilized species such as alder and oak.  In addition, some work has been done with ramon, Santa Maria, and other species from the Peten. This program would benefit enormously if the United States and other industrialized countries banned the importation of key species like Spanish cedar and mahogany except in finished products. (5) IMCC has developed the basis for managing existing forest stands for multiple and sustained use through the creation of markets for alternative (to firewood) forest products. Demonstration construction activities using both sawed lumber and the stems of small trees were helpful in this regard.  Important offshoots of the program could be the development of alternative uses for thinnings (pruning residues) from Central American fuelwood plantations.  Once again, however, sustainability of this effort will involve a long-term effort (decades). (6) IMCC also provided TA in air and kiln drying to producers of construction lumber and showed sawmillers the benefits of proper care and filing of saws; these efforts should improve both the quality and quantity of lumber produced.","Attached to PD-ABF-893|Attachment is project paper supplement|Regional Environmental and Natural Resource Management (RENARM)","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","3/1/1992 12:00:00 AM","","Forestry|Wood products|Markets|Natural resource utilization|Natural resource conservation","Central America|Guatemala","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDABF893A.pdf","5,052 KB","007669 - Stewart Holmes & Associates","","002290 - USAID.

"Evaluates the use of P.L. 480 Title II Food for Work (FFW) support to the Municipal Infrastructure Program in Santa Cruz, Bolivia.  The program, an innovative response to the need to construct basic urban infrastructure, uses Title II cash and commodities to provide construction jobs to the unemployed. Fundamental to the program is that neighborhood residents pay the majority of the costs for residential pavement and sewage outlets, with the understanding that their property taxes will not be raised while they are making these payments.  The private sector finances the remaining costs of main residential avenues and drainage canals, together with additional infrastructure that is beyond the means of neighborhood residents. FFW has played an important role in providing momentum to the start up of the Municipal Infrastructure Program.  Food has been an incentive to the construction companies to contract unskilled and unemployed workers.  Moreover, USAID participation in the Program has provided an element of confidence to neighborhood residents and participating institutions alike. One important problem has been the slow start-up and initiation of infrastructure projects, due principally to uncommonly heavy rains. Neighborhood residents were asked to begin payments immediately upon initiation of construction, and when long delays stopped construction, these residents began to complain.  Another problem was the high start-up cost of construction and the first year payments by residents which reflected these high costs. When the costs first appeared on the water bills, they were unexpectedly high to many, and to some, impossible to meet.  One innovative construction company tried to address these problems by talking and working closely with the neighborhood residents, assuring them that construction would continue. The company was able to reduce the late payments from 80% to 15% over a 7-month period. Nonetheless, many neighborhood residents continued to delay payments and to pressure the Municipal Government to reprogram their payments and even to find additional financing.  Even stronger pressure has been applied to abolish the system of neighborhood resident repayments. Consequently, the Municipal Government is reevaluating the Program's financial aspects. Key conclusions and recommendations are as follows.  (1) There are 332,340 very poor people living outside the 4th ring of Santa Cruz without paved streets, sewage, drainage, hygienic facilities, clean water, or adequate housing.  The FFW Program is not adequately reaching these groups.  A.I.D. should continue FFW into 1993, until the projects started in 1992 are completed, and then refocus the Title II food and monetary program on the marginal groups outside the 4th ring.  (2) Control and monitoring of food distribution and delivery to construction companies and workers have been tightened and adjusted; additional pressure will only add unnecessary burden.  On the other hand, a fixed and limited number of rations per worker per project must be defined. (3) There is a serious question whether Santa Cruz's municipal revolving fund will cover program costs in view of high construction costs and an overly burdensome administrative apparatus.  It is recommended that experts in municipal infrastructure, finance, and low-cost urban pavement construction be hired to reorganize the fund.  (3) There are too many organizations involved in the execution of the program.  The number of organizations should be reduced.  (4) Despite demands that it increase its staff, the Fondo de Desarrollo Municipal, which is running the Program, should try to meet program demands without expanding. Contracting out many of its functions and turning the promotion function over to neighborhood councils could solve this problem.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","8/1/1992 12:00:00 AM","","Food for Work|Urban development|Integrated rural development|Domestic government programs|Municipal level|Public services|Employment|Economic infrastructure","Bolivia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABF898.pdf","1,207 KB","008515 - USAID.

"Evaluates a grant to World Vision Relief and Development (WVRD) to implement a child survival/Vitamin A project in the Assaba region of Mauritania.  The project began in 10/89, but was interrupted by the Gulf War for 10 months (12/90-10/91). This midterm evaluation covers the period through 10/91. Most of the project's objectives -- e.g., vaccinating children, promoting breastfeeding, dispensing Vitamin A -- are well on their way to being achieved.  Particularly important has been the progress made in sensitizing the Ministry of Health (MOH), other Ministries, and the population in general in how to improve community well-being.  These aspects, along with the creation of community health committees, training of community health workers, and the introduction of cost recovery measures, will not only strengthen the health infrastructure in Mauritania, but will contribute to the sustainability of health care services. At first glance, the 10-month interruption of WVRD activities during the Gulf War might lead one to question the sustainability of the project.  Many vaccination services were interrupted, Vitamin A distribution by mobile vaccination teams ceased, and supplies from Nouakchott dwindled.  On the other hand, a number of project activities continued to function:  health committees were still in place, village health workers still provided some services, gardens were still planted, and mothers knew about proper weaning and continued to give oral rehydration solution to children with diarrhea.  Most importantly, however, the knowledge that the project shared with the MOH and the communities was not lost when WVRD was absent.  What did cause some activities to halt was lack of vehicles and fuel. Although it is currently impossible for developing countries to fully fund vaccines, vehicles, and fuel, it may be reasonable -- now that regions and departments in Mauritania have a functioning budget and cost recovery for some health services is getting underway -- to expect that some recurrent costs such as drugs and fuel for vehicles and refrigerators can be assumed by them. Finally, the evaluation notes specific areas in which more work is needed:  mothers don't understand what tetanus toxoid vaccine is (some think it's used to sterilize them); mothers don't know how to mix sugar/salt solutions; and oral rehydration packets are not always readily available.

"Final evaluation of the Rwanda Agricultural Surveys and Policy Analysis Project (ASPAP) to expand the analytical capabilities of a sample-based, agricultural data collection and analysis system developed under the Agricultural Survey and Analysis Project (ASAP); and to establish linkages between the system and agricultural policy and programming.  The evaluation covers the period 9/86-10/92. The project is a successful one.  ASPAP has been able to develop in the Division des Statistiques Agricoles (DSA), a data collection and analysis organization, which, by African standards, is excellent.  The project did, however, have some implementation difficulties.  Programs at Ministry of Planning (MINIPLAN) and the former Ministry of Finance and Economy (MINIFINECO) (the two other participating agencies in the project) were not successful.  The project was also plagued by difficulties with local cost funds and, to a more limited extent, with commodity procurement.  Implementation in the last year of the project was also hampered by internal disruption within the country.  Despite these difficulties, project objectives were substantially met. The project purpose was to develop an institutional capacity to collect and analyze data on the rural economy, which in turn would help to improve policy and program formulation in the country.  The data collection capability built by the project is well recognized, although there are still areas in need of refinement.  The evaluation also found substantial evidence of positive impact of the project-generated data on a host of policy and program issues that support the rural economy. While impressive, the evaluation contends that more could be done in linking ASPAP's data to policy making. Three general lessons were learned from the project:  (1) adequate staff is necessary for proper management of USAID's project portfolio; (2) policy oriented projects must be considered within the political context; and (3) institution building requires long and patient support with particular attention to operational details.  Cases may arise where it is in the donor's best interest to sustain an institution that a host government may not yet be able to afford.

"PACR of the Jamaican subproject (9/86-3/92) of a project to strengthen legal systems in the English-speaking Caribbean. Achievements under the three subproject components were as follows. The construction component completely renovated the Supreme Court building and 14 Resident Magistrate courts.  The problems of excessive heat and traffic noise were addressed at a low cost by minimizing air conditioning, relying on fans, and closing off adjacent street noise. Much needed furniture was provided. Under the records management component, the subproject automated and introduced the use of microfilm in the Supreme Court's civil registry and also introduced a computer-aided transcription system (CAT).  At the PACD, 1992 records were up to date in the filming process and 1991 records were being filmed.  After a slow start, the stenotypists adjusted to CAT system, and it took hold in the Supreme Court and circuit courts.  The training of court personnel included in this component was originally thwarted by high turnover rates stemming from low civil service salaries. This problem has been addressed. The training component provided in-country and overseas training to judges, resident magistrates, and prosecutors.  The objectives of the training were to:  (1) expand the judiciary's role in the decision of cases; (2) develop technical abilities in such areas as court management, statistical systems, and budgeting; and (3) promote respect for the rule of law and recourse to the courts by the people. Recommendations are to:  (1) establish a maintenance program for the buildings repaired under the subproject; (2) transfer responsibility for administrative management and physical maintenance of the courts from judges, registrars, and clerks to persons with management training and administrative experience; (3) continue to collect service fees (e.g., for filing documents, providing copies) and make sure these fees devolve to the Ministry of Justice, not the general budget; and (4) give responsibility for book procurement to the involved agency (in this case the Supreme Court) -- not to a contractor.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1992 12:00:00 AM","","Administration of law|Courts","Jamaica","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABG085.pdf","497 KB","008563 - USAID.

"An assessment of selected A.I.D.-supported child survival (CS) communication programs implemented from 1985-91 in Latin America and the Caribbean is presented.  An introduction discusses the three principal mechanisms through which A.I.D. has funded CS communication efforts: the multilateral Expanded Program on Immunization; bilateral agreements, which are often supported via centrally funded TA projects such as HEALTHCOM, PRITECH, and REACH; and contributions to PVO country projects. Section two outlines A.I.D.'s approach to public health communication, which is seen as a six step process:  initial research; planning; development and pretesting of materials; revision and production; implementation and training; and monitoring and evaluation. In Section three, 31 projects with CS communication components are assessed and compared within the framework of the A.I.D. approach; particular attention is given to 9 projects for which Project Papers were available.  A fourth section discusses the contextual factors which surround communication programs and help determine their success or failure (e.g., availability of primary health care; supply of rehydration salts and vaccine; mass media coverage; and skill of health care providers).  Section five reviews communication input and output indicators, and suggests approaches to research design, sampling, and data collection. Section six lists data sources used to complete the assessment.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","5/1/1992 12:00:00 AM","","Child survival activities|IEC|Health education|Communications aspects","Latin America|Caribbean","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNABP373.pdf","1,883 KB","000693 - Johns Hopkins University.

"Evaluates a rural electrification project in El Salvador. Internal, mid-term evaluation covers the period 8/88-2/92 and was conducted by the U.S. implementing agency, the National Rural Electrification Cooperative Association (NRECA). Progress in the two project components has been uneven.  The multi-faceted TA component is ahead of schedule, with training going well in all categories.  As of 3/91, 92 personnel of CEL, the national utility, had completed 419 person-hours of training at the training center included in the new CEL complex.  The subject matter of the training was appropriately aimed at rectifying major problems, trainers were knowledgeable, and equipment fully met expectations.  More training is needed, however, especially in accounting, since training needs were greatly underestimated at the start.  By contrast, the construction component has experienced substantial delays, mainly due to a shift -- which was advisable -- from the local lottery system to the competitive bidding procedure for selecting contractors. Several recommendations are made for adjusting the project's design. (1) Adding household connections from distribution lines constructed under the predecessor project (which did not include a credit program for house wiring) would bring in new consumers rapidly and would be very cost-effective in social, economic, and financial terms.  It would also improve the load factor of the total distribution system.  (2) While the Banco de Fomento Agropecuario (BFA) recently signed an agreement with CEL to provide TA and credit for a productive uses program, the Bank lacks commitment to the program.  If the BFA credit process does not function well, USAID should reconsider its stand against allowing CEL's Electricity Distribution Division (DISCEL) to serve as a lending agent for rural customers.  (3) Planned construction of a demonstration small hydroelectric project should be dropped.  Hydro technology has already been proven in El Salvador, but existing hydro plants have not been properly maintained.  (4) To reduce the financial burden which deters many potential customers from connecting to the system, CEL should assume the costs of service drops and meters.  While this is a radical departure from current practice, NRECA deems it necessary in order to bring electricity to the rural poor. Other recommendations are to, inter alia, address the project delays caused by the turnover rate in DISCEL staff and DISCEL's lack of experienced managers, streamline host country construction approval procedures, disaggregate project information by gender, have project trainees prepare course evaluations, conduct a cost-benefit analysis of the productive use demonstrations being conducted by NRECA's mobile unit, and conduct Government-to-Government policy dialogue on the need to create a Public Utility Commission and to re-privatize the electricity distribution system. Lessons learned are as follows.  (1) NRECA's Demand Assessment Model provides an objective and equitable basis for countering political pressures in regard to site selection.  (2) A commingling of participants from many countries creates a more open training atmosphere and lessens trainee defensiveness against changing practices.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","519-0358-A-00-8499-00","","2/1/1992 12:00:00 AM","","Electrification|Rural areas|Cooperative development organizations|Electric utilities|Beneficiary count","El Salvador","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABG403.pdf","3,473 KB","000874 - National Rural Electric Cooperative Association","","008540 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of a CARE project to reduce the rate of child morbidity and mortality in Indonesia's subdistricts by working in collaboration with the local government and village leaders improve health service delivery in the Posyandu (integrated health posts).  The evaluation covers the period 10/88-9/92. Major findings are as follows.  (1) CARE's community management approach was successful in increasing Posyandu attendance and increasing knowledge, attitudes, and practices of mothers and kaders (volunteer health workers) in the project areas.  (2) The project goals were accomplished successfully, following recommendations made during the midterm evaluation and following the Detailed Implementation Plan.  (3) Village Supervision Teams and Subdistrict Supervision Teams have been functioning well, providing important moral support and rallying broad-based community participation in Posyandu.  (4) Health education materials introduced during the project were well appreciated, especially by religious leaders. The materials integrated strong health education messages into religious teachings.  Religious leaders became active health educators in the community.  (5) Kader Incentive Support Systems using traditional mechanisms were beneficial to kaders.  The introduction of medicine posts (Pos Obat Desa) were added incentives for both community and kaders. The following lessons were learned.  (1) The notion of peer groups has proven to be an important factor positively affecting group behavior.  New expected behaviors are beginning to become norms in the project sites among the groups formed:  Village Supervisory Teams, Subdistrict Supervisory Teams, kader groups, and among mothers who attend Posyandu.  Peer pressure helps to maintain active participation in health activities.  (2) A community management project focus is more sustainable than a direct intervention focus as investments are made in human resource development and community organization. (3) Local community agents other than kaders can make tremendous contributions to primary health care.  Religious leaders are powerful health educators, given materials which integrate health messages within religious teachings.  (4) Working within the government context has highly increased the chances of regeneration, leading to sustained activities. As a change of personalities within the government can affect the support given to community management structures, it is important to involve the second and third layers within a system to assure the system will continue.

"Evaluates project to provide technical assistance, training, and information dissemination services related to urban and industrial pollution control in Eastern Europe.  Evaluation covers the period 9/90-11/92.  The project was implemented by the World Environment Center (WEC). The cooperative agreement with WEC was designed at a time when A.I.D. knew only the basics of the environmental calamity in Central and Eastern Europe and little about what WEC would encounter ""on-the-ground.""  As with other A.I.D. programs in the region, flexibility and speed were emphasized and the activities were intended to be demand-driven and responsive.  As drafted, the cooperative agreement did not lay out clear and consistent goals, objectives, and strategies, making implementation and evaluation difficult. This evaluation found that WEC has made good progress towards CA objectives; activities are having significant and substantial impact (improving industrial pollution control, realizing savings at the plant level, increasing environmental awareness, and supporting preliminary efforts in legal and policy reforms) and most project components are cost-effective.  Nevertheless, maximum program impact is handicapped because of almost no follow-up and inadequate information and communication about the program activities. This evaluation recommends that A.I.D. continue to support project elements (particularly plant assessments and environmental audit workshops), but make a number of documentation, strategic, and procedural changes to improve project management and results. Today, WEC and this cooperative agreement are part of a broader context of changing attitudes regarding environmental issues and rapidly evolving economic, political, and social situations. Except for environmental improvements anticipated from production slowdowns and plant closings, industrial environmental problems are unlikely to significantly improve until investment is forthcoming.  Such investment will not occur until laws are clear and regularized, plant-specific environmental liabilities are known, and regulations regarding liability are finally worked out.  Through its plant assessments, training workshops, and legal and policy reform activities, WEC is making a valuable contribution to privatization and environmental improvement.

"Mid-term evaluation of a project to strengthen developing country programs to control vector-borne diseases.  Evaluation covers the period 1990-5/92. USAID Missions and Bureaus generally have a positive impression of the project, which they view as a quick and reliable source of TA in the specialized area of vector control.  However, the Office of Health (R&D/H) has a broader vision of the project, having focused its design on assessment and control of vector-borne diseases, and requiring that the project possess expertise in a number of aspects not included in its predecessor. The project has been more successful in responding to requests for TA than in initiating innovative approaches to the control of vector-borne diseases.  Some success in the latter can be identified in places like Bolivia, where the project has assisted in a successful Chagas' Disease control effort.  However, problems have been encountered in recruiting and integrating personnel who can support R&D/H's broader vision.  As a result, the project functions much as its predecessor did, maintaining many of the original staff.  The key decisionmakers in MSCI (Medical Services Corporation International, the primary contractor) and the project reinforce the vector control perspective.  Those familiar with the project over several years describe the difficulty of reorienting the project towards disease control and related health and community participation issues; for example, the search for the Institution/Human Resource Development (I/HRD) specialist lasted over a year and the position has yet to integrated into the project in any meaningful way. The narrow technical vector-control orientation has been reinforced by recruitment of consultants who are often colleagues of senior project staff.  While competent in their areas of expertise, they are typically old school specialists who may be less familiar or comfortable with the broader perspective that is called for in a disease control approach. The lack of a strategic plan for allocating project resources (core funds) is a concern.  Resources have been spread too thinly among 27 countries and 9 diseases.  Almost half of the field work has been in Latin America, the continent where morbidity and mortality rates are least affected by vector-borne diseases.  The project's success in the region can be attributed to the personal energy and vast network of the project's deputy director, who is to be commended.  However, the lack of any concerted effort in Africa, especially toward malaria, is a concern. Even given the difficulty of programming in Africa, the allocation of project resources might have been different if priorities had been established within a strategic plan.  What, for example, was the rationale for spending more core funds on Guinea worm than on malaria in Africa and why was $80,000 in core funds spent on malaria in Swaziland, a small country with little malaria? Moreover, the project has missed a number of opportunities to market broad, innovative activities.  As a result, it has generated a relatively limited number of buy-ins, approximately $0.25 worth for every dollar of core funds expended. Project management, especially the lack of participation by project staff in the decisionmaking process, is another issue. Although staff meetings are held on a regular basis, decisions are made by the high-level corporate and project managers with virtually no input from responsible staff members who have expertise and experience to contribute.  This has led to a turnover in critical staff, especially those tasked with bringing the broader perspective into the project. They did not feel that their ideas were being taken into consideration in the hierarchical decisionmaking process.

"PACR of a project (8/84-12/91) to improve the institutional capacity of the Sri Lanka's National Water Supply and Drainage Board (NWSDB) and its delivery of health education and rural sanitation services. Early progress was hindered by an implementation approach that subjected NWSDB staff to radical organizational, attitudinal, and behavioral changes at a rate quicker than they were prepared to accept. In the beginning of 1986, several senior members of the NWSDB and the TA team were replaced and the project's approach was revised.  While the new approach was slower and more incremental in nature, initial delays had already caused many of the project's activities to slip more than a year behind schedule.  Thus the project was granted a 1-year extension to 8/91.  A second extension, to 12/91, was made to accommodate NWSDB's purchase of a diesel generator. The project completed most of the planned organizational changes, trained staff, developed policies and procedures, and met objectives regarding NWSDB decentralization.  However, due to civil turmoil in 1988-89, the construction of physical facilities, particularly regional offices, workshops, and laboratories, was delayed, and in some cases, terminated.  Only 6 of 23 planned buildings were completed satisfactorily (3 more are scheduled for completion using NWSDB's own resources). Similarly, only 4 of 6 planned water supply subprojects were implemented.  Fortunately, the problems with facilities construction did not affect decentralization, as other arrangements were made. Community participation promotion, health education, and latrine construction were accomplished in the 4 subproject areas.  The project developed training curricula, constructed 5,400 adult latrines and 1,300 pre-school latrines, and trained some 370 volunteer village health workers in health education activities. The following were among the lessons learned.  (1) A prescriptive design must be avoided at all costs in institution-building projects of this nature, since it places unnecessary burdens on both the institution and the TA contractor.  (2) The key to successful institution-building effort in an engineering organization such as NWSDB is the selection of a TA consultant with a balanced mix of technical and organizational specialists. (3) Institution-building projects could benefit from the help of politically influential individuals.  (4) All change strategies, new procedures, and other project interventions must be owned by the counterparts.  From ownership comes acceptance and commitment, which in turn leads to sustainability.  (5) Performance indicators must be developed, and they must be relevant and achievable.  Performance review meetings must be held regularly and attended by top management.  (6) The regular external monitoring carried out be the WASH project was highly successful in refocusing priorities, and was accepted by the both the contractor and NWSDB.  The process included formal interviews and collaborative workshops attended by the TA team and chief NWSDB staff. (7) There should have been a more flexible approach to solving problems faced by contractors.  Although the standard host country construction contract included a clause to cover price escalation, this was ordered deleted by USAID/SL.  Then, implementation delays and subsequent inflation rendered contractors unable to meet costs, resulting in delays or default. Also, payment of contractors often took up to 6 months because four levels of approval were required (local firm, NWSDB regional office, NWSDB central office, and USAID).  (8) The strong support of Sri Lankan and USAID officials at all levels was a key factor in the project's success.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","5/1/1992 12:00:00 AM","","Water supply structures|Sanitation|Water supply engineering|Institution building|Beneficiary count","Sri Lanka","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABH189.pdf","2,970 KB","008606 - USAID.

"Evaluates Phase I (1/91-9/92) of a Vitamin A social marketing project in Niger in 16 villages in the Birni N'Konni district of Tahoua Department.  The project is carried out by the Ministry of Health and Helen Keller International, with TA from the USAID/W Nutrition Communication Project.  The region was selected because of the availability of water and the existence of dry-season vegetable cultivation. Phase I was a pilot intervention which tested six message concepts, which were communicated to pregnant and nursing women and their husbands to increase consumption of particular Vitamin A rich foods; to gardeners to encourage cultivation of traditional dark green leafy vegetables; and to community leaders, to motivate them to support the project.  The messages were communicated by Village Animation Committees, primarily through community-based events, such as skits, and other traditional media.  Local health workers, teachers, and agricultural agents provided technical support to the committees and carried out specific communication activities. Results of interviews and questionnaires in 12/92 indicated that consumption of vitamin A-rich foods increased:  90% of adults eat green leaves more frequently and 87% eat liver more frequently; the percentage of women who had eaten liver in the past week rose from 51% to 69%. Exposure to nutrition messages was high, particularly among men.  (Women are more cloistered.)  Theater was popular, and perceived by villagers as a good source of information; 61% of men and 34% of women saw at least one play. Many who saw plays took steps to improve their own and their children's nutritional status, although messages about children's nutritional needs seem to have been less emphasized in the storylines. Village-sponsored activities continued without outside support after the project ended. Lessons and recommendations are as follows.  (1) Messages about child nutrition should be intensified, as behavior change was lower in this group.  Close to half the children under age 6 either don't eat leafy vegetables or eat them less than once a week.  Some parents feel children under a year are not old enough to eat leaves.  (2) One Village Animation Committee per village should be created; members should be chosen by villagers according to willingness, motivation, talent, and stability, and should include women and be recruited outside of the growing season.  (3) The committees should address a number of nutrition themes beyond vitamin A, and all of their skits should be compiled as material for radio dramas and other program.  (4) Gifts could be budgeted for the committees as the idea of volunteering is not well understood, and the general poverty makes it difficult for people to participate without remuneration.  There is a perception on the part of health workers and extension agents that the ""foreign"" money is kept by those in Niamey, and a perception among the committee members that the technical field agents keep the money.  More contact between Niamey and the villages might stem these rumors.  (5) Traditional, religious, and opinion leaders should have a more active role.  (6) Local artists should be used to create visual aids to ensure they are culturally appropriate.  (7) Extension workers and other field personnel should live in the villages they are advising.  (8) Delays in wiring funds from the U.S. to Niger must be shortened.

"PACR on a project (8/87-12/91) to foster private enterprise development in El Salvador.  The project was implemented by the Salvadoran Foundation for Economic and Social Development (FUSADES) and contained two components:  the Program to Strengthen Local Business Associations (FORTAS), and activities of FUSADES' Department of Social and Economic Studies (DEES). FORTAS was terminated 1/91 after it was determined that it had successfully attained its objectives.  Under the program, 36 business associations were strengthened; 6,000 association managers and members received training in areas such as communications, marketing, and information systems; and 177 business leaders were trained in association management and communications.  Additionally, FORTAS promoted the principles of free enterprise through a national publicity campaign that reached 1.8 million people nationwide; programs for students, employees, reporters, and journalists; and support for the introduction of market economy subjects into the curricula of selected private universities.  As a result of FORTAS' efforts, 25 private associations have sponsored 139 infrastructure projects in 65 low-income areas in San Salvador, including construction of fences, walls, cisterns, and sewage canals; street lighting; and improvements in community halls. DEES is now considered the best economic think tank in the region. DEES has carried out more than 70 studies in macroeconomics, microeconomics, and social issues, and has succeeded in developing its own research capacity.  DEES' economic policy recommendations have been disseminated through bulletins, reports, seminars, conferences, and educational projects, such as a course on social evaluation of projects at the Catholic University of Chile, and numerous audiovisual presentations.  USAID is currently funding DEES under project 5190287.01 and will do so until that project's 9/94 PACD. The following lessons were learned.  (1) FORTAS has contributed significantly to solving the basic needs of the country's neediest population, successfully promoting both free enterprises and private sector participation in social programs.  However, while the private sector has been generous, its economic resources are limited; future projects should include feasible investment plans to guarantee the most efficient utilization of resources.  FORTAS and FUSADES have also gained valuable experience in coordinating different public and private entities to implement short-term projects and provide community leadership.  (2) DEES has grown into a center for applied research; however, its initial stage of contracting outside research consultants was very useful to the local staff, who took advantage of all the knowledge transmitted by the consultants. The dissemination of the principles of free market economy has been a very beneficial, but slow and constant process, and will be a permanent activity for DEES.  DEES' collaboration with the Government's economic policy team has paid off; several DEES staff have assumed important ministerial positions, facilitating dialogue between DEES and political leaders.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","519-0336-A-00-7589-00","","6/1/1992 12:00:00 AM","","Private enterprises|Business associations|Economic research|Beneficiary count","El Salvador","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABH852.pdf","2,266 KB","008540 - USAID.

"PACR of a project component (4/85-3/89) to provide displaced families in El Salvador with employment in community infrastructure projects. The Federacion de Cajas de Credito Rural de El Salvador (FEDECCREDITO) implemented the project. The project met or exceeded all but one of its planned targets. The targeted 10 service agencies are in operation and have provided employment to 14,000 displaced persons/month (vs. a target of 10,000-12,000) in infrastructure projects to improve health conditions (e.g., water and sanitation), community services (e.g., roads, streets), education (schools), and business opportunities (workshops). Environmental improvements were made in the targeted 69 refugee camps, 4,846 employment projects were completed (vs. 3,800 planned), 62 work projects were implemented for returnees (vs. 50 planned), and 116 vocational skills training courses were completed (vs. 95 planned).  On the negative side, only 1,897 displaced persons completed the training courses, vs. a target of 2,349. The following lessons were learned.  (1) Basic infrastructure projects implemented in municipalities and communities receiving displaced persons generated immediate employment in the 10 target departments (Chalatenango, Cuscatlan, Cabanas, San Vicente, Usulutan, San Miguel, Morazan, La Libertad, La Union, and La Paz).  Further, even though approximately 95% of these individuals had prior work experience in agriculture only, they were able, under supervision, to provide effective labor on a variety of construction activities.  (2) In El Salvador, infrastructure projects such as enlargement and construction of roads, introduction of potable water, retention walls, etc., are traditionally carried out by men only.  Under this project, however, women were given significant employment opportunities, resulting in 20% of the labor being provided by women.  (3) To attract an even greater number of women into the labor force, the project should include a specific component to promote female employment among the commercial and productive sectors.  (4) The participation of Fiscal Agent auditors provided the project better control over financial management and on-the-job financial management training for accounting staff.  (5) Assigning implementation responsibilities to local groups, such as the Cajas de Credito's Board of Directors, expedited implementation and more accurately identified the needs of the beneficiary communities.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","12/1/1992 12:00:00 AM","","Refugee relief|Employment|Construction workers|Labor intensive technology","El Salvador","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABH853.pdf","253 KB","008540 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (8/87-3/90) to stimulate discussion of public policy and development issues in El Salvador by helping the Center for Technological and Scientific Studies (CENITEC) expand its public education and outreach activities. The project met its targets.  It included a seminar program and weekly ""charlas,"" or informal meetings; organization of a research unit, which with very limited professional resources conducted studies of contemporary issues; and publication of Presencia, a quarterly journal, which disseminated results of the studies and seminars.  Policy TA provided to senior government officials was less successful and was suspended by mutual agreement in January 1989. CENITEC's success in this project shows that it is possible in El Salvador for a politically affiliated institution to develop a reputation for objective, impartial outreach activities.  A key lesson is that institutions that are to be evaluated by external evaluators should first carry out an internal evaluation following the format to be used by the external evaluators.  This would force the institution to perform a self-assessment, and would provide useful data for the external evaluation. A follow-on grant to CENITEC (project 5190375) was signed in 3/90.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","519-0334-A-00-7253-00","","11/1/1992 12:00:00 AM","","Information centers|Policy analysis|Policy dialogue|Information dissemination|Public awareness|Seminars","El Salvador","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABH854.pdf","155 KB","008540 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (6/88-7/91) to improve the ability of the Central American Research Institute for Industry (ICAITI) to provide technical services to export-oriented industries in Central America. By helping ICAITI develop several new systems and strengthen existing ones, the project has developed ICAITI as a center of excellence. ICAITI now has firm leadership, an improved organizational structure, improved methods of resource allocation, and a solid menu of services. ICAITI has become a more aggressive institution with the administrative and technical capabilities to achieve self-sufficiency.  Financial sustainability, however, will take time to achieve. Specific project achievements include:  (1) preparation of a 5-year institutional plan and of a market assessment; (2) development of important linkages with U.S. and Canadian institutions, ensuring that ICAITI's technological know-how is up-to-date and that Central American industry has access to high-level technical backstopping; (3) establishment of a Private Sector Advisory Committee, the existence of which ensures that ICAITI's programs address industry's most pressing needs, and which strengthens in particular the Total Quality Management Program which ICAITI operates in each Central American country; and (4) improvement of administrative and financial systems, which has led to important cost-cutting actions.  Project training included courses for all ICAITI staff to reinforce the administrative, organizational, and technical changes occurring under the project, and establishment of a permanent career development program, designed to motivate employees to obtain the training they need for advancement. The following lessons were learned.  (1) Institutional improvements require a strong internal authority structure; ICAITI went through a period of uncertainty and infighting because it lacked a confirmed director.  Once the Director was confirmed, the project gained momentum and institutional improvements began to occur.  (2) Long-established habits in a quasi-governmental institution are difficult to change. Success in this area requires a clear understanding of project objectives and the complete participation of all the organization's personnel.  (3) The project faced some problems because it employed weak indicators of project success. Institution-building projects should employ indicators that inspire human drive, competition, and collaboration in achieving project objectives.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","2/1/1992 12:00:00 AM","","Regional development|Industrial development|Research centers|Industrial research|Institution building","Central America","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABH856.pdf","173 KB","002290 - USAID.

"Mid-term evaluation of a program to encourage fertilizer marketing reforms in Kenya.  Evaluation covers the period 1986-12/91. The program has succeeded in achieving its purpose.  Importers and distributors now use pricing policies which reflect the cost of fertilizer to them, including a profit margin which is driven primarily by competitive forces.  There is a wider retail distribution network in place:  retailers are earning higher margins, which has provided an incentive for them to set up in new areas and in competition with existing retailers.  In addition, fertilizer traders are beginning to develop new sources of competitive advantage in strategic activities such as marketing, sales, and service activities. This stronger market network has increased the potential for increased smallholder fertilizer use.  The terms of reference for this evaluation study did not require direct estimation of the actual changes in smallholder fertilizer use.  However, over the duration of the program, total fertilizer consumption in Kenya fell from 272,000 tons in 1988/89 to 228,000 tons in 1990/91, a decline of 16%.  It is likely that fertilizer use by smallholders over the period would have declined by more than 16%.  The decline can be explained mainly by factors other than lack of fertilizer availability.  These factors include low official producer prices for scheduled crops and delays in payments to farmers, low international prices for tea and coffee exports, and a general lack of seasonal credit for smallholders. However, there are still a few areas of concern related to the development of the fertilizer marketing network.  These include continued and increasing reliance on donor imports in preference to direct commercial imports, and general lack of investment in physical distribution capacity by importers and distributors. The major covenants specified in the program have been complied with in all material respects.  USAID appears to have complied in most respects with planned implementation procedures.  However, some of tasks and activities outlined in the monitoring and evaluation plan have not yet been fully accomplished. The following recommendations are made.  (1) The program should be continued, albeit with modifications to reflect new policy reform objectives.  (2) The Farm Inputs Branch should be strengthened through further training and the provision of office and logistical support, tasks which could be coordinated with the World Bank's program.  (3) The program should extend and intensify fertilizer use promotion through literature distribution and by increasing the supply of aid fertilizer in smaller packages. (4) The Kenya National Fertilizer Association (KNFA) should establish an independent secretariat that will represent importers and distributors.  (5) The program should monitor and evaluate the impact of fertilizer policy changes on fertilizer imports, use, and agriculture in Kenya.

"PACR of a project (4/81-9/91) to expand family planning (FP) information and services through in Ecuador's public and private sectors. The project was a great success, exceeding its targets, and generated a follow-on (5180054), which is currently being implemented.  Specific achievements included:  a decrease in the crude birth rate to 29% (vs. a target of 35%) and an increase in the contraceptive prevalence rate to 54% (vs.48%); expansion of Association for the Welfare of the Ecuadorian Family (APROFE) clinics to 18 (vs. a target of 13) and of Medical Center for Family Planning and Orientation (CEMOPLAF) clinics to 20 (vs. a target of 6 clinics and 3 laboratories); and increase in APROFE and CEMOPLAF users to around 420,000 (vs. 351,000); an increase in FP outlets of the Campesino Social Security Program (SSC) to 547 (vs. 530); an increase in contraceptive distributors to 1,292 (vs. 1,240); and an increase in private doctors and midwives providing FP services to 74 (vs. 80).  The Catholic Church participated in the project through grants to the Archbishopric of Cuenca and the Vicariate of Esmeraldas for projects in natural FP; and the Government of Ecuador published a population policy in October 1987, but unfortunately it has not been implemented. The Contraceptive Social Marketing Program created through Fundacion Futura, a local PVO, in conjunction with two private pharmaceutical firms, had two components:  IEC and distribution. (1) Under the IEC component, a mass media campaign led by Fundacion Futura and the Center for the Promotion of Responsible Parenthood (CEPAR) promotes general FP on TV, specific methods on radio, and Protektor condoms on both.  CEPAR, APROFE, and CEMOPLAF also produce FP publications, and CEPAR has prepared an average of 9 research studies a year, vs. a target of 12. In December 1990, the IEC Coordinating Committee, representing APROFE, CEMOPLAF, CEPAR, the Ecuadorian Social Security Institute (IESS), and Fundacion Futura, was officially established.  (The Ministry of Health is not formally represented on the committee, but is invited to its meetings).  Committee members have had the opportunity to work and study together, support each other, and preclude duplication of efforts by sharing experiences.  (2) Results of the distribution component were mixed.  Almost 2.5 million orals were distributed between 1988 and 1991, vs. a target of 680,000, but distribution of condoms did not begin until June 1991 and has totaled only about 10% of the annual target of 1 million. More generally, the project has changed an environment that was once indifferent or hostile to FP to one in which the discussion of FP is common.  It has also enabled FP PVOs to gained prestige at the national and international levels. This 10-year project is part of A.I.D.'s 25 years of FP service provision which has reduced Ecuador's rate of population growth from 3.2% to 2.6% and the total fertility rate from 6.9% to 4.3%, and has increased the country's contraceptive prevalence rate from 13% to 54%. With the culmination of this project, it can be said that FP as a concept is fully established in Ecuador, making it highly improbable that serious regressions will occur.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","7/1/1992 12:00:00 AM","","Family planning promotion programs|Family planning services|Family planning education","Ecuador","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABI520.pdf","132 KB","008538 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (8/86-9/91) to help India expand and upgrade its immunization and oral rehydration therapy (ORT)services. The project has been a success.  The Universal Immunization Program (UIP), now one of the largest preventive health interventions in the world, has increased immunization coverage to 80% in all states; 98% of infants were immunized with DPT3 and Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV3), 97% with tuberculosis and 89% with measles vaccine, and 78% of pregnant women were immunized with tetanus toxoid.  USAID's support of the UIP was channeled through UNICEF. Under the Government of India's (GOI) National Diarrheal Diseases Management Program, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MOHFW) established an organizational unit and ORT surveillance centers, developed a new reporting format, and undertook a social marketing campaign.  As a result of the program, almost half of rural and urban Indian households have knowledge of ORT, and there has been a 25% reduction in child death due to diarrheal disease. In addition, the project completed 19 small, innovative activities, studies, and seminars; it appears that about 25% of these will be continued by the GOI, State governments, or private agencies. Activities included production and distribution to state and district government offices of videotapes on maternal/child health (MCH). Both the UIP and ORT programs were strengthened through training, including U.S. training in MCH, financial management, and health administration for 34 central and state government officers; a basic epidemiology program at a local Indian institution for 15 District Immunization Officers; and the production of training films for health workers by the MOHFW. The following lessons were learned.  (1) Previously, most health programs were defined at the Central and State levels.  In this project, however, district-level planning and implementation strategies were an integral part of the UIP, which made the program more relevant to the district infrastructure, increasing the likelihood of sustainability. (2) The project included a very successful performance-based disbursement system, the first such attempt in USAID/I's Health, Population and Nutrition (HPN) portfolio.  The performance-based system, which evaluates outputs rather than the line item value of inputs, allowed USAID/I and the GOI more flexibility in achieving objectives (e.g., the system can estimate the incremental return on policy changes and other inputs to which it is difficult to assign a value, thereby validating their pursuit).  (3) This project was also the first in the HPN portfolio to obtain ""extra budgetary status"" for a component; with no activity in the first four years, the ""extra budgetary status"" allowed the innovative activities component to flourish; almost 19 activities were completed in just over 6 months.  By bypassing the GOI's budgetary process, there was a reduction in the pipeline, and disbursement of funds was accelerated.  (4) The UIP and ORT programs are still implemented in a vertical manner. This lack of integration not only wastes resources, it also leads to a focus on means, rather than objectives.  Therefore, integration is probably preferable in terms of efficiency and impact.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1992 12:00:00 AM","","Child health care|Child survival activities|Immunizations|Oral rehydration therapy","India","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABI561.pdf","190 KB","008557 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (4/84-8/92) to improve the physical infrastructure and management of minor irrigation schemes (MISs) in Maharashtra State, India. The project was a great success, primarily because it used an innovative approach to irrigation management consisting of (1) a performance-based disbursement system, which disbursed funds only as the Government met specific performance benchmarks, (2) performance testing of the distribution system.  The Government of Maharashtra (GOM)/Irrigation Department (ID) is considering institutionalizing this methodology. The project has completed construction of 84 MISs (with 6 more underway), a number of which reached 100% of planned irrigable land in their first season.  Other accomplishments include: establishment of 52 hydrometeorological stations; computerization of data from rain gauge and river gauge stations and other sources, for use in crop planning and water scheduling; a number of studies, analyses, and pilot activities, findings of which were incorporated into MIS design and management planning; establishment of a few demonstration chaks (areas served by a single canal), in which farmers learned about new crop varieties, such as sunflowers, and cultural practices. The organizational improvements, special studies, pilot activities, and training programs introduced under the project played a major role in improving the capabilities of the ID and of the Agriculture Department (AD), although the latter was never involved to the extent planned.  Three new ID departments were formed, one was reorganized, and all are working effectively. The establishment of farmers' groups to participate in operation and management of MISs was a key element, the success of which is due to such factors as early involvement of farmers in the planning process, training of ID engineers who motivated farmer participation, and the MIS performance testing which gave farmers confidence in the system. The following lessons were learned.  (1) The PBD system may be the most effective means of managing MISs.  (2) Land acquisition difficulties delayed the achievement of benchmarks on 6 MISs. The likelihood of such complications should be considered during project design.  (3) Early farmer involvement in MIS planning, completion, and performance testing facilitates the formation of well-functioning farmer organizations.  In addition, ID staff, with minimal training, have the interest and capacity to work with the farm community.  These factors augur well for sustainable development of MISs.  (4) Initially, the AD provided the project with very little support; separate funding and performance requirements should be set for the irrigation sector and the agricultural sector.  (5) The ID has the capacity to computerize its functions; however, this requires an acceptance of technology, private sector training and maintenance support, and sufficient time to set up a management information system. (6) Fixed Amount Reimbursement (FAR) was incorporated into the PBD mechanism, requiring that cost overruns be borne by the implementing agency.  Due to inflation, completion costs for some approved MISs exceeded estimates, straining GOM's budget. Where the FAR is used, safeguards should be established in the budget to cover inflationary pressures.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1992 12:00:00 AM","","Irrigation system construction|Agricultural water management|Institution building|Farmer participation","India","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABI562.pdf","703 KB","008557 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (7/84-9/92) to upgrade irrigated land and water management and expand the area under irrigation in hill areas of the Indian State of Himachal Pradesh (HP). The project was overly ambitious given its time frame, the climate of the hill areas, and the limited experience and capacity of the implementing Government of Himachal Pradesh (GOHP) departments; in fact, implementation of some components only effectively began in 1990. Nevertheless, the project produced an integrated program of irrigation system development, institutional development, extension, and training which provides a basis for transforming HP into a state with an irrigated agricultural economy. Physical accomplishments were particularly impressive; 878 minor irrigation schemes (MISs) were constructed or improved, and the area under irrigation was expanded by over 26,000 ha--a remarkable achievement considering only 60,000 ha had been irrigated between 1948 and 1985.  A shift from monocropping to mixed cropping of high-value crops was observed in project areas. In addition, the project prompted the GOHP and local communities to test cost-saving technologies such as sprinkler and trickle irrigation.  Significant progress was also made in afforestation and soil stabilization, which were carried out on 269 schemes. Farmers report that soil conservation works have helped in maintaining a regular water supply and reducing silt flow into storage structures.  The environmental impacts of afforestation will not be evident for some time, but it is reasonable to predict reduced sedimentation, a more regular water supply, and protection of scheme components; in addition, the plantation system provides a source of fodder, fuelwood, and small timber. Institution building, especially of the GOHP's capacity to manage activities in the irrigation sector, was more problematic; however, efforts were relatively successful given the magnitude of the challenge and the prospects for sustainability are good. The project successfully increased farmer participation through the development of farmer's organizations; 287 micro-irrigation schemes have been handed over to farmers for day to day maintenance, and the GOHP has agreed, at least in principle, to turn over all scheme to farmers, except for lift schemes. The GOHP has also drafted a new water law and overall water policy, which are ready for consideration by the legislature.  Finally, the project conducted extensive training:  over 1,700 GOHP officers participated in more than 100 in-country irrigation courses, and 25 in U.S. courses; and more than 29,000 farmers were trained in irrigation skills, management techniques, record keeping, etc. Lessons learned included the following.  (1) Preoccupation with construction overshadowed and delayed implementation of other vital project components.  Projects such as this should incorporate controls on counterparts' inclination to focus on construction.  (2) Because development of farmer organizations lagged far behind irrigation scheme construction, there was no alternative but to adopt a post-construction participatory approach to farmer organizations.  Farmers should have been involved in planning and decision making at the early stages, as in other USAID irrigation projects.  (3) Frequent changes in the position of chief engineer -- 6 over 8 years -- impaired continuity in project planning and monitoring; in addition, the position was not invested with enough authority.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1992 12:00:00 AM","","Irrigated farming|Agricultural water management|Hill soils|Water supply engineering|Irrigation system construction|Institution building|Farmer participation","India","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABI563.pdf","380 KB","008557 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (9/82-6/92) to provide managerial and technical training to public sector, and where appropriate private sector, personnel to strengthen India's capabilities to plan and implement development projects. The project was a resounding success.  As it evolved, it grew steadily grew in size and scope, particularly after a highly favorable mid-term evaluation when it was expanded beyond its original priority areas (agriculture, irrigation, health, women in development, child welfare, environment, energy, and social welfare) to include four major additional areas -- informatics for health, scientist exchanges, housing and urban development, and special projects.  This last component, special projects, provided a vehicle for increased private sector involvement, through which the project funded activities to strengthen the capacity of selected training institutions.  These special sub-projects included collaborative research under the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research of India and the National Science Foundation of the USA Exchange program; the Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval (MEDLARS) project; and training and TA in the area of Housing and Urban Affairs. Ultimately, the project far exceeded its original training goals: about 9,150 people were trained through in-country programs, and about 500 middle- and senior-level personnel, most of whom were from the public sector, in the U.S, versus original goals of 1200 and 100, respectively.  In addition, the project offered collaborative project development opportunities to 25 U.S. and 25 Indian scientists in both India and the U.S. through the scientist exchange program.  The result is a base of trained personnel in both the public and private sectors in such diverse fields such as power generation, agriculture, water resources, health, environment, human welfare, telecommunications, women in development, and bioinformatics which will undoubtedly contribute significantly to India's development. The key lesson learned concerns the mode and content of training. According to the report, training yielded substantive benefits to both participating institutions and individuals when it was focused, i.e., related to a specific technical area.  However, the benefits of the short-term U.S. training for middle and senior government officials, which addressed diverse areas including taxation, accounting/budgeting, public enterprise management, project analysis and implementation, and export marketing strategies, were less clear; even though these programs clearly benefited the participants, their impact in terms of wider dissemination of ideas or the application of skills in the local context was not evident.  USAID/India decided not to fund short-term U.S. training in the future unless it focused on a few specific areas.  The Technical Assistance and Support Project (TASP) has been amended to include short-term U.S training in support of economic and financial reforms, but in specific areas such as the financial sector, privatization, and exports/trade.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1992 12:00:00 AM","","Education for development|Management training|Technical training|Private sector|Public sector|Personnel development","India","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABI564.pdf","215 KB","008557 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (7/83-9/92) to improve India's irrigation sector management. The project was a great success, and by its end had become a ""flagship"" program with high visibility and impact and national stature. It had been expanded from 5 to 11 states containing 75% of India's population and 85% of its surface and underground water supply and played a major role in developing India's first national water policy. It has been cited as having the potential to produce a legacy to U.S.-India relations similar to that achieved by U.S. contributions to India's agricultural universities. Key achievements were as follows.  Over 1,000 professionals received specialized U.S. training, and over 12,000 field-level professionals and farmers received in-country training. Indigenous training capacities were greatly strengthened, as is evident in the fact that 10 technical training and training of trainers programs initially conducted by U.S. universities were transferred to India.  Training programs related to integrated river basin planning and design, and the development of interactive video disc technology were also institutionalized under the project, and, perhaps most importantly, 11 Water and Land Management Institutes (WALMIs -- State training institutes) were established. Both the WALMIs and independent institutes, either directly or through PVOs, interfaced with the small-scale farming sector in action research that focused on solving water application and production problems.  Among the project's many accomplishments in this area were its collaborative work with the Mohini Cooperative Waters User's Society, and its work through the Bhartiya Agro-Industries Federation, which by itself has extended project benefits to thousands of farmers in the states of Gujurat and Maharashtra. Other major achievements included:  promotion of participatory collaboration in resolving conflicts over water allocation (which were quite frequent at project initiation); formation of operational linkages among participating ministries, departments, and universities; increased public sector support for private sector engagement in the irrigation sector, as exemplified by the Center for Water Research and Development and Management in Calicut, Kerala; and promotion of new external collaborations, including a joint program between the Central Ground Water Board and the U.S. Geological Survey. Project impacts are likely to be sustained, as many of the ideas promoted under the project have been included for funding in India's Eighth Five-year Plan.  Both the central and participating state governments have declared their intent to provide long-term financial support for the WALMIs and other activities initiated under the project, including providing attractive salaries to insure retention of professionals working at the WALMIs. Lessons learned included the following.  (1) Participatory training methodologies should have been adopted in addition to the traditional lecture-oriented methods; construction of training institutes should have focused on facilities for participatory training rather than just lecture halls.  (2) Action research, though eventually one of the project's most successful elements, was slow to be developed and replicated. Baseline studies and periodic assessments should have been built into the project design.  (3) The success of the project, despite its large scale and institutional complexity, is attributable in part to mid-course restructuring and simplification. Simplification becomes more important as the size and complexity of a project increases.  (4) Organizational and procedural changes might have been better addressed as a separate initial phase of the project, followed by implementation of project activities.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1992 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural water management|Irrigation","India","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABI565.pdf","663 KB","008557 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (7/83-6/92) to construct minor irrigation schemes (MISs) in Madhya Pradesh, India. Restructuring of the project after the mid-term evaluation resulted in construction of fewer irrigation systems, increased participation by farmers and State departments (especially the Departments of Agriculture and of Tribal Welfare and the Water and Land Management Institutes [WALMIs]), and several major policy and practice changes by the Government of Madhya Pradesh (GOMP) aimed at creating institutional capacity and replicating the project in non-project areas.  Of particular importance was the adoption, in June 1988, of a performance-based disbursement (PBD) mechanism, which improved implementation significantly: while only two MISs had been completed by 1990, by the PACD 20 MISs had been completed, with another 26 under construction.  The GOMP plans to have 15 of these completed by June 1993 and the other 11 by June 1994. The project's four pilot activities produced major technical improvements/innovations.  (1) The scheme at Khor introduced buried polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pressurized pipe technology (PPT) as an alternative to conventional surface channel network below the outlet; similar pipe systems are being extended to non-project MISs, including 10 planned for construction in 1992-93.  (2) The Gadigaltar subproject introduced, with farmer participation, a major innovation -- an ""on-demand"" flexible water supply system utilizing a level-top canal in addition to buried low pressure pipes.  (3) The Raipura scheme demonstrated the impact of land development on irrigation efficiency and agricultural productivity.  (4) The Ghorapachhar subproject served as an adaptive research site for the GOMP's Irrigation and Agriculture departments, and for the WALMI at Bhopal. Performance testing of the ability of the new irrigation systems to deliver an adequate and timely supply of water (a practice first introduced in the Maharashtra Minor Irrigation Project and required in the revised benchmarks for this project) was reassuring to farmers and resulted in their immediate subscription to the new systems.  Also, through use of a ""bottom down"" approach, the project realized (as did the Maharashtra and the Hill Areas Land and Water Development projects) the previously elusive goal of involving command area farmers in opting for construction of their respective systems.  Reliability of water supply, another long-standing problem, as achieved by basing reservoir capacity on the extent of demand given a variety of cropping patterns and dependable climatic data.  Also contributing to project success was the increased responsiveness of the GOMP to project innovations and the increased involvement of the private sector. Prospects for sustainability are good.  Institutional capacities have been upgraded at various levels in the GOMP; 53 officers were trained in the U.S. and 2,246 locally in water management and irrigation related issues.  The GOMP has implemented a policy shift away from administering water to managing water per farmers' needs and has developed a strategy for increasing farmer participation in decisionmaking and irrigation system operation and maintenance.  Finally, the GOMP Water Resources Department has adopted the irrigation system design criteria developed under the project for the entire Madhya Pradesh minor irrigation sector. Lessons learned included the following.  (1) The project demonstrates the value of interim redesign and revision.  At the time of initial design, it can be difficult to ascertain a project's complexities.  (2) Criteria for measuring performance should be quantified in a way that is appropriate and practical for the implementing agency.  (3) Targeting of underserved and remote traditional tribal areas, while commendable, had anthropological implications that project designers failed to consider sufficiently.  Specifically, the design did not call for sufficient involvement by social scientists and as a result farmer organizations were not as successful as they could have been.  (4) Delays were largely caused by lack of technological capacity in both the public and private sectors, as well as by problems in land acquisition and by changes in GOMP personnel, chronic to India's bureaucratic system.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1992 12:00:00 AM","","Irrigation system construction|Agricultural water management|Government departments|Institution building|Farmer participation","India","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABI566.pdf","208 KB","008557 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (9/83-1992) to help expand the Government of India's (GOI's) integrated child development services (ICDS) program, providing supplementary feeding, nutrition education, and health services to children under three and pregnant and nursing mothers at anganwadis (village child care centers) in Maharashtra's Chandrapur district and Gujarat's Panchmahals district. In spite of a slow start, the project was eventually successful in achieving its goals.  Against an initial target of 4,000 the ICDS program was expanded to nearly 4,500 anganwadis, which are fully functional with trained workers.  In the target districts, children's health and nutrition status has improved, infant and toddler mortality rates are lower, and mothers are receiving better pre- and postnatal care.  The anganwadis have been staffed with project-trained village health workers and supervision of anganwadis has been improved as has coordination with the health system.  Many of these benefits are likely to be sustainable. The nutrition and supplementary feeding component achieved most of its goals of reduced infant and child malnutrition and mortality. However, while the project was successful in reducing the incidence of moderate and severe malnutrition, so far there is no evidence that there has been any impact on long-term malnutrition.  Food distribution, which was the responsibility of the state governments, was satisfactory in both states; rations are now provided to all pregnant women rather than only to those in the third trimester, which along with the accompanying rise in health services in the anganwadis should lead to improved nutritional status and fewer low-weight births. The nutrition and health education component had to be redesigned when the expected GOI support failed to materialize.  While the component did eventually contribute to the project's success, it did not have as much impact as hoped; particularly disappointing was the use of mass media.  Fortunately, the lack of government counterpart support was partially made up for by the competence of health workers in using the project's printed educational materials. Training elements were outstanding, particularly the Mobile-In-Service Training (MIST) program, under which 19,000 ICDS and health functionaries were trained.  MIST training not only produced a cadre of trained workers to staff the anganwadis by training supervisors, who in turn trained front line-workers, it helped to ensure sustainability and replicability; further, by training health and ICDS workers together, MIST contributed to improved coordination in the field between ICDS functionaries (who report to social welfare agencies) and health care workers (who report to state and central ministries of health).  The MIST methodology is now being replicated in an additional district in each state with the enthusiastic support of the GOI.  In addition to MIST the project also supported a series of short-term training sessions abroad for senior ICDS management and training personnel, and workshops for mid-level ICDS personnel. Other than training, the management information system (MIS) developed under the monitoring and evaluation component was the project's most successful aspect.  The computerized MIS became a key element of the ICDS, and the GOI has agreed to a countrywide expansion. The research conducted under the project on low birth weight (LBW) produced substantial data, much of which has yet to be analyzed; one study suggested that dietary supplements for mothers can increase birthweights by almost a quarter kilogram on average.  The GOI has expressed an interest in exploiting the data from the LBW research in planning for the future of the nationwide ICDS program, and has requested TA in doing so, as well as in analyzing the data produced by the series of impact evaluation surveys. Finally at the policy level, the project by prompting the GOI to expand its use of the private and NGO sectors in the ICDS program has demonstrated the important role the private sector can play in health programs. Lessons learned include the following.  (1) The improvement in health services was an important factor in the achievement of nutritional goals, demonstrating the value of a multi-purpose village-based institution such as the anganwadis for delivering health and nutrition services.  (2) Mass media techniques -- e.g., radio, videos --  need to be carefully adapted to their target audience; for example, while the project's traveling ""video vans"" drew large receptive audiences in the rural villages, the villagers sometimes found the films shown, which portrayed urban characters and situations, to be offensive or irrelevant.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1992 12:00:00 AM","","Primary health care|Child health care|Maternal child health care|Food for Peace Title II|Health outreach services|Villages","India","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABI567.pdf","387 KB","008557 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (6/82-6/92) to support collaborative U.S. Indian subprojects (SPs) in the field of alternative energy development. The project was extremely successful, providing the Government of India (GOI) with technologies and increasing awareness of the country's energy problems and of possible solutions to them.  It increased the research capacity of participating Indian institutions and facilitated the formation of excellent working relationships between U.S. and Indian institutions. The biomass production component provided TA, training, and equipment to two research centers -- the National Botanical Research Institute (NBRI) and Madurai Kamraj University/Bharathidasan University (MKU/BU). Two research SPs were completed:  the Production of Woody Biomass on Substandard Soil at NBRI and Development Studies of Woody Biomass Species on Arid Marginal Lands at MKU/BU.  In addition, a national workshop on nursery technology was held at Madurai. The coal and biomass conversion component completed 12 SPs aimed at improving the use of the low-quality coal which India has in abundance. These SP's resulted in the development of several energy technology testing facilities, including sophisticated facilities for evaluating the combustion and heat transfer in the freeboard region of a fluidized bed combustor, and for evaluating fuel performance in boilers; both are used extensively by Bharat Heavy Electricals, Ltd. (BHEL).  The SP also developed an extensive data base on coal conversion and pollution control, which will be useful to the U.S. private sector in selecting technologies and products for the Indian power sector.  One SP, the Advanced Diagnostic Studies for Prediction of Life Expectancy of Existing Power Plants, will promote the use of U.S. technology to extend the life of Indian power plants.  Workshops and U.S. study tours facilitated technical exchanges between U.S. and Indian scientists. The energy efficiency component held four in-country workshops that were attended by over 400 Indian participants and established links between Indian and U.S. manufacturers.  In addition, a U.S. tour for 20 senior Indian businesspeople promoted discussion of the potential for U.S./India trade in energy conservation technology, while another U.S. study tour for 11 Indian personnel led to the development of a widely circulated action plan to promote cogeneration in India.  Cogeneration is expected to be a major concern of the Mission's EMCAT project (3860517), which supported the project component under discussion. The information exchange component established mechanisms for the ongoing exchange of information, and sponsored attendance at U.S. conferences and seminars for 100 participants as well as in-country workshops to disseminate the findings of a study of cogeneration in India.  The component also supported 5 SPs, which resulted, inter alia, in the commercialization of polymer film collectors, which have the potential for significantly reducing installation costs; the introduction of Indian scientists to a new approach to solar technology; and development of a National Planning Model for Non-Conventional Energy.  Perhaps most importantly, the component developed a Solar Photovoltaic Test Facility, which has the potential to play a major role in the success of photovoltaics in India. The following lessons were learned.  (1) The Pittsburgh Energy Technology Center's (PETC) coal projects established strong linkages between the Indian and U.S. coal industries, which, with support from the U.S. Department of Energy, should lead to commercial joint ventures in clean coal technologies; the latter represents a key area of follow-on activity, as does power plant life assessment.  (2) The opportunity for U.S. joint ventures in the area of environmental monitoring is bright, though U.S. technology will first have to be adapted to Indian conditions. (3) For the first time in India, the power and coal mining sectors have been opened to the private sector; opportunities for U.S. companies in these sectors are growing constantly.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1992 12:00:00 AM","","Energy technology|Energy research|Alternative energy resources|Cogeneration","India|USA","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABI568.pdf","645 KB","008557 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (6/83-6/92) to strengthen India's agricultural research system. The project has promoted the development and transfer of agricultural technologies through collaborative research between Indian and U.S. scientists, and strengthened Indian agricultural research institutions. However, a concise assessment of the progress of the project's subprojects and pre-projects is difficult due to their wide range. Nine subprojects were completed.  Those with the most significant impact in terms of improved research infrastructure, technology transfer, and some commercial use of agricultural technologies include Post Harvest Technology and Soybean Processing and Utilization.  Others have improved researchers' capabilities and enhance scientific information output, including Intra-cellular Blood Protista, Embryo Transplant Technology, Conversion of Biodegradable Animal Wastes, Agrometeorology, and Agroforestry. Seven pre-projects did not reach full implementation, but nonetheless enhanced the capabilities of research institutions and resulted in priority research plans.  One of them, the Plant Genetic Resources pre-project, has evolved into a separate A.I.D.-funded project. Training included U.S. courses of various lengths for over 300 scientists, who, upon returning to India, often conducted similar but condensed courses for local scientists.  Over 100 U.S. consultants (115 person-months) provided Indian agricultural professionals with courses and seminars, demonstrated the use of modern research equipment, and served as mentors.  The project thus promoted collaborative research and linkages between Indian and U.S. agricultural professionals, resulting, inter alia, in the development of forestry faculties at 14 Indian universities. In addition, Indian researchers were provided with state-of-the-art laboratory and field equipment, ranging from relatively simple measuring devices to automated, computer-monitored weather stations and sophisticated analytical laboratory equipment.  The Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) developed 5 new research laboratories, remodeled one laboratory, and developed over 400 agricultural professional positions, including scientist, technician and support staff positions. The most obvious sign of the project's success may be that the GOI exceeded its funding commitment and included all project components in its 5-year plan beginning, which begins in 1992. The following lessons were learned.  (1) Recognizing a host country's priorities and integrating project activities into its infrastructure is one of the best ways to ensure sustainability. (2) Projects that require large amounts of procurement, training, and consultancy or management expertise should include a contractor-run management support services component.  (3) An umbrella project provides its subprojects flexibility and ensures them funding.  However, the subprojects require the same degree of scrutiny as stand-alone projects.  (4) Because activities were selected by both the GOI and A.I.D., implementation was smoother than it would have been without pre-planning.  (5) Intensive interaction between Indian and U.S. counterparts promotes a greater involvement in the training process, involvement which extends well beyond the training course itself.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1992 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural research|Scientific cooperation|Technology transfer|Agricultural technology|Scientists|Agricultural training|Institution building","India","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABI569.pdf","146 KB","008557 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (8/81-9/90) to reduce mortality and fertility among rural and urban poor in India by supporting joint efforts of USAID, the Government of India (GOI) and PVOs involved in health and population. The project was very successful, expanding and improving basic and special preventive health, family planning, and nutrition services for the poor by strengthening the private and voluntary sector.  It also fostered cooperation among the GOI, USAID, and PVOs by agreeing on the untapped potential of PVOs and by sharing program costs.  The program approved sub-grants to 30 PVOs, affecting 1.5 million individuals in underserved areas.  Beyond the quantity of projects, the quality of the services maintained high standards. The voluntary sub-grantees greatly strengthened their capabilities to manage health projects and to deliver a quality package of maternal/child health interventions, including immunization, oral rehydration therapy, health education, family planning, and prenatal care.  This was a result of training large numbers of workers, increasing the number of staff members at all levels and expanding operations to cover a significant number of people in underserved and isolated areas.  The project also assisted the PVOs in developing better financial systems and upgrading their project monitoring capabilities. Regarding the government sector, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MOHFW) and the National Institute of Health and Family Welfare (NIHFW) developed a much better understanding of PVOs and what they an accomplish in the health field, as well as a sensitivity and capability to work more effectively with them. The NIHFW played a critical role in the success of the project by assuring the technical quality of subprojects and providing appraisal, monitoring and evaluation.  The MOHFW's attitude has changed from one of having to tolerate the voluntary sector to one in which it considers a PVO the best mechanism to reach remote and resistant population pockets with family welfare and health services.  The enthusiasm with which the GOI/MOHFW is advocating collaboration with PVOs indicates that the shift is genuine and not superficial. The following lessons were learned.  (1) The GOI and PVOs can collaborate effectively, especially using an intermediary technical institution to monitor results and quality control. (2) Comprehensive sustainability planning needs to be incorporated into the initial project design with adequate TA at the project design and appraisal stage.  (3) While PVOs had sufficient technical competence in the health and family welfare areas, they could have been more effective if assistance had been provided in accounting procedures and managerial skills.  (4) Small grassroots organizations were unable to access grant funds because USAID grants are too large for them to absorb, yet they work in the most needy areas.  (5) PVOs are constrained from expanding their services by lack of trained grassroots level workers.  (6) Closer involvement between the PVOs and the local state governments should be fostered to change the states' perception that the project was out of their purview and control. (7) An effective way to influence GOI policy is to design and implement an activity with no overt suggestion of policy changes. Although this approach may require considerable time, once the GOI is convinced that the new methods can lead to success, it is often quick to change its policies. In India, USAID is the accepted leader in strengthening the PVO sector.  Efforts have been aimed at individual PVOs, while strengthening the sector as a whole has been neglected.  It is recommended that future projects focus on the national PVO sector to enhance its ability to function as an effective third alternative to the government and commercial sectors in the field of health services.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1992 12:00:00 AM","","Preventive health care|Family planning services|Human nutrition|Private voluntary organizations|Primary health care|Maternal child health care","India","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABI570.pdf","298 KB","008557 - USAID.

"Special evaluation of a project to establish a model decentralized approach to rural potable water operations and maintenance in Central Tunisia.  Evaluation covers the period 1986-91. The Rural Potable Water Institutions (RPWI) project in Kasserine and Gafsa governorates is considered a success by both the Government of Tunisia and the USAID.  Designed to address specific problems that had plagued earlier rural potable water programs in Central Tunisia, the project achieved its stated objectives and provides a model for future development interventions in Tunisia and elsewhere.  The problems addressed included water point selection based on political criteria rather than on the basis of need, waste of both energy and water, a high frequency of water system breakdowns, and a lack of health education programs to ensure hygienic use of potable water.  The RPWI project instituted an equity-based site selection methodology and reduced water system operation inefficiencies by promoting community participation through the creation of water user associations (WUAs).  These associations also became the focus of a variety of health education interventions.  The project visibly reveals the effectiveness of, and the need for, community participation and local management of local water resources. The project accomplishments demonstrate the central role that the social sciences should take in the design and implementation of rural development policy.  Coinciding in the 1980s with a major shift toward political decentralization and economic liberalization in the overall context of Tunisian development, the project was executed by Tunisian engineers, social scientists, and health education specialists, committed to its community-participation focus.  With some short-term expatriate assistance, these Tunisians made the RPWI project an impressive success, a development model that is rapidly being disseminated to other regions and development sectors throughout the country.

"Final evaluation of a project to implement a mass media program promoting safer sexual practices in conjunction with the Zaire National AIDS Program.  The evaluation covers the period 1988-91. The project's strategy has been to target youth between the ages of 12-19 and prospective parents between 20-30.  It draws on Zaire's rich traditions in music and drama to send messages that influence social norms and counter high-risk practices. Innovative media materials, based on audience research, have been used in television and radio spot announcements, dramas, music videos, talk shows, interviews, student notebooks, and comic-strip calendars. Even though the project was suspended in November 1991, when USAID withdrew funding due to Zaire's political and social instability, it succeeded in meeting its objectives.  The target population reflects an improved attitude and intended behavior related to safer sexual practices.  Research, including media post-tests and longitudinal KAP (knowledge, attitudes, and practice) studies, conducted over the length of the project, present evidence of:  (1) increased awareness regarding asymptomatic carriers; (2) increased acceptance and reported practice of abstinence and mutual fidelity for AIDS prevention; and (3) increased knowledge, acceptance, and reported use of condoms for AIDS prevention. It is significant that during the same period, annual sales of condoms, by the implementors of USAID's Condom Social Marketing Project, increased by more than 1,000%.  Family Health International's AIDSTECH program estimates that, as a result of increased condom sales, close to 7,200 cases of AIDS will be prevented in Zaire during 1991.  The intensity of the project's campaign and its use of traditional Zairian forms of communication to convey AIDS messages were key elements in its success. Ultimately, reducing the spread of HIV transmission requires each society to undertake the extremely gradual and complex process of examining and altering its customs as well as its social and economic structures.  Zaire's experience demonstrates that through systematic use of available mass media channels, and marketing and distribution of high-quality condoms sold at affordable prices, it is possible to motivate people to take positive actions to stem the spread of AIDS.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","660-0094-G-00-9042-00","","1/1/1992 12:00:00 AM","","Disease prevention and control|Communicable diseases|HIV/AIDS|Human sexual behavior|IEC|Mass media","Congo DR","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABJ872.pdf","432 KB","008309 - Population Services International (PSI)","","008626 - USAID.

"Evaluates the Trade and Investment Services (TIS) program, a pilot effort to identify and test new and inexpensive ways in which International Executive Service Corps (IESC) Volunteer Executives (VEs) could provide services to developing country entrepreneurs.  Mid-term evaluation covers the period 9/89-5/92. TIS has been a worthwhile experiment and has developed cost-effective approaches to delivering trade and investment services.  The key accomplishment is perhaps IESC's new Multiple Business Services program, whereby its network of VEs is utilized to provide many additional services needed by the private sector in USAID client countries.  To date, a total of $11.2 million has been expended on TIS efforts in 10 countries, including those in Eastern and Central Europe.  In two countries (Morocco and Sri Lanka), USAID funding covers almost 100% of TIS' operating costs, indicating that TIS ""seed"" projects have begun to take root and germinate.  However, better monitoring and reporting by IESC would enable USAID to assess the impacts of individual country experiments with greater precision. The programs in operation the longest have all generated results. According to IESC reports, Morocco, Guatemala, and Dominican Republic have generated nearly $20 million in exports, over 4,000 jobs, and more than 80 transactions (cooperative agreements, licensing arrangements, etc.).  However, the IESC reports assume that these effects were due solely to the TIS program; such a high level of attribution is possible only in Morocco, where TIS is separated from the traditional VE program. Adjusted figures would reduce TIS' overall impact to $12.2 million in exports and about 790 new jobs.  Even with these modest figures, however, the cost-effectiveness of the three programs is competitive with other successful promotion programs.  The other TIS programs examined by the evaluators are either too new to have produced results (Sri Lanka, Indonesia), or require a change in design (Turkey, Portugal). Several valuable lessons have been learned. on strong in-country management, proactive marketing, and clear objectives.  As far as possible, TIS must distinguish ""winners"" from ""losers"" and focus on healthy small and medium-sized firms that would not seek out partners on their own.  (2) TIS programs are resource-intensive.  TIS clientele (small and medium-sized firms) require significant assistance, and the program needs to be sufficiently funded if it is to provide the variety of services needed to make exports and investments happen -- the guaranteed presence of an in-country office, the provision of TA, market studies, matching grants, paid local and foreign consultants, etc.  At the same time, these higher costs must lead to demonstrably quick and cost-effective results; otherwise, higher costs can become a red flag and undermine the program. (3) It is unlikely that any of the TIS programs will become self-sustainable over the next 2-3 years, nor should they be expected to.  To date, no TIS programs have generated cash reflows through fees which could cover some of the operating costs. Some Advanced Developing Countries such as Turkey and Portugal have tried to charge success fees of 1% on total investment; since USAID is unable to finance in-country costs, such fees will be needed.  In the case of less developed countries, it is questionable whether sustainability should even be an objective, since it might lead the TIS program to shift its focus from a developmental to a commercial orientation in which large firms are served.  (4) Within the next 2-3 years, IESC will incorporate TIS into its traditional TA operations. The success of this move will depend on the existence of adequate systems to assure that U.S. management of TIS does not suffer, particularly with regard to control of market research and in-country and U.S. communication and implementation procedures.  Conflicts between standard USAID regulations and innovative TIS approaches should be resolved by USAID.","Delivery order no. 22|Evaluated project title: Trade and investment services (TIS)","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-0095-I-00-9096-00","","5/1/1992 12:00:00 AM","","International trade|Investment promotion|Business support services|Technology transfer|Management development|Private enterprises|Private voluntary organizations|Volunteers|Economic impact|Pilot projects","Central and Eastern Europe|Morocco|Sri Lanka|Indonesia|Portugal","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABK124.pdf","9,347 KB","005742 - Louis Berger International, Inc.

"PACR of a grant (6/86-6/92) to Private Agencies Collaborating Together (PACT) to provide support to PVOs in Costa Rica. The project was a success.  (1) PACT helped the Mission to maintain its support to PVOs, especially the U.S. PVO community. (2) U.S. dollars were channelled to international PVOs registered with A.I.D./W to finance their development projects in Costa Rica.  A total of 20 such projects were funded.  In addition, 18 mini-grants were made to U.S. and local PVOs.  (3) Fifteen workshops on subjects of interest to PVOs were conducted, and attended by 757 PVO managers or members of boards of directors. (4) The Asociacion Costarricense para Organizaciones de Desarrollo (ACORDE) was created and legally established as an independent PVO support entity.  ACORDE manages a large loan and grant portfolio in dollars and colones and provides, through a contract with the Central American Institute for Business Administration (INCAE), a systematic, sector-wide TA and training program for PVO institutional strengthening.  The program has been well-received. The following lessons were learned.  (1) While other PVO support entities funded by USAID in Central America have mostly been umbrella organizations driven by PVO interests and need for funds, the foundation-like structure of ACORDE has brought together Costa Ricans of all sectors of the society who have an interest in serving their communities, thereby eliminating the conflict of interest problem.  (2) This careful attention to political balance has provided ACORDE with access to both major political parties.  The result is that agreements can be reached that give ACORDE access to bilateral and multilateral funding, which requires host government approval.  (3) The ACORDE mechanism provides ample coverage for USAID in the field of public relations.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","6/1/1992 12:00:00 AM","","Private voluntary organizations|Indigenous private voluntary organizations|Development projects|Grants|Institution building","Costa Rica","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABL861.pdf","64 KB","008533 - USAID.

"Mid-term evaluation of a grant to the World Rehabilitation Fund (WRF) to train Armenian prosthetists to produce prosthetic equipment for victims of the 1988 earthquake. The evaluation covers the period 9/90-11/92. WRF has been successful in training Armenian prosthetists to produce quality prosthetists, and five or six of those trained are considered technically competent to continue after the project's end.  This is remarkable given the extreme difficulty which WRF has had in posting and retaining professional staff -- a difficulty which has seriously impeded training and left managerial gaps and a patchwork materials ordering system which has resulted in a shortage of some items, and a lifetime supply of others. The WRF facility produces about 200 limbs per year, the quality of the limbs is adequate by U.S. standards, and the staff appear dedicated and anxious to do a good job.  Although the Ministry of Social Welfare (MSW) seems to accord the project a high priority, sustainability is in serious doubt because the facility operates at cost levels which cannot be met by the MSW. As the project heads towards conclusion, the first attempts are being made to utilize Russian-made components, which can be purchased with rubles, which are still used as the currency in Armenia. An attempt to charge nominal fees is still in the discussion stage; all limbs are now free.  The WRF trainees are being paid a wage many times higher than the MSW standard (which is clearly insufficient to retain the staff); cost recovery is essential if they are to be paid more. The demand for prostheses greatly exceeds supply due to the increasing number of war victim amputees, both military and civilian; in fact, war victims greatly outnumber the earthquake victims originally targeted by the project.  The number of amputees is estimated at 3,000, with waiting lists of several hundred at both the WRF facility and a small Soviet workshop which is still in operation.  (The technology and equipment are antiquated at the Soviet workshop and the production methods slow and extremely labor-intensive, but the workshop -- unlike WRF's -- uses indigenous materials, and, moreover, it is sustainable by the MSW.)","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","11/1/1992 12:00:00 AM","","Humanitarian assistance|Earthquakes|Handicapped persons|Prostheses|Technical training","Armenia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABM977.pdf","950 KB","002439 - World Rehabilitation Fund","","008509 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to address the placement needs of Romanian children in institutions.  Evaluation covers the period 10/90-10/92.  The project was implemented by Holt International Children's services under a subgrant from PACT. Placement efforts under the project have included family reunification, adoption, and foster care. Holt has exceeded its reunification objective with more than 2,800 families counseled and 395 children reunited with their birth families.  As for adoption, Holt has placed 117 children with Romanian families and 6 with international families, although adoptions were stopped by the Government of Romania (GOR) for a while and only recently restarted under strict control. Adoption has been a sensitive issue, under intense international scrutiny.  Temporary foster care has also been initiated, but difficulties with acceptance and staff cooperation have limited its effects.  Holt also plans to focus on maternity wards, working to prevent separation of children from their parents.  The reported 1992 rise in children admitted to institutions shows the need to prevent institutionalization. Holt's placement work was carried out by 44 social assistants (SAs) who were trained and supervised by Holt. Some institution staff, especially SAs, had difficulty adjusting to the new Holt model of child placement. In sum, the PACT Consortium's work in permanency planning through family reunification, adoption, or foster care has had significant influence on Romania. Holt's direct activities in reunification through SA training and supervised practice had credible, immediate results and prepared personnel to meet future placement needs.  It is unfortunate that no tracking system exists that can verify the long-term effect of the placements. Despite the progress made, many children remain in institutions due to an insufficient number of SAs.  Laws and procedures impede the movement of children.  Additional training of a significant number of SAs and other child placement staff within technical and university affiliated programs stressing supervised field work is needed. Consistent TA to the GOR is also needed to develop its system for adoption and child protection, along with additional cooperation among consortium NGOs to identify, refer, and place children.  Large numbers of children, who because of their conditions or their families' circumstances cannot be cared for at home, will need to remain in appropriate institutions. PACT's short-term consultants have strengthened the Romanian Adoption Committee (RAC) and other national and county level institutions to develop policies and procedures for child protection and placement. PACT-supported international study tours were valuable, promoting the RAC, the Ministry of Health (MOH), the Ministry of Education (MOE), and other GOR agency awareness of comprehensive child care systems.  Further TA and study tours will build a critical mass of prepared child protection leaders. Strengthening and sustaining the interest and capability of the directors and staffs of Romanian children's institutions depends on continued staff training, modeling, and allocation of GOR funds for additional staff and travel to prepare children for placement. Additional work in hospitals and communities is needed to prevent the institutionalization of children.

"Final evaluation of the Peace Corps Guinea Worm Eradication Program (PC/GWEP -- 6/89-8/92), designed to significantly reduce or eradicate Guinea worm disease in up to 10 African countries. Originally designed for 10 countries, the program now includes 11: Benin, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Cote d'Ivoire, Chad, Ghana, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, and Togo.  A total of 74 volunteers are currently active in the program; over half of these combine Guinea worm eradication with complementary tasks in general health education, water supply, and community development. Overall, the program met its objectives.  The level of outputs achieved was high, and efforts in the field were especially notable. Moreover, where local surveillance data are available, a tentative correlation is permissible between a decline in the incidence of the disease and the efforts of Peace Corps Volunteers in the area.  Some weaknesses in program planning, management, and design, now in the process of being corrected, were offset by expectations exceeded elsewhere. Most important, however, is clear evidence of a growing momentum in participating countries and their respective Peace Corps posts as the eradication target date of 1995 draws near.  Every post engaged in the program has expressed the conviction that Guinea worm eradication activities should continue.  Given the limited core funding available within the Peace Corps for water and sanitation activities, an extension of financial and technical support will be required to consolidate and sustain present gains and to permit the planned increase in volunteer effort. Of the lessons learned from the PC/GWEP, two stand out.  One is that the community-based, person-to-person approach to health education can be effective in encouraging health-seeking behavior. The other is that, in the view of many persons active in Guinea worm eradication throughout the decade, the entry of the Peace Corps into the campaign was a watershed and the beginning of a global mobilization effort.

"Final evaluation of a project (9/89-11/91) to train community health workers to facilitate the awareness and prevention of HIV/AIDS in targeted communities in Cameroon.  The project was implemented by Save the Children (SC). The project was successfully implemented in six activity zones in the Far North Province.  Although the scope of the project changed from three impact areas to one, and from twelve target groups to two, the number of people trained and the ripple effect that was created far exceeded the numbers originally projected.  Over 316 health workers received training during 14 training-of-trainers (TOT) sessions, and more than 24,000 people were reached by the trainers.  In addition, over 104,000 condoms were distributed.  Posters developed for the project adorn walls in clinics and hospitals throughout the Province. Nevertheless, the project experienced problems that influenced its overall effectiveness.  Most of these relate to managerial issues, such as staffing, training and supervision, budgeting, and finance.  As a result, procedures for assessing the effectiveness and quality of the project activities were largely overlooked.  Another area of difficulty centered on the vertical nature of the program and the unrealistic time-frame in which funding was made available. The following lessons were learned.  (1) To ensure sustainability, strong collaboration should exist between the implementing agency and national, provincial, and local health authorities at all stages of the project, from design through evaluation, with respective roles and responsibilities clearly defined.  (2) To sustain HIV/AIDS initiatives in Cameroon, activities should be fully integrated into SC's current primary health care support program in the Far North Province. (3) Criteria for selecting target groups for TOT interventions should include an individual's ability to reach and influence others.  Training materials should be specifically adapted to the needs and characteristics of different target groups.  (4) A 2-year time-frame for a project in which behavioral changes are anticipated is not realistic to maintain training momentum and optimize the educational and behavioral benefits that take place within the target population.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","AFR-0474-G-SS-9062-00","","1/1/1992 12:00:00 AM","","Disease prevention and control|HIV/AIDS|Community health workers|Paramedical education|Public awareness|Sex education|Health education|Teacher training|Human sexual behavior|Behavior change","Cameroon","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABP362.pdf","2,334 KB","001407 - Save the Children (U.S.)","","001554 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of a project (3/87-1/92) to strengthen operations-level management of primary health care (PHC) programs in the Ministries of Health in Lesotho and Botswana.  The project was implemented by the MEDEX Group of the John A. Burns School of Medicine at the University of Hawaii. The core of the project was the application of the MEDEX Group's structured process for reengineering managerial systems for supervision, personnel, transport, drugs/medical supplies, finance, communications, health information, patient records and referral, maintenance, and training.  The project recruited and trained Ministry personnel as management analysts, supervised them in the study of the various systems, held decisionmaking workshops to determine the content of the redesigned systems, wrote manuals to document the new systems, and trained district level personnel in the use of the systems. Despite delays, the MEDEX management development process appears to work and to show potential for further development and application in other areas and other countries.  The process succeeded reasonably well in Lesotho, but ran into difficulties in Botswana, in part because of problems in interministerial coordination.  The project demonstrated that ministry engagement in an analytical and decisionmaking process can result in the redesign of management systems and in the development of manuals to document those systems. On the down side, due to various delays and USAID's shortening of MEDEX's original 5-year project to 4 years, some major objectives were not achieved: putting the revised systems in place at the operations level; installation of an improved supervisory system linked to an ongoing program of inservice training; and full institutionalization of the new process in the target ministries.  As a result, there is little evidence that the new systems are helping to improve the delivery of child survival or primary health care services. Lessons learned are as follows.  (1) What is important is not just the product, but the MEDEX process itself, including a thorough self-analysis by the host organization.  Simply to hand out a manual could short-circuit the process, although well-written manuals can be illustrative.  (2) Where systems were non-existent or very weak, the MEDEX process worked well to create or to improve them, and ran into little resistance.  Where reasonably well developed systems were already in place, more resistance and delays were encountered.  Redesigning systems requires additional criteria, including the potential political volatility or interministerial impact of the change.  Addressing less contentious systems first could build skills, experience, and credibility before taking on the more controversial systems.  (3) The MEDEX approach focuses specifically on management improvement, creating a critical mass of talent and resources focusing on that goal.  Once a ministry has gone through the process under the guidance of MEDEX, it has the skills, methods, and materials to continue the process independently and at relatively low cost.  (4) The time, resources, and energy devoted, especially early on, to developing and testing four management improvement technologies (critical events, case study, distance learning, and resource allocation technologies) was a distraction to the main thrust of the project.  Only the critical (or management) events technology proved relevant to the core management development process. Case study and distance learning activities could have contributed more, but appear to have been used in relative isolation.  (5) ""Establishing a Receptive Framework"" is not just the first step of the MEDEX process, but an ongoing activity which, if neglected, can seriously compromise the whole process.  Commitment to this activity must be constantly renewed, particularly at the central level.  (6) The project lacked a carefully articulated plan to install the new systems in the districts through the teaching of specific skills and competencies to operations level personnel.  Much more work is needed to design and deliver the competency-based management training program for district-level personnel called for in the project design.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","PDC-5929-I-00-0108-00","","1/1/1992 12:00:00 AM","","Health care administration|Public health care|Government departments|Primary health care|Institution building|Management development|Management operations|Host country cooperation","Lesotho|Botswana","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABP589.pdf","2,562 KB","001036 - Research Triangle Institute (RTI)","","001554 - USAID.
