"The purpose of this performance evaluation of the United States Agency for International Development in Jamaica's (USAID/Jamaica) Jamaica Education Transformation Project (JETP; ""project"") is: (1) to assess the progress of the project from its start in January 2010 through the end of the school year in 2012; and (2) to make recommendations for any necessary modifications through the life of the project; and to review the validity of data collected thus far.&nbsp; The evaluation report is also intended to provide suggestions and recommendations for inclusion in the next education strategy for USAID/Jamaica.&nbsp; The original evaluation questions can be summarized as follows: (1) to what degree are teachers, principals and regional Ministry of Education (MOE) offices implementing and supporting the project? (2) does the Jamaican education system have the capacity to implement and monitor the project? (3) is there a difference in student reading performance between project schools in crime-prone communities that received additional material support and those that were not? (4) what were the challenges faced with baseline data collection, have they been resolved, and if not, how can they be? &nbsp;(Excerpt, modified)","On title page: February 14, 2013|'This document was submitted ..... under USAID Contract No. AID-RAN-I-00-09-00019, Task Order No. AID-517-TO-12-00001'|Evaluated project title: Jamaica education transformation project (JETP)","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID-517-TO-12-00001|RAN-I-00-09-00019-00","","2/1/2013 12:00:00 AM","","Educational development|Teachers|Student evaluation|Reading skills|Educational materials|Basic education|Societies in transition","Jamaica","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACX310.pdf","2,286 KB","011933 - Social Impact, Inc.","","013413 - USAID.

"This evaluation report provides the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) with a high-level assessment of its support to the Eurasia Foundation (EF) under its current grant agreement, the third awarded since 1993.&nbsp; The $148m grant (2001-present) provides core funding to EF and its EF Network -- a constellation of affiliated but locally registered foundations in Russia, Central Asia, the South Caucasus, Ukraine and Moldova -- to promote ""open, just, and progressive societies"" in the former Soviet Union.&nbsp; With the grant due to end on December 31, 2013, USAID procured this evaluation to: (1) assess how well EF has met the grant's three broad Strategic Objectives (SOs): promoting private enterprise (PE), civil society (CS), and public administration and policy reform (PA); (2) analyze the success of EF's strategy for building sustainable partner foundations; and (3) identify the advantages and disadvantages of the ""foundation model"" in delivering USAID assistance as opposed to contracts and/or &ldquo;project-based&rdquo; assistance.&nbsp; The report aims to build a better understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of the foundation model to inform various audiences within USAID and the broader United States Government (USG) on future program design.&nbsp; It provides findings that may be useful to the EF home office (EF-DC) on how to improve their operating model, sustainability efforts, and support to PFs.&nbsp; These recommendations will also be useful for other foundations and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) providing similar development assistance.&nbsp; (Excerpt, modified)","Inside title: Performance evaluation of the Eurasia Foundation|Submitted as: Final performance evaluation of USAID's assistance to the Eurasia Foundation","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","AID-OAA-TO-12-00028|RAN-I-00-09-00019-00|AID-RAN-I-00-09-00019","","3/1/2013 12:00:00 AM","","Societies in transition|Grassroots development|Strategic objectives|Private enterprises|Civil society|Public administration|Policy reform","Central Asia|Central and Eastern Europe","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACX371.pdf","1,652 KB","011933 - Social Impact, Inc.","","013413 - USAID.

"MTPDS was a three-year, $19.9 million USAID-funded program designed to improve learning outcomes for Malawi's primary school children.&nbsp; The program was implemented through three discrete ""packages"" of support, implemented at the school level: (1) Level 1 &ndash; National Continuous Professional Development: CPD in-service teacher training includes modules on literacy and leadership that reach all 36,080 Standard 1&ndash;4 teachers in all 34 education districts nationwide through in-service training conducted over weekends and school holidays; (2) Level 2 &ndash; Intensive Literacy Intervention: This includes CPD plus additional days of training, scripted lesson plans, and the Nditha Kuwerenga Reader for every Standard 1 student in the seven target districts; (3) Level 3 &ndash; Coaching: This includes all previous interventions plus coaching by MTPDS and Primary Education Advisors (PEA) (select schools in Salima and Ntchisi).&nbsp; USAID/Malawi commissioned an evaluation of the MTPDS activity comprised of two complementary components.&nbsp; An impact evaluation (IE) approach was to assess the differential impact and costeffectiveness of the three levels of treatment intensity on student learning in reading.&nbsp; A performance evaluation approach was to document lessons learned and to assess progress towards sustainability (specifically the handing over of the national CPD program to the MoEST).&nbsp; The four-person evaluation team utilized a multi-level, mixed-methods approach to gain both a breadth and depth of information.&nbsp; These methods included: document review, data quality assessment (DQA), direct observation, key informant interviews (KII), focus group discussions (FGD), mini-surveys, and a statistical analysis of quantitative data to derive impact and associated cost-effectiveness estimates.&nbsp; Each technique facilitated triangulation of data during the analysis and reporting phases&nbsp; (Excerpt, modified).","'Requisition no: REQ-612-12-000029'","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","AID-612-TO-13-00002","","5/1/2013 12:00:00 AM","","Teacher education|Professional development|Literacy|Performance measurement|Cost-effectiveness|Access to education|Enrollment|Quality of education|Reading skills|Writing skills|Primary schools|Efficiency|Leadership training","Malawi","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACX458.pdf","980 KB","011933 - Social Impact, Inc.","","008573 - USAID.

"In 1984 the National Bipartisan Commission to Central America and the Caribbean (the Kissinger Commission) found that the United States was not sufficiently responsive to the political and civil turmoil in that region.&nbsp; Congress appropriated funding that directed USAID to address this need through participant training of youth, and designated a partner, Georgetown University, through its Center for Intercultural Education and Development (CIED), to implement the LAC Higher Education Scholarship Program.&nbsp; In 1985, the first Central American, Andean, and Caribbean participant training scholarships were launched.&nbsp; The program has provided two-year technical training for economically disadvantaged high school graduates from underserved areas of designated countries across Central America and the Caribbean.&nbsp; These individuals take English language training, which allows them to take standard coursework in the United States along with U.S. peers.&nbsp; They also live with U.S. host families as part of their curriculum.&nbsp; From 1989 through 2008, the program was known as CASS, the Cooperative Association of States for Scholars.&nbsp; Since 2008, it has been known as SEED, Scholarships for Education and Economic Development.&nbsp; This report summarizes the findings of an impact evaluation of the above scholarship programs.&nbsp; The study dealt with program implementation and effects.&nbsp; Implementation was studied by examining service delivery and program costs in relation to other scholarship programs offering similar services.&nbsp; Effects were examined by comparing scholarship recipients to non-recipients who were judged to be outstanding candidates for a scholarship, but were not chosen in the final selection process.&nbsp; This document is organized in relation to the two principal evaluation questions: (1) to what extent did the program provide value for investment?; and (2) did the scholarships enable participating individuals to become leading change agents in their respective professions and communities?&nbsp; (Excerpt, modified)","'This publication was produced .... under Task Order AID-OAA-BC-10-00001 of the Global Evaluation and Monitoring II Blanket Purchase Agreement, GEM II BPA EDH-E-00-08-00003-00.'|Related evaluation: An evaluation of the Cooperative Association of States for Scholarships [CASS] program (1994-2001) (PD-ABZ-325)|Related evaluation: Training impact and development : an evaluation of the impact of the Cooperative Association of States for Scholarships (CASS) program (PD-ABK-526)","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID-OAA-BC-10-00001|EDH-E-00-08-00003-00|AID-EDH-E-00-08-00003","","2/1/2013 12:00:00 AM","","Higher education|Scholarships|Community development|Occupational opportunities|Community leadership|Change agents|Free trade|Trade agreements","Mexico|Latin America|Guatemala|El Salvador","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACX232.pdf","1,024 KB","013875 - JBS International, Inc.","","000035 - U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)","English","application/pdf","","","Chesterfield, Ray|Dant, William","Higher education","February 2013","","","","Evaluation of LAC higher education scholarships program","","PD-ACX-232","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MzM1Njc3","Latin American Regional",""

"The Improving Livelihoods and Governance through Natural Resource Management Project (&ldquo;project&rdquo;) is implemented by the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) and funded by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) under cooperative agreement no. 306-A-00-10-00516-00. &nbsp;The project started in April 2010 and ran through December 2013. &nbsp;The project goals are: (1) to build Afghanistan's capacity to conserve and sustainably manage its natural resources; (2) to improve the livelihoods of the rural poor in and near targeted protected areas; and (3) to strengthen subnational governance related to natural resources management, as well as linkages between communities, provincial and national government institutions. &nbsp;The project works in Band-e-Amir National Park and the Northern Plateau in Bamyan Province, and in the Wakhan Corridor and Little and Big Pamirs (hereafter referred to collectively as ""the Wakhan"") in Badakhshan Province. &nbsp;These areas are significant in terms of biodiversity conservation and watershed protection. &nbsp;The project also includes a national capacity building component. &nbsp;The project supports and reports results under USAID/Afghanistan's Assistance Objective AO 5: A Sustainable, Thriving Agricultural Economy, specifically Program Element 5.2: Improved Natural Resource Management as a Result of USG Assistance. &nbsp;This performance evaluation: (1) examines whether the project is on track to achieve its intended goals and results (outputs and outcomes) in a sustainable manner; (2) assesses the validity of the program design and logic; (3) identifies project strengths, weaknesses, successes, lessons learned, and opportunities for improvement; and (4) recommends options for USAID and Afghan Government support for natural resource management, protected areas management, and rural livelihoods, including the potential role of the pending Afghanistan Parks and Wildlife Authority (APWA). &nbsp;Evaluation findings are based on evidence of progress from implementing partner quarterly reports and evidence of performance from the evaluation team's field visits and interviews, specifically: progress against performance indicators (baselines, targets and results) and the annual project work plan (activities and outputs), the implementing partner's perspectives on implementation challenges and progress, key stakeholder interviews, and observations on the quality of technical assistance. &nbsp;The most significant findings and conclusions are: (1) governance achievements are substantial; (2) the project design is robust; (3) significant differences in challenges and opportunities exist between Bamyan and the Wakhan; (4) balancing human, livestock, and habitat conservation trade-offs is critical to sustaining community buy-in; (5) work Plan flexibility allows the project to respond readily to emerging technical assistance priorities; (6) the project consistently demonstrates characteristics of quality technical assistance; (7) stakeholder critiques of project performance are few; (8) the project is often associated with snow leopard conservation in people's minds; (9) the project is largely on track with respect to work plan activities and indicator targets; and (10) opportunities exist for improvement. &nbsp;Twenty-four recommendations are also included. &nbsp;(Excerpt, modified)","Evaluated project title: Improving livelihoods and governance through natural resources management (ILGNRM)|Project title: Services under program and project offices for results tracking II (SUPPORT II)","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","AID-306-C-12-00012","","8/1/2013 12:00:00 AM","","","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACX762.pdf","1,486 KB","000356 - Checchi and Co.

"The increasing importance of the wildlife management areas (WMAs) in Tanzania, where 17 WMAs are now functioning and 22 others are in various stages of development, begs the question of what successes have been achieved and what challenges remain to be addressed if this Community-Based Conservation model is to be sustained and even scaled up. &nbsp;There has not been a country-wide evaluation of WMAs since the pilot-phase evaluation in 2007 at a time when most WMAs were too new to yield firm projections for the long term. &nbsp;The evaluation team chose five of the nine pilot WMAs for which full baseline studies were available: Wami-Mbiki, Pawaga-Idodi, Ipole, Burunge, and Enduimet. &nbsp;All five had been officially launched in 2003 and all had reached fully registered status with user rights by 2007. &nbsp;The four-person evaluation team spent approximately four weeks in the field visiting 15 villages around these five WMAs, at the same time that a 750-person household survey was carried out in 25 villages in the same WMAs. &nbsp;The evaluation had three objectives: (1) assess what have been the key outcomes and achievements of the overall WMA approach for the Tanzanian government, local communities, and conservation of wildlife and other resources in terms of creating increased financial benefits, strengthening governance, improving human-wildlife conflicts, and strengthening wildlife management; (2) Identify whether the policy framework and the WMA institutional structure is effective and sufficient in meeting the overall WMA goal of providing benefits to both communities and wildlife; and (3) identify what opportunities and challenges exist to the sustainability and scaling up of the current approach. &nbsp;The review found that WMAs in Tanzania are presently at a key inflection point in their evolution, with a number of possible future pathways of development. &nbsp;Considerable progress has been made during the past decade in terms of: (1) creating a basic legal and institutional framework for WMAs; (2) supporting communities to establish the basic management structures and land use patterns required to form and oversee WMAs; and (3) building broad support for WMAs as a key component of both conservation and natural resource-related development policies and approaches in Tanzania. &nbsp;However, despite this significant progress, major challenges remain, particularly in the economic and governance realms. &nbsp;New approaches to organizational development of authorized associations (AAs), enterprise development and private sector engagement in WMAs, and larger-scale wildlife sector governance issues will be an important element of continuing support by USAID to WMAs, and create numerous opportunities for future support to be designed in a more strategic way. &nbsp;The recommendations highlight these opportunities and suggest specific steps for developing them. &nbsp;(Excerpt, modified)","Cover title: Tanzania wildlife management areas evaluation : final evaluation report|Footer title: Tanzania WMA evaluation : final evaluation report|Submitted as: Tanzania wildlife management evaluation","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","7/1/2013 12:00:00 AM","","","Tanzania","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACY083.pdf","1,616 KB","013576 - Tetra Tech ARD","","008612 - USAID.

"The comprehensive partnership between the United States and Indonesia identifies the creation of education partnerships as a top priority.&nbsp; In furtherance of this objective, USAID/Indonesia launched the University Partnerships (UP) program in December 2009 to help improve the quality and relevance of higher education in Indonesia.&nbsp; Establishing U.S.-Indonesia university partnerships leverages U.S. universities&rsquo; expertise to strengthen the research and teaching capacity of Indonesian institutions.&nbsp; To date, USAID has made awards to 16 U.S.-Indonesia university partnerships, with the U.S. university as the awardee and one or more Indonesian partner organizations as sub-awardees.&nbsp; The range of awards is from $600,000 to $1,000,000 in funding from USAID/Indonesia.&nbsp; This evaluation of the third and fourth UP partnership awards, carried out in June 2013, is the second evaluation of UP partnerships.&nbsp; The purposes of the evaluation were to: 1) assess the extent of the knowledge and skills transfer that has occurred between the lead U.S. university and the Indonesian partners as sub-awardees; 2) determine the extent or level of the capacity building that has taken place within the partnerships; 3) assess the effectiveness of the project interventions between the partners to improve the teaching and research services; 4) assess whether or not the projects are sustainable and have achieved the project objectives; 5) obtain lessons learned from the existing partnerships that can be applied to the future direction of the UP program; and 6) demonstrate how the institutions have achieved measurable improvements in the quality and relevance of their teaching and research services.&nbsp; (Excerpt, modified)","Header title: Evaluation of Indonesia university partnerships #3 and #4|Evaluated project title: University partnerships (UP)|Phase 1 evaluation: PD-ACU-841|AID-RAN-I-09-00016","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","AID-497-TO-12-00004|RAN-I-00-09-00016-00|RAN-I-00-09-00016-00","","8/1/2013 12:00:00 AM","","Higher education|Access to education|Livelihood|University and college students|University and college degrees|Educational development|Teacher training|Curriculum design","Indonesia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACY092.pdf","820 KB","001891 - International Business and Technical Consultants, Inc.

"The program cycle is a core mechanism by which Bureau of Policy, Planning and Learning (PPL) works to instill a ""discipline of development"" in the agency. &nbsp;It is at the center of USAID's efforts to achieve results and contributes to the broader objectives of USAID Forward, the Policy Framework (2011&ndash;2015), and higher level government-wide policies embodied in the Presidential Policy Directive 6 on Global Development and the joint Department of State-USAID Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review. &nbsp;Over the course of 2010-2012, PPL issued seven policies and strategies, country development cooperation strategy (CDCS) and project design guidance, a draft learning guide, and revisions of ADS 201 and 202. &nbsp;PPL offices initially provided support to USAID missions on an ""on-demand"" basis, but adjusted their approaches to support over time, based on feedback and learning. &nbsp;PPL engaged EnCompass LLC to assess the effectiveness, utility and extent to which the bureau's policies, reforms and activities are influencing agency planning, programming, operations and budgetary decision-making, especially in missions. &nbsp;The evaluation was specifically designed to provide PPL with a greater understanding of how well the program cycle has been understood, implemented, supported and integrated into organizational culture, and to inform PPL's strategy for deeper integration and institutionalization of the program cycle. &nbsp;The evaluation addressed the following questions: (1) to what extent are USAID missions effectively implementing and other stakeholders effectively supporting implementation of the program cycle; (2) to what extent are PPL program cycle products and services meeting the needs of missions and others in the Agency; (3) what factors internal to PPL enable or constrain its effectiveness related to the program cycle; and (4) what is needed to facilitate institutionalization of the program cycle. &nbsp;Overall, the concept of the program cycle has been well-received by USAID staff who perceive it as returning to a more rigorous, evidence-based, approach to programming. &nbsp;All program cycle components assessed during the evaluation are perceived as adding value to USAID's work, although missions particularly struggle with implementation of the project design processes. &nbsp;Primary responsibility for implementing the program cycle in missions rests with foreign service officers (FSOs) with critical support from foreign service nationals (FSNs). &nbsp;Uptake and implementation have been hindered by the exceptionally high volume of new policies and guidance issued over the past three years by PPL and agency initiatives (presidential or otherwise). &nbsp;The ""roll out"" of the program cycle appeared to lack an overall plan to introduce and facilitate its reception and use in missions. &nbsp;The evaluation concludes that the program cycle marks an important paradigm shift for the USAID, but institutionalization will not occur through promulgation of new guidance and policies alone. Mission staff wishes for a slower pace, better policy integration, training, and active support from PPL, regional and pillar bureaus on the program cycle. &nbsp;PPL is adjusting its approach to program cycle support based on feedback and learning. &nbsp;(Excerpt, modified)","'Evaluation Mechanism No.M/OAA/GRO/LMA-12-00800'|Related documents: PD-ACX-603, PD-ACX-604, PN-AEC-227, PN-AEC-228","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID-OAA-M-12-00021","","9/1/2013 12:00:00 AM","","Evaluation methodology|Development policy|Development planning|Implementation","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACX518.pdf","2,604 KB","012914 - EnCompass, LLC","","013312 - USAID.

"<div>Originally conceived under the Senator Paul Simon Water for the Poor Act of 2005, the Sustainable Water and Sanitation in Africa (SUWASA) project was designed to provide water and sanitation services to underserved populations in Africa. &nbsp;The project aimed to address the following needs: (1) African governments lack sufficient regulatory and corporate governance tools to enable local utilities that are technically and financially capable to provide quality water and sanitation services to their customers in a cost-effective and sustainable way; (2) African utilities were ineffective and inefficient because they were not sufficiently developed or trained in effective revenue collection, in addressing leakage problems in water distribution systems, or in customer relations; and (3) utility services to the poor are expensive, not uniformly available, and not of high quality. &nbsp;The design of the SUWASA project emphasized the role that institutional reform would play to improve direct service delivery in providing access to water and sanitation services and included: (1) the development of cost-based tariffs, a process by which tariffs are adjusted; (2) development of governing boards overseeing and planning utility operations and investment; and (3) training provided at the local utility level. &nbsp;The main goal of the evaluation was to provide USAID with an external assessment of SUWASA to date, its ability to integrate other complementary development activities, and its effectiveness at improving sector performance, measured by documented results and the perceptions of stakeholders. &nbsp;The five salient evaluation questions focused primarily on five corresponding premises: (1) contribution to the body of solutions; (2) maximum development impact and aid effectiveness; (3) value of service provider; (4) positive country-level reform; and (5) correctly designed, managed, and implemented project. &nbsp;The evaluation presents findings, conclusions, and recommendations for each SUWASA country, followed by overall conclusions and recommendations. &nbsp;(Excerpt, modified)</div>","'Prepared under Water II IQC: EPP-1-00-05-00010-00; Water Sector CKM Task Order Number: AID-OAA-TO-12-00002'|Evaluated project title: Sustainable water and sanitation in Africa (SUWASA)","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID-OAA-TO-12-00002|EPP-I-00-05-00010-00","","9/1/2013 12:00:00 AM","","Water supply|Sanitation|Water sanitation|Sustainable development","Ethiopia|Kenya|Liberia|Mozambique|Nigeria|Senegal|South Sudan|Uganda|Zambia|Africa south of Sahara","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACY091.pdf","2,144 KB","008414 - Mendez England and Associates","","008308 - USAID.

"The Community-based Therapeutic Care Institutionalization (CTCIM) project was implemented by Concern World Wide (CWW) under cooperative agreement no.

"This evaluation of evaluations, or meta-evaluation, was undertaken to assess the quality of USAID's evaluation reports. &nbsp;The study builds on USAID's practice of periodically examining evaluation quality to identify opportunities for improvement. &nbsp;It covers USAID evaluations completed between January 2009 and December 2012. &nbsp;During this four-year period, USAID launched an ambitious effort called USAID Forward, which aims to integrate all aspects of the Agency's programming approach, including program and project evaluations, into a modern, evidence-based system for realizing development results. &nbsp;A key element of this initiative is USAID's Evaluation Policy, released in January 2011. &nbsp;The meta-evaluation on which this volume reports systematically examined 340 randomly selected evaluations and gathered qualitative data from USAID staff and evaluators to address three questions: (1) to what degree have quality aspects of USAID's evaluation reports, and underlying practices, changed over time; (2) at this point in time, on which evaluation quality aspects or factors do USAID's evaluation reports excel and where are they falling short; and (3) what can be determined about the overall quality of USAID evaluation reports and where do the greatest opportunities for improvement lie. &nbsp;The overall picture of evaluation quality at USAID from this study is one of improvement over the study period, with strong gains emerging on key factors between 2010 and 2012. &nbsp;The number of evaluations per year increased, and the quality of evaluation reports has improved. &nbsp;While this portrait is largely positive, the study also identified evaluation quality factors, or standards, that USAID evaluation reports do not yet meet. &nbsp;On several core evaluation quality standards -- such as clear distinctions among evaluation findings, conclusions, and recommendations -- performance was found to be below USAID standards. &nbsp;Other significant deficiencies included the small percentage of evaluations that indicated that an evaluation specialist was a member of the evaluation team, which USAID has required for the better part of a decade, and low ratings on the presence of sex-disaggregated data at all results levels -- not simply for input level activities. &nbsp;Low ratings were also found for several evaluation standards introduced in the 2011 Evaluation Policy, but this may simply reflect slow uptake or lack of awareness of standards. &nbsp;(Excerpt, modified)","","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID-OAA-M-11-00026","","8/1/2013 12:00:00 AM","","Evaluation methodology|Development policy|Development planning|Implementation|Data quality","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACX771.pdf","2,859 KB","003970 - Management Systems International, Inc.

"<p class=""MsoNormal"">The Child Survival and Health Grants Program (CSHGP), has been, since 1985, USAID&rsquo;s primary central vehicle for enlisting the support of U.S. PVOs to engage in community-oriented programming for child survival.&nbsp; It has three components: (1) small scale country-based cooperative agreements with U.S. PVOs and NGOs, selected through an annual competitive process; (2) technical assistance (TA) through the Maternal and Child Health Integrated Program (MCHIP) to support PVO work in rigorous monitoring and evaluation, maternal and child health (MCH) technical areas, operations research techniques and use of evidence, and reporting; and (3) networking for collaboration to strengthen leadership in community health through the Child Survival Collaborations and Resources (CORE) Group PVO/NGO coalition.&nbsp; As of October 2012, the CSHGP portfolio consisted of 34 projects implemented in 26 countries by 23 U.S. PVOs.&nbsp; The purpose of this evaluation is to inform the U.S. Agency for International Development's (USAID's) future investment in partnerships and strategies to improve development impact as a part of the agency's reform agenda, USAID Forward.&nbsp; The evaluation places particular focus on the role played by U.S. private voluntary organizations (PVOs)/non-governmental organizations (NGOs) intermediaries and their local partners to accelerate progress for current and emerging priorities in health, particularly ending preventable child and maternal deaths.&nbsp; This evaluation covers the period since 2003, after CSHGP moved to the Bureau for Global Health (BGH).&nbsp; Based on the evaluation findings about strengths and weaknesses of the CSHGP in light of USAID's strategic priorities and future needs and proven PVO capabilities, there is a future role for U.S. PVOs, among other partners, in ending preventable child and maternal deaths. CSHGP has supported many &nbsp;of the strengths of PVOs, but there are elements of the program's structure and management that have limited grantee contributions. CSHGP no longer provides an effective vehicle to take advantage of potential contributions of U.S. PVOs and their local partners in community-oriented programming to accelerate ending preventable child and maternal deaths, and suggests programming options that could contribute significantly to BGH and global needs.

"The Asia's Regional Response to Endangered Species Trafficking (ARREST) program, funded by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) Regional Development Mission for Asia (RDMA) Regional Environment Office (REO), promotes a three-pronged approach to curb wildlife trafficking through: (1) reduction in consumption of endangered species in key markets in Asia by reducing consumer demand; (2) reduction in poaching and trafficking of endangered species across Asia by strengthening law enforcement capacity; and (3) continuation and sustainability of these positive trends beyond the life of the program by strengthening and sustaining regional learning networks and partnerships.&nbsp; The purpose of the mid-term evaluation was to reflect upon program implementation to date and look forward to opportunities for increased program success and sustainability.&nbsp; The evaluation was framed by three objectives: (1) assess progress to date toward agreed-upon program objectives and intermediate results; (2) identify implementation challenges, corrective actions, and/or areas for improvement related to program management and achievement of expected results for the duration of the program period; and (3) recommend specific opportunities to enhance regional level impact and further strengthen the regional Wildlife Enforcement Network (WEN) and sustainability approach.&nbsp; The evaluation concluded that the ARREST program is off to a strong start and important progress has been made by the Freeland Foundation and its partners on many elements of the program during its first two years, particularly in its law enforcement training and capacity-building activities.&nbsp; ARREST is exceptionally well positioned to help address rising USG interest in and concern about wildlife trafficking both regionally and globally, including its intersection with a broad range of other high-priority issues such as transnational drug and human trafficking crimes and emerging pandemic threats resulting from the illegal transport of live animals across borders without health inspections.&nbsp; The program is on track to meet many of the activity-level results as set out in the Performance Management Plan (PMP).&nbsp; Results to date at the Intermediate Results (IR) level of the Results Framework (RF) -- the level from which the key evaluation questions have been drawn -- are varied:&nbsp; modest progress in reducing consumer demand, significant progress in strengthening law enforcement capacity and mixed progress in strengthening and sustaining regional learning networks and partnerships.&nbsp; Extensive input from document review and key informant interviews in five countries (China, Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam) identified a number of ways in which the ARREST program can be strengthened during its remaining three years.&nbsp; Key recommendations are included in the report along with suggested lead responsible parties and entities to implement the recommendations.&nbsp; (Excerpt, modified)","Cover title: Mid-term performance evaluation of Asia's regional response to endangered species trafficking program|'Evaluation report'|Evaluated project title: Asia's regional response to endangered species trafficking (ARREST)","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID-486-TO-13-00004|RAN-I-00-09-00019-00|AID-RAN-I-00-09-00019","","10/1/2013 12:00:00 AM","","Endangered species|Animals|Crimes|Hides and skins|Wildlife hunting|Protected wildlife areas|International law|Law enforcement|Public awareness","Asia|Southeast Asia|Indonesia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACY224.pdf","2,667 KB","011933 - Social Impact, Inc.","","011460 - USAID.

"<div>This report presents the purpose, findings and conclusions of an evaluation carried out by Partners in Development Services (PDS). &nbsp;PDS was contracted by USAID to evaluate the performance and impact of three completed projects, track the performance of two active projects and observe the status of a newly awarded grant. &nbsp;Since June 2011, the USAID-DG office funded under the newly established Fixed Obligation Grants (FOGs) mechanism, six projects in Sudan with a total of $1,297,672. &nbsp;All the projects were/are implemented by four Sudanese civil society organizations (CSOs). &nbsp;The main focus of the projects was to empower the Sudanese CSOs and to enable them to play a role in determining the future of their country and people.The purpose of this evaluation is to better understand, not only how the DG FOGs have performed to-date, but also how effective FOGs are as a programming mechanism for DG activities in Sudan. &nbsp;Areas of focus for this evaluation include, but are not limited to, what USAID and partners are obtaining from the FOGs, what is going well and what is not, and how lessons learned can be applied to future programming.&nbsp; The evaluation came up with two sets of recommendations. &nbsp;The first addresses USAID whereas the second addresses FOG recipients. &nbsp;The first set stresses on the continued use of FOGs as a DG programming mechanism; continued support to democracy advocates in Sudan and providing funding to some of the current projects for at least two years. &nbsp;In particular, to the capacity building efforts of projects that focus mainly on women and youth. &nbsp;USAID DG is also encouraged to consider funding for other GJD areas and in particular key elements of good governance such as legislative functions and processes, local government and decentralization, and anticorruption reforms. &nbsp;FOG's recipients call for more concerted networking between actors, engagement with political parties and media; opting to use of communication channels that appeal to youth and women; and developing benchmarks or other measures to integrate women as important allies in constitution-making. &nbsp;(Excerpt, modified)</div>","'Report Submitted to USAID/Sudan’s Democracy and Governance Office'","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/2013 12:00:00 AM","","Grants|Funding mechanisms|Governance|Democratization|Civil society|Civil society organizations (CSO)|Anticorruption interventions|Communication channels|Political participation|Youth|Women|Political development","Sudan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACW250.pdf","1,081 KB","040356 - Partners in Development Services (PDS)","","040194 - USAID.

(MKFI) in achieving LIPAD's objectives of: (1) enhanced peace initiatives through literacy activities (with special attention to women nonliterates who could be effective peace agents and agents of change); (2) increased basic literacy and functional literacy of citizens in the Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao (ARMM); and (3) developed sensitivity of youth to peace and development efforts in the ARMM by harnessing their services in the literacy delivery program. &nbsp;The evaluation team examined the effectiveness of LIPAD service delivery chain within four major activities&mdash;adult literacy facilitator training, adult literacy classes, learning materials distribution, and the integration of peace building concepts in the adult literacy curriculum. &nbsp;The team also assessed project results guided by 11 evaluation questions clustered within the following five domains: for relevance, effectiveness, efficiency, sustainability, and other essentials (e.g., monitoring and evaluation, and outreach communications) and documented what is working/good practices. &nbsp;The evaluation assessed the degree to which these results or other unintended project outcomes are supported and owned by stakeholders at the local and municipal levels and made recommendations on what could be better where applicable. &nbsp;It is anticipated the the findings from this performance evaluation will be used to inform the staff of the USAID/Philippines (Offices of Education and Program Resources Management) as well as the staff of MKFI and the Government of the Philippines stakeholders (Department of Education [Central and ARMM] and the Department of Social Work and Development) on what's working and what could be better in implementing similar types of literacy projects. &nbsp;(Excerpt, modified)","Cover title: AID-492-E-13-00003/AID-492-BC-13-00025 'literacy for peace and development (LIPAD) project performance evaluation : final publishable report|Header title: USAID AID-492-E-13-00003/AID-492-BC-13-00025 'literacy for peace and development (LIPAD) project performance evaluation : final report|Evaluated project title: Literacy for peace and development' (LIPAD)","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","AID-492-E-13-00003|AID-492-BC-13-00025","","10/1/2013 12:00:00 AM","","","Philippines","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACY456.pdf","10,842 KB","040710 - CPRM Consultants, Inc.","","008592 - USAID.

"This is a report on the mid-term performance evaluation of the Judicial Independence and Legal Empowerment Project (JILEP) funded by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) Mission in Georgia. &nbsp;JILEP is being implemented during the period September 24, 2010-September 24, 2014, by the East-West Management Institute (EWMI). &nbsp;JILEP was designed to support and strengthen the judiciary as an independent yet equal branch of government, and to improve Georgia's commercial law system. &nbsp;The main objectives of the evaluation were to determine the effectiveness of JILEP and to provide recommendations on corrective actions and new directions for the remaining years of project implementation and beyond. &nbsp;The main thrust of the evaluation included analyzing JILEP activities from the project's start in September 2010 through the initiation of this evaluation in June 2013 to review progress toward achieving key expected results, as well as identify accomplishments, delays, challenges, and their impact on the project. &nbsp;An integral part of the evaluation mission was to answer a set of pre-determined questions, which focused primarily on judicial reform, building a civil society coalition, legal education, and commercial law. &nbsp;These questions are depicted in the body of this report, followed by sections related to findings, conclusions and recommendations. &nbsp;They concern: (1) the interplay between direct support for the judicial system and support for civil society organizations (CSOs) intent on advocating fundamental changes within the judicial system; (2) the project's effect on judicial reform despite support from the judicial leadership; (3) the project's approach to building a coalition of like-minded non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to support judicial reform; (4) the extent to which the project's approach to legal education was effective; and (5) the extent to which the project's approach to commercial law was effective. &nbsp;The evaluation concludes that: (1) JILEP's design allowed it to allocate resources based on the political will or willingness of its target partners; (2) JILEP's activities effectively contributed to judicial independence, transparency and professionalism; (3) JILEP has been effective in designing and implementing activities that contribute to improved legal education in Georgia and its enhancement of clinical education to hone students' skills is a major breakthrough in Georgia's legal education system; (4) JILEP's activities have had a modest impact on the High School of Justice's ability to provide commercial law training to judges; and (5) due to JILEP's various activities, alternative dispute resolution (ADR) has gained wider acceptance in both mediation and arbitration and commercial adjudication is perceived as less fair by attorneys than it was a year ago. &nbsp;Recommendations include: (1) support for civil society and core legal institutions together in one project is an effective lever for reform; (2) JILEP should continue to work directly with the High Council of Justice, the High School of Justice (HSOJ) and the Ministry of Justice in the same technical areas it has pursued since inception, with a greater focus on those that have not been completed; (3) JILEP should expand its work focusing on the empowerment of judges by assisting the Conference of Judges and the newly-created Unity of Judges; (4) JILEP should continue to work through Coalition for an Independent and Transparent Judiciary as the two-prong approach in pursuing judicial reforms has been successful; (5) JILEP should develop a sustainability strategy for the legal education component to ensure that the initiatives it started continue beyond project completion; (6) JILEP can focus its efforts on commercial law with the HSOJ, which has been generally receptive to commercial law training. &nbsp;(Excerpt, modified)","'Submitted to: USAID/Caucasus'|Evaluated project title: Judicial independence and legal empowerment project (JILEP)","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID-114-TO-13-0003|AID-114-I-13-00001","","9/1/2013 12:00:00 AM","","Judicial reform|Legal systems|Empowerment|Human rights|Rule of law|Commercial law|Political leadership|Transparency","Georgia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACY458.pdf","521 KB","008414 - Mendez England and Associates","","009620 - USAID.

"This is a report on the mid-term performance evaluation of the Power and Gas Infrastructure Project (PGIP) funded by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) Mission in Georgia.&nbsp; The PGIP project is being implemented during the period May 10, 2010-September 30, 2014, by Georgia Oil &amp; Gas Corporation (GOGC), Sakenergoremonti (SER), and Tetra Tech EM (TT).&nbsp; PGIP was designed to: (1) promote energy security through greater access to electricity and natural gas supplies for households and businesses in Western Georgia; (2) promote the development of the Poti Free Industrial Zone (FIZ) on the Black Sea; and (3) secure power exports through reliable transmission infrastructure improvements domestically.&nbsp; PGIP is a portfolio of $115 million in energy infrastructure projects that include: (1) main gas pipeline; (2) power transmission line construction; and (3) smart grid improvements.&nbsp; The project is unique because it is funded from ""one-time"" supplemental post-conflict resources, is the largest USAID-funded infrastructure project in Georgia, and utilizes an innovative mix of both private sector and host country-controlled organizations as implementers.&nbsp; The main objective of the evaluation was to assess PGIP's progress towards its goals and, as a secondary objective, provide lessons learned on the sustainability considerations of large-scale infrastructure projects, implementation modality, and other important aspects.&nbsp; The main thrust of the evaluation included PGIP activities from May 2010 to May 2013, and focused on: (1) end users' measurable economic benefits that can be associated with the gas pipeline construction under PGIP; (2) overall quality of the design and procurement of the Senaki power transmission project; (3) overall process of designing the transmission project; and (4) extent the operations, maintenance, and sustainability of Georgian gas pipeline and power transmission systems improved, as well as the contribution that PGIP made (if any) towards such improvement.&nbsp; The evaluators collected quantitative and qualitative data and information from a broad range of stakeholders and affected groups to obtain a balanced and thorough overview, as well as accuracy and completeness of the subsequent conclusions.&nbsp; Techniques that balance each other were utilized: quantitative vs. qualitative data; individual vs. group responses; semi-structured interviews vs. analysis of existing surveys; and data sets.&nbsp; The evaluation concludes with findings, conclusions, recommendations and lessons learned.&nbsp; (Excerpt, modified)","Evaluated project title: Power and gas infrastructure project (PGIP)","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID-114-TO-13-00004|AID-114-I-13-00001","","9/1/2013 12:00:00 AM","","Electric power|Gas|Access to resources|Electric power distribution|Electric power lines|Energy needs|Energy supply","Georgia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACY463.pdf","1,462 KB","008414 - Mendez England and Associates","","009620 - USAID.

"In 2009, recognizing the need to strengthen sub-national governance and its institutions, primarily the Provincial Governors (PGs) and the Provincial Governors' Offices (PGOs), USAID/Afghanistan's Office of Democracy and Governance (ODG) designed the Performance Based Governance Fund (PBGF) project.&nbsp; The purpose of PBGF is to deliver capacity building and financial support to PGs and their offices to enable them to fulfill their key functions as the provincial representatives of the national government and to provide essential services to their respective constituents.&nbsp; The implementing partner for PBGF is The Asia Foundation (TAF).&nbsp; The PBGF project has been implemented in two phases.&nbsp; Phase I (PBGF-I) was co-funded from 2009 - 2011 by USAID, the United Kingdom's Department of International Development (DFID), and the Government of Belgium.&nbsp; Phase II (PBGF-II) was funded solely by USAID and is scheduled to end in 2013.&nbsp; The purpose of this evaluation was to assess the performance of PBGF and TAF in building the capacity of the PGOs to plan, budget, and procure goods and services to respond to the needs of citizens.&nbsp; The evaluation was also called upon to assess the project's capacity to improve the legitimacy and popular perception of the PGOs by examining the quality of interventions and support to different actors in the provincial governance framework.&nbsp; As a final evaluation, the purpose is also to identify lessons that can inform future USAID support to PGOs through similar programs.&nbsp; The evaluation found, despite functioning in areas of the country that are increasingly difficult to monitor and manage, that TAF implemented a well-managed and responsive program that made progress toward its stated goals.&nbsp; The majority of responses received from PGs, PGO staff, line ministries, and beneficiaries regarding PBGF were positive with respect to program management and the financial assistance provided, and the program provided an important benefit to communities by funding grants to community groups identified by PGOs.&nbsp; The evaluation concludes that: (1) that overall, PBGF demonstrated that it is possible to support and build the institutional capacity of PGOs by providing resources, training and mentoring to help them improve and fulfill their outreach and responsiveness to citizens' needs; (2) changes that PBGF introduced in the allocation of spending did appear to have led to improved outreach to outlying districts; (3) a key strength of the program was the reliability with which funds were delivered to PGOs each month, coupled with the incentives PBGF introduced; (4) the incentive system could have been improved by inviting PGOs to participate in its design and provide inputs on various aspects; and (5) capacity building in financial management was an area of the project with little success.&nbsp; Recommendations include: (1) greater attention must be given to developing a Provincial Development Plan that is within the budget capacities of GIRoA; (2) PGOs should be more aware of the various central line ministry funding ceilings before planning development activities; (3) it is recommended that PBGF and PGOs, given the importance of having a visible presence in outlying districts to citizens' perceptions of the PGO and GIRoA, establish a dedicated fund to provide development assistance and services to outlying districts; (4) the design of future projects would also benefit from measuring how much outreach is occurring within each outreach category, who the beneficiaries are, how often outreach is occurring, the costs of outreach activities, the number of districts receiving outreach, and the number of people benefiting on a monthly basis; and (5) building on the positive experiences reported by DoWA representatives and the importance of PBGF funding to DoWA programs, it is recommended that a District Women's Initiative Support program be promoted through the PGOs.&nbsp; (Excerpt, modified)","Project title: Services under program and project offices for results tracking II (SUPPORT II)","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","AID-306-C-12-00012","","9/1/2013 12:00:00 AM","","","Afghanistan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACY476.pdf","1,663 KB","000356 - Checchi and Co.

"The primary purpose of the final evaluation of EIG program was to assess its effectiveness to achieve sustainable impacts on beneficiaries especially with regard to employment and incomes and provide guidance to USAID in future program designs. &nbsp;The evaluation has focused on four components namely, literacy (Component 1 or C1), vocational (Component 2 or C2), agricultural productivity and enterprises (Component 3 or C3) and scholarship to Dalit (Component 4 or C4 ). &nbsp;This final evaluation has focused on all four components and has been framed in order to answer the six key evaluation questions namely: (1) how well the EIG approach increased disadvantaged youth's access to employment and incomes?; (2) how have literacy, numeracy and entrepreneurship skills enhanced women's empowerment and increased agricultural productivity?; (3) how relevant was vocational education program to the short, middle, and long-term development needs of Nepal?

"The purpose of the evaluation was to assess the Carter Center (TCC) project in Liberia, Access to Justice (ATJ) and Access to Information (ATI), from 2010 to mid-2013, and to capture lessons for potential future USAID programming. &nbsp;ATJ and ATI are two distinct projects under one USAID agreement. &nbsp;ATJ has roots back to 2006 in the customary justice sector, and absorbs 90% of the $6.75 million budget; while ATI is an early-stage project which supports implementation of the Freedom of Information (FOI) Act (passed in 2010), in partnership with ""pilot"" public sector institutions led by the Ministry of Information. &nbsp;The study took place between April 22 and May 31, 2013, and included field visits to Grand Bassa, Bong, and Montserrado counties in Liberia; and a meeting with staff of Carter Center headquarters in Atlanta. &nbsp;Sixty-five persons were interviewed individually or in groups, including public officials, traditional leaders, civil society, and TCC officers and field staff delivering paralegal or information services. &nbsp;A common finding to both ATJ and ATI is the high regard and respect held by respondents for the Carter Center for its exceptional personnel, its skill in working in the justice sector, and its talent playing the role of honest broker. &nbsp;This observation applies both to the highest levels of government and to citizens in rural communities. &nbsp;Despite its position in the hierarchy of aid as a service-delivery NGO, TCC is often - at least as regards customary justice - a strategic leader in Liberia's post- conflict recovery and development. &nbsp;In part, this is due to its long history of commitment to Liberia: President Carter visited in 1979, and programs have been ongoing since 1996. &nbsp;Despite sometimes having little money to bring to the table, it has been an able policy advocate which its high reputation helps reinforce. &nbsp;Finally, common to the two projects are the flaws in the Results Frameworks, which do not follow standard USAID terminology, do not always inform as to project results, and are sometimes confusing. &nbsp;(Excerpt, modified)","'Strengthening Citizen Participation in Government: Access to Justice and Information'|Evaluated project title: Access to justice (ATJ)|Evaluated project title: Access to information (ATI),|Project title: Liberia monitoring and evaluation program (L-MEP)","Special Evaluation","Documents","669-C-00-10-00181-00|AID-669-C-00-10-00181","","6/1/2013 12:00:00 AM","","","Liberia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PBAAA133.pdf","438 KB","008360 - Mitchell Group, Inc.","","008570 - USAID.

"This final performance evaluation of the Integrated Protected Areas Co-management (IPAC) Project focuses exclusively on the democracy and governance (DG) components of the project and assesses the effectiveness of these components in achieving the project's objectives. &nbsp;The evaluation is structured around ten evaluation questions and six DG project indicators relating to the enabling policy and legal framework; community participation and local organizations; capacity building; and communication and outreach. &nbsp;Additional evaluation questions addressed cross-cutting themes of gender and youth engagement; project coordination with stakeholders; project contributions to environmental governance; best practices; sustainable interventions; and project management. &nbsp;Data collection involved a review of project documents and supporting literature, semi-structured interviews with a wide range of stakeholders (from beneficiaries to Ministry staff), and visits to eight of the 25 protected areas in three of the project&lsquo;s five geographic clusters. &nbsp;Political disturbances made field work difficult to schedule, and it was not possible to interview all key stakeholders or make all planned field site visits. &nbsp;Overall, the evaluation concludes that IPAC has been a well-managed project that has done some high quality and well-documented work, met most of its DG targets, and contributed to its overall objectives in a very challenging context. &nbsp;IPAC can be particularly credited with what one observer called an ""unprecedented level of coordination"" with the three departments, helping them break out of their management silos and work together on biodiversity conservation issues. &nbsp;A national strategy and action plan for the PA system was developed and approved by the three departments. &nbsp;Many elements of the legal framework needed for PACM are now in place or in well-advanced preparation. &nbsp;Many stakeholders at all levels have received training on a variety of relevant topics. &nbsp;The co-managed PA system has now reached 25 sites involving 55 co-management organizations (CMOs) and nearly 1,000 participating village groups. &nbsp;(Excerpt, modified)","Footer title: Final performance evaluation of the integrated protected areas co-management (IPAC) project|Evaluated task order title: Integrated protected areas co-management (IPAC)|Evaluated project title: Prosperity, livelihoods and conserving ecosystems indefinite quantity contract (PLACE IQC)","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","AID-388-TO-12-00001|AID-OAA-I-10-00003","","9/1/2013 12:00:00 AM","","","Bangladesh","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PBAAA333.pdf","1,253 KB","011933 - Social Impact, Inc.","","008511 - USAID.

USAID/Peru has commissioned this evaluation to assess the effectiveness of the Parque Nacional Cordillera Azul (PNCAZ) project in achieving its objectives over the last 5 years. USAID/Peru is also interested in learning from the process and identifying factors that may have contributed to the project&rsquo;s success or failure. Thus, the evaluation responds to three main objectives: (1) to document the implementation process; (2) to learn to what extend the project&rsquo;s expected results have been achieved; and (3) to identify lessons learned from this experience that may be applicable to similar parks or projects. The evaluation's statement of work (SOW) established three evaluation questions that guide the analysis presented in this report: (1) was the Parque Nacional Cordillera Azul effectively protected; (2) has the project contributed to the long-term sustainability of the Park and its management; and (3) what are the key elements of this project that can be replicated in future initiatives to preserve biodiversity and avoid CO2 emissions.

"A midterm evaluation of the Control and Prevention of Three Diseases (CAP-3D) Project was undertaken in Burma, Laos, and Thailand and a final evaluation was undertaken in China in June and July 2013. &nbsp;The overarching strategy for this project is to increase the coverage, quality, and sustainability of a comprehensive package of for HIV prevention, care, and treatment services. &nbsp;A major area of emphasis is reducing dependence on external donor resources by strengthening local institutions and securing local government buy-in and diverse funding sources. &nbsp;To achieve this, PSI and its partners focus on the following objectives: (1) the scale up of the CPP model, shifting increasingly toward provision of technical assistance to local agencies for CPP implementation (IR1); (2) valuation and documentation of CPP models and use of strategic information (SI) to advocate for replication and leveraged funding (IR2); and (3) enabling local organizations to scale-up the CPP through provision of technical assistance and capacity building (IR3). &nbsp;The evaluation focused on answering &nbsp;five key questions: (1) to what extent have the approaches used for prevention, care and treatment for the most vulnerable populations achieved results to date; (2) what progress has been made toward ensuring sustainability of CAP-3D's approaches; (3) to what extent does the way that the CAP-3D project is organized, operates, and maintains relationships and communication with key stakeholders, establish an effective and sustainable approach; (4) looking at the HIV programs from a regional perspective, to what extent will CAP-3D be able to achieve critical results, at scale, in HIV prevention, treatment and care by the end of the project; and (5) to what extent are the strategic information activities serving to inform the planning, implementation and monitoring of the project. &nbsp;The evaluation concluded that overall CAP-3D represents an appropriate regional focus on prevention and HIV testing to ensure continuity and linkages throughout the comprehensive model of prevention, care and treatment. &nbsp;The project is appropriately focused among men-who-have-sex-with-men, transgendered women, and female sex workers. &nbsp;The added activities for people who inject drugs in China were also appropriate and in accordance to the local epidemiology. &nbsp;(Excerpts, modified)","Evaluated project title: Control and prevention of three diseases (CAP-3D)","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","10/1/2013 12:00:00 AM","","HIV/AIDS|Tuberculosis|Malaria|Disease prevention and control|Health care coverage|Access to services|Disease treatment|Local level|Men who have sex with men|Transgendered persons|Prostitution","Burma|Laos|Thailand|China","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00JJZ9.pdf","1,411 KB","","","011460 - USAID.

"The main goal of the USAID/Nicaragua supported Education for Success (EFS) project is to develop and implement an integrated program for at-risk children and youth in targeted municipalities in the Regi&oacute;n Aut&oacute;noma del Atl&aacute;ntico Sur (RAAS) that would provide opportunities for formal and non-formal education, life skills, and workforce competencies. &nbsp;Implemented by Fundacion para la Autonomia y Desarrollo de la Costa Atlantica de Nicaragua (FADCANIC), EFS was launched in 2010 as a seven-year, $6.7 million effort implemented initially in Bluefields, Pearl Lagoon, Kukra Hill and then later in Corn Island and Desembocadura del Rio Grande. &nbsp;In September 2013, USAID/Nicaragua requested that JBS International, Inc. conduct a mid-term evaluation of the EFS project. &nbsp;The purpose of the study was to examine the extent to which the program has contributed to advancing its stated goals. &nbsp;It was also designed to capture the lessons learned to date, help identify changes to be made in the second phase of project implementation, and identify obstacles constraining progress. &nbsp;In October 2013, a team of three researchers conducted a site visit of the EFS project which included numerous key informant interviews, semi-structured group interviews, and on-site observations. &nbsp;The results of the mid-term evaluation demonstrate that EFS has been successful in generating youth development opportunities in the RAAS. &nbsp;More specifically it has contributed to increased positive attitudes such as greater self-confidence in youth; transferable work readiness skills; and more engaged family and community members. &nbsp;As EFS begins its second phase, the evaluation team recommends FADCANIC increase its staff expertise in non-formal education strategies, gender-sensitive programming, and community development approaches. &nbsp;Certain improvements to FADCANIC's organizational, technical and management systems are also suggested in order to strengthen and ready the project's core staff as they move to the next stage. &nbsp;(Except, modified)","Submitted as: Mid-term evaluation final report of the education for success project|Evaluated project title: Education for success (EFS)","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","12/1/2013 12:00:00 AM","","Educational development|At-risk groups|Youth|Access to education|Labor force|Employment|Life skills","Nicaragua","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00JK6H.pdf","1,106 KB","013070 - JBS International, Inc.

"<div>The Opportunities for Vulnerable Children (OVC) program represents a unique and highly commendable effort made by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) to bring children with disabilities into Indonesia's mainstream education settings in a substantive manner. &nbsp;The program -- which only cost USD 9.3 million in 10 years or USD 930,000 a year on average -- contributed significantly to strengthening the Indonesian enabling educational environment for children with disabilities, in the following ways: (1) building substantial government bureaucratic and political support for inclusion of children with disabilities; (2) spearheading the development of national policies, such as recognition of ""resource teachers"" as a legitimate category of service, and 22 subnational policies that operationalized the national inclusive education policies; (3) helping stakeholders to lobby for and legitimize the development of budgets to support inclusive education, which will allow inclusive education initiatives to be funded post-OVC; and (4) changing parents' and community attitudes about the rights of children with disabilities to an education. &nbsp;The above was achieved by well-targeted use of short-term technical experts and ongoing engagement of very knowledgeable program personnel who understand how to work with and within the existing systems. &nbsp;However, without strategic and selective external technical support for deepening and broadening OVC accomplishments, full realization of OVC program benefits is at risk. &nbsp;There is also a risk that inclusive education will remain synonymous with special education, rather than special education falling under the umbrella of a functional inclusive education system. &nbsp;USAID's Education Strategy Goal 1 will ensure that 150 million children worldwide become readers in the early grades; however, most early grade reading assessments have not taken children with disabilities into account in testing protocols, data disaggregation, or ensuing programming. &nbsp;If USAID is able to act on the opportunity for disability-sensitive programming that the OVC program introduced, Indonesia can provide a valuable model on which to build in order to bring children with disabilities into this broader group of 150 million children. &nbsp;Failure of the government and donor community to further to deepen and extend OVC program achievements would be a significant and regrettable ""missed opportunity."" &nbsp;(Excerpt, modified)</div>","Evaluated project title: Opportunities for vulnerable children (OVC)","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","AID-497-TO-13-00003|RAN-I-00-09-00008-00","","12/1/2013 12:00:00 AM","","","Indonesia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00JM2M.pdf","1,901 KB","040773 - GRM International|006007 - AMEX International, Inc.","","008558 - USAID.

"<p>The Support for International Family Planning Organizations (SIFPO) mission is to increase the use of Family Planning (FP) services globally through strengthening selected international FP organizations and an extensive, multi-country network of FP clinics, in order to achieve maximum program impact and synergies.&nbsp; The current project is working toward the following four results areas: (1) strengthened organizational capacity to deliver quality FP services to target groups; (2) internal quality assurance standards and results quantified and disseminated to strengthen FP performance at a global level; (3) increased organizational sustainability of country-level programs, including internal south-to-south support and technical assistance; and (4) gender-sensitive FP services targeting youth strengthened at a global level.&nbsp; A special focus of the SIFPO projects has been on capacity building and systems strengthening to build upon and leverage the organization's extensive network of country programs that are often funded by other donors.&nbsp; The mid-term evaluation presented here is an examination of Marie Stopes International's (MSI's) internal system and structures and the impact SIFPO has had upon them.&nbsp; It also examines MSI's relations with SIFPO partners and the joint activities they have undertaken.&nbsp; The evaluation questions include but are not limited to: (1) what evidence exists that core resources invested in organizational strengthening have improved country-level platforms and programming; (2) what has been the effect on organizational capacity; (3) is there evidence that there is increased sustainability; (4) how have management practices within the organization been affected; (5) is there evidence that the internal quality assurance standards have been disseminated to strengthen FP service delivery and performance at a global level; and (6) to what extent is the MSI project's portfolio of service delivery activities meeting the needs of stakeholders?&nbsp; Specific evaluation findings, conclusions and recommendations are provided with detailed analysis for each evaluation question.&nbsp; (Excerpt, modified)</p>","Evaluated project title: Support to international family planning organizations : Marie Stopes International (SIFPO/MSI)","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID-OAA-C-13-00032","","8/1/2013 12:00:00 AM","","","Ghana|Madagascar","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00JQ1X.pdf","1,325 KB","011492 - Development & Training Services, Inc.

"The Alternative Resources in Media (ARM) is a $4 million, four-year program now entering the second half of its period of implementation.&nbsp; The program has three objectives: (1) supporting production and dissemination of alternative content through multiple high and low tech platforms; (2) building consumer demand for news and information by promoting media literacy, critical analysis, and use of latest web and mobile-based media applications; and (3) encouraging public advocacy on media-related issues.&nbsp; The broader goal, as stated by USAID, is to assist citizens to transform themselves from passive users to active information producers in an otherwise controlled media environment.&nbsp; The evaluation addresses a set of five questions focused on identifying what changes should be made in the approaches and directions of the current program, and what recommendations can be made for the design of future media programs.&nbsp; The questions, as stated in the evaluation statement of work (SOW) are: (1) how relevant has the ARM project intervention been to the media field challenges in Armenia; (2) to what extent has the project contributed to creating opportunities for&nbsp;a diversity of alternative sources of information and opinion,&nbsp;increased access to alternative sources of information and opinion, and advocacy for improved enabling environment for media independence; (3) what has the project done or mechanisms has it created to ensure that the project products will be sustained; (4) what have been the added value and/or drawbacks of the project management structure (consortium of three local organizations with an unaffiliated Chief of Party); and (5) how successful has the project been in leveraging resources of (a) the skills and organizational strengths of the consortium members, and (b) private and other donor partnerships?&nbsp; In the remaining project period, it is generally recommended that the ARM project look for ways to be more selective in the activities it supports, giving more focus and resources to those that are most relevant and effective.&nbsp; Specifically, it is recommended that ARM: (1) establish additional Infotuns (regional information centers);&nbsp; (2) take initiatives to support the use of new media tools to promote democratic processes and principles in the February 2013 presidential election -- in cooperation with national and international election monitoring groups, ARM should use its experience and knowledge of new media in projects to help inform citizens about issues, candidates, interest groups, and proper election process, and to assist journalists, monitors, and voters to observe and to report and correct irregularities in campaigning, balloting, and vote counting; (3) be even more creative and proactive in efforts to promote media literacy and educate the Armenian public about the new media environment and how to understand and use the new knowledge that it makes available; (4) make additional grants to assist traditional media making the transition to multimedia news coverage; (5) initiate exploratory discussions on the changing media market with media managers (editorial and business), advertisers and ad agencies, rating companies, and other relevant stakeholders to collect data and ideas on how media will have to adapt to the new environment, and develop concepts for future projects to assist in that process.&nbsp; (Excerpt, modified)","Evaluated project title: Alternative resources in media (ARM)","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID-111-TO-12-00002|AID-RAN-I-00-09-00019|RAN-I-00-09-00019-00","","1/1/2013 12:00:00 AM","","","Armenia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00JR2Q.pdf","529 KB","011933 - Social Impact, Inc.","","008509 - USAID.

"Pakistan's generally low investment in education, and specifically higher education, has severely affected the financial health of Pakistan's universities. &nbsp;In fiscal year (FY) 2007-08, the Government of Pakistan (GOP) cut the Higher Education Commission's (HEC) budget for recurring grants to universities by 21 percent. &nbsp;Also, since FY 2008-09, the GOP has consistently released less money than budgeted for development grants, which support scholarships, infrastructure (e.g., buildings, laboratory equipment) and other development projects, and pay the salaries of development project staff, all of which are crucial to strengthening the ability of Pakistan's universities to meet future needs. &nbsp;In moves that further aggravated the weak financial situation of universities, in FY 2008-09 the GOP mandated 20 percent increases in government employees' salaries (including those of university staff), but did not increase funding levels to cover these increases. &nbsp;In the same year, the GOP waived tuition and fees for 7,354 internally displaced students without increasing funding to the affected universities to cover the lost tuition revenue. &nbsp;USAID responded to the problems posed by these financial cuts to universities by providing two separate cash transfers to HEC. &nbsp;The overall objective of the First Cash Transfer was to expand the availability of university and technical education to students from conflict-affected areas. &nbsp;The transfer was intended to contribute to the ""Investing in People"" objective under the U.S. Foreign Assistance Framework, especially in the areas of higher education and social assistance. &nbsp;The Second Cash Transfer was intended to ""Increase research capacity, improve teaching techniques and laboratory facilities, and enhance the quality and applicability of academic degrees in academic disciplines related to agricultural sciences and hydrology."" It also supported other disciplines which support these sectors including environmental sciences, engineering and economics. &nbsp;The purpose of this evaluation is to determine whether the two cash transfers have achieved expected results. The evaluation should facilitate stakeholder accountability, assess project performance (e.g. effectiveness and relevance), and generate recommendations for improving future cash transfer programs and other programming to support higher education.

"The Nicaragua Media Program (NMP) was implemented during the period of July 12, 2010-July 12, 2013 by FHI 360. &nbsp;NMP was a cross-cutting program that sought to strengthen the viability of independent media in Nicaragua while improving its ability to produce and disseminate quality information supporting USAID development programs. &nbsp;NMP assisted media outlets in 12 cities and two autonomous regions where other USAID development programs are being implemented. &nbsp;The program's objective was to help independent media outlets improve their content and production quality. &nbsp;Support involved providing grants, each ranging from $10,000 to $15,000, to media outlets and non-governmental organizations (NGOs). &nbsp;NMP sought to advance U.S. interests and universal democratic and human rights through public diplomacy and support for independent media. &nbsp;The program reinforced the mission's goals of: (1) empowering NGOs; (2) promoting economic growth, with equity to private sector-led growth and market-led agriculture; (3) implementing the Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR); (4) supporting at-risk youth; (5) preventing school drop-out; promoting reading to children; and (6) supporting democratic governance and citizen participation. &nbsp;NMP was integral to USAID/Nicaragua's Strategic Objective 1 of Ruling Justly: More Responsive, Transparent Governance. &nbsp;The evaluation of NMP was conducted during the period of July-August 2013, by a team assembled by Mendez, England &amp; Associates (ME&amp;A). &nbsp;The evaluation team consisted of two experts -- one international and one local -- both with experience in the media sector. &nbsp;The main objective of the evaluation was to provide an objective review of NMP in strengthening the viability of independent media in Nicaragua while also improving its ability to produce and disseminate quality information supporting USAID development programs. &nbsp;An integral part of the evaluation mission was to answer a set of pre-determined questions. &nbsp;The findings and conclusions reached will be used to help USAID/Nicaragua make management decisions in a changing political environment and whether, when, and how to continue future support to the Nicaraguan media sector. &nbsp;(Excerpt, modified)","'Prepared under RFTOP No. SOL-524-13-000004'|Translated title provided by submitter|Submitted as: Nicaragua media program final performance evaluation report|Evaluated project title: Nicaragua media program (NMP)","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","9/1/2013 12:00:00 AM","","","Nicaragua","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00JR44.pdf","725 KB","008414 - Mendez England and Associates","","008584 - USAID.

"This is an evaluation of the performance and lessons from the Program for Appropriate Technology in Health's (PATH) implementation of the TB TO 2015 Program since 2009. &nbsp;The main objectives were to determine if USAID-supported interventions increased TB case notification and successful treatment in the targeted areas. &nbsp;The purpose was to evaluate project performance with special attention to advocacy, communication, and social mobilization (ACSM) activities and to formulate recommendations to USAID for future TB projects. &nbsp;The report is based on: (1) review of planning documents and reports from USAID, PATH, national programs, and other sources; (2) interviews with staff and partners; and (3) observations from site visits in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. &nbsp;The main questions the evaluation was to answer were: (1) whether TB TO 2015 is on track to meet the expected results; (2) the extent to which the project was effective in achieving objectives; (3) factors for success and shortcomings; and (4) which priorities and steps USAID should consider in future projects to support TB control. &nbsp;The evaluation found that, in general, implementation of the project was considered on track, though there were varying delays in some countries. &nbsp;Weaknesses mentioned in interviews were: (1) insufficient interaction of USAID with national programs before preparing the plan of action to harmonize USAID project priorities with the National Tuberculosis Program (NTP) perceived needs; (2) short-term financing that interfered with recruitment; and (3) insufficient communication with consortium partners about progress in country support. &nbsp;USAID and PATH staff interviewed both expressed concern about delays in launching activities, mostly because multiple layers of approval were required from national and international agencies. &nbsp;Field observation in Tanzania showed the excellent collaboration with national staff at all levels and with community organizations, and the consistency of laboratory and patient records with data in the reports. &nbsp;In conclusion, the TB TO 2015 Project seems to be on track to achieve its operational objectives in terms of all the key components listed, and it also seems to be a very good investment of USAID support that will have lasting impact on TB control globally as well as in some of the countries involved. &nbsp;It is too early to assess the epidemiologic objective of reducing TB prevalence and burden of disease; and the strategies used as models (the Stop TB Strategy and MDR-TB Global Response Plan 2007&ndash;08) do not prioritize interruption of transmission (screening suspects with microscopy, IPC, control of contacts) or prevention of MDR-TB, concentrating instead on patient management. &nbsp;ACSM has been successfully used to support TA and to build national capacity. &nbsp;Technical assistance quality was good, and coordination with and support to the NTPs were in general excellent. &nbsp;(Excerpt, modified)","'Evaluation of the Activities, Operational Results, and Impact of USAID Support to TB Control through Task Order 2015 from 2009 to 2013 and Lessons Learned'|Project title: Global health technical assistance project bridge IV (GH Tech IV)","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID-OAA-C-13-00113","","11/1/2013 12:00:00 AM","","Tuberculosis|Disease treatment|Disease prevention and control|Community mobilization|Advocacy|Communication channels|Multidrug-resistant/extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR/XDR-TB)|Health care systems|Human capacity development","Tanzania","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00JR8J.pdf","609 KB","011492 - Development & Training Services, Inc.

"<p>The USAID-funded Sudan Transition and Conflict Mitigation (STCM) program aimed to establish and manage a quick-response mechanism that would strengthen Sudanese confidence and capacity to address the causes and consequences of political conflict, violence, and instability.&nbsp; Expectations were that the STCM program would reduce the effects and causes of instability in the rapidly shifting environment of Sudan, particularly in the north-south border/transitional areas, the Three Areas (Abyei, Blue Nile, and Southern Kordofan), during the lead up to the southern secession referendum in January 2011 and potential independence of South Sudan in July.&nbsp; Post-secession expectations were that the program would further mitigate tension in the border areas, as well as Darfur and Khartoum.&nbsp;&nbsp; Although STCM is mentioned throughout the report as a 'program' it is better understood as a specialized tactical tool to provide strategically targeted support to transition and conflict mitigation activities.&nbsp; The independent performance evaluation of STCM will assist USAID/Sudan in determining: (1) the effectiveness and appropriateness of the overall approach to conflict mitigation programming and choice of funding mechanism; (2) the degree to which the implementing partner ensured a timely and cost-effective response to emerging needs in providing peace dividends, promoting community-level reconciliation, and strengthening local capacity for conflict mitigation; and (3) lessons learned that may guide the future of USAID/Sudan's conflict mitigation programming in Sudan.&nbsp; Specific evaluation findings, conclusions and recommendations are provided with detailed analysis for each evaluation question.&nbsp; (Excerpt, modified)</p>","Evaluated project title: Sudan transition and conflict mitigation (STCM)","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","AID-667-TO-13-00001|AID-RAN-I-00-09-00016|RAN-I-00-09-00016-00","","10/1/2013 12:00:00 AM","","","Sudan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00JS5Q.pdf","927 KB","001891 - International Business and Technical Consultants, Inc.

"<p>In June 2013, USAID commissioned the final external performance evaluation of the Reproductive Maternal Newborn Child Health /Health Systems Strengthening (RMNCH/HSS) program in Cambodia, consisting of two primary components.&nbsp; The first component is a final performance evaluation of the main RMNCH and HSS projects: 1) maternal and child health program; 2) together for good health, and 3) better health services.&nbsp; The purpose of the first component was three-fold: (1) Conduct a final performance evaluation of the RMNCH and HSS projects; (2) review capacity of local partners to manage for results and technically direct USAID programs in the field and at national level; and (3) capture lessons learned and provide recommendations that will refine mission investments in key activities that will be carried forward for the next five years.&nbsp; The second component, a more detailed assessment of USAID's family planning activities, is included as part of this final performance evaluation.&nbsp; The purpose of the second component was to evaluate whether family planning goals and objectives were met by each project by: (1) identifying strengths and weaknesses of the various USAID-funded family planning intervention in Cambodia and identify gaps and missed opportunities that need to be addressed in future USAID-supported family planning projects; and (2) identifying lessons learned and best practices that should be prioritized for scale-up to contribute to reaching the Royal Government of Cambodia's (RGC) family planning goals.&nbsp; The evaluation team&nbsp;concluded with confidence that the USAID health program goals for 2013 have been achieved.&nbsp; Given the intensive and widespread support for interventions directly targeting those goals, the contribution of the USAID program and its projects towards the achievement of the program goals has been significant. &nbsp;Several recommendations have been acted upon by USAID and the implementing partners.&nbsp; Collaboration amongst partners has markedly improved.&nbsp; Project monitoring and survey systems have further improved.&nbsp; Some less active Reproductive Health Association of Cambodia (RHAC) clinics in rural areas were closed. &nbsp;And to some extent, competency, qualifications issues and program knowledge of provincial and field staff have been addressed.&nbsp; (Excerpt, modified)</p>","Evaluated project title: Maternal and child health program|Evaluated project title: Together for good health|Evaluated project title: Better health services","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","7/1/2013 12:00:00 AM","","","Cambodia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00JTWK.pdf","2,061 KB","","","008523 - USAID.

"<p>The Strengthening Political Parties, Electoral and Legislative Processes (SPPELP) project operates on the hypotheses that: (1) strong electoral institutions and processes are fundamental to an inclusive, stable and lasting democracy in Nepal; (2) if parties were more representative and able to implement effective competitive electoral campaigns and the population had access to better information of policy differences, the political parties can better contribute to the democratic process in Nepal; (3) more comprehensive election monitoring and better informed media to cover election related issues will enable civil society initiatives to more effectively contribute to transparent electoral processes; and (4) more effective reviews and deliberation of bills of the Constituent Assembly (CA) incorporating input from constituents will make the the legislative process more transparent and will help the CA more effectively fulfill its democratic functions.&nbsp; With the SPPELP, USAID thereby tried to address: (1) what was perceived as weaknesses of the young Nepali democracy; (2)&nbsp; the capacity of political parties to run party organizations and to participate in competitive electoral campaigns; (3)&nbsp; the capacity of civil society to have better oversight of the political process; and (3) the institutional capacity of the CA and the Election Commission, Nepal (ECN).&nbsp; The summary of key evaluation questions are: (1) given two-and-half years of the program, do the objectives of the project remain relevant to Nepal's political development [and] are there new challenges which are not addressed by the program [and] what adjustments to the program are recommended; (2) to what extent is the project on track to reach its intermediate results and overall goals; (3) how effective is the program in engaging women, youth, Dalits, and other marginalized groups to contribute to development of national politics; (4) how effective is the relationship between the Consortium of Elections and Political Processes Strengthening (CEPPS) partners and key stakeholders?&nbsp; The evaluation showed that the SPPELP project is still on track to reach its goal even with the challenges that the political situation in Nepal has provided.&nbsp; (Excerpt, modified)</p>","'Solicitation Number: SOL-367-13-000007'|Evaluated project title: Nepal’s strengthening political parties, electoral and legislative processes (SPPELP)","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","12/1/2013 12:00:00 AM","","Political parties|Political participation|Elections|Electoral systems|Laws and legislation|Democratization|Youth|Women|Public awareness|Transparency|Accountability","Nepal","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00JZTD.pdf","1,484 KB","040828 - Organization Development Centre Inc.
