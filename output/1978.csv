"Evaluates project to provide loans for agricultural inputs to Tanzanian smallholders.  Special evaluation covers the period 1974/75-3/78 and is based on reports by the implementing agency, the Tanzanian Rural Development Bank (TRDB), and a survey of farmers in Mbulu District. The survey of 78 borrowers and non-borrowers in six loan and six non-loan villages revealed that the Small Farmer Food Crop Loan Program (SFFCLP), while serving its target group (i.e., farmers with less than 20 ha), was not really meeting the needs of the poor, given an average Tanzanian farm size of 1.25 ha.  Since participation in the SFFCLP depended on village initiative, it was not surprising that loan villages were found to be older, established, registered villages; had prior experience in obtaining loans; were proximate to the administrative center of Karatu and thus had greater access to information and government officials; and produced and sold surplus output, usually wheat.  There was a clear tendency for loans to go to those with larger holdings (5-10 versus 3 acres), greater access to modern inputs and techniques, and above average income.  Neither the level of farmer education and nor farmer contact with extensionists proved relevant. Although slightly higher than in other Tanzanian loan programs, the 83% repayment rate (ranging from 42-100% in different villages) was short of the 90% rate required for SFFCLP viabilty given the TRDB's 9% interest rate. Although loan payments were to be deducted from village crop sales, many farmers avoided this by finding other sales outlets or by using their loans for non-production activities from the start. Moreover, many farmers, used to lax loan administration and repayment, felt obliged to retaliate against perceived TRDB intransigence and injustice. The SFFCLP is also plagued by other administrative problems: widespread ignorance of the program, infrequent field visits by supervisors, insufficient manpower to monitor farmers' use of project inputs, and reliance on ad hoc loan administration at the village level. The evaluators thus conclude that the SFFCLP cannot be justified on the basis of serving the very poor, raising wheat yield, or providing farmers with otherwise unobtainable inputs.","Evaluation period: Jan 1974-Mar 1978","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID-T-621-78-08","","4/1/1978 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural credit|Agricultural inputs|Agricultural production credit|Financial management|Credit|Small farms|Farmers|Agricultural production|Agricultural development banks|wheat|Agricultural extension|Agricultural management|farm income|Villages|Change agents|Community development|Beneficiary interviews|Sampling method","Tanzania","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAJ438.pdf","1,398 KB","008612 - USAID.

"Evaluates pilot on-farm water management (OFWM) project in Pakistan. Special evaluation by a U.S./Pakistani team covers a period from project inception in late 1976 to 3/78 and is based on field visits, discussions with project personnel, and interviews with farmers. Although the project is about a year behind schedule due to various training and financial difficulties noted below, sound procedures have been established for helping small farmers to improve their water courses and to level land for more efficient irrigation.  To date, 14 field teams were working in the Sind, Punjab, and Northwest Frontier Provinces; 25 water courses were improved (24 in Punjab), and 2,826 ha of land (1,863 in Punjab) had undergone precision leveling. Recommendations include establising a permanent, possibly semi-autonomous, institution to implement the project now and after project termination and according legal and permanent status to Water User Associations (WUA) as a key to long-term improved irrigation efficiency and increased crop production.  Also, a new agency should be created for extension and related farmer services. Also recommended are substituting lowered academic standards combined with additional training and experience for the present rigid qualifications for recruiting field personnel, as well as increasing slightly the number of trainees to compensate for dropouts.  To improve trainee recruitment and retention, personnel should be regularized promptly to provide needed job security. District personnel and team leaders should be authorized to approve estimates of water course improvements and to make cost-sharing payments to farmers, and funds should be made to project directors on time.  To encourage provinces to give priority to the project, a direct link is recommended between dollars released and rupee funds allocated to provinces.  Also recommended are a pilot farmer credit program in each province and increased bank credit to private contractors. Included among other recommendations are to:  define Pakistani small farmers more clearly; consider providing cost-sharing and land leveling services to tenant farmers, especially in the Sind; and replacing the hard-to-get patwari certification with a statement signed by farmers.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","5/1/1978 12:00:00 AM","","Water management|Irrigation|Appropriate technology|Rural areas|Small farms|Farmers|Irrigated farming|Beneficiary interviews","Pakistan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAJ583.pdf","2,284 KB","008588 - USAID.

"Evaluates technical assistance component of a project to upgrade the capability of the Government of Ivory Coast's (GOIC) Ministry of Public Works, Transport, Construction, and Town Planning (MTPTCU). Evaluation covers the period 6/76-6/78 and is based on site visits, a review of project documents, and interviews with USAID/IC, GOIC, and project personnel. Within the guidance provided by GOIC, the six technical assistants (TA) -- one in the MTPTCU's major projects division, one in SETU (Societe d'Equipement des Terrains Urbains), and two each in the MTPTCU construction division and land title/purchasing division -- have generally fulfilled their duties in such areas as: coordinating subcontractors; inspecting equipment and supplies; designing schools, health centers, and play grounds; supervising construction; developing and implementing competitive bidding procedures; and assisting in data collection, processing, and management. However, the GOIC's failure to assign counterparts (CP) in a timely manner and the failure of the TA's to insist that they be assigned CP's have led to a shortfall in CP training.  In addition, the conflicting policies of different GOIC agencies have hampered TA effectiveness, a situation which the Project Coordinator (PC) has been unable to ameliorate due to his many other non-project responsibilities.  Further, the MTPTCU professional training project in which three TA's were to have been instructors has not yet been implemented. Project deficiencies, to the extent that they reflect a GOIC policy posture, were deemed beyond the scope of this evaluation. It is, however, recommended that: (1) the PC exert stronger leadership in order to achieve those project goals requiring significant innovations in GOIC and public sector policy and behavior; (2) the contracts of the TA town planner in the MTPTCU major projects division and the data processor at the land title/purchasing division be extended 1 year; and (3) TA's spend more time with departmental staffs in order to expand staff perception of overall departmental roles.","Attached to PD-AAJ-022|Evaluation period: Jun 1976-Jun 1978|In: Ivory Coast urban development project, mid-project evaluation","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","11/1/1978 12:00:00 AM","","Contract management|Educational facilities|Building construction|Urban development|Clinics|Management information systems|Indigenous education|Institution building|Financial management|Economic planning|Fiscal policy|Urban areas|Housing|Housing investment guaranty|Housing planning|Housing policy|Transportation planning|Transportation policy|Urban renewal|Slum areas|Low cost housing","Ivory Coast","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAJ022A.pdf","508 KB","008562 - USAID.

"Evaluates technical assistance component of a project to upgrade the National Savings & Loan Bank of the Ivory Coast (BNEC). Evaluation covers the period 6/76-6/78 and is based on site visits, a review of project documents, and interviews with USAID/IC, project, and Government of Ivory Coast officials. Overall, the technical assistants (TA's) have performed their tasks competently and effectively.  However, assistance was limited almost exclusively to BNEC's activities as a manager of government resources; little attention was given to BNEC's banking activities.  Furthermore, counterpart (CP) training, a major project objective, did not proceed on schedule due to the BNEC Director General's (DG) lack of commitment; the lack of a clearly defined training program for each TA and his CP; and in some cases, poorly designated, motivated, or qualified CP's. Although the TA assigned to the Financial Department has made a valuable contribution, he is doing so without CP training; his time was primarily occupied by tasks delegated by the DG (e.g., planning BNEC's current and future financial needs); and his capability has been stretched by assigning him the responsibilities of the Savings Department TA.  It is recommended that a separate TA be assigned to the Savings Department to design and implement a savings mobilization campaign and a lending program and also to decrease the work load of the Fiancial Department TA. The BNEC Technical Department (TD) has had three TA's over the life of the project, although the incumbent serves without A.I.D.'s concurrence.  The first two TA's made positive contributions to the definition and execution of technical staff tasks but slowdowns occurred as each new TA began work. Because the TA for the Credit Department was assigned only in 1/78, it is too early to evaluate his work. Thus, to improve CP training it is recommended that all BNEC Departments better define TA and CP responsibilities; establish a program to shift responsibilities from TA's to CP's; and regularly evaluate TA and CP performance.","Attached to PD-AAJ-022|Evaluation period: Jun 1976-Jun 1978|In: Ivory Coast urban development project, mid-project evaluation","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","6/1/1978 12:00:00 AM","","Credit|Indigenous education|Institution building|Financial management|Economic planning|Fiscal policy|Savings and loan associations|Banks|Urban areas|Housing|Housing investment guaranty|Housing planning|Housing policy|Transportation planning|Transportation policy|Urban renewal|Urban development|Slum areas|Low cost housing|Limited data plus","Ivory Coast","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAJ022B.pdf","363 KB","003241 - USAID.

"Evaluates economic aspects of colonization project in Bolivia's San Julian and Chane-Pirai areas.  Evaluation covers an unspecified period ending 11/78 and is based on document review and interviews with officials of Bolivia's Banco Agricola (BAB) and Instituto Nacional de Colonizacion (INC) and with colonists and technicians in the areas. A total of 1,392 families have been settled in San Julian, compared to a target of 4,000; some 800 will be settled in the next year.  In Chane-Pirai, 7,000 families (118% of target) have been settled; when access roads and trails are complete Chane-Pirai will encompass about 1,000 more families.  An orientation program provides new settlers with instruction in nutrition, cooperativism, sanitation, construction, and farming. Construction of a 77 km access road in the San Julian area is 68% complete and a 100 km access road in the Chane-Pirai area is 60% complete; dry weather access trails to small Chane-Pirai settlements are also being constructed.  Work on Agricultural Service Centers in San Julian and Chane-Pirai is about 20% and 35% complete, respectively. Only 16% of a planned 200 wells have been constructed. The availability of credit for agricultural production constitutes a major problem.  Only about 25% of the allotted monies have been loaned due primarily to strict BAB credit regulations and a very high default rate; the latter resulted from the low cost of corn and delays in distributing loans. Also, only a small part of the planned technical assistance in land surveying and preparation has been provided, a planne land resource study has not been completed, and colonists have not been given land titles as planned. It is recommended that: (1) BAB allow San Julian farmers to receive medium- and long-term loans; (2) loans in both settlements be closely monitored; (3) costs and delays in providing credit be reduced; and (4) A.I.D. subsidization of low-interest loans be considered.  The following means of helping farmers should also be reviewed:  allowing INC intervention in marketing; promoting production of soybeans and possibly of wheat, dairy products, cacao, and oranges; and encouraging the use of animal traction.","'Agricultural Economist Report'","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","11/1/1978 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural land settlement|Land development|Agricultural production credit|Agricultural development|Development strategies|Agricultural production|Penetration roads|Road construction|Farmers|Agricultural inputs|Small farms|Beneficiary count|Beneficiary interviews","Bolivia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAJ812.pdf","930 KB","008515 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to establish the Acacia albida tree in Chad to increase agricultural production and promote firewood cultivation. Special evaluation covers the period 7/76-4/78 and is based on document review; field visits; and interviews with CARE, Peace Corps, USAID/C, and other project personnel, and participating farmers. The project is an outstanding success in terms of progress toward achieving outputs and is in fact ahead of schedule in all areas except live fencing.  This is in part due to farmers' unfamiliarity with the concept of live fencing and is not a great problem since the available species has not proven completely satisfactory.  Output levels attained thus far include: 350,500 acacia trees versus a planned total of 350,000 planted on 2,000 ha, with 178,000 surviving; 45,000 of a planned 122,500 m of Commiphora tree fencing planted; 63,000 trees planted (52,500 still living) as windbreaks and for firewood; and nine nurseries established. A field manual and a series of films have also been prepared.  Now that targets have been achieved, more attention should be given to increasing the survival rate and protection of the trees. Approximately 3,000 farmers versus an expected 1,850 are participating in the project.  Virtually all have received some P.L. 480 and CARE foodstuffs, and some have also been provided tools.  However, these ""incentives"" have not been given in such a way as to encourage cooperation and performance, indicating a need to revise the food for work system. Among the technical issues addressed by the evaluators were the durability of the plastic pots and bags in which the nurseries plant the trees; the advantages of seed planting over stock planting; the trees' impact on the water table; the possibility of using vegetatitive reproduction of acacia; methods of rainwater harvesting; tree growth rates; choice of species for live fencing; and damage from elephants and caterpillars. A series of 20 recommendations are made for improving the project regarding the types and numbers of trees still to be planted, planting techniques, development of educational materials, and improved communication among project personnel.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","4/1/1978 12:00:00 AM","","Acacia albida trees|Reforestation","Chad","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAJ854.pdf","2,075 KB","000390 - Consultants in Development","","007518 - CARE International","English","application/pdf","Indepth evaluation|Onsite evaluation|Evaluation team","","Weber, Fred R.|Dulansey, Maryanne","","Apr 1978","","","","Chad reforestation project; midpoint evaluation","","PD-AAJ-854","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTUzOTI2","Central African Republic","6770008"
"Evaluates project to improve the multiple-use planning and management of natural resources (NR) in arid/semi-arid regions.  Evaluation covers the period 6/74-3/78 and is based on interviews with personnel from the University of Arizona (UOA), the contractor. UOA has achieved in 4 years the outputs planned for 5 years. Informational outputs include expanding the computer-based Arid Lands Information System (ALIS) to include more LDC data; developing a roster of NR experts (a task slowed by the need to verify names); publishing an international newsletter on NR in arid lands and state-of-the-art reports on appropriate technology, desertification, technology application in LDC's, and groundwater development. To keep its graduate programs responsive to LDC needs, UOA has established a new minerals economics program and conducted weekly seminars on a variety of topics.  Foreign workshops have also been conducted, and a number of research projects initiated. UOA has made a strong effort to involve faculty and students from a variety of disciplines in activities in the arid/semi-arid regions of Ghana, Niger, Peru, and Mexico, and has expanded its capability for providing technical advice -- a capability which, unfortunately, has been underutilized. UOA has pursued linkages with domestic and international organizations, and has made both informal exchanges and formal agreements with LDC's for joint research, training, and possible faculty exchange. UOA's emphasis on involving faculty and students in LDC field activities led to some problems in Niger, where the government expected UOA to provide manpower to act as government extension personnel, a role UOA did not envision for itself.  To maintain the friendly relations between the two parties, a realistic work program which UOA could accomplish during the fifth year of the grant was designed. For recommendations, see the attached PES facesheet (PD-AAG-881).","Attached to PD-AAG-881|Evaluation period: Jun 1974-Mar 1978","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","3/1/1978 12:00:00 AM","","Universities and colleges|faculty|International cooperation|Educational networking|Arid soils|Appropriate technology|Management information systems|Technological development|Graduate education|Mineral resources|groundwater|Environmental research|Natural resource management|Technical assistance","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAG881A.pdf","956 KB","001219 - University of Arizona","","","English","application/pdf","Evaluation team|Indepth evaluation","","","Natural resources management","3 Mar 1978","","","","Multiple - use planning and management of natural resources of arid/semi-arid developing nations; University of Arizona 211(d) fourth year review","","XD-AAG-881-A","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTU0MDE5","Technical Assistance","9310159"

"This is the final of 17 reports produced in the two areas of cost analysis/projections and the out-of-school television (OSTV) segment of Ivory Coast instructional television broadcasting. In 1971 the Ivory Coast Government began intructional television broadcasts in a program designed to greatly improve the quality and relevance of the educational system, mainly at the primary school level. LDC educational administrators and planners have been eager to learn about costs, impact, effectiveness, benefits and problems related to the harnessing of the mass media for national development purposes. Since 1972, USAID has been involved with evaluation efforts of this project. From 1975 to 1978 an extensive evaluation has been done on systems costs and the organization and impact of rural adult education. This present report is a part of the effort. It is divided into four sections. Chapter One gives an introduction to the OSTV project after its first five years of existence. It describes the main elements of the in-school reform, outlines the progression of OSTV objectives, gives examples of the subject matter covered in broadcasts and demonstrates the range of ministries and development agencies which have co-sponsored programs. Chapter Two presents a ""social impact model,"" based on a series of reports on the OSTV program. The social and educational impact of the program are analyzed for effort, effect, adequacy, efficiency, and process.  Chapter Three summarizes each of the economic studies performed under the contract. Cost studies are presented for primary schooling, secondary education and out-of-school education. Chapter Four pursues the analysis of the first chapters to a series of recommendations for action in both the cost and the OSTV fields.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","AID/afr-C-1158","","1/1/1978 12:00:00 AM","","Cost benefit analysis|Educational materials|Television|Educational economics|Communications technology|Economic studies|Nonformal education","Ivory Coast","","","000223 - Academy for Educational Development, Inc.

"Evaluates Phase II of regional Maternal Child Health Extension project in Benin and the Gambia during the period 6/76-6/78. Purpose of Phase II was to replicate successful Phase I activities in at least two other areas.  Team reviewed all AID/W and field documents; met with Ministry of Health (MOH) personnel; & conducted onsite observ & disc w/US, Gambian, & Benineise proj technicians.  In both countries, utilization of MCH services has been good, although FP services were less well accepted. Programs have been established at Kuntaur, Kerewan, & the Royal Victoria Hospital in the Gambia.  At pilot site trng center for community health nurses, the first 15 grads have been posted; current students enthusiastic about nutrition, public health, nursing skills, & other areas of study.  Host country not fully prepared to take on full academic, functional, & financial responsibilities of trng ctrs. Advanced MCH/FP trng is needed for admin-level physicians, & mgmt/health admin trng is needed for key MOH personnel.  Methods of completing & storing standardized medical records are inadequate for the volume of Gambian patients.  Data is collected successfully but must be hand-tabulated once it reaches MOH.  Roads & transport are deficient & there is a lack of supplies due to dependence on govt purchase & other donor input. health & malnutritn, although somewhat simple, reached intended audience.  12-month extension of activities recommended. In Benin, ten ctrs are operating well in all aspects.  Host country appears ready to accept full responsibility for continuing project activities.  An effective sys of record keeping was established, & will be implemented shortly to serve output of data collection analysis. Transport, communic, & supply sys operating effectively.  Programs on envir health & malnutrtn using sophisticated A-V methods in conjunction with lectures, group exercises, & discussions were well received & reached projected populations.  Scheduled phase-out of activities recommended.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/pha-C-1100|AID/ta-C-1320","","6/1/1978 12:00:00 AM","","Family planning education|Medical education|FAMILY PLANNING|Rural areas|Health care|Nurse midwives|Health education|Training centers|Clinics|Health research|Data collection|Nurses|Assistants|Paramedical education|Limited data plus","Gambia|Benin","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAM072.pdf","1,511 KB","000262 - American Public Health Association","","000077 - USAID.

"PROJECT WAS CONSIDERED SUCCESSFUL IN ITS ORGANIZATIONAL EFFORTS WITH A SYSTEM OF COMMITTEES, WORKGROUPS & TASK FORCES ESTABLISHED. OVERALL PROJECT DESIGN AS ORIGINALLY CONCEIVED WAS TOO AMBITIOUS CALLING FOR A VARIETY OF ACTIVITIES. NATIONAL PLANNERS VOICED CRITICISM THAT IICA (INTERAMERICAN INSTITUTE FOR AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES) PROJECT STAFF DID NOT SUFFICIENTLY INVOLVE THEM IN DETERMINING THE PROJ'S APPROACH. SET OF MANUALS AND GUIDES WERE PRODUCED. THESE PROVED MORE VALUABLE IN THE ORGANIZATIONAL PHASE OF THE PROJECT RATHER THAN AS TEXTBOOKS FOR DEVELOPMENT OF NATL OR REGIONAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS. ALSO SERIES OF SHORT, FORMAL TRNG PROGRAMS WERE CONDUCTED CONCERNING STATISTICAL METHODS AND AREA FRAME SAMPLING CONCEPTS AND TECHNIQUES. TRNG WAS SUCCESSFUL IN WHETTING APPETITES OF NATL PLANNERS AND TECHNICIANS FOR MORE DETAILED INFORMATION. HOWEVER, SMALL SIZE OF THE STAFF HAS LIMITED ITS RESPONSE TO INFREQUENT AND VERY SHORT TRIPS TO THE PARTICIPATING COUNTRIES. DEVELOPMENT OF METHODOLOGY FOR USING TECHNOLOGICAL INFORMATION (TECHNOLOGICAL PACKAGES) HAS NOT PROGRESSED VERY FAR. REPORT NOTES THAT THIS PROJECT ELEMENT WILL REQUIRE CLOSE COOPERATION WITH 2 OTHER ROCAP PROJECTS- SOILSFERTILITY PROJECT AND MULTIPLE CROPPING SYSTEMS PROJECT. EMPHASIS WAS CORRECTLY PLACED ON DEVELOPMENT OF NATL INFORMATIONS SYSTEMS BEFORE PROCEEDING TO REGIONAL SYSTEM. STUDIES FOR DEVELOPMENT OF MARKET NEWS SYSTEM REVEALED THAT PRODUCERS, WHO FOR THE MOST PART ARE LIMITED TO 1 MARKET, ARE NOT INTERESTED IN THIS TYPE OF INFORMATION. MOST PRESSING NEED FOR ASSISTANCE WILL BE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF AREA FRAME SAMPLING SYSTEMS FOR CROP FORECASTING. ALL 6 COUNTRIES HAVE ASSIGNED THIS A HIGH PRIORITY. PANAMA HAS A FUNCTIONING SYSTEM, BUT IT WILL REQUIRE UPDATING. ALL THE OTHER COUNTRIES ARE IN THE EARLY STAGES OF ESTABLISHING THEIR SYSTEMS.","Companion report to PD-AAT-293","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","AID/OTR-C-1383","","3/1/1978 12:00:00 AM","","Agriculture|Information services|Agricultural research|Information systems","Central America","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAB499D1.pdf","734 KB","006727 - Development Alternatives, Inc.

PRIMARY EMPHASIS WAS GIVEN TO ON-FARM WATER PROBLEMS AFFECTING THE QUALITY OF LIFE FOR SUBSISTENCE FARMERS. SECONDARILY, USU WAS INVOLVED IN ALL PHASES OF THE WATER CHAINTO IDENTIFY WATER MNGMT PROBLEMS IN LESS DEVELOPED COUNTRIES (LDCS) & TO SEEK SOLUTIONS THROUGH TRNG, RESRCH, CONSULTING & PREPARATION & DISSEMINATION OF EDUCATIONAL MATERIALS. NEWCOURSES WERE ADDED FOR STUDUENTS FROM LDCS & 9 NEW STFF MEMBERS SERVE AS TEACHERS & RESRCH DIRECTORS FOR THESE STUDENTS. OTHER STAFF MEMBERS ARE ON LONG-TERM ASSIGNMENTS IN PERU,HONDURAS,KENYA & GUATEMALA,& TRAINED GRADUATE STUDENTS ARE WORKING THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. SLIDES & EXTENSION BULLETINS HAVE BEEN PREPARED AS WELL AS A TEXT ON IRRIGATION SYSTEMS EVALUATION. LIBRARY RESOURCES HAVE BEEN IMPROVED & EXPANDED & LANGUAGE COMPETENCE INCREASED. THROUGH THE CONSORTIUM OF INTERNATIONL DEVEL (CID), SPECIAL CAPABILITIES IN WATER MNGMT WERE COORDINATED WITH THOSE OF UNIV OF ARIZONA & COLORADO STATE UNIV,IN PART THROUGH AN INFORMATION DATA SYSTEM, CIDNET. FOUR OTHER UNIVS JOINED THE CONSORTIUM DURING THE GRANT PERIOD. THIS COORDINATION SERVES TO IDENTIFY NEW PROBLEMS,TO ESTABLISH PRIORITIES & TO DECIDE ON A DIVISION OF LABOR & COOPERATN IN ORDER TO PREVENT DUPLICATION OF EFFORT & TO UTILIZE THE MOST QUALIFIED PERSONNEL. A CHANGE IN EMPHASIS WAS MADE IN 1974 FROM DEVEL TO UTILIZATION OF COMPETENCE. OUTPUTS FOR UTILIZATION WERE IDENTIFIED AS INFORMATION CAPACITY,EDUCATION TRAINING,EXPANDED KNOWLEDGE BASE, ADVISORY CAPACITY,& LINKAGE NETWORKS. AN INITIAL ASSUMPTION,THAT USU COULD INCREASE ITS COMPETENCE FASTER THAN THE INCREASE IN DEMAND FOR ASSISTANCE,HAS NOT PROVED VALID. THERE HAS BEEN ONLY LIMITED ASSISTANCE FROM LDCS, AID & THE MISSIONS IN IDENTIFYING PROBLEMS & ESTABLISHING PRIORITIES FOR USING USU'S CAPABILITIES.

PRONAEEH has 2 purposes:  (1) to coordinate institutional efforts in non-formal education and (2) to deliver basic integrated education for the rural poor.  In 1977, program was concentrated in the area of Ocotepeque and San Marcos; it reached 1000 people with 40 monitors (the teacher/facilitor of a learning group). PRONAEEH attempted to use the ""psycho-social method"" wherein the objective of a lesson is supposed to be ""encoded"" in the illustration of a poster; through group participation, these objectives should be ""decoded"" and come as a discovery by the group. Because of the illustrators lack of experience the posters did not accomplish this. Illustrations and captions were often vague, unrealistic, and failed to dynamize the group.  The evaluators analyze specific examples from the units on soil erosion and chicken raising. USAID should hire an agronomist and a health advisor to insure correct technical content and a literacy program specialist to advise on the proper use of the psycho-social method. Monitors, who average a fourth grade education, must currently teach health, agriculture, community development, co-ops, literacy, and other subjects. This means that the monitor will duplicate the work of every one of the Government institutions that take care of those subjects. The problems of this approach are:  (A) the monitor does not have the capacity to play this role effectively, and (B) the program does not have the budget to respond to such a scheme. The program calls for an expansion in 1978 to reach 20,000 people in 5 regions.  Authors believe that the program is not ready to be expanded to such a scale.  Rather, PRONAEEH should concentrate its efforts in the Bajo Aguan region, using it as an experimental base to develop the most effective system.  Real and modern non-formal education communication systems should be tested instead of the out-moded, pseudo non-formal approaches borrowed from formal education as was done in Ocotepeque. Meanwhile, the other regions should be reached with educational radio programs.","Evaluation period: Through 28 Apr 1978","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","4/1/1978 12:00:00 AM","","MASS MEDIA|Farmer training|Change agents|Training|Rural areas|Health education|Literacy instruction|Educational materials|Radio|Evaluation|Educational delivery|Education|Pilot projects|Illiterates|Educational methods|Adult education|Nonformal education|Beneficiary count|Project change|Limited data plus","Honduras","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAB059A1.pdf","676 KB","000223 - Academy for Educational Development, Inc.

"EVALUATES PERFORMANCE OF THE AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL ON A PROJECT TO INCREASE THE COMPETENCE OF ASIANS TO DEAL WITH THE ECONOMIC AND HUMAN PROBLEMS OF AGRICULTURAL AND RURAL DEVELOPMENT IN THEIR OWN COUNTRIES FROM 6/72 TO 6/78. THE EVALUATION CONDUCTED AS A JOINT WORKSHOP WITH ADC AND AID, DETERMINED THAT THE ADC HAD PERFORMED WELL UNDER THE EXISTING GRANT AND THAT THE PROJECT WAS ACHIEVING ITS PURPOSE. AID CONTRIBUTED APPROXIMATELY 60% OF THE COSTS OF THE ADC EXPANDED FELLOWSHIP PROGRAM. DURING THE PERIOD OF THE AID GRANT A TOTAL OF 81 INDIVIDUALS HAVE RECEIVED ADC FELLOWSHIPS. THE BREAKDOWN BY DEGREE IS AS FOLLOWS: 72 PHD, 6 MS AND 3 NON-DEGREE. OF THE GROUP, 51 HAVE RETURNED HOME, 3 ARE IN THE US UNDER OTHER AUSPICES AND 27 ARE CURRENTLY IN TRAINING. EVALUATION ALSO CONCLUDED THAT WHILE THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF OVERSEAS TRAINING SPONSORED BY THE ADC IS NOT SIGNIFICANT IN TERMS OF THE DEMAND FOR THIS TRAINING, IT IS HIGHLY SIGNIFICANT IN TERMS OF THE SUPPLY OF FIRST CLASS RESEARCHERS AND POLICY THINKERS. WHILE AID RECOMMENDS THAT THE PROPOSED FINAL CONTRIBUTTIN OF $300,000 FOR THE PROJECT BE APPROVED, THE AGENCY WILL NOT SUPPORT A SUCCESSOR PROJECT FOCUSED ON PHD TRAINING AT US INSTITUTIONS. THIS NON-SUPPORT IS PRECIPITATED BY THE AID POLICY REQUIREMENT TO LINK TRAINING MORE CLOSELY TO THE NEEDS OF THE POOREST MAJORITY, AND THE AVAILABILITY OF GENERAL PARTICIPANT TRAINING PROJECTS AT FIELD MISSIONS. IN ADDITION, IT IS FELT THAT GIVEN THE HUMAN RIGHTS CONCERNS EXPRESSED  ABOUT MOST ASIAN AID COUNTRIES, A FOLLOW-ON PROJECT WOULD HAVE TO DEMONSTRATE BENEFITS ACCRUING TO THE POOR MAJORITY DURING THE LIFE OF THE PROJECT, SEVERAL SUGGESTED ALTERNATIVES TO A FOLLOW-ON PROJECT INCLUDE: 1) GENERAL SUPPORT TO THE ADC; 2) SPECIFIC SUPPORT GRANT FOR COUNTRY PROGRAMS WHICH INSTITUTIONALIZED COUNTRY-DIFFERENTIATED 5-YEAR SUPPORT STRATEGIES; SPECIFIC SUPPORT GRANT FOR RESIDENT ASSOCIATE PROGRAM; 4) SPECIFIC SUPPORT GRANT FOR NON-DEGREE ONE-YEAR TRAINING PROGRAMS IN THE US; 5) SHIFT TO BILATERAL CONTRACTS TO EXPAND SPECIFIC IN-COUNTRY PROGRAMS.

"Evaluates performance of the Earthquake Recovery Low Cost Housing Project in Nicaragua from 1976 to 1978. A total of 8,043 permanent units have been either repaired or constructed & most contemplated infrastructure & community buildings were completed.  Homes of 9 different styles were built within the paying capacity of the poor, with special payment consideratns instituted for families that cannot afford the cheapest units.  Social participatn was carried out under the direction of Junta Nacional de Asistencia y Prevision Social (JNAPS), a Nicaraguan Social agency. Small businessmen and women have received training in job skills, community leadership, planning, and cooperative training, as well as, C$1.82 million in credit.  BANINIC's capacity to execute home improvement activities and JNAPS' capacity to implement community development was strengthened thru techl assitance. Systems were established for the delivery of both small business and home improvemt credit.  Constructn costs were minimized by maintaining, reinforcing, and adding to the temporary shelters.  Manuals were prepared and distributed to teach residents elementary constructn techniques. Also, JNAPS adequately coordinated numerous agencies involved in the Community Devel program. Unfortunately, coordination with numerous Govt of Nicaragua (GON) and private agencies met with difficulties and required numerous changes. An attempt to promote a GON inter-agency Nat'l Housing Plan was delayed since support was not initially secured from other concerned GON agencies. Requested informatn received concerning internal accounting & record keeping were delayed and/or incorrect. It was recommended that:  1) the USAID controller's office audit the Trust, Home Improvement, and Home Owner's Assoc Funds in 9/78 & again before the 9/79 audit, and 2) 2 reports be submitted by the Borrower to USAID/N containing mortgage delinquency data, balances for Trust Home Improvemt & Home Owners Assoc Funds, the number & amount of sm business & home improvemt loans provided, the number of houses remaining to be adjudicated, and the number of mortage documts issued.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","7/1/1978 12:00:00 AM","","HOUSING|Disaster relief|Earthquakes|Low cost housing|CREDIT|Community participation|Community self help|Community development|Construction techniques|Vocational training|Beneficiary count","Nicaragua","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAN378.pdf","235 KB","008584 - USAID.

"Evaluates progress of the agricultural manpower project, a joint effort of USAID and the Govt of Tanzania, Ministry of Agriculture, which includes a technical assistance component provided by the Consortium of West Virginia University and North Carolina A&T State Univ from 2/75 to 2/78. Project was designed to help the GOT increase self-sufficiency in food crops and livestock by providing training for managerial and technical manpower. The evaluation team conducted interviews and data gathering with Tanzanian officials and training personnel. The MINAG manpower devel division was judged to be supporting the project and carrying out its functions, with upgrading of staff in progress.  The 12 MINAG Training Institutes (MATI) are hampered by budget limitations and frequent rotation of staff, which hamper morale and hinder planning for orderly growth.  West VA/North Car A&T Univ performance is judged satisfactory in spite of late start-up and delays. Evaluators recommend identification of qualified Tanzanians to phase into all positions occupied by Americans.  Absence of counterparts hinders technicians' teaching duties and other project-related responsibilities. Training component is judged successful, with 20 of 54 persons selected for training returned, most of them assigned to MATI's. Lack of baseline data hindered measurement of all major benefits of the Tanzanian development effort.  Evaluator recommends establishing a system-wide in-service program for new MATI personnel without previous training with focus on classroom and practical teaching methods, preparation of teaching materials, communication skills and human relations.  A postgraduate performance evaluation instrument is recommended to be used 3-4 years after graduation of the first classes for relating competence to prior training.  Expanded village outreach is recommended to ensure more student contact with village farmers and to improve feedback from villagers. Evaluators recommend adding 30 more participant trainees than originally planned for phase 3, of which 70% should be post-graduates in agricultural education with minors in administration.","Evaluation period: 1 Feb 1975-25 Feb 1978","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/afr-C-1142","","4/1/1978 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural extension training|Agricultural management|Agricultural training|Agricultural education|Food production|LIVESTOCK","Tanzania","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAB600C1.pdf","1,098 KB","000256 - American Technical Assistance Corp.

"Evaluates project performance from 1973 to 1978 in Liberia. Objective was to develop a Highway Maintenance Division capable of maintaining and developing roads.  Report based on discussions with USAID, SAUTI-ICE, donor personnel, and Ministry of Public Works (MPW) personnel at the Assistant Ministry of Operations level or below.  Also, a review was made of USAID project files during an inspection of approximately 700 miles of highway and visits to 7 Maintenance District Headquarters and 9 workshops. Joint discussion with the MPW director was not held. Consequently, at end of AID evaluation, MPW describes 58 instances of USAID ""misconceptions"" of MPW's performance. AID evaluators found district adequate in staff, equipment, and quality of training but grossly lacking ability to effectively administer staff.  Staff do not apply training, maintain or properly handle equipment, and are often required to perform duties not their duty.  Spare parts and tools have been insufficiently stocked, equipment secured through Afro-American Procurement Center has not conformed to specifications, and Government of Liberia has not adhered to warranty agreements.  Evaluators feel project is two years behind schedule with ineffective coordination of components. Recommendations are to:  (1) prepare descriptions for administrative and supervisory positions reviewing personnel qualifications and making reassignments as necessary; (2) provide more specialized training; (3) obtain more tools and maintain a larger spare parts inventory; (4) set up an accounting Department; (5) provide for disciplinary action against equipment abuse; and (6) add a high-level project coordinator. Report also evaluates project #6690143.","Evaluation period: 1 Jan 1973-12 Jun 1978","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","AID/OTR-C-1626","","7/1/1978 12:00:00 AM","","Administrative occupations|Vocational training|Training centers|Vehicles|Road maintenance|Roads|Transportation system design|Road construction|Limited data","Liberia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAC747A1.pdf","2,195 KB","000035 - U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)","","","English","application/pdf","Country program evaluation|Indepth evaluation|Onsite evaluation|Final EOPS","","WALTER, E.

"May 1978 Final Report evaluates 1976-1977 Fundamental Education & Skills Trng Proj (FESTP) in El Salvador.  Pilot proj designed to develop institutional capability of Ministry of Educ (MOE) to plan, manage, & eval short-term skills trng courses for unskilled urban & rural Salvadorans. Proj achievement indicators met or surpassed with participant & in-service trng of 10 MOE administrators, 4 supervisors, & 58 instructors; development of 36 new skills trng courses with training of 1712 semi-skilled individuals.  Participants in most cases successfully serviced through new guidance system consisting of orientation & job info dissemination.  Students enrolled in MOE's entire Occupational Skills Trng Program (OST) tripled & the retention rate improved from 46% to 54%. Despite FESTP resource investment, size & quality of MOE staff is insufficient to sustain expanded OST program; specialized tech & admin units are critically needed.  FESTP guidance system was not fully implemented in all pilot schools.  Physical facilities & equipment are inadequate to deliver expanded OST courses.  The Trade Advisory Council component of FESTP planning & mgmt info system not adequately developed to supply schools with valuable trade info. Occupational surveys & tracing of 60% of course graduates demonstrated relevance of OST courses utilizing job hiring and income level criteria. Eval recommend emphasis & expansion of permanent, rotating, & mobile courses in construction, auto mechanics, sewing & tailoring; deemphasis & confinement to urban areas the offerings of service-industry related courses including cooking, cosmetology, & radio/TV repair.  Eval identifies necessary admin & tech personnel needs of MOE's Div of Adult/Permanent Educ (DAPE), recommending filling of 22 positions, and that DAPE take advantage of expertise of other MOE offices.  Eval further recommends full utilization of available stock of OST courses; greater support of guidance system; further dvlp of trade advisory council network; more in-service trng of school principals; and dvlp of vital instructional materials. Additional USAID support is not proposed in report.","Evaluation period: 1 Mar 1976-1 May 1978","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","5/1/1978 12:00:00 AM","","Educational methods|Urban areas|Rural areas|Continuing education|Adult education|Educational planning|Educational policy|National level|Educational administration|Management training|Participants|On the job training|Teacher training|Education|Pilot projects|Nonformal education|Institution building|Vocational guidance|Vocational training|Beneficiary count","El Salvador","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAA800A1.pdf","2,492 KB","008540 - USAID.

"EVALUATES PROJECT PERFORMANCE IN HONDURAS AS OF 2/27/78. SINCE 1975, THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH HAS CONDUCTED, WITH USAID SUPPORT, A PROGRAM TO EXPAND AVAILABILITY OF HEALTH SERVICES IN RURAL AREAS. EVALUATION IS BASED ON FIELD INTERVIEWS WITH SEVERAL MEMBERS OF EACH CATEGORY OF HEALTH WORKER (HEALTH REPRESENTATIVE, HEALTH GUARDIAN, EMPIRICAL MIDWIFE), OBSERVATIONS OF THE TRAINING PROGRAM, DISCUSSIONS WITH NATIONAL AND REGIONAL NURSING SUPERVISORS, AND A REVIEW OF STATISTICAL AND SUPERVISORY REPORTS. THE OVERALL PROJECT DESIGN APPEARS WELL SUITED TO CREATING A RURAL HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE IN HONDURAS. IN MANY WAYS, HOWEVER, THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROGRAM FAILS TO ADEQUATELY EXPLOIT THE POTENTIAL OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT IT CREATES. THE PROGRAM IS CENTERED AROUND THE RURAL HEALTH POST OR ""CESAR."" 55 CESARS HAVE BEEN CONSTRUCTED WITH A TOTAL OF 243 UNITS PLANNED. 150 RURAL AUXILIARY NURSES HAVE BEEN TRAINED IN A 10-MONTH COURSE IN THE TRAINING CENTER ESTABLISHED FOR THE PROGRAM. THESE AUXILIARIES STAFF THE CESARS AND SUPERVISE A NETWORK OF VOLUNTEER COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS IN THE AREAS SURROUNDING THE CESAR. TRAINING OF THE RURAL AUXILIARY NURSE IN CLINICAL AREAS APPEARS GENERALLY SATISFACTORY. HOWEVER, FIELD PERFORMANCE CLEARLY DEMONSTRATES UNSATISFACTORY TRAINING IN THE AREA OF SUPERVISION. THE AUTHORS SUGGEST THAT INSTRUCTORS AT THE TRAINING CENTER PERFORM IN-DEPTH EVALUATIONS OF FUNCTIONING CESARS AND THEN, ON THE BASIS OF THIS EXPERIENCE, HAVE THEIR STUDENTS PARTICIPATE IN SIMILAR EVALUATIONS TO LEARN TECHNIQUES OF EVALUATING AND SUPERVISING. PRESENTLY, THE ""HEALTH GUARDIAN"" PASSIVELY RESPONDS TO REQUESTS FROM INDIVIDUALS. THE GUARDIAN'S ROLE SHOULD BE EXPANDED TO TAKE A MORE ACTIVE PART IN PROVIDING COMPLETE COVERAGE OF THE COMMUNITY WITH BASIC MEDICAL, EDUCATIONAL, AND REFERRAL SERVICES. FURTHER, TO PROVIDE AN OBJECTIVE MEASURE OF THE PROGRAM'S ULTIMATE EFFECTIVENESS, THE AUTHORS SUGGEST THAT AN INFANT OR CHILD MORTALITY SURVEY BE AUTHORIZED COMPARING AREAS WHERE THE PROGRAM HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED WITH THOSE WHERE IT HAS NOT.","Evaluation period: Through 27 Feb 1978","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","4/1/1978 12:00:00 AM","","Nursing education|Nurses|Assistants|Paramedical education|Health outreach services|Health delivery","Honduras","","","001439 - Centers for Disease Control (CDC) (U.S)","","","English","","Pre evaluation data|Onsite evaluation","","HEIBY, JAMES R.","","6 Apr 1978","","","","RESOURCE SUPPORT SERVICES REPORT : EVALUATION OF THE PROGRAM FOR THE EXTENSION OF HEALTH SERVICES, HONDURAS (FEB 4-27, 1978).","","PD-AAB-625-A1","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc1MzI3","Honduras","5220130"

SOME FACTORS HINDERING PROGRAM EFFECTIVENESS ARE: 1. PREMATURE ESTABLISHMENT OF BASES FOR ANTICIPATED REPLICATION; 2.POOR IDENTIFICATION OF SKILL DEMANDS; 3.FAILURE TO RECOGNIZEDUPLICATION OF TRAINING AT OTHER COUNTRY INSTITUTIONS; 4.INADEQUATE PLANS AND PROJECTIONS; 5.LACK OF OPERATING EXPERIENCE IN THE FIELD AMONG TOP OFFICIALS,PLANNERS,AND ANALYSTS; AND 6.THE NUMBER OF TRAINESS COMPLETING TRAINING FALLING SHORT OF GOALS DUE TO STUDENT WITHDRAWALS,UNCERTAIN ARRIVAL OF FUNDING,AND ELECTRICITY SHORTAGES. THE GREATEST NEED FOR IMPROVEMENT IS MORE TIMELINESS IN FILLING VACANT POSITIONS ON A PRIORITY BASIS AND AN IMPROVED RECRUITMENT PROCESS. OTHER RECOMMENDATIONS ARE TO IMPROVE FRENCH LANGUAGE CAPACITY AMONG PROJECT TEAM WHILE ENCOURAGING THE OICI BOARD TO BE MORE ACTIVE IN SHAPING POLICY.","Evaluation period: 1 Jan 1975-17 Mar 1978","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","AID/OTR-C-1381","","5/1/1978 12:00:00 AM","","Industrial development|Administrative occupations|Feasibility studies|Management|Problem solving|Educational facilities|Employment services|Beneficiary count|Limited data","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAK258C1.pdf","6,265 KB","002434 - Wolf and Co.","","","English","application/pdf","Multi country evaluation|Evaluation team|Indepth evaluation|Onsite evaluation|Sector level evaluation","","MYERS, HERMAN L.|ENGEL, NAT|BARNETT, STANLEY A.","","18 May 1978","","","","FINAL REPORT : EVALUATION OF OPPORTUNITIES INDUSTRIALIZATION CENTERS, INTERNATIONAL (OICI)","","PD-AAK-258-C1","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc1NDM4","Population and Humanitarian Assistance","9320076"
"EVALUATES PROJECT PERFORMANCE FROM 1974 TO 1978 IN JORDAN. PROJECT ASSISTS THE JORDAN VALLEY FARMER'S ASSOCIATN(JVFA) TO PROVIDE AGRICULTURAL CREDIT & TECHNOLOGICAL ASSISTANCE TO  SMALL FARMERS IN THE JORDAN VALLEY. SECONDARY DATA WAS REVIEWED;GOVERMENT OFFICIALS,BUSINESSMEM & FARMERS WERE INTERVI EWED; & ON-SITE OBSERVATIONS WERE MADE. UNFORTUNATELY SOME OF THE CONCLUSIONS REACHED IN THE EVALUATION MAY NOT BE ACCURATE SINCE STATISTICAL DATA ARE CONFLICTING,PIECEMEAL,OUT OF DATE & SOMETIMES INACCURATE. JVFA'S START-UP HAS BEEN SLOW SINCE JVFA CREDIT HAS NOT STARTED,THE NECESSARY NUMBER OF TRAINED PERSONNEL HAVE NOT BEEN RECRUITED,LOAN POLICIES & PROCEDURES HAVE NOT BEEN DEVELOPED,BASE LINE DATA NECESSARY FOR PLANNING & DECISION MAKING HAS NOT BEEN COLLECTED,& JVFA HASNOT GAINED THE NECESSARY OPERATING EXPERIENCE. SINCE JVFA HAS FAILED TO PROVIDE MANY PROMISED SERVICES, FARMERS LACK CONFIDENCE & DO NOT OFTEN SUPPORT THE PROGRAM. INFORMATION SERVICES PROVIDED BY EXTENSION AGENTS ARE LITTLE USED DUE TO THEIR LACK OF LEADERSHIP,INCENTIVE,FUNDING,& ABILITY TO COMMUNICATE WITH FARMERS. THERE HAS BEEN NO DIRECTION FROM LONG TERM PLANNING,& EXTENSION AGENT POSITIONS ARE HARD TO FILL DUE TO LOW WAGES & THE NECESSITY OF MOST EMPLOYEES TO COMMUTE FROM OUTSIDE THE JORDAN VALLEY TO WORK. THE JORDAN COOPERATIVE ORGANIZATION (JCO) HAS BEEN PREFERRED BY FARMERS SINCE THEY FAVOR ITS CREDIT SYSTEM AND TRAINING PROGRAM. RECOMMENDATIONS ARE THAT JVFA SHOULD: APPROVE LAON POLICIES & PROCEDURES CONSUSIVE TO SMALL FARMERS; PREPARE A FIVE-YEAR PLAN OF PROPOSED CREDIT WITH THE GOVERNMENT OF JORDAN (GOJ) PROVIDING ASSURANCE THAT JVFA LOAN FUNDS WILL SUPPLEMENTED; DEFINE & COORDINATE ITS GOALS WITH JCO & THE AGRICULTURAL CREDIT ORGANIZATION; & PROVIDE FOLLOW-UP ON ITS EXTENSIONS. FARMING TECHNOLOGY NEEDS TO BE IMPROVED WITH EXTENSION AGENTS TEACHING FARMERS HOW TO RAISE NEW CROPS,USE PLASTIC IRRIGATION TUNNELS,& SPRINKLER & DRIP IRRIGATION. MARKETING SERVICES SUCH AS GRADING, PACKING,& STROAGE OF PRODUCE ALSO NEED IMPROVEMT SINCE ONE-FOURTH OF PRODUCE IS LOST IN POST-HARVEST HANDLING.","Evaluation period: 1 Jan1974-30 Jun1978","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/ne-C-1503","","6/1/1978 12:00:00 AM","","Farm management|Agricultural credit|Short term credit|Irrigated farming|Agriculture|Information services|Credit cooperatives|Management operations|Cooperatives|Financing|Agricultural cooperatives|Limited data plus","Jordan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAA386A1.pdf","9,164 KB","","","","English","application/pdf","Sector level evaluation|Indepth evaluation|Onsite evaluation","","SORENSON, MAURICE V.","","1 Jun 1978","","","","REVIEW AND EVALUATION OF THE JORDAN VALLEY FARMER'S ASSOCIATION AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PLAN","","PD-AAA-386-A1","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc1NTYy","Jordan","2780186"

"Evaluates the Small Scale Irrigation Project in the Philippines from 1975 to 1978.  Proj, responsible for devel small farm systems & raising small farmer (SF) income, was conducted in cooperatn with the Farm Systems Devel Corp (FSDC). Evaluation based on extensive interviews with the Irrigator's Service Assoc (ISA), FSDC, and USAID staff. Basic proj elements include devel of:  SF organizatns, economic integratn, and govt-private sector partnerships.  Emphasis is placed on ISA's irrigatn sys devel, organizat'l mgmt, and financial trng. Although only 11.2% of the targeted SF's have been reached, 641 projs have been initiated irrigating 90,000 hectares and serving 30,000 SF's. While most projs utilize pump systems, some gravity projs are also in operatn.  Many SF incomes have greatly improved due to irrigatn which has increased crop yield & made double cropping possible.  Zinc oxide fertilizer has also increased rice yields.  Competent, enthusiastic, and dedicated FSDC proj staff has formulated excellent short & long range plans. Between 1/76 & 6/77, 694 FDSC officers were trained in institutional devel, rice productn, and water mgmt. Other FSDC staff trng has included: institutional credit, organized buying & selling, seed productn, organized rice productn, farm tools & equipmt, and research.  Also, 8,837 SF's have received various trng & loan repaymt schedules have been extended easing SF financial burdens. Little has been accomplished in the development of post-harvest service centers & farm equipmt pools.  Interagency coordinatn & organizational probs caused delays in proj implementatn.  Technical problems were encountered in developing pump equipmt & recruiting technical advisers. Recommendatns were to:  1) revise proj goals & purposes; 2) change proj title to SF Organizatn or SF Devel; 3) have AID assist FSDC obtain more office space & supplies, better transportatn, and equipmt; 4) enable FSDC to upgrade ISA's performance; and, 5) improve SF instructn in modern agr techniques especially rice productn. Ten supporting documents are attached which address social, economic, and scientific situations effecting project.","Evaluation period: 1 Jan 1975-1 Jan 1978","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","3/1/1978 12:00:00 AM","","Farmer training|Small farms|Farmers|Irrigated farming|IRRIGATION|Agricultural cooperatives|Multiple cropping|Zinc|Dietary supplements|RICE|DOUBLE CROPPING|Cropping patterns|Water management|Management training|Credit cooperatives|CREDIT|Cooperatives|Financing|Beneficiary count|Limited data","Philippines","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAD551A1.pdf","1,767 KB","002390 - University of Wisconsin at Madison.

"EVALUATES THE PADAT KARYA GATA BARU (PKGB) RURAL WORKS PROJECT IN INDONESIA FOR THE YEAR 1977. THIS REPORT IS A SUPPLEMENT TO THE 1977 EVALUATION (PD-AAA-428-A1) AND FOCUSESONLY ON THE PROJECT'S SOCIO-CULTURAL ENVIRONMENT, BENEFICIARIES, AND BENEFITS. THIS SOCIO-ECONOMIC ASSESSMENT IS BASED ON A 10/77 FIELD SURVEY OF 34 (20%) OF THE 169 SUBDISTRICTS IN WHICH THE LABOR-INTENSIVE SUBPROJECTS WERE LOCATED. 1,200 PEOPLE WERE INTERVIEWED; 827 OF THEM WERE HEADS-OF-HOUSEHOLD IN BENEFICIARY VILLAGES. AMONG THE 34 SUBPROJECTS, 13 WERE CONCERNED WITH CANALS FOR IRRIGATION OF FLOOD CONTROL. THESE DIRECTLY AFFECTED 1,300 HA OF CULTIVATED OR CULTIVATABLE 1AND. FLOODING WAS CONTROLLED ON ANOTHER 1,600 HA IN SURROUNDING AREAS. AT LEAST 75 HA OF FISHPONDS WERE CREATED OR IMPROVED. IF ALL THESE CANAL SUBPROJECTS WERE BROUGHT INTO FULL OPERATION, EXTENDED SLIGHTLY, OR IMPROVED TO TAKE A GREATER VOLUME OF WATER, ANOTHER 3,000 HA WOULD PROBABLY BENEFIT. CANALS HAVE PERMITTED CULTIVATION OF PREVIOUSLY UNCULTIVATED 1AND, DOUBLE CROPPING ON SINGLE CROP LAND, INCREASED YEILDS, AND CREATION OF FISH PONDS. THE $313,250 INVESTMENT IN THESE CANALS (83% OF WHICH WENT TO SUBPROJECT LABORERS) WAS MORE THAN RECOVERED WITHIN A YEAR THROUGH INCREASED AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION. IN THE 10 CANAL SUBPROJECTS FOR WHICH FIGURES WERE AVAILABLE, AGRICULTURAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES INCREASED 60% AFTER THE SUBPROJECTS WERE COMPLETED. ECONOMIC BENEFITS RESULTING FROM THE ROAD SUBPROJECTS WERE LESS APPARENT. PRODUCER INCOME ROSE NOT ONLY BECAUSE OF MORE DIRECT, RAPID ACCESS TO MARKET BUT ALSO BECAUSE OF THE BYPASSING OF THE MIDDLEMAN. ALSO, THE PRICE OF GOODS AVAILABLE IN THE VILLAGES DECREASED. INCREASED PRODUCTION, GREATER CASH FLOW IN PROJECT AREAS, AND MORE ACCESSIBILITY HAS ENCOURGAGED ENTREPRENURIAL ACTIVITY, INCREASED LAND VALUES (REPORTEDLY AS MUCH AS 50% OF PROJECT VILLAGES), & IMPROVED THE QUALTIY OF VILLAGE LIFE. THE STRONG VILLAGE STRUCTURE IN INDONESIA SUPPORTS THE DECENTRALIZED PKGB PROJECT. OF THE 34 SUBPROJECTS STUDIED, REQUESTS FOR 23 WERE INITIATED AT THE VILLAGE LEVEL.","Evaluation period: 1 Jan1976-31 Dec1971","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","3/1/1978 12:00:00 AM","","Sociology research|Economic research|EMPLOYMENT|Labor intensive technology|Fish ponds|Farm to market roads|FARM INCOME|Water management|Floods|Surface irrigation|Canals|IRRIGATION|Roads|Rural development|Road construction|RICE|Beneficiary count|Beneficiary interviews|Sampling method","Indonesia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAD844C1.pdf","678 KB","008558 - USAID.

"EVALUATES THE REGIONAL NUTRITION PROJECT IN CENTRAL AMERICA AND PANAMA FOR THE PERIOD 11/76 - 5/78. THE PROJECT'S PURPOSE IS TO ESTABLISH NATIONAL TECHNICAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE STRUCTURES WITH A CAPACITY TO PLAN, IMPLEMENT, AND EVALUATE FOOD AND NUTRITION PROGRAMS. THE EVALUATORS SPENT 2 WEEKS MEETING WITH GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS AND USAID STAFF IN HONDURAS, EL SALVADOR, AND GUATEMALA. THEY DID NOT VISITT COSTA RICA, NICARAGUA, OR PANAMA. THE EVALUATION IS PRIMARILY CONCERNED WITH THE INSTITUTION BUILDING ASPECT OF THE PROJECT SINCE ACTIVITIES ARE AT AN EARLY STAGE AND NO IMPACT ON THE TARGET POPULATION CAN YET BE MEASURED. THE INSTITUTE OF NUTRITION FOR CENTRAL AMERICA AND PANAMA (INCAP) HAS MADE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS IN ACHIEVING THE PROJECT'S OUTPUTS. INCAP HAS DEVELOPED A COMPREHENSIVE METHODOLOGY FOR THE OPERATION OF NUTRITIONAL PLANNING UNITS AND HAS PROMOTED ITS USE THRU SEMINARS, DISCUSSIONS, DOCUMENTS, AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. THE PROJECT HAS ACHIEVED ACCEPTANCE OF THE CONCEPT OF MULTISECTORAL NUTRITIONAL PLANNING. NOW, THE PROBLEM IS HOW TO MOTIVATE NATIONAL GOVERNMENTS TO PASS FROM VERBAL TO SUBSTANTIVE COMMITMENTS BY ORGANIZING AND PROVIDING FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO NATIONAL PLANNING UNITS. THE OUTSTANDING SUCCESS TO DATE HAS BEEN IN HONDURAS WHERE THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT HAS PROVIDED FULL ACCEPTANCE AND SUPPORT. IN THE OTHER COUNTRIES, VERBAL COMMITMENTS TO MAKE FOOD AND NUTRITION A MAJOR CONCERN OF NATIONAL POLICY HAVE BEEN MADE. HOWEVER, NUTRITIONAL PLANNING GROUPS IN THESE COUNTRIES ARE STILL AT THE STAGE OF MANEUVERING FOR ORGANIZATIONAL AND FINANCIAL SUPPORT. NOW THAT THE BASIC METHODOLOGIES FOR MULTISECTORAL PLANNING PROCEDURES HAVE BEEN INITIALLY DEVELOPED, MORE ATTENTION SHOULD BE GIVEN TO SELECTION OF QUALITY PROJECTS TO PUT SOME OF THESE TOOLS TO WORK AND SHOW WHAT CAN BE DONE. AS COUNTRIES REACH AN ACTIVE PLANNING/PROGRAMMING STAGE, INCAP SHOULD PROVIDE CONTINUOUS TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. INCAP TRAINING SHOULD BE MORE RESULTS-ORIENTED. IN THIS CONNECTION, EVALUATORS RECOMMEND THAT INCAP DEVELOP PRACTICAL TRAINING MATERIALS FOR FIELD WORKERS AND COMMUNITY GROUPS, WITH FUNDING FROM USAID.","Evaluation period: 1 Nov 1976-1 May 1978","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","5/1/1978 12:00:00 AM","","Technical assistance|Development strategies|Nutrition improvement|Health care planning|Nutrition|Workshops|Health policy|Sector planning|Management training|Project change|Limited data","Central America","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAB509A1.pdf","4,549 KB","002290 - USAID.

"Evaluates project performance from 1974 to 1978 in Korea. Purpose of project is to assist the Office of Rural Devel (ORD) to increase basic crop yields, cropping systems, and land utilizatn.  Evaluatn methodology based on interviews and onsite observatns. Although Korea has developed sophisticated agr techniques and admin organizatns, her agr output, except for rice, is still insufficient for her needs.  ORD conducts local research to devel disease, pest, and weather resistant varieties; and maintains close cooperative relatns with several interntl research organizatns.  As a result the first cold water facility with controlled temperatures in the world is being established which will determine rice hardiness at all stages of devel and its water temperature tolerances. The production of barley, wheat, and soybeans has met with less success since:  1. barley/rice culture demands a great deal of man power and barley has been susceptible to insect pests, 2. high humidity has produced a high percentage of scab disease in wheat, and 3. soybeans have suffered from disease pathogens and insects.  Although potatoes could be economically feasible, farmers usually plant only enough for their own consumptn. Higher yielding crops to feed Korea's growing population have been or are being developed.  Emphasis is being placed on developing short season and saline/cold-tolerant varieties which will enable 2 crops/year. Although barley-rice and potato-rice combinations provide a substantial productn increase, their prices are too low to make them economically feasible.  A wheat-rice combination has not yet been developed. Evaluators feel Korea's past agricultural weaknesses may be improved if ORD were to:  1. continue to improve its library collection, 2. encourage staff to learn English, 3. establish higher research salaries, 4. train more specialists, 5. provide a biometics unit, 6. establish a livestock program, and 7. participate in Title XII.","Attachment: XD-AAA-434-1|Loan no. 489-T-088|Evaluation period: 1 Jan1974-6 Jun1978","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","6/1/1978 12:00:00 AM","","Farmer training|CROP YIELD|Potatoes|SOYBEANS|Disease prevention and control|Animal diseases|SOIL RESEARCH|Agricultural technology|Agricultural research|Cultivars|BARLEY|WHEAT|PEST CONTROL|Maize|Varietal research|Cereals|Agricultural equipment|Rice|Agribusiness|Beneficiary interviews|Limited data plus","Korea R","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAA434A1.pdf","1,695 KB","000035 - U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)","","","English","application/pdf","Onsite evaluation","","YOHE, JOHN M.|KOPF, KENNETH|DESROSIERS, RUSSELL","","6 Jun 1978","","","","EVALUATION OF AID LOAN 489-T-088","","PD-AAA-434-A1","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc1Njc3","Korea, Republic of","4890705"
"Evaluates assistance project to Govt of Tanzania from 1976 to 1978. A coordinated national research program was developed to improve maize, food legumes, sorghum, and millet production.  Four agronomist specialists visited Agricultural Research Institutes (ARI's), research statns, village trials, and interviewed statn staffs. Team found overall performance of the project good and felt many Tanzanians have outstanding ability and dedication to the program. Scientists have developed 5 maize hybrids and 3 food legumes now being used by farmers.  A food legume production handbook has been developed and is ready for printing.  Handbook will be useful to many but may need simplification for the average farmer. Obtaining data from maize village trials has been less successful due to low rainfall, poor maintenance and shortages of spare parts for vehicles.  Since conditions are not very conducive for village trials it has been recommended that major emphasis shift to an expanded training program of Tanzanians, with steps taken to shorten the time required to complete formal training and to expand disciplines in which training may be obtained.  Improved training will provide local support of the National Research Program.  Other recommendations were to:  1. add a plant protection expatriate to help conduct research concerning insect pests and plant diseases; 2. add an extension agronomist specialist expatriate to bridge the present gap between research and extension staffs; 3. free project expatriates from an inordinate amount of paper work and allow them more research time by giving many of their responsibilities to economists; 4. provide ARI libraries with agricultural journals and reference books; 5. reduce the number of village trials keeping only those now located in major ecological areas; and 6. conduct soil surveys in all participating areas.","Evaluation period: 1 Nov 1976-1 Aug 1978","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/afr-C-1142","","8/1/1978 12:00:00 AM","","SORGHUM|Food production|Agricultural research|Agricultural training|On the job training|Participants|Millet|LEGUMES|Maize|SOYBEANS|Seed production|Cultivars|Crop yield|Varietal research|Limited data","Tanzania","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAA545A1.pdf","1,116 KB","000522 - General Research Corp.","","","English","application/pdf","Country program evaluation|Pre evaluation data|Evaluation team|Indepth evaluation|Onsite evaluation","","WORZELLA, WALLACE W.|KILLINGER, GORDON B.|et al.","Agricultural research","1 Aug 1978","","REDSO/WA-L-74-7","","EVALUATION OF TANZANIA AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH PROJECT (6/22/78 TO 7/9/78)","","PD-AAA-545-A1","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc1NzI2","Tanzania","6210018|6210143|6210117|6210119|6210092|6210099|6210107"
"Self-generated April 1978 Eval Summary by World Vision Relief Organization (WVRO) of its Dvlp Program Grant (DPG) from AID.  DPG's purpose was to create WVRO dvlp staff competent to plan, process, administer, control, & evaluate variety of dvlp projs in a number of LDC's.  WVRO, a branch of the Christian dvlp-oriented World Vision Intl (WVI), has made transition from primarily relief work in 1973 to over 80% dvlp work with vastly increased budget by 1978.  This WVRO self-eval presents final report on grant-related activities. WVRO exec staff has been constituted with DPG assistance. African and Latin American regional directors are now serving on location in field offices, effecting decentralization of WVRO efforts & enabling greater contact with projs in field.  Assoc Dir of Operations hdqtrs position has been created to oversee regionalized operations.  Originally-slated Assoc Dir for Educ position has been covered instead by short-term consultants. WVRO's output objs with respect to planning documents & annual field surveys have been achieved; 2 regional plans & 8 country plans finalized.  Some 286 projs in 30 dvlp nations are currently under WVRO supervision.  Projs are currently designed/supervised by expanding field staff (overlapping with WVI staff) in cooperation with local community leaders, as opposed to previous proj design/direction at exec level. Emphasis now on multifaceted, integrated community dvlp projs. Extensive trng has been provided to WVRO's exec staff, & 276 person weeks trng made available to WVRO/WVI field staff through DPG funding. Unanticipated problems occurred in effort to secure adequately experienced proj managers & in forced cancellation of planned activities in war-torn Ethiopia. Annexes include sample country plans, an annotative listing of all current WVRO projs, and a description of exec staff dvlp trng efforts. WVRO is submitting a proposal to AID for a matching grant to assist in the continued expansion of WVRO-directed dvlp activities.","Evaluation period: 1 Apr 1975-31 Mar 1978","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/pha-G-1087","","4/1/1978 12:00:00 AM","","Institution building|Development project evaluation|Technical training|Development project design|Development project implementation|Limited data","","","","000145 - USAID.

"EVALUATES ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR ANALYSIS PROJECT IN THAILAND INITIATED IN 1973 AND COMPLETED IN 1978. PURPOSE OF THE PROJECT WAS TO ENHANCE THE AGRICULTURAL POLICY ANALYSIS CAPABILITY IN THE THAI GOVERNMENT. A JOINT THAI-US TEAM OF EXPERTS PREPARED THE EVALUATION FOLLOWING REVIEW OF PROJECT DOCUMENTS, DISCUSSIONS WITH STAFF OF THE DIVISION OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS (DAE) AND IOWA STATE UNIVERSITY (ISU), AND INTERVIEWS WITH USERS OUTSIDE OF DAE. THE REVIEW TEAM BELIEVES THAT THE PROJECT HAS SUCCEEDED. DAE NOW HAS A HIGH-CALIBER OPERATIONAL CAPABILITY FOR APPLYING AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS ANALYSIS TO GOVERNMENT POLICY PROBLEMS. THE MODELS DEVELOPED BY DAE AND ISU YIELD RELIABLE RESULTS. FARM-LEVEL LINEAR PROGRAMMING MODELS WERE DEVELOPED INITIALLY FOR THE 19 AGROECONOMIC ZONES. THESE WERE THEN LINKED TO FORM REGIONAL MODELS AND A NATIONAL CROP MODEL. TRANSPORTATION, STORAGE, AND PROCESSING MODELS WERE ALSO CONSTRUCTED AS WELL AS LOCAL ECONOMIC INPUT-OUTPUT MODELS. DEMAND ANALYSES FOR IMPORTANT CROPS WERE CARRIED OUT. A MACRO-ECONOMETRIC MODEL FOR THE THAILAND ECONOMY WAS DEVELOPED TO STUDY INTERACTIONS BETWEEN AGRICULTURE AND THE REMAINDER OF THE ECONOMY. COMPUTERIZATION, SURVEYS, AND DATA BANK DEVELOPMENT HAVE CONTINUED THROUGHOUT. THE MODELS HAVE BEEN USED IN A VARIETY OF WAYS TO AID POLICY MAKING AT THE NATIONAL AND LOCAL LEVELS AND THE USES CONTINUE TO EXPAND. MOST OF THE ACTIVITIES HAVE IMPACTED RURAL POVERTY BECAUSE OF THE EMPHASIS ON AGRICULTURAL INCOMES AND LOW-INCOME REGIONS SUCH AS THE NORTHEAST. THIS KIND OF PROJECT IS A COST EFFECTIVE WAY OF PROMOTING AGRICULTURAL AND INCOME DISTRIBUTION OBJECTIVES. FOR EXAMPLE, IN ANALYZING DIFFERENT ALTERNATIVES FOR THAILAND'S FOURTH 5-YEAR PLAN, ONE STRATEGY WAS IDENTIFIED AS BEING MORE FAVORABLE TO RAISING INCOMES IN THE NORTHEAST THAN OTHER STRATEGIES. CONSERVATIVELY, THIS STRATEGY ALONE COULD RAISE THE INCOME OF 1/2 MILLION FARM FAMILIES BY $5 PER YEAR. THE RESULTING $2.5 MILLION GAIN IN YEARLY INCOME IN THE NORTHEAST WOULD FAR EXCEED THE COSTS OF THE PROJECT FOR ANY GIVEN YEAR. ATTACHED ARE 11 STATUS REPORTS ON DIFFERENT ELEMENTS OF THE PROJECT.","Evaluation period: 1 Jan 1973-1 Oct 1979","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","10/1/1978 12:00:00 AM","","Farm income|Income distribution|Agricultural prices|Exports|Simulations|Statistical data|Economic research|Agriculture|Sector evaluation|Economic analysis|Agricultural policy|Agricultural planning|Agricultural economics","Thailand","","","001695 - Thailand.

"EVALUATES AID'S BASIC VILLAGE EDUCATION PROGRAM (BVE) IMPLEMENTED IN GUATEMALA TO DETERMINE ITS APPLICATION TO OTHER DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS UTILIZING RADIO IN NON-FORMAL EDUC. THIS EVALUATION IS INTENDED TO PROVIDE AN EXTERNAL VIEWPOINT TO THE EVALUATION CONDUCTED IN GUATEMALA BY THE ACADEMY FOR EDUCATIONAL DEVELPMNT UNDER CONTRACT WITH AID. THE BVE PROJ WAS A LONG-TERM FIELD EXPERIEMENT. THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF THE BVE PROJ WAS  TO DETERMINE THE EFFECTIVENESS & RELATIVE COSTS OF DIFFERENT MIXES OF COMMUNICATIONS MEDIA, USED TO SUPPLEMENT THE WORK OF EXTENSION AGENTS IN INFLUENCING CHANGE IN AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES AND PRODUCTION AMONG LADINOS & INDIANS OF RURAL GUATEMALA. ONE OF THE MAIN CONCLUSIONS REACHED IN THE BVE PROJ IS THAT RADIO REQUIRES THE AID OF PARAPROFESSIONALS & PROFESSIONAL TECHNICIANS IN ORDER TO CHANGE CAMPESINO PRACTICES IN A SUBSTANTIAL SENSE. THE BVE PROJ ALSO CONTRIBUTED IMPORTANT EVIDENCE REGARDING THE IMPORTANCE OF DIFFERENT MEDIA FOR DIFFERENT TYPES OF SOCIETAL NORMS. FOR EXAMPLE, THE MOST MODERN GUATEMALAN  COMMUNITY PARTICIPATING IN THE PROJ (QUEZADA IN THE ORIENTE REGION)WAS THE MOST WILLING TO ACCEPT NEW AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES BY MEANS OF RADIO MESSAGES ALONE. THUS, DEVELOPMENT PLANNERS CAN NOW USE THE LEAST EXPENSIVE MEDIUM (RADIO ALONE) WHEN THEY KNOW THEY ARE ADDRESSING RELATIVELY MODERN COMMUNITIES. THE PARAPROFESSIONALS IN THE BVE PROJ WERE SELECTED FROM AMONG THE RANKS OF THE TARGET RURAL POPULATION AND CONDUCTED REGULAR MEETINGS IN WHICH AUDIO-VISUAL INFORMATION WAS SHARED WITH A GROUP OF VILLAGERS. THE BVE PARAPROFESSIONALS PROVED TO BE OF GREAT IMPACT, EVEN WITHOUT RADIO OR AGRONOMISTS TO AID THEM. IT MAY BE THAT THE USE OF PARAPROFESSIONALS SHOULD PRECEDE THE USE OF RADIO. ALONE, THE PARAPROFESSIONALS, MAY HELP CREATE A CLIMATE FOR MODERNIZATION THAT LATER CAN BE REINFORCED BY RADIO MESSAGES.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/LAC-C-1282","","10/1/1978 12:00:00 AM","","Communications technology|Evaluation|Educational delivery|Educational research|Cost benefit analysis|Literacy instruction|Farmer training|Labor intensive farming|Radio|Educational materials|Audiovisual educational materials|Nonformal education","Guatemala","","","","","","English","","Indepth evaluation","","KORZENNY, FELIPE","","1 Oct 1978","","","","EVALUATION ISSUES RELATED TO THE BASIC VILLAGE EDUCATION IN GUATEMALA","","PD-AAB-553-D1","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc1ODEy","Latin American Regional","5980551"

PURPOSE OF PROJECT WAS TO BEGIN PILOT ACTIVITIES IN THE PROJ AREA,AND TO INSTITUTIONALIZE THE PROVINCIAL DEVELOPMENT OFFICE (PDO)'S ROLE IN SUB-PROJ SELECTN,DESIGN,APPROVAL,AND SUPERVISION. EVALUATN METHODOLOGY WAS BASED ON INTERVIEWS,MISSION RECORDS,AND ONSITE OBSERVATIONS. ALTHOUGH SOME PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE AND MANY OF THE OPERATNAL DIFFICULTIES CONCERNING THE PROJ & ITS RELATION TO PDO HAVE BEEN OVERCOME,A NUMBER OF CRITICAL PROBLEMS REMAIN. OF THE 200,000 PEOPLE TO HAVE BENEFITED,ONLY 10% HAVE BEEN AFFECTED. THE MAJOR OBSTACLES STEMMED FROM UNSTABLE POLITICAL SITUATN;BUREAUCRATIC TURMOILS WHICH DELAYED PASSPORTS,CLEARANCES FOR SHORT-TERM PROJ CONSULTANTS; DISPUTES OVER THE AUTHORITY & RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE PDO HEAD & THE LOCAL PROJ COORDINATOR;AND TRAVEL REQUESTS FOR THE RDS TO VISIT PROJ SITES. FRUSTRATNS DUE TO PROJ DELAYS HAVE RESULTED IN RAPID TURN OVERS IN STAFF & A LACK OF PROJ SUPPORT FROM THE PDO,PROJ COORDINATOR,THE RDS,AND LOCAL BUSINESSES. FURTHER, AN EVALUATN BY THE REGIONAL ADMINISTRATION & AN AUDIT OF PROJ ACCOUNTS HAVE STOPPED ALL ACTIVITIES; 8 SUB-PROJECTS HAVE BEEN LEFT IN THE BALANCE WITHOUT CHIEF ADMINISTRATORS; USAID IS LACKING STAFF CAPACITY TO PROPERLY BACKSTOP & MONITOR THE PROJ;AND STUDIES OF LAND & WATER USE,AND THE ESTABLISHMT OF AN INFORMATN SYSTEM HAVE NOT BEEN COMPLETED.

"EVALUATES AID 211(D) GRANT TO THE UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN'S LAND TENURE CENTER (LTC) FROM FY75 TO FY78. THE EVAL INCLUDED ON-SITE VISITS (7/17-18/78) AT THE UNIV OF WISCONSIN & IN THE PHILIPPINES -- THE ONLY COUNTRY TO WHICH LTC HAS PROVIDED LONG-TERM ADVISORY ASSISTANCE. LTC HAS MAINTAINED FAIRLY STRONG TIES IN LATIN AMERICA,STEMMING FROM PREVIOUS CENTRALLY FUNDED ACTIVITIES (1962-69). HOWEVER,SINCE LTC MOVED FROM THE RESEARCH GRANT STAGE IN 1969 TO 211(D) GRANTS, VERY LITTLE RESEARCH FUNDING HAS BEEN AVAILABLE. (THE ASSUMPTION THAT USAID MISSIONS & OTHER DONORS WOULD PROVIDE RESEARCH FUNDING PROVED FALSE.) CONSEQUENTLY,LTC HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO DEVELOP STRONG RELATIONSHIPS OUTSIDE LATIN AMERICA. THE MOST SUCCESSFUL LTC RESEARCH & FIELD OPERATION WAS IN THE PHILIPPINES, RESEARCH BY LTC STAFF & GRADUATE STUDENTS HELPED TO IDENTIFY BOTTLENECKS & PROCEDURAL PROBLEMS IN TRANSFERRING TITLES FROM LANDLORDS TO TENANTS IN LAND REFORM OPERATIONS. LTC RESEARCH ALSO DOCUMENTED PROBLEMS IN LAND EVALUATION FOR COMPENSATION OF LANDOWNERS & PAYMENT BY LAND REFORM BENEFICIARIES. IN ADDITION,A FACULTY MEMBER CURRENTLY ON ASSIGNMENT IN THE PHILIPPINES INITIATED A STUDY OF THE IMPACT OF LAND REFORM ON THE LANDLESS. THE REVIEW TEAM NOTES THAT MUCH OF LTC'S RESEARCH WAS HISTORICAL RATHER THAN POLICY-ORIENTED. THE TEAM SUPPORTS THE UNIVERSITY'S ASSERTION THAT LTC'S PRINCIPAL IMPACT WILL COME THROUGH ITS TRAINING PROGRAM. A SAMPLE OF GRADUATE STUDENTS WERE FOUND TO BE OF HIGH QUALITY; AND THE CAREERS OF PAST STUDENTS HAVE BEEN IMPRESSIVE. SPECIAL SHORT-TERM TRAINING PROGRAMS WERE ARRANGED FOR OFFICIALS FROM ETHIOPIA,TURKEY,SYRIA,THE PHILIPPINES,PORTUGAL,AND SRI LANKA. THE REVIEW TEAM RECOMMENDS THAT AID INCREASE ITS KNOWLEDGE & USAGE OF LTC STAFF & FACILITIES. ALSO,IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT FUTURE RESEARCH BE FOCUSED ON A FEW KEY LAND TENURE QUESTIONS. IN ADDITION,MERGING THE LTC LIBRARY WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN LIBRARY SHOULD BE CONSIDERED ALONG WITH TYING IN WITH AGRICOLA,THE ON-LINE INFORMATION SYSTEM FOR THE NATIONAL AGRICULTURE LIBRARY.

"Evaluates Univ of Minn (UM)'s assist to Natl Institute of Agr & Veterinary (IAV) in Morocco from 1969-78.  Evaluatn based on docs, interviews, and on-site observatns. Evaluator and IAV find UM assist excellent.  IAV plans to educ 50% of its students in US.  UM has provided 32 man years of service and trained 53 students and faculty. Despite some language problems, on-campus advisors are committed and aware of participant probs.  Field staff is adequate.  Project has influenced & continues to influence AID and Govt of Morocco (GOM) agr devel policies. With IAV's tremendous growth, campus staffing is, and will continue to be, grossly inadequate.  IAV students do not benefit from US trng since they lack sufficient English; receive short notice of US acceptance; feel neglected as non-US degree candidates; and are moved frequently. Proj should be extended 10 more years to enable IAV to adequately train research scientists, provide facilities and finances for local research, devel a reward/incentive sys, and establish linkages with other scientists.  A ""Consortium"" of universities is necessary for staffing and trng.  MS trng should be followed with PhD trng as soon as qualified faculty are available.  Assistance in technical agricultural economics, extension activities and institute administration, organization, and operations should also be initiated. Communication among UM, AID, and GOM needs improvemt with all 3 contributing to proj planning.  UM should serve as lead univ by continuously providing senior faculty, allowing more lead time in the selection process, coordinating efforts with IAV and other agr devel programs, and having more freedom in executing contract requirements. AID should devel a more personalized on-campus system for trainees, establish a better selection/placement process that will place PhD and MA agricultural trainees promptly according to interest, and allow research dealing with local agricultural problems.

"EVALUATES THE PHILIPPINE POPULATION PLANNING II PROJECT FROM 7/77 TO 3/78. REPORT IS BASED ON 4 REGIONAL FIELD EVALUATIONS (ATTACHED TO DOCUMENT). IN ALL 4 REGIONS, POLITICAL SUPPORT FOR THE POPULATION PLANNING PROGRAM IS FAIRLY HIGH. LOCAL GOVERNMENTS SEEM TO BE MAKING EFFORTS TO ASSUME AN INCREASING SHARE OF PROGRAM COSTS. HOWEVER, SOME LOCAL OFFICIALS DO NOT REGARD THEMSELVES AS BEING RESPONSIBLE FOR PROGRAM PERFORMANCE IN THEIR AREAS. EVALUATORS RECOMMEND THAT THE GOP STRESS LOCAL ACCOUNTABILITY, AND AT THE SAME TIME, PROVIDE GRANTS-IN-AID TO LOCAL OFFICIALS WHEN LOCAL RESOURCES FALL SHORT. AS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE REQUIRED TO ASSUME A HEAVIER SHARE OF PROGRAM COSTS, THE OUTREACH PROGRAM MAY NOT PROVE TO BE FINANCIALLY VIABLE. EVALUATORS RECOMMEND THAT THE OUTREACH PROGRAM BE CONTINUED AT LEAST UNTIL ITS IMPACT ON CONTRACEPTIVE USE AND FERTILITY CAN BE ASSESSED. LACK OF COORDINATION DUE TO THE RUSHED PACE OF INITIAL OPERATIONS HAS RESULTED IN SOME MAJOR PROBLEMS AND HAS HAMPERED SMOOTH DELIVERY OF SERVICES. STRENGTHENING OF THE ""BOTTOM-UP"" PLANNING CONCEPT IS RECOMMENDED FOR MORE REALISTIC PLANNING AND TARGET-SETTING. THE MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM IS OF QUESTIONABLE QUALITY. SOME DOUBLE-COUNTING OF ACCEPTORS HAS OCCURRED. MORE TRAINING AND AN INTERNAL SYSTEM OF CHECKS AND AUDITS ARE NEEDED. TRAINING PROVIDED TO FULL TIME OUTREACH WORKERS (FTOW'S) STRESSED COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT MORE THAN FAMILY PLANNING. CONSEQUENTLY, FTOW'S ARE UNABLE TO PROVIDE PROPER ADVICE ON THE PROS AND CONS OF DIFFERENT CONTRACEPTIVE METHODS, NEITHER CAN THEY DEAL WITH THE QUESTIONS REGARDING SIDE-EFFECTS. ADDITIONAL TRAINING IS RECOMMENDED. THE ""BARANGAY SUPPLY POINT OFFICERS"" (BSPO'S) WORK ON A VOLUNTARY BASIS AND ARE THE KEY IN THE ENTIRE OUTREACH SERVICE DELIVERY SCHEME. A COMMITTEE SHOULD BE FORMED TO STUDY WHAT KIND OF INCENTIVES MIGHT BE NECESSARY TO ENSURE CONTINUED BSPO INTEREST.

"EVALUATES PROJECT TO INCREASE THE QUANTITY AND QUALITY OF TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES AVAILABLE TO SMALL FARMERS AND THE RURAL POOR. ALTHOUGH INITIAL NATIONAL APPRENTICESHIP SERVICES'(SENA) PERFORMANCE WAS DISAPPOINTING, EFFORTS ARE NOW BEING MADE TO CORRECT PROBLEMS. SENA HAS ESTABLISHED PROCEDURES TO COLLECT AND DISSEMINATE TECHNOLOGY BASED ON LOCAL NEEDS FOR COURSE REVISION. A FILM LIBRARY HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED. AGRICULTURAL CENTERS HAVE BEEN ORGANIZED SPECIALIZING IN THE PRODUCTION OF RICE, COFFEE, SHEEP, MILK, AND COTTON. A $2 MILLION LOAN HAS BEEN GRANTED FOR A MOBILE PROGRAM PROVIDING TRAINING FOR ALL RURAL AREAS OF COLOMBIA. TRAINING PROGRAMS, EVALUATED BY LOCAL POPULATIONS, ARE BEING REVISED TO EQUALLY STRESS AGRICULTURE, COMMERCE, AND INDUSTRY. INSTRUCTORS ARE BEING TRAINED TO TEACH NECESSARY COURSES IN FARM MANAGEMENT AND OPERATIONS. FURTHER, RECORDS OF PROFIT AND LOSS ARE BEING COMPILED, SO UNPROFITABLE ENTERPRISES MAY BE ELIMINATED AND PROFITABLE ONES EXPANDED. ALTHOUGH COURSES ARE BEING IMPROVED AND REVISED TO MEET STUDENT NEEDS,CONSIDERABLE WORK WILL BE NEEDED TO EVALUATE JOB PERFORMANCE OF COURSE GRADUATES. PRESENTLY,THE MAJOR SENA PROBLEM HAS BEEN A LARGE STAFF TURNOVER. BESIDES SENA,THE OTHER MAIN GOVERNMENT OF COLOMBIA ORGANIZATION RESPONSIBLE FOR RURAL TRAINING IS THE POPULAR CULTURAL ACTION PROGRAM (ACPO). SINCE ACPO WAS SPENDING MORE MONEY THAN IT RECEIVED,A $2 MILLION LOAN WAS NEGOTIATED TO BUY EQUIPMENT THAT WOULD PROVIDE ACPO WITH ADDITIONAL INCOME. ALTHOUGH PROJECT IS NOW PROGRESSING,ASSISTANCE WILL BE NEEDED UNTIL THE MACHINERY IS IN PLACE AND OPERATING,AND CLASSROOM BUILDINGS ARE COMPLETED. OTHER ACPO DELAYS HAVE OCCURRED DUE TO THE ADMINISTRATION BEING CENTERED IN ONE PERSON,AND AN OVERDUE EVALUATION REPORT WHICH MUST BE RECEIVED BEFORE FUTURE APCO RECOMMENDATIONS CAN BE MADE.","Evaluation period: 1 Oct 1976-30 Sep 1977","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","AID/LA-C-1163","","2/1/1978 12:00:00 AM","","Vocational training|Nonprint media|Libraries|Agricultural management|Agricultural equipment|Agricultural education|Delivery systems|Agricultural inputs|Curriculum|Management operations|Educational research|MASS MEDIA|Educational methods|Leadership training|Teacher training|Education|Rural areas|Nonformal education","Colombia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAA642E1.pdf","670 KB","008530 - USAID.

"EVALUATES PERFORMAMCE FROM 1975 TO 1977 (TWO CROP YEARS) IN THE SAHEL REGION OF SENEGAL. PURPOSES OF THE PROJECT ARE TO ASSIST THE GOVERNMENT OF SENEGAL (GOS) TO ACHIEVE HIGHER LEVELS OF AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTIVITY AND TO HELP SODEVA (A SEMI-AUTONOMOUS AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT AND EXTENSION ORGANIZATION) DIVERSIFY AND INTENSIFY PRODUCTIVITY IN THE WEST CENTRAL REGION OF SENEGAL'S GROUNDNUT BASIN.EVALUATION OF PROJECT PERFORMANCE IS BASED ON REVIEW/ANALYSIS OF: 1) A DRAFT MID-TERM AID EVALUATION; 2) REPORTS/FILES OF PARTICIPATING ORGANIZATIONS; 3) CONSULTATION WITH AID/GOS PERSONNEL. WHILE EVALUATION IS TOO EARLY TO ASSESS ACHIEVEMENT OF PURPOSE 1, PROGRESS TOWARD PURPOSE 2  HAS BEEN SUBSTANTIAL. PROJECT INPUTS OF AID FINANCING FOR THE SUPPORT OF INFRASTRUCTURE, EQUIPMENT, OPERATIONAL COSTS, AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE HAVE BEEN WELL-UTILIZED, ALTHOUGH AT SLOWER RATE THAN ANTICIPATED. INPUT MANAGEMENT BY SODEVA HAS BEEN VERY EFFICIENT. OUTPUT HAVE ALSO BEEN SUBSTANTIALLY REALIZED. ADOPTION OF INTENSIFICATION PRACTICES HAS INCREASED, WITH ABOUT 3 TIMES MORE FARMERS USING SEMI-INTENSIVE TECHNOLOGY IN 1976 THAN IN 1974, AND MORE THAN TWICE THE NUMBER OF FARMERS USING LESS INTENSIVE TECHNOLOGY. EXPANSION OF CROP DIVERSIFICATION ACTIVITIES WILL PROVIDE ALTERNATIVES TO MILLET-GROUNDNUT ROTATION. THE LIAISON UNIT HAS UNDERTAKEN SOME USEFUL STUDIES ON THE SOCIAL IMPACT OF THIS PROJECT. AN IN-HOUSE EVALUATION OF THE PROJECT DUE IN MARCH, 1978, WILL PROVIDE FULLER ANALYSIS OF THE LIAISON UNIT AS WELL AS SODEVA. THE HIGHEST TECHNOLOGY HAS NOT BEEN ADOPTED TO EXPECTED LEVELS FOR MANY REASONS: 1)FARMER HESITANCY TO PREPARE LAND BECAUSE OF INSECURE LAND TENURE; 2)CONFLICT BETWEEN USE OF LABOR FOR PLOWING OR HARVEST; 3)LIMITED AVAILABILITY OF EQUIPMENT; 4)DOUBT OVER ECONOMIC BENEFITS OF HIGHER TECHNOLOGY LEVELS. THE IN-HOUSE EVALUATION WILL ADDRESS THESE ISSUES, WITH REDIRECTION OF PROJECT ACTIVITIES A LIKELY RESULT. EXTENSION OF PROJECT FOR ONE YEAR IS RECOMMENDED. RECOMMENDATIONS TO CAREFULLY ASSESS PROBLEM AREAS CITED ABOVE IN DESIGNING A POSSIBLE SECOND PHASE OF THE PROJECT ARE INCLUDED.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","2/1/1978 12:00:00 AM","","Crop production|Millet|Cereals|Youth|Vocational training|Agricultural credit|Farmer training|Agricultural technology|Agricultural inputs|Agricultural extension training|Agricultural research|Agricultural extension|Agricultural diversification|Beneficiary count|Public data|Project change|Limited data","Senegal","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAC150E1.pdf","577 KB","","","","English","application/pdf","Limited data","","LEBEAU, FRAN J.","","11 Feb 1978","","","","EVALUATION OF THE SENEGAL CEREALS PROJECT","","PD-AAC-150-E1","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc2MDQ4","Senegal","6850201"

PROJECT IS DESIGNED TO ASSIST CREDIT INSTITUTIONS IN PERFORMING ANALYSES TO IMPROVE SMALL FARM CREDIT POLICIES, PROGRAMS, AND LOAN REPAYMENT. MAJOR PLANNED ACTIVITIES DURING THIS PERIOD INCLUDE 1)PROJECT INITIATION AND 2)REVIEW OF LITERATURE OF SMALL FARM DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS METHODOLOGIES. COLORADO STATE UNIV (CSU) AND OKLAHOMA STATE UNIV (OSU) WERE CONTRACTED TO IMPLEMENT THESE ACTIVITIES. INITIALLY, THE PHILIPPINES WAS CHOSEN AS SITE OF PROJECT, BUT PROBLEMS AROSE IN IDENTIFYING AND FINALIZING AGREEMENTS WITH GOVT OF PHILIPPINES, SO NICARAGUA WAS DECIDED UPON. PROJECT INITIATION ACTIVITIES ARE ON SCHEDULE. THE LITERATURE REVIEW SHOWED THAT AVAILABLE LITERATURE ON SMALL FARM DATA COLLECTION PERTAINS PRIMARILY TO AFRICA AND THE MIDDLE EAST. THE FIRST DRAFT OF AN ANNOTATED BIBLIOGRAPHY ON THE SUBJECT HAS BEEN COMPLETED. A NUMBER OF ARTICLES ON SMALL FARM CREDIT WERE ALSO PRODUCED. IN ADDITION, PHILIPPINE FARM RECORD KEEPING METHODOLOGIES WERE REVIEWED AND ANALYZED TO BE USED AS GUIDELINES FOR NEW SYSTEMS. 11 GRADUATE STUDENTS PARTICIPATED IN A SEMINAR ON AGRICULTURAL CREDIT CONDUCTED BY THE PROJECT LEADER FROM CSU, AND SEVERAL GRADUATE STUDENTS ARE EXPECTED TO CONDUCT PROJECT-RELATED RESEARCH IN THEIR COURSE OF STUDIES.

AUTHORS WERE REQUESTED BY USAID/GUATEMALA AND OTHERS TO ASSIST APROFAM IN ANALYSIS OF DATA RESULTING FROM YR-END, CLINIC-LEVEL EVAL PERFORMED BY APROFAM'S EVAL UNIT. REPORTED DATA MAY CONTAIN BIASES BECAUSE OF ALLEGED VISITS BY DDP PERSONNEL FAMILIAR WITH EVAL PROCESS TO CLINICS SELECTED FOR EVAL. THE DDP PROVIDES LOGISTICAL SUPPORT TO THE MSP PROGRAM. IT DOES THIS BY 1)DIRECT SUPPLY OF MATERIALS TO MSP CLINICS.AND 2)SUPPLY OF MSP AREA WAREHOUSES, WHICH IN TURN SUPPLY CLINICS. ANALYSIS OF DATA GENERALLY SHOWS DDP SUCCESSFUL IN STOCKING AND MAINTAINING CONTRACEPTIVE SUPPLIES TO MSP CLINICS, AND CLINICS RECEIVING SUPPLIES DIRECTLY FROM DDP TO BE BETTER PROVIDERS OF FAM PLAN SERVICES THAN WAREHOUSE-SUPPLIED  CLINICS (KEEPING IN MIND QUESTIONS ON DATA RELIABILITY). MORE THAN TWICE AS MANY DDP-SUPPLIED CLINICS MAINTAIN SPECIAL FAM PLAN SERVICE HOURS. DDP-SUPPLIED CLINICS ALSO APPEAR TO BE BETTER SUPPLIED IN TOTAL NUMBER AND RANGE OF CONTRACEPTIVES. EVALUATION REVEALED MAJOR PROBLEMS IN AREAS OF CLINIC-LEVEL DATA COLLECTION AND REPORTING NEEDED FOR DDP PROG MGMT. IMPROVING CURRENT REPORTING SYSTEM IS RECOMMENDED RATHER THAN EXPANDING PROGRAM, BECAUSE OF NEED TO ESTABLISH CONTINUOUS CONTRACEPTIVE SUPPLY IN RURAL AREAS FOR LONG-TERM SUCCESS OF PROGRAM. OTHER RECOMMENDATIONS INCLUDE: 1)REDUCE NUMBER OF RESUPPLY VISITS BY ESTABLISHING MAXIMUM AND MINIMUM STOCK LEVELS FOR CLINICS; 2)EXTEND VISITING TIME OF DDP PERSONNEL TO PROVIDE MORE TECH ASSISTANCE TO CLINICS; 3)IMPROVE APROFAM'S OVERALL TECH ASSISTANCE TO NEEDY CLINICS THROUGH TRAINING, LITERATURE AND FILM SUPPLIES; 4)IMPROVE DDP REPORTING SYSTEM THROUGH NEGOTIATION WITH MSP ON ITS RESTRUCTURE; 5)AUDIT AND RE-ESTABLISH DDP ACCOUNTING SYSTEM.

"EVALUATES THE RURAL ACCESS ROADS PROGRAM (RARP) IN KENYA FOR THE PERIOD 9/77 TO 3/78. PROGRAM IS PART OF THE RURAL ROADS SYSTEMS PROJECT, THE REMAINDER OF WHICH MISSION WILL EVALUATE 7/79. PRESENT EVALUATION WAS CONDUCTED JOINTLY BY ALL PROGRAM DONORS AT REQUEST OF MINISTRY OF WORKS (MOW) OF GOVT OF KENYA IN ORDER TO DETERMINE FUTURE DONOR COMMITMENTS. EVALUATION WAS BASED ON REVIEW OF PROGRAM DOCUMENTS, VISITS TO WORK SITES, AND INTERVIEWS WITH RARP FIELD STAFF. DONORS ARE GENERALLY SATISFIED WITH PROGRAM PROGRESS AND WITH MOW MANAGEMENT. DONORS ARE COMMITTED TO FINANCING 40 OF THE 52 ALREADY REQUESTED ROAD CONSTRUCTION UNITS AND ADVISE AGAINST GOK RIGIDITY IN REGARD TO PROGRAM OUTPUTS. PRESENT ROAD MAINTENANCE IS SATISFACTORY, BUT DONORS EXPRESSED CONCERN OVER PROPOSED SHIFT TO PROVINCIAL-LEVEL MAINTENANCE GROUPS, WHICH ARE INADEQUATE, AND NOTED THAT MAIN ROADS MUST BE WELL-MAINTAINED IF RARP IS TO ACHEIVE ITS GOAL. DONORS AGREED THAT MOW CRITERIA FOR ROAD SELECTION NEEDS CLARIFICATION; THAT MORE TIME SHOULD BE SPENT ON INSPECTING PROPOSED ROAD SITES; THAT EQUITY BE OBSERVED IN DISTRIBUTING ROADS; AND THAT RARP BE INTEGRATED WITH OTHER KENYAN DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES, ESPECIALLY IN REGARD TO EXTENDING RARP'S LABOR-INTENSIVE METHODS. DONORS ENDORSED MOW'S DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION STANDARDS, WHILE SUGGESTING MORE ADEQUATE CRITERIA FOR MOW GRAVELING POLICY, WITH EXCEPTION OF AID, IBRD, AND EEC, DONORS ACCEPTED MOW DISBURSEMENT PROCEDURES. EQUIPMENT PROCUREMENT AND MAINTENANCE NEED MUCH IMPROVEMENT AND AN IMPACT STUDY SHOULD BE BEGUN AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. TWO AREAS CAUSED SPECIAL CONCERN. DESPITE MOW DISCLAIMERS, DONORS CONSIDER UNDERSTAFFING AT RARP HEADQUARTERS A SERIOUS PROBLEM. PROCUREMENT OF VITALLY NEEDED QUALITY HANDTOOLS IS ALSO CONSIDERED A SERIOUS PROBLEM AND ONE THAT MAY WORSEN IF THE CENTRAL TENDER BOARD RELAXES STANDARDS. DONORS WISH TO BE KEPT CLOSELY INFORMED OF BOTH SITUATIONS. IN THE FUTURE, MOW WILL PREPARE JOINT QUARTERLY REPORTS FOR ALL DONORS, ALONG WITH SEPARATE APPENDICES FOR INDIVIDUAL DONORS UPON REQUEST.

VIRTUALLY ALL OF THE PROJECT ACTIVITIES ARE BEHIND SCHEDULE. CONSTRUCTION OF THE ORD COMPLEX IN FADA N'GOURMA,SCHEDULED FOR COMPLETION IN 12/76,WILL NOT BE COMPLETED UNTIL 6/78. APPLIED RESEARCH ACTIVITIES ARE 18 MONTHS BEHIND SCHEDULE BECAUSE OF THE LATE ARRIVAL OF THE MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY TEAM. ANOTHER SERIOUS PROBLEM HAS BEEN THE LACK OF ORD STAFF TRAINING. HOWEVER, VEHICLES. EQUIPMENT, AND COMMODITIES WERE DELIVERED MORE OR LESS ON SCHEDULE AND HAVE BEEN IN USE FOR SOME TIME. ANOTHER PROBLEM HAS BEEN ORD'S LACK OF COMMITMENT TO THE INTENSIVE ZONE CONCEPT OF IMPLEMENTATION. THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT THE ORD HAS MADE ANY EFFORTS TO ACHIEVE THE PLANNED LEVEL OF 1 EXTENSION AGENT PER 75-100 FARMS IN THE INTENSIVE ZONE. EVALUATORS RECOMMEND THAT THIS ISSUE BE RESOLVED.

"EVALUATES PROJECT TO STRENGTHEN AGRICULTURAL COOPERATIVES AND MARKETING IN SWAZILAND, AS OF 12/27/78. RAPID GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT OF FARM PRODUCTION SUPPLIES HAS PLACED A STRAIN ON THE ACCOUNTING AND ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES OF THE CENTRAL COOPERATIVE UNION (CCU). TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM, THE AUTHORS RECOMMEND THAT REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE GOVERNMENT OF SWAZILAND AND OTHER IMPLEMENTING AGENCIES (AID, THE CONTRACTOR, AND THE UNITED KINGDOM OVERSEAS DEVELOPMENT MINISTRY) FORM A COMMITTEE TO SELECT A QUALIFIED GENERAL MANAGER FOR THE CCU. THE ENTIRE CCU STRUCTURE IS UNDERCAPITALIZED, WITH ITS ASSETS SERVING AS SECURITY FOR LOANS FROM THE SWAZILAND DEVELOPMENT AND SAVINGS BANK (SDSB). THE ONE-YEAR TIME-FRAME NOW USED FOR THE FISCAL BUDGET IS INADEQUATE FOR LONG-TERM FINANCIAL PLANNING. INSTEAD,FINANCIAL PLANNING SHOULD BE EXTENDED 5 YEARS AHEAD. THE CCU'S CAPITAL PROBLEMS CAN ALSO BE TRACED TO INADEQUATE GROSS MARGINS IN SALES AND SERVICES. THE AUTHORS RECOMMEND THAT THE CCU PROVIDE TECHNICAL AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES FOR CO-OP MARKETING RATHER THAN ASSUME ITS OWN MARKETING FUNCTION.

"EVALUATES THE KELAPA DUA HUMAN DEVELOPMENT PROJECT IN INDONESIA AS OF 11/20/78. KELAPA DUA AREA IS THE SITE OF A PILOT VILLAGE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT BEING IMPLEMENTED BY THE INSTITUTE OF CULTURAL AFFAIRS (ICA), A PRIVATE VOLUNTARY ORGANIZATION. REPORT COMPILES RESPONSES TO A QUESTIONNAIRE ADMINISTERED TO 57 VILLAGERS BY A 2-MEMBER USAID EVALUATION TEAM. MOST COMMENTS ON ALL ICA PROGRAMS ARE POSITIVE. THE VILLAGERS ARE GRATEFUL TO ICA FOR BRINGING CHANGES IN HEALTH, EDUCATION, AND FARMING. HEALTH IMPROVEMENT IS THE MOST SUCCESSFUL ASPECT OF ICA ACTIVITIES. THIS INCLUDES BATH-WASH-TOILET FACILITIES, POTABLE WATER, AND CLINIC OR HEALTH INFORMATION. VILLAGERS EXPLAIN THAT BEFORE ICA PROGRAMS BEGAN, SKIN DISEASE AND DIARRHEA WERE COMMON AMONG CHILDREN AND ADULTS, BUT NOW THEY ARE ENJOYING BETTER HEALTH. CHILDREN ATTENDING THE NEW PRESCHOOL ARE PROVIDED FREE FOOD BY ICA. MOST VILLAGERS AGREE THAT NEW RICE FARMING TECHNIQUES HAVE INCREASED PRODUCTION PER HARVEST BY 2 OR 3 TINS (A TIN IS ABOUT 20 LITRES) EVEN UP TO 75%. THIS WAS EXPERIENCED WHEN THEY WERE GIVEN RICE VARIETY SEED IR36, FREE FERTILIZER, AND FREE INSECT SPRAYING FOR A FIRST PLANTING DEMONSTRATION. AT THE NEXT PLANTING SEASON,THEY WERE GIVEN FREE SEED IR36 BUT WRE ASKED TO PAY FOR THE FERTILIZER AND THE PESTICIDE. AFTER THE HARVEST, ONLY A FEW FARMERS WERE WILLING TO PAY BACK. WITH THE COMING PLANTING SEASON, FARMERS ARE STILL CONFUSED: THEY MISUNDERSTAND THE DEMONSTRATION CONCEPT AND STILL EXPECT ICA TO SUPPLY THEM WITH MORE COMMODITIES AS ICA HAS DONE WITH OTHER PROGRAMS. VILLAGERS CONSIDER PATH CONSTRUCTION THE WORST ICA PROGRAM. SOME VILLAGERS REFUSE TO WORK ON PATH CONSTRUCTION BECAUSE GRAVEL WILL HARM THEIR RICE FIELDS AND THEY WERE NOT CONSULTED IN ADVANCE ON WHAT KIND OF MATERIAL SHOULD BE USED FOR PATH CONSTRUCTION. MOST VILLAGERS COULD NOT RESPOND TO THE QUESTION ""WHAT WILL HAPPEN WITHOUT ICA?"" BASED ON THE RESPONSES THAT WERE OBTAINED, ICA MUST TRAIN VILLAGERS TO BE INDEPENDENTAND SELF-SUPPORTING IN DEVELOPMENT WITHOUT THE HELP OF ICA. ON 12/10/78, THE ICA COMMUNITY ASSEMBLY WAS OFFICIALLY INAUGURATED.

"Evaluates project to assist the Government of Pakistan's (GOP) rural malaria control program.  Evaluation covers the period 1/78-9/78. Evaluation methodology is not specified. An intensive insecticide safety monitoring program was conducted. Malaria consultants trained GOP personnel in safe insecticide handling techniques, reestablished laboratories capable of testing cholinesterase levels of suspected malathion intoxication cases, and conducted field checks throughout the spraying season to monitor safety procedures and oversee spray coverage quality.  Of 17,000 spraymen and mixers, there were only three or four possible cases of malathion intoxication.  In two cases, the spraymen returned to work after acquiring a dose of atropine.  A third sprayman with possible symptoms was removed from his job due to poor safety compliance and had no further symptoms.  The fourth case involved the death of a sprayman.  After extensive investigation, however, it was determined that death was probably due to heatstroke.  The program was thought to be effective in preventing toxicity problems among the malaria workers. Due to the lack of a uniform spraying quality technique, the optimum level of insect control was not reached in most areas. In addition, most areas had little data on vector density and on the susceptibility of vector mosquitoes. Since the epidemiological status of malaria was unknown, an internal assessment was planned for 10/78. Due to transitional problems of integrating the malaria control program with other health programs into a communicable disease control (CDC) agency, Punjab officials had problems in obtaining accurate malaria incidence data from the CDC offices.  Punjab communicable disease work is woefully inadequate. Several cities prepared proposals for urban malaria control programs and a malaria research proposal was also prepared.  These were being processed and USAID/Pakistan expected to initiate requests to AID/W upon receipt of GOP requests for program aid.  A similar proposal to utilize Mondale rupees to assist the Pakistan Medical Research Center has been prepared.","Evaluation period: 1 JAN 1978-30 SEP 1978","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","9/1/1978 12:00:00 AM","","MALARIA|Technical training|Disease research|Laboratories|Disease vectors|Disease transmission|Pesticide resistance|DDT|MALATHION|INSECTICIDES|Pesticide spraying|Pesticide application|Disease prevention and control|Anopheles mosquitoes|Human diseases|Limited data","Pakistan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAF862A1.pdf","181 KB","008588 - USAID.

"Evaluates Housing Guaranty project to increase low-cost urban shelter in Panama by constructing a multipurpose community center at Nuevo Chorrillo Cooperative (NCC).  Evaluation, which covers the period 1/1/77 to 11/30/78 and was performed by an outside evaluation team which included a sociologist, was based on an examination of the project's site planning, land use, infrastructure, and construction, as well as of its impact on the lifestyles and budgets of project beneficiaries. The NCC was found to be a dynamic institution able to meet needs on schedule through effective community organization, despite obstacles in terms of budget and target group constraints, and lack of much outside assistance.  To date, a total of 700 of 2,100 planned units have been completed.  This represents the completion of phase one of the project. In addition, an elementary school, baseball and soccer fields, a concrete block plant, a door and window production plant, a materials and tool distribution center, a cooperative food store, an office, community water wells, and cooperative busses are in operation.  Earth work is nearing completion of stage two of the project, with 746 houses planned for construction.  Phase three will have 721 houses. In order to remedy project deficiencies, the following recommendations were made:  1) improvement and facilitation of collaboration between the institutions concerned with development of cooperatives; 2) encouragement by both A.I.D. and the Government of Panama of additional indigenous cooperatives; 3) investigation of ways to reduce lot and house sizes in future cooperatives in order to reduce costs; 4) inclusion of self-help activities in future A.I.D. financed programs; 5) improvement of the financial management of NCC; 6) a study of alternative ways to resolve the financial problems of the transportation system; 7) annual preparation of a budget and financial plan; 8) close monitoring of loans in arrears; and 9) implementation of an agreement with FUNDAVICO to help the NCC improve its internal financial management operation. This evaluation is attached to a PES (PD-AAF-981-B1).  .","Evaluation period: 1 Jan1977-30 Nov1978","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","12/1/1978 12:00:00 AM","","Construction techniques|Vocational training|Housing cooperatives|Cooperatives|Landless laborers|Management operations|Low cost housing|Community self help|Indigenous education|Institution building|Financial resources|Housing investment guaranty","Panama","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAF979A1.pdf","2,629 KB","001814 - Multifamily Housing Services, Inc.","","","English","application/pdf","Evaluation team|Indepth evaluation|Onsite evaluation|Social science evaluation","","","","21 Dec 1978","","525-HG-008","","NUEVO CHORRILLO HOUSING COOPERATIVE","","PD-AAF-979-A1","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc2Nzgx","Panama","525HG08"
"Evaluates project to reconstruct Managua, Nicaragua in a safe, decentralized pattern of resettlement after the earthquake of 1972. This annual evaluation, which covers a period ending 6/78, was conducted by USAID and the Government of Nicaragua's (GON) Vice Ministry of Urban Planning (VIMPU), and was based on GON records and interviews with GON personnel and project beneficiaries. After 1972, the GON developed an Immediate Action Reconstruction Plan (PRAI) to guide short-term reconstruction activities.  In addition, the VIMPU is preparing a master plan for the city that will include approaches to land use patterns based on seismic conditions. Public services such as water, electricity, sewerage connections, communications, health facilities, government buildings, flood control channels, and roads, have all been restored to 1971 levels.  Potable water sales have increased 5.3% since 1973, 4,560 households connections have been installed, and 60,000 household electrical services have been repaired. Various construction projects, such as the Provisional Civic Center, are underway, and the PRAI has highlighted the need for new public services. Since 1973, settlements have increased to 33.2% in the outlying city areas, thus attesting to the effectiveness of GON initiatives, e.g., through the issuance of building permits, to deconcentrate resettlement patterns. A water administrative center has been established in Aguadora. As of 10/77, 2,203 families had received potable water and 2,238 families had received sewage connections.  Generally, the PRAI has benefitted the urban poor in areas of restoration of services, employment, and household water connections.  Additional data and analysis are needed to determine the benefit to low-income families concerning specific project activities. Recommendations are given concerning priority areas for uncompleted projects; GON support for the Small Enterprise Program and initiation of land negotiations for the health center and road projects; and VIMPU evaluation of consultant studies on Managua's metropolitan area and release of these studies to the public and private sectors.","Evaluation period: Through 30 Jun 1978","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","7/1/1978 12:00:00 AM","","Water supply structures|Water management|Water pipelines|Water supply|Sanitation|Urban renewal|URBAN PLANNING|Land use|Sewage|Sewage systems|System design|Health facilities|Building construction|Building renovation|Electric power distribution|Urban areas|Electrification|Road construction|Hospitals|Disaster relief|Beneficiary count|Limited data","Nicaragua","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAG591A1.pdf","1,546 KB","008584 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to assist the Government of Colombia's National Apprenticeship Service (SENA) and Popular Cultural Action Program (ACPO) to improve training opportunities for small farmers and the rural poor. Evaluation covers the period 10/1/76-9/30/77.  No methodology is specified. The project progressed as planned.  SENA was decentralized, giving more power to the individual regions.  The regions conducted their first studies of problems and priorities.  SENA established departments to review and improve course effectiveness and to collect and disseminate appropriate technology for use in updating courses.  Almost 200 instructors were retrained in special farm management courses.  A film library was established, as were agricultural centers specializing in rice, coffee, milk, sheep, and cotton production.  SENA's evaluation system was revised to monitor post-graduation job performance and income, and feedback data.  SENA allocated equal resources to agriculture, commerce, and industry and extended its training service to cover all parts of Colombia. The main problem SENA faced was high level personnel changes that delayed project implementation changes.  Further work is needed in reviewing and improving courses and in assuring that the agricultural centers back up rural mobile programs. Because ACPO was spending more than it was taking in, the loan was renegotiated to buy equipment to generate new income. Continued assistance will be needed in this area until the machinery is in place and producing.  The farm laboratories are now better organized.  Profit and loss records are kept, and a closer relationship between classroom teaching and farm operations has been established.  Revision of ACPO's curriculum has begun.  Follow-ups of farm operations and course revisions are necessary, however. ACPO's progress has been slowed by:  1) the concentration of administration in one person; 2) delays in building construction; 3) non-arrival of equipment, impeding rises in net income needed to fund social programs; and 4) delay in the evaluation of ACPO, causing a lack of sound data on which to base recommendations for change.","Evaluation period: 1 Oct 1976-30 Sep 1977","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","2/1/1978 12:00:00 AM","","Farm management|Farmer training|Apprentices|Educational centers|Agricultural education|Curriculum|Nonprint media|Libraries|Agricultural technology|Appropriate technology|Rural areas|Small farms|Farmers|Limited data","Colombia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAF929A1.pdf","704 KB","000109 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to assist the Chilean National Commission for Food and Nutrition (CONPAN) to institutionalize nutrition planning in Chile. Evaluation, which covers the period from 7/77 to 6/78, is based on a field visit, and focuses on COMPAN's performance and future stance. CONPAN successfully executed contractor pilot projects such as family gardens and casetas sanitarias, and studies, such as monitoring nutrition status, estimating food production, and identifying foci of malnutrition.  CONPAN's continued assistance improved and national school feeding and breastfeeding programs, and CONPAN collaborated with the school feeding agency and the Ministry of Health on prospective regular nutrition planning and implementation assistance. CONPAN's relation with USAID improved greatly and its administrative structure improved after a 7/77 reorganization, as shown by its development of a procedures manual, information system plans, and a functioning library. On the other hand, combined political, economic, and staff personality problems limited CONPAN's performance and power.  In addition, CONPAN's self-induced isolation and independence hindered intra- and inter-agency communication and cooperation.  This communication barrier and a concurrent budget squeeze alienated outside agencies and contractors, and fostered widespread insecurity among its staff who grew pessimistic, keenly aware of salary disparities, and showed less zeal and work competence. CONPAN formed an analysis and planning group during its 7/77 reorganization period. Rather than properly integrating it in the organization by linking the planning and interventions areas for more effective nutrition planning, it polarized the two, causing unresolved strategy and tactics issues. To remedy these problems, CONPAN needs to build information and nutritional review systems; improve intra- and inter-agency coordination; establish an orientation and training program; expand evaluation activities; establish an internal decisionmaking process; and correct salary discrepancies to boost morale.","Evaluation period: 1 Jul 1977-30 Jun 1978","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/TQ-C-2217","","5/1/1978 12:00:00 AM","","Health policy|Sector planning|Institution building|Nutrition improvement|Health care planning|Nutrition|Information services|Nutritional status|Food production|Deficiency diseases|Breastfeeding|School feeding programs|Child feeding programs|CHILD NUTRITION|Infant nutrition","Chile","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAF911D1.pdf","2,162 KB","000885 - New TransCentury Foundation","","","English","application/pdf","Indepth evaluation|Onsite evaluation","","PINES, JAMES M.","","30 May 1978","","","","FINDING THE WAY : A SECOND REVIEW OF NUTRITION PLANNING IN CHILE","","PD-AAF-911-D1","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc2ODc4","Chile","5130281"
"Evaluates project to promote colonization of subtropical San Julian lowlands in Bolivia.  This special anthropologist's report covers a period ending 11/15/78, and is based primarily on interviews with colonists and project agencies, and on visits to project sites and previously colonized areas. A distinctive feature of the project is an intensive four-month orientation program (OP) given to colonists by the United Church Group (CIU), with help from the National Institute of Colonization (INC). With assistance in the areas of food, health, and cooperative management, colonists are required to clear farm and urban lands and to build dwellings. The OP closes with a ceremony, important for promoting solidarity, in which colonists receive settlement certificates.  The OP has helped colonists adapt to a new environment and has promoted solidarity, but socioeconomic integration has not occurred where homogenous backgrounds have led to carry-overs of economic disincentives, such as the cargo system, or of prior animosities.  The OP is also excessively dependent on foreign staff (CIU). In contrast to linear settlement patterns used in previous projects, a nucleated settlement pattern organized around a central farm-urban nucleus and called NAPEDA is followed so as to promote solidarity and communication.  Since these benefits have not been realized where an initial sense of solidarity was lacking, or where ethnic animosities developed, NAPEDA's should be settled simultaneously, and ethnic groupings avoided. There is a need to integrate women into the project through participation in the OP and in agricultural activities.  An intensive health education program, including promotion of daily bathing, is also needed.  Other problem areas are the unavailability of some production loans due to the inefficiency and mishandling of credit monies by the Bolivian Agricultural Bank; lack of agricultural planning to offset farmer concentration on the short-term; lack of government delivery of promised land titles; and lack of a structured follow-up program, including provisions for community services such as light and potable water.","Companion project evaluation summary: PD-AAF-906-B1|Loan no. 511-T-050|Evaluation period: Through 15 Nov 1978","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","11/1/1978 12:00:00 AM","","Private voluntary organizations|MIGRATION|Demographic research|Agricultural production credit|Agricultural production|Subtropical zone|Women in development|Land development|Beneficiary interviews","Bolivia","","","001733 - Florida Technological University","","","English","","Indepth evaluation|Onsite evaluation|Social science evaluation","","STEARMAN, ALLYN M.","","15 Nov 1978","","","","SUB-TROPICAL LANDS DEVELOPMENT, SAN JULIAN COLONIZATION PROJECT (ANTHROPOLOGIST'S REPORT OF 11/15/78)","","PD-AAF-907-A1","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc2OTE0","Bolivia","511036408|511T050"
"Evaluates project implemented by the World Trade Institute (WTI) to assist LDC's in the field of export development.  Evaluation covers the period 6/73-8/78 and is based on a review of documents and data, interviews with WTI trainees, meetings at AID/W and WTI, and field visits. LDC requests for assistance and willingness to pay for such services provides clear evidence of WTI's success.  WTI technical assistance and training targets have been met.  WTI and U.S. in-country training programs benefitted 187 and 504 participants, respectively.  Most of the trainees interviewed reported that their training was useful.  WTI also conducted a total of 58 trade laboratory projects (against a target of two per year); conducted practical export development research leading to the production of marketing and production guides and other tools for use by LDC's; developed the planned specialized library on international trade development; and provided short-term technical assistance to LDC's and USAID's in several areas. The project was funded on an annual incremental basis, and the resulting uncertainty hurt WTI planning and operations; attainment of financial independence by WTI appears to have been unrealistic.  A.I.D. support for the project should continue under continued PPC/PDPR/RD management and should be long enough (at least 4 years) to enable WTI to undertake long-range planning and activities.  Consideration should be given to expanding the program.  WTI's training courses have served as springboards for export projects and ought to remain a key aspect of the overall program.  Efforts should be made either to untie USAID support of training participants (generally required by A.I.D. programming procedures) or increase the use of regional training programs as a source of funding for WTI training.  To increase impact on the poor, no single economic sector or type of export project should be emphasized. WTI should increase its promotional activities among potential LDC clients rather than rely on AID/W or USAID channels.  AID/W should clearly state its support for LDC export development and for USAID assistance in these areas.","Evaluation period: 1 Jun 1973-1 Aug 1978","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","10/1/1978 12:00:00 AM","","Participants|Institution building|Export promotion|EXPORTS|Marketing research|Marketing|Information services|Markets|Economic surveys|Indigenous education|Project change","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAG427A1.pdf","1,459 KB","000163 - USAID.

"Evaluates project conducted by the Community and Family Study Center (CFSC) at the University of Chicago (UC) to assist selected LDC's in evaluating family planning (FP) program effectiveness.  Evaluation covers the period 7/1/76-6/1/78.  No methodology is specified. CFSC has met or exceeded planned targets.  Evaluations of FP program impact were completed in Thailand, Indonesia, South Korea, and Colombia and are in progress in the Philippines and Colombia.  Assistance to Thailand and Indonesia indicated organized FP can help reduce fertility rates.  LDC's already surveyed were assisted in developing methods of data analysis. Computer programs were developed, data classified, tabulation tables formed, and recommendations made for data analysis.  A work plan for analysis of the World Fertility Survey data was also developed and used in Bangladesh and Mexico.  Egypt was assisted in secondary analysis of their 1974-75 National Fertility Survey, and Indonesia's National Family Planning Board was assisted in preparing data from the Quarterly Acceptor Surveys for tabulation. Some 59 participants attended workshops in Thailand and Indonesia on formulation of client record systems and use of computer programs for tabulating FP data, and 75 foreign nationals attended two summer workshops at UC on demography, impact evaluation techniques, and computer processing. M.A. and Ph.D-training at CFSC was offered to several foreign nationals and to one American.  Five manuals were completed on birth interval analysis, functional projections, and FP follow-up surveys. CFSC prepared country and regional population projections which account for present and postulated future effects of FP programs.  CFSC has also developed projection techniques using computer programs and data from LDC's and international organizations. Expansion of project-type activities is strongly recommended.  Since, however, questions remain regarding the validity of the assumptions, methodology, and data of CFSC's analysis techniques, it is also recommended that future contracts be based on competitive bids to obtain alternative approaches to FP analysis.","Evaluation period: 1 Jul 1976-1 Jun 1978","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/pha/C-1100","","6/1/1978 12:00:00 AM","","Computers|Family planning|Development program evaluation|Evaluation methodology|Data collection|Data analysis|Records management|Computer technology|Family planning surveys|Contraceptive agents and devices|Demographic data collection|Research methodology|Demography|Manuals and handbooks|Development project evaluation|Impact assessment|Management information systems|Technical training|Graduate education|Participants|Universities and colleges|Demographic research|Institution building","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAH303E1.pdf","2,230 KB","000262 - American Public Health Association","","","English","application/pdf","Indepth evaluation","","Cavanaugh, Joseph A.","","7 Jun 1978","","AID/PHA/C-1108","","Review and evaluation of Community and Family Study Center, University of Chicago","","PD-AAH-303-E1","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc3MDc5","Population and Humanitarian Assistance","9320619"
"Evaluates project to establish a National Seed Service (NSS) to produce improved seed varieties in Upper Volta.  This special evaluation covers the period 1/1/74-4/30/78 and is based on interviews with project personnel and beneficiaries. Project staffing has been insufficient -- a demonstration program for farmers has not been initiated because the technician has not yet arrived.  NSS, also in critical need of key personnel, has released improved varieties of corn, rice, peanuts, sesame, and soybean to the farmers but has not developed improved millet or sorghum seeds.  Despite the lack of long-term assistance, seed research programs have been established and training has been provided to 10 of 24 planned extension agents and to 11 (against 4 planned) local seed multiplication officers. NSS efforts to determine the effective demand for seed and to allocate the seed produced have been sabotaged by the government's seed pricing policy, the major problem faced by the project. Because the price of seed is tied to the fixed price of food, official seed prices are artificially low--often less than 50% of the free market grain price for the same produce.  It is close to impossible for seed research stations to recover seed products from farmers and, since much of the seed sold is being used for ""cheap"" food rather than planted, the true relationship of demand for seed and the amount produced cannot be determined. Seed can only be produced on a subsidy basis because production costs exceed the selling price.  Efforts to encourage the government to change its pricing policy are therefore essential to prevent the project from being derailed. A.I.D. should also support NSS efforts to improve its reporting system, expand the use of its laboratory, and expand its field survey and collection activities.  A minimum of 5 years of additional inputs (especially personnel) are needed to make NSS self-sufficient.  Increased emphasis must be placed on training, on maintaining the purity of foundation seed, and on marketing the seed produced.  Finally, the program should be supported by a strengthening of the rural development organizations.","Evaluation period: 1 Jan1974-30 Apr1978","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","4/1/1978 12:00:00 AM","","Varietal research|Seeds|Distribution|Seed production|Personnel development|Institution building|Indigenous education|Agricultural extension|Agricultural research|Agricultural extension training|Agricultural inputs|SEED TESTING|Beneficiary interviews","Burkina Faso","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAG387A1.pdf","1,895 KB","008620 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to establish an education program for women in two Tanzanian villages using an audio cassette forum. Evaluation covers the period 11/77-11/78 and is based on an onsite review, including participant interviews. The project was carried out in the villages of Majengo and Kimundo. Project activities included a needs resource survey, production of problem-posing and information tapes, group discussions, and implementation of action plans.  A formative evaluation of the participants' reactions and involvement was an ongoing part of the project.  Evaluators conclude that the project implementation method is viable.  The use of audio cassettes was particularly appropriate since many of the participants were illiterate (67% in Majengo). Also, the tapes extended the reach of extension personnel and proved especially useful during the cholera quarantine when project staff were unable to enter the village.  The project encouraged attitude changes and was instrumental in instigating development activities involving latrine construction, water supply, child care and nutrition, the establishment of a low-cost clothing store, and combatting drunkenness.  Most of these changes, however, took place in Majengo. Several reasons can be given: (1) The village of Kimundo is relatively weathly, and their needs went far beyond the basics.  (2) Kimundo, which is close to a large town and bus transport, already had access to many services unavailable to the women of Majengo.  It is recommended that for any future projects, project planners seek out villages where needs are basic and which have little or no group organization and are not currently involved in development activities. This report provides a detailed outline of the project's implementation and background. A bibliography (XD-AAG-347-1) and samples of evaluation questionnaires are attached.","Evaluation period: 1 Nov 1977-30 Nov 1978","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","AID-621-002-T","","1/1/1978 12:00:00 AM","","WOMEN IN DEVELOPMENT","","","","000164 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to develop subtropical lands in southern Bolivia. This special evaluation covers the period 9/1/74-11/31/78 and is based on a contracted ecologist's observations of the San Julian colony. Present settlement patterns seem compatible with the area's natural resource potential.  However, any permanent settlement must include on-farm management techniques to protect the area from environmental degradation.  No matter which type of settlement technique is used, the final environmental impact of clearing and settling forested land will be similar, given areas of comparable ecology.  Slash-and-burn land-clearing methods deposit ashes which result in 2-3 years of greater soil fertility than in lands mechanically cleared.  Thereafter, farm yields are similar for both methods. Soil erosion from wind and water; stream degradation; loss of soil fertility; drainage and other watershed problems; destruction of native plant and animal species; and use of farmland for cattle grazing are some of the area's potential problems. Proposed solutions include leaving undisturbed buffer-zones of trees to act as windbreaks and to prevent soil erosion; leaving vegetated areas along the banks of all permanent streams to prevent sedimentation buildup; and establishing perennial tree crops or other vegetative cover in abandoned areas to hasten reforestation, increase soil fertility and water infiltration rates, and lessen soil erosion.  Colonies built on very wet areas should use drainage canals to minimize the time the soils remain under water. Sufficiently large sections of native habitat should be protected from any development whatsoever.  Culverts and small bridges are necessary in road construction to prevent road sections from being washed out.  Where existing roads block natural drainage routes, the road should be cut away and small dips installed.  Lastly, the farmers should be taught a crop rotation system.  Rather than allowing cattle grazing on fallow fields, grazing should be restricted to areas planted with fruit trees or other perennial crops.  A demonstration farm should be established to test perennial varieties.","Evaluation period: 1 Sep 1974-31 Dec 1978","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1978 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural land settlement|Natural resource management|Environmental research|ECOLOGY|Reforestation|Deforestation|Soil conservation|Soil erosion|SOIL FERTILITY|Soil management|SOIL MOISTURE|Tropical soils|Cropping patterns|Demonstration|Farms|Varietal research|Agricultural production|Land development","Bolivia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAG318A1.pdf","544 KB","008515 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to develop subtropical lands in southern Bolivia. Evaluation covers the period 9/74-11/78 and is based on the observations of a contracted management specialist. The project was administratively handicapped early on by the choice of a project coordinator who was unacceptable to the National Institute of Colonization (INC), the implementing agency, and was thus excluded from project meetings and decisions.  A new coordinator, named in late 1976, was more effective but was given added duties which severely limited the time he could spend on the project.  Much of the project's success to date has been due to the cooperation between the resettlement advisor and the United Church Committee (CIU), the PVO supervising the settlement/orientation program, and to INC's capable field director. While cooperation between CIU and INC has occurred, the high degree of interagency cooperation originally envisioned has not generally come about.  The failure to fill the position of resident advisor to INC has been a problem.  Also, much of the project's heavy machinery remains inoperable due to the lack of a field master mechanic. It is doubtful whether the project will proceed as smoothly once CIU personnel are withdrawn.  Any Bolivians managing the project will be bound by the over-centralization of the Government of Bolivia (GOB) bureaucracy (an over-centralization designed to control abuses, but which also proves inflexibile) and will be unable to circumvent normal administrative channels as the expatriate advisors were allowed to do. A particular problem is the future of the orientation program.  A counterpart Bolivian should commence training as soon as possible, and a new orientation department should be established to preserve the program's autonomy. The first settlers will become eligible for land titles in 12/78; it is imperative, therefore, to speed up the land titling process, which often takes years, although in theory it can be completed in 3 months. Finally, USAID officials should meet with the GOB to resolve the budgetary crisis, which has caused extensive delays in procurements and funding requests.","Loan no. 511-T-050|Evaluation period: 1 Sep 1974-31 Dec 1978","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","11/1/1978 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural land settlement|Decentralization|Management|Problem solving|ECOLOGY|Institution building|Private voluntary organizations|Land development","Bolivia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAG318B1.pdf","799 KB","008515 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to establish two colonies (San Julian and Chane-Pirai) on subtropical lands in southern Bolivia. Evaluation covers the period 9/1/74-11/31/78 and is based on the report of a contracted regional development specialist. There were marked differences between the two colonies both in the funding provided and the development approach used. San Julian (SJ), a colony of 4,680 persons, was highly controlled, while the Chane-Pirai (CP) model provided support services only in an otherwise spontaneous settlement.  SJ's villages were geometrically laid out; roads, potable water, and machine clearing were provided prior to the colonists' arrival; an agricultural service center provided research, agricultural inputs, credit, and health services; and both orientation and community organization were emphasized through the use of experienced colonists and community promoters.  The site preparation, the major innovation of the settlement, and the orientation processes have been very effective, leading to a more accelerated rate of development than would have been possible in a strictly spontaneous settlement area.  Provision of basic human services, such as nutrition, education, and health, have made the community much more livable than spontaneous settlements, which tend to lack adequate services. Nonetheless, the high per capita cost of this settlement raises questions as to its replicability for large-scale, sustained settlement schemes. A cost-effectiveness index is difficult to calculate for the CP area due to the uncertain number of colonists (estimated at about 7,000). The less structured model is nonetheless highly effective, since the area has shown remarkable development and must be considered one of the most dynamic colonization zones in Bolivia. Further study of the SJ model's applicability is needed before extension of the model to other areas is contemplated. Continued support to controlled experimentation with colonization consolidation is recommended.  Part two of this evaluation examines the policy issues involved in the two colonization efforts (XD-AAG-318-1).","Companion project evaluation summary: PD-AAF-906-B1|Loan no. 511-T-050|Evaluation period: 1 Sep 1974-31 Dec 1978","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","11/1/1978 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural land settlement|Integrated rural development|Agricultural inputs|Regional development|Development planning|Land development","Bolivia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAG318D1.pdf","1,768 KB","008515 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to establish two colonies (San Julian and Chane-Pirai) on subtropical lands in Bolivia.  Evaluation is part two of a regional development specialist's report (for part one, cf. PD-AAG-318-D1) and examines policy issues. The author compares the controlled San Julian (SJ) and the spontaneous Chane-Pirai (CP) models to determine which better protects the human and physical environments of newly developed areas. Although provision of extensive infrastructure and services at SJ brought about some of Bolivia's best social indices, income distribution remains a problem.  Moreover, the number of prerequisite conditions (e.g., availability of human resources and free food) for the SJ model obstruct its replication. CP developed and grew spontaneously even prior to project intervention, making an assessment of the project's effect on development difficult.  The CP approach is, however, a much harsher one for both the settlers and the environment. Project experience shows that improved information on the opportunities available in new settlement areas will accelerate migration. Administrative changes are needed, especially in land titling and credit procedures.  Road construction in new areas should guide the path of development rather than continue haphazardly. Forestry resource management should be a major part of any area development strategy. More study is needed on farm size and technology, i.e., available markets, employment-generation, and efficient use of resources.  Limited financial and technical resources require alternative means of agricultural research.  Use of detailed resource information should preceed any new development; care must be taken to preserve the area's ecosystem and prevent the degradation which often accompanies land development. It is recommended that support for another SJ-type project await further research on the orientation/consolidation processes. Two options for A.I.D. action are:  (1) withdrawal from involvement with Bolivian colonization after expiration of the current loan; or (2) further controlled experimentation at the SJ site in a three-phase extension project.","Attached to PD-AAG-318|Evaluation period: 1 Sep 1974-31 Dec 1978","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","11/1/1978 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural land settlement|Integrated rural development|Agricultural inputs|Regional development|Development planning|Land development","Bolivia","","","008515 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to promote and market contraceptives in Ghana. This special evaluation covers the period 7/76-12/78; no methodology is specified. Implementation of the project was hampered by the delay in obtaining the Government of Ghana's (GOG) approval; national economic instability; poor in-country and international communications; local unavailability of basic supplies; and the GOG ban on commercial promotion of oral contraceptives. Nonetheless, Westinghouse, the implementing agency, has been a competent manager and has received strong USAID support. Cooperation among Westinghouse, its subcontractors, and GOG has been impressive. The Westinghouse marketing plan was well conceived and flexible, and initial market research was satisfactorily completed.  Logistics for the importation of needed products were well planned.  Excellent inventory control and distribution systems have been developed -- the household distribution phase will begin in 1979 and will include consumer sampling and data collection. Pricing and packaging policies for oral contraceptives and condoms have been finalized.  Product advertising campaigns have been developed and approved for the initial launching phase. Recommendations include:  The advisory board requirement should be removed from the contract and replaced with free counsel.  USAID contraceptive supplies should continue until the project becomes self-sufficient.  Condom wrappers should be unlabeled to distinguish between goverment- and commercially-supplied condoms.  Requirements for records of retail sales should be eased due to their prohibitive cost. Marketing research studies should begin prior to the transition to Ghana National Family Planning Program (GNFPP).  A household distribution system using trained individuals should be pursued rather than a vending machine approach. Further recommendations are to increase the number of advertising outlets, develop a product information program for all retailers, and encourage generic advertising of family planning.  After the contract period, GNFPP should remain as overseer, while delegating daily operations to other organizations.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/pha/C-1100","","3/1/1978 12:00:00 AM","","Condoms|Contraceptive agents and devices|Oral contraceptives|Data collection|Family planning education|MASS MEDIA|Family planning services|Delivery systems|FAMILY PLANNING|Commercial retail sale of contraceptives|Contraceptive distribution|Household based delivery|Marketing research|Retail marketing","Ghana","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAC109.pdf","722 KB","000262 - American Public Health Association","","000077 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to assist the West African Rice Development Association (WARDA) to identify constraints to small farm rice production in its 14 member countries and to develop practical means of overcoming these constraints.  This special evaluation, attached to a PES (PD-AAI-590-A1), covers the period 10/75-3/78 and is based upon site visits, a review of project documents, and interviews with project personnel. WARDA's Rokupr research station is meeting project objectives with its swamp rice varietal improvements, which assess traditional rice varieties' strengths and test the adaptability of 350 imported varieties. Rokupr seeks to develop a long-term, disease-resistant variety for current cropping methods and a short-term, salt-tolerant variety for double-cropping. However, the Rokupr and Mopti stations had little information on local farmers and their activities.  It is recommended that Rokupr conduct a sociocultural survey of local farmers and that Rokupr and WARDA's Training Center increase their exchange of staff and research. Lacking a research director, the newer Mopti station has suffered from poor program management and a lack of staff expertise. It is recommended that until a director and assistant director are selected, Mopti be backstopped by periodic visits of WARDA specialists and that construction authority be given to CDO/Bamako.  Mopti's 1977 harvest findings were unavailable at the time of review. WARDA's Training Center has graduated 159 trainees in a series of three courses.  The courses' scientific/research components are adequate, but need more emphasis upon extension techniques and the two stations' operations and research findings. At the regional level, WARDA's Secretariat has a great potential to link its research and training activities to farmer's needs.  It is thus recommended that WARDA seriously consider establishing a Department of Training and Extension.  It is also recommended that WARDA continue its efforts to collect members dues and evaluate, in cooperation with USAID, its impact upon regional rice production. A four-page bibliography (XD-AAI-590-1) is appended.","Evaluation period: 1 Oct 1975-31 Mar 1978","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","4/1/1978 12:00:00 AM","","Research centers|Rice|Plant breeding|National level|Agribusiness|Agricultural research|Varietal research|CROP YIELD|Crop quality","West Africa","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAI590B1.pdf","1,982 KB","008570 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to establish a Clearinghouse on Development Communications (CDC) of the Academy for Educational Development to provide A.I.D. with information on the application of communications technology to development problems.  Special final evaluation, attached to a PES (DOCID B9310925001501) covers the period 1/77-6/78 and is based on an onsite review of the project by a five-person team from A.I.D. and the Academy for Educational Development, the implementing agency. CDC has assembled an excellent staff with complementary skills, and its Development Communication Reports and Profiles have been valuable in communicating analytic statements, project summaries, and state-of-the-art information and in identifying problems of broad relevance. Thus, A.I.D.'s Office of Education (AID/DS/ED) should continue and strengthen the CDC's activities.  It is recommended though, that:  (1) AID/DS/ED actively participate in all questions of project priority and emphasis; (2) target audiences be better defined by gathering field-oriented knowledge through questionnaires or other means; (3) the CDC's information analysis, summary, and synthesis roles be emphasized over its more purely library functions; (4) CDC publications be improved by using a more concise style, focusing on sector applications, not limiting issues to a single sector, and publishing simple ""how-to"" items in separate handbooks; (5) support be given for greater CDC staff participation in professional meetings and field visits to Missions and LDC counterpart institutions; and (6) the CDC develop guidelines for referring users to other development communication sources and institutions.","Attached to PD-AAI-238|Evaluation period: 1 Jan 1977-16 Jun 1978","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","6/1/1978 12:00:00 AM","","Communications technology|Information dissemination|Newsletters|Information management|Scientific information|Technical information|Management|Problem solving|Print media|Libraries|Management information systems|Development administration|Technical assistance|Limited data","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAI238A.pdf","1,270 KB","000070 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to upgrade the ability of Chile's Instituto de Financiamento Cooperativo (IFICOOP) to serve the rural poor. Evaluation, which also evaluates the Agricultural Cooperative Development Project (5130277), covers the period 4/75-4/78; no methodology is given. Under these projects, IFICOOP supported worker co-op enterprises, causing its near bankruptcy by 1/77.  The government's sale of state-owned enterprises encouraged IFICOOP to help campesino, artisan fisher, and reform sector co-ops acquire such ventures. IFICOOP provided these A.I.D. target co-ops with loan guarantees, operating capital loans, technical advice, and temporary ownership of enterprises until the buyer-cooperative was formed. Problems arose as some ventures failed, the co-op structure complicated management functions, and IFICOOP's loan controls proved inadequate.  IFICOOP's 25% delinquency level may indicate poor lending policies or an attempt to help high-risk clients (the rural poor). About 75% of the delinquencies consist of loans to reform sector co-ops that took large credits in 1976 and then suffered from bad crop prices, high input costs, and poor cooperative-level management.  The Superintendent of Banks finally appointed a provisional manager for IFICOOP with total control.  To solve its cash flow problem, IFICOOP drastically cut its deficit ventures and general operating costs. IFICOOP's inability to solve this crisis alone is inexplicable, as its staff already had identified the problems and remedies and were capable of taking action; a possible explanation is IFICOOP's own cooperative structure.  The Superintendent's intervention will probably last until IFICOOP's recovery, which is likely but must be monitored closely.  As of 3/78, lending operations have not returned to prior levels.  A.I.D. has disbursed no loan funds to the credit fund since 11/77. It is recommended that IFICOOP:  determine whether to implement (at its own expense) the evaluation system as currently designed; make firm plans for using the balance of the technical assistance component; and determine the capacity of the co-ops to absorb training.","AID Loan no. 513-T-065|Evaluation period: 28 Apr 1975-17 Apr 1978","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","3/1/1978 12:00:00 AM","","Cooperatives|Financing|Management operations|Financial management|Economic planning|Fiscal policy|Institution building|Fisheries|Agricultural cooperatives|Education|Rural areas|Business enterprises|Classrooms|Artisans|CREDIT|Educational materials|Financial institutions|Private enterprises|Limited data","Chile","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAH958.pdf","48 KB","008529 - USAID.

"This report evaluates English language services rendered to A.I.D. by Georgetown University's American Language Institute (ALIGU).  The study examines ALIGU's language program, test administration and materials development, individual course offerings, and operations.  The evaluation was based on document review, interviews with ALIGU, observation of facilities and course elements, student interviews, and a comparative review of four other English language programs. Recommendations relate primarily to ALIGU operations, with some suggestions made for improvements in the program and support services.
