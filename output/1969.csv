"EVALUATES TECH ASPECTS OF THE DIRECTED CREDIT PROGRAM (DCP) OF THE NATL FEDERATION OF CREDIT & SAVINGS COOPERATIVES (HEREINAFTER THE FEDERATION) IN ECUADOR FROM 6/1/67-6/1/69. USAID ASSISTANCE WAS PROVIDED TO THE DCP TO INCREASE AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION THROUGH THE DEVLPMNT OF RURAL AGRI CREDIT UNIONS. INFO FOR THE ANALYSIS WAS COLLECTED FROM RECORDS OF THE COOPERATIVE BANK OF ECUADOR & A SURVEY OF CREDIT UNION MANAGERS CONDUCTED IN 5/69. STUDY CONCLUDES THAT THE DCP REALIZED SUBSTANTIAL SUCCESS IN A VERY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME WITH 26 CREDIT UNIONS ESTABLISHED OR REVITALIZED IN 4 1/2 YRS. HOWEVER,THE EVAL NOTES THAT THE MOST IMPORTANT REASON FOR ITS SUCCESS WAS THE AMT OF MONEY SPENT. AS OF 12/31/68, USAID MADE GRANTS TOTALLING $125,000 COVERING DCP'S ADMIN EXPENSES & THE COST OF CUNA (CREDIT UNION NATL ASSOC) TECHNICIANS. IN ADDITION, $650,000 OF A USAID LOAN TO THE ECUADOR CO-OP BANK WAS USED EXCLUSIVELY FOR THE DCP. STUDY DESIGNATES THE FAILURE OF THE FEDERATION TO PROVIDE ADEQUATE TECH ASSISTANCE TO THE DCP CREDIT UNIONS AS THE MOST SERIOUS SHORTCOMING. STUDY RECOMMENDS THAT THE FEDERATION ASSIGN ADDITIONAL AGRONOMISTS OR OTHER AGRI EXPERTS TO THE PROG; ALSO, THAT THE NUMBER OF PARTICIPATING CREDIT UNIONS BE REDUCED TO APPROX 5. THIS REDUCTION IS REQUIRED TO CUT COSTS & IMPROVE PROG ADMINISTRATION AS WELL AS TO INCREASE THE AMT OF SUPERVISION & TECH ASSIST AVAILABLE TO THE CREDIT UNIONS. ALL 6 URBAN ORIENTED CREDIT UNIONS SHOULD BE EXCLUDED FROM THE PROG. STUDY CONCLUDES THAT INSTITUTION-BUILDING (INCREASING THE NUMBER OF DCP CREDIT UNIONS) WAS EMPHASIZED OVER PROG QUALITY TO A DETRIMENTAL DEGREE. THE STRESS ON QUANTIFIABLE GOALS MAY BE DUE TO THE INFLUENCE OF CUNA INTNATL WHICH USES STATISTICAL INDICATORS TO ASSESS THE LA CREDIT UNION MOVEMENT. STUDY SUGGESTS THAT USAID HELP TO LESSEN THIS EMPHAIS AND THAT PROG NOT BE EXPANDED ANY FASTER THAN PERSONNEL ARE ACQUIRED TO SERVE AS MANAGER, FIELD INSPECTORS AND AGRONOMISTS.","Evaluation period: 1 Jan 1967-1 Nov 1969","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","11/1/1969 12:00:00 AM","","Finance|Rural development|Agricultural production credit|Agricultural production|Agricultural inputs|Agricultural extension training|Agricultural credit|Credit cooperatives|Credit unions|Institution building","Ecuador","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAA758A1.pdf","36,150 KB","008538 - USAID.

"Evaluates the effectiveness of Guyana's Public Safety Program in strengthening internal security from 1966 to 1969.  Evaluation team consulted with Guyanese officials concerned with internal security and police administration, and visted rural areas. After inspecting border outposts, team finds installations effective in encouraging the development of Guyan's interior.  Progress has been made in the establishment of a joint Operations Center and an integrated command structure for coordination of the 2 internal security forces during emergency operations. A highway patrol has been created and its personnel trained. Telecommunications have been effective in training police communications personnel and expanding networks into the interior. Although US training has benefited police force capability, not enough attention has been paid to training junior grade officers.  The 100 USAID donated helmets have not been used since they do not fit over British-made gas masks.  Also, maintenance of all types of transportation vehicles is poor due to lack of parts, and maintenance techniques. Program would be improved if: l. screening of out-of-country training could be simplified; 2. Guyana's Police were given additional technical assistance, training, and commodity support; 3. a crime laboratory were established; 4. Chief Public Safety Advisor were provided assistance through the Commissioner of Police; 5. Public Safety advisor-generalist maintained US equipment; 6. junior officers received more training; 7. efforts were made to continue police department and telecommunication expansion; 8. more vehicles were secured and maintained; 9. the traffic department improved traffic flow; and 10. an effective planning unit were established within the Police Force.","Evaluation period: 18 Mar 1966-24 Oct 1969|Handwritten on cover: 504-11-710-037","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","10/1/1969 12:00:00 AM","","PUBLIC SAFETY|Police services|Public administration|Telecommunications technology|Police|Vocational training","Guyana","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAP789.pdf","135 KB","008553 - USAID.

"Provides 9/19/69 Special Eval of FY1962-FY1970 Agric Services Proj in Somali Republic (SR) and of Univ of Wyoming (UWY) contractor performance since 1965.  Proj designed to assist Ministry of Agric (MOA) develop effective research program & extension service to facilitate Somali agric dvlp. Eval by AID agric officer at request of USAID/SR & AID/W consists of document review, onsite observation, & discussions with principals & GSR officials. Evaluator notes evident, though slow, progress, more significant in research than in extension area.  UWY staff judged well-qualified and capable in proj leadership; most serious shortfall was in lag in appointing chief extension advisor.  Afgoi research station has provided useful data vital to crop dvlp of rice & edible safflower oil (major Somali import items), sorghum, peanuts, & of grapfruit (along with bananas the major foreign exchange earners).  A soils lab is reasonably operative. Bonka Farmers Trng Center has provided modest, though important trng of 30 agric extension instructors (15 of these now assigned to villages) and 1000-1100 farmers, but has been plagued by lapses in GSR scheduled funding. 23 Somalis have been or are engaged in US partic trng:  14 short-term; 7 BS, & 2 MS. Proj hampered by extended delay in construction of National Agric Center (expected completion date is now mid-1970), & by lack of full GSR counterpart staffing & funding support.  Key counterpart slots remain unfilled, or slated counterparts are still in US participant trng.  GSR funding, erratic & incomplete in past, has been recommitted in 1969 ProAg. There is yet no plan for MOA manpower takover & assumption of operational costs.  UWY team-proposed MOA extension organizational plan has not yet received MOA support. Evaluator deems continued AID assistance through 1973 vital to proj completion, but recommends extension of assistance be contingent upon improved GSR staffing and funding support; otherwise June 1971 phaseout upon completion of UWY tours is feasible, though proj gains would be jeopardized.  UN or indirect AID assistance are possible funding alternatives.","Evaluation period: 1 Jun 1961-12 Sep 1969","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/afr-412","","9/1/1969 12:00:00 AM","","RICE|Oil crops|SORGHUM|Peanuts|CROP YIELD|Agricultural technology|Agricultural research|Agricultural production|Agricultural policy|Agricultural planning|Agricultural management|Agricultural training|Agriculture|Information services|Agricultural extension training|Agricultural education|Agricultural development|Development strategies|Institution building|Project change|Limited data plus","Somalia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAA565A1.pdf","4,045 KB","000035 - U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)","","","English","application/pdf","Indepth evaluation|Onsite evaluation","","NIXON, WALTON M.","","19 Sep 1969","","","","EVALUATION OF AGRICULTURAL SERVICES PROJECT - SOMALI REPUBLIC; UNIVERSITY OF WYOMING CONTRACT (AUG 17-SEPT 12, 1969)","","PD-AAA-565-A1","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc1MzQ0","Somalia","6490038"

EVALUATION COMPILED THROUGH ONSITE VISITS, CONCLUDED THAT THE UNIVERSITY OF VICOSA, WITH THE HELP OF PURDUE UNIVERSITY, HAS DEVELOPED THE STRONGEST HIGHER EDUCATION PROGRAM IN BRAZIL -- POSSIBLY IN ALL OF SOUTH AMERICA. THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM, HOWEVER, IS FAR FROM COMPLETE. THE MASTER'S PROGRAM IS EFFECTIVE IN ONLY 4 SPECIALITIES: AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS, ANIMAL SCIENCE, HORTICULTURE, AND SOILS; AND NO DOCTORAL PROGRAM EXISTS. MAJOR AREAS IN NEED OF DEVELOPMENT ARE FORESTRY, ENTOMOLOGY, AGRICULTURAL ENGINEERING,AGRICULTURAL TECHNOLOGY, RURAL SOCIOLOGY AND BASIC SCIENCES. PURDUE HAS HAD SOME STAFFING DIFFICULTIES. SOME POSTS HAVE BEEN VACANT FOR MONTHS, OR EVEN MORE THAN A YEAR AT VARIOUS STAGES OF THE CONTRACT. IN ADDITION, LACK OF STRONG LEADERSHIP AND COORDINATION AND INADEQUATE ORIENTATION OF PARTY CHIEFS HAVE BEEN A WEAKNESS IN PURDUE OPERATIONS.

AID/W OFFICIAL DECLARES CONDITIONS RIPE FOR LAND REFORM PROGRAM IN ZONA DA MATA REGION VISITED AND EXPRESSES HOPE THAT SUCH REFORM EFFORTS NOT BE ""LOST IN THE OPERATING SHUFFLE OF GERAN."" THE AREA POSSESSES ABUNDANT LABOR RESOURCES, RELATIVELY CHEAP LAND, ACCESSIBLE ROADS, AND GOOD CLIMAT AND NATURAL RESOURCES. HIGH FOOD PRICES AND A DEFICIT IN FOOD PRODUCTION SHOULD PROVIDE PRODUCTION INCENTIVES. OFFICIAL PROPOSES AID SUPPORT OF LAND PARCELIZATION AND FAMILIARIZATION OF GERAN AUTHORITIES WITH LAND REFORM MODELS ELSEWHERE IN LATIN AMERICA. HE SUGGESTS THAT A SELECTION PROCESS BE UTILIZED TO OBTAIN PARCELIZATION PARTICIPANTS WITH LABOR UNIONS AND/OR COOPS BEING GIVEN FINAL SELECTION AUTHORITY. GIVEN THE QUALIFICATIONS OF THOSE THEN SELECTED, AID OFFICIAL FEELS THAT MUCH LESS EMPHASIS NEED INITIALLY BE PLACED ON FORMAL TRAINING PROGRAMS. GIVEN ACCESS TO RESOURCES, ADEQUATE INCENTIVES AND A MODEST AMOUNT OF TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE, MOST LAND REFORM PARTICIPANTS SHOULD BE ABLE TO MAKE IT ON THEIR OWN. ONLY A VERY MODEST AMOUNT OF CAPITAL IS RECOMMENDED FOR HOUSING AND ROAD IMPROVEMENTS; MORE MIGHT BE REQUIRED FOR WATER SYSTEMS FOR HOME & LIVESTOCK USE. OFFICIAL RECOMMENDS THAT AID OBTAIN A FULL-TIME COORDINATOR TO HANDLE GERAN QUESTIONS AND AT LEAST 3 TECHNICIANS TO ASSIST GERAN WITH LAND REFORM QUESTIONS: A GENERAL ECONOMIST AND/OR MGMT SPECIALIST; A LAND REFORM POLICY EXPERT; AND AN AGRICULTURAL CREDIT SPECIALIST. OFFICIAL RECOMMENDS CONSIDERATION BE GIVEN TO INITIATION OF AID PROJECTS IN THE AREAS OF PRODUCTION CREDIT FOR SETTLERS, CONSUMPTION CREDIT IN THE FORM OF PL480 FOOD AID, AND A ""LAND SALE GUARANTEE"" PROGRAM, INDUCING THE COMMERCIAL SALE OF LAND BY LANDOWNERS TO PEASANT ORGANIZATIONS.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","9/1/1969 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural diversification|Agricultural credit|Land tenure|LAND REFORM|Feasibility studies|Development project design|Development project implementation|Development project evaluation|Management operations|Agricultural management|Agricultural training|Agricultural education|Institution building|Agricultural policy|Agricultural planning|Sugar|Food industry|SUGAR CANE|Financial management|Agricultural technology","Brazil","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAA285E1.pdf","275 KB","003221 - USAID.
