"The USAID Municipal Competitiveness Project (MCP) in El Salvador is a $11.2 million project which was designed to improve the competitiveness of Salvadoran municipalities through the development of a unique model with several inter-related components designed to: (1) enhance municipal effectiveness and efficiency; (2) measure the local business climate; (3) encourage private-public and inter-jurisdictional engagement and dialogue; and (4) provide incentive funds to encourage municipalities to mobilize financial resource for improving economic development and security.&nbsp; The purpose of this final performance evaluation of the MCP is to document the effectiveness of the project from its inception in October 2010 through September 2013 and to inform USAID and other stakeholders of opportunities for additional investments.&nbsp; The primary objectives of the evaluation are to: (1) document successes and shortcomings of the MCP approaches in order to determine their effectiveness in promoting municipal competitiveness and business enabling environments; (2) make recommendations for priority activities to ensure sustainability and increased private sector participation and improve competitiveness at the municipal level; (3) identify the level of success of the Domestic Finance for Development (DF4D) component in promoting Municipal Competitiveness Committee (MCC) participation in community crime prevention activities; (4) make recommendations on MCP approaches to encourage increased municipal revenues; and (5) offer suggestions on measuring municipal level investment in the country.&nbsp; The overall conclusion of this evaluation is that MCP is highly innovative and has made a significant contribution to municipal development in El Salvador.&nbsp; Clearly, developing a business-enabling environment within which local areas develop a culture of competitiveness is a long-term process, and it is a process that will likely require sustained interventions on the part of USAID and other development partners.&nbsp;&nbsp; Although the gains described in this report are still tentative in many MCP municipalities, the experiences accrued by the project have a potential to serve as a model for municipal development internationally for those countries that are pursuing municipal or other subnational development strategies that require some degree of decentralization.&nbsp; (Excerpt, modified)&nbsp;","'Evaluation report'|Evaluated project title: Municipal competitiveness project (MCP) = Proyecto para la competitividad|municipal (PCM)|Spanish ed.: PA-00J-Q4R","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","AID-519-O-14-00001","","1/1/2014 12:00:00 AM","","","El Salvador","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00JQ4Q.pdf","1,860 KB","001891 - International Business and Technical Consultants, Inc.

"<p class=""MsoNormal"">A performance evaluation was conducted of two USAID-funded human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) testing and counseling (HTC) projects in Tanzania.&nbsp; The first, a project titled ""Rapid Scale up of Innovative HIV Counseling and Testing Approaches on Tanzania Mainland,"" is known locally as Angaza Zaidi, and was implemented by African Medical and Research Foundation (AMREF) and partners starting in 2008 with a budget of $16.3 million over five years.&nbsp; The main goal of Angaza Zaidi was to increase the number of Tanzanians who know their HIV status and link those who test positive to care and treatment services.&nbsp; A non-profit affiliate of the Johns Hopkins University, Jhpiego, and partners received $16.5 million USD, also in 2008, to lead the other project, Universal HIV/AIDS Intervention for Counseling and Testing (UHAI-CT) over five years.&nbsp; UHAI-CT's main goal was to increase testing and counseling particularly among high-risk populations.&nbsp; Angaza Zaidi implemented HTC through stand-alone voluntary counseling and testing (VCT), integrated VCT and community outreach, while UHAI-CT implemented HTC through provider-initiated testing and counseling (PITC) and community outreach.&nbsp; The aim of this performance evaluation was to provide USAID/Tanzania, the Government of Tanzania, and other in-country stakeholders with an objective, independent assessment of the efficiency and quality of the performance of these two projects at the national, regional, facility and community-based service levels.&nbsp; To do this, the evaluation team used a cross-sectional design to evaluate the two projects and collected data using a mix of qualitative and quantitative methods in six regions: Iringa, Tabora, Njombe, Tanga, Kilimanjaro, and Dar es Salaam.&nbsp; The evaluation: (1) identifies achievements, implementation gaps and challenges; (2) documents lessons learned and best practices; and (3) provides key recommendations for future programming.&nbsp; The evaluation team concludes that both projects met many, but not all, of their objectives and targets.&nbsp; Although the evaluation documents several weaknesses, both projects had more strengths than weaknesses.&nbsp; While all of the HTC modalities played a significant role in increasing HTC and reaching different populations, they were not used strategically to reach populations at high risk.&nbsp; Among a number of key lessons learned by both projects is the necessity for a decentralized approach to project management in Tanzania to facilitate project monitoring, communication, and stakeholder engagement.&nbsp; Neither project created a robust, traceable linkage system to ensure HIV-positive clients are linked to care and treatment.&nbsp; However, both projects made measurable progress towards building the capacity of local institutions and institutionalizing practices for HTC.&nbsp; (Excerpt, modified)</p>","Evaluated project title: Rapid scale up of innovative HIV counseling and testing approaches on Tanzania mainland (also known as 'Angaza zaidi')|Evaluated project title: Universal HIV and AIDS intervention for counseling and testing (UHAI-CT)","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","AID-621-TO-13-00004|RAN-I-00-09-00016-00","","2/1/2014 12:00:00 AM","","","Tanzania","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00JQ5B.pdf","1,687 KB","001891 - International Business and Technical Consultants, Inc.

"The Community Development Program (CDP) represented one of USAID's longest-running stabilization efforts in Afghanistan.&nbsp; The program officially adopted stabilization objectives in September 2010 and shifted focus to primarily rural areas identified by USAID field staff in coordination with International Security Assistance Forces (ISAF).&nbsp; Despite changing program objectives, over its lifespan CDP implemented the same type of infrastructure projects, without relying on subcontractors.&nbsp; The evaluation team considered the following key questions: (1) were projects designed with the appropriate stakeholders, and did they meet the criteria for selection; (2) were community engagement processes effective; (3) were government engagement processes effective; (4) was laborer recruitment appropriately targeted and perceived to be fair; (5) were payment processes perceived to be effective, fair, and transparent; (6) were procurement processes perceived as fair, efficient, and transparent; (7) were training and maintenance plans well designed and effective; (8) how did stakeholders (including the community) perceive the project in terms of attribution and quality of work; (9) were monitoring systems effective; (10) was coordination between USAID and the Central Asian Development Group (CADG) effective, and (11) did the program meet its Performance Management Plan targets?&nbsp; The findings of this evaluation suggest that CDP was quick and flexible, and displayed a remarkable ability to work in some of Afghanistan's most difficult areas. In general, projects facilitated positive interactions between communities and the government and were positively perceived by communities.&nbsp; CDP's success can largely be attributed to its longevity and CADG's strong relationships with USAID, the Afghan government, and communities.&nbsp; By the final phase of the nearly five-year program, CDP systems were well honed.&nbsp; Directly implementing projects rather than relying on subcontractors allowed the program to be more responsive and to have better control over recruitment, implementation, and involvement of the Afghan government.&nbsp; However, CDP was not immune to the pressures of a challenging environment.&nbsp; Corruption was known to be a significant issue and this evaluation's findings indicate that it may have been more widespread than previously documented.&nbsp; (Excerpt, modified)","'Measuring Impact of Stabilization Initiatives (MISTI) Project'|Evalued project title: Community development program (CDP)","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","AID-306-TO-12-00004|AID-OAA-I-10-00002","","2/1/2014 12:00:00 AM","","","Afghanistan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00JQ88.pdf","596 KB","003970 - Management Systems International, Inc.

"The ProJustice Program was funded by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) to address challenges faced by the Congolese judiciary while supporting reforms initiated by the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (GoDRC), as set forth in the 2006 constitution. &nbsp;Tetra Tech DPK implemented the ProJustice Program over the course of five years (September 2008&ndash;September 2013) with a budget of US $20,484,410. &nbsp;The main objective of the program was to develop an accessible and empowered justice system through improved judicial management, lower costs of access to justice, and a more informed and engaged public. &nbsp;ProJustice was designed around four main components, each with a corresponding core objective: (1) supporting the establishment of new judicial institutions; (2) more effective and transparent management of the judiciary and Ministry of Justice (MoJ); (3) more effective, transparent, and accessible court operations in pilot jurisdictions; and (4) increasing access to justice for vulnerable populations. &nbsp;This final performance evaluation helps to assess the validity of the program design and assumptions as well as the overall performance of the ProJustice Program, and to gauge the present landscape of the judiciary in the DRC. &nbsp;The specific objectives of this evaluation exercise are to: (1) make an overall independent assessment of the past performance of the ProJustice Program, with particular attention to the impact of program actions against its pre-established goals and objectives; and (2) identify key lessons learned and propose practical recommendations for the program and USAID/DRC for future rule of law (RoL) strategies. &nbsp;The evaluation found that the approach used by the program on both the supply and the demand sides of the justice system appears to have had a positive effect on the Congolese judicial institutions. &nbsp;With the exception of activities conducted under a fifth component, &ldquo;Windows of Opportunity,&rdquo; all four program components have been deemed appropriate, based upon data emerging from the evaluation. &nbsp;Several adjustments have been proposed to better support the justice sector and provide target communities with access to fair and transparent justice. &nbsp;The evaluation exercise and data confirm that the approach taken by the program was relevant and appropriate, addressing the needs and critical issues that the program set out to achieve. &nbsp;Although there were opportunities for improvement, overall the ProJustice project was successful in meeting its objectives. &nbsp;(Excerpt, modified)","Cover title: Final evaluation : ProJustice program in the Democratic Republic of the Congo|'USAID Contract Number AID-RAN-I-00-09-00015, Task Order Number AID-660-TO-13-00001'","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","AID-660-TO-13-00001|RAN-I-00-09-00015-00","","1/1/2014 12:00:00 AM","","","Congo DR","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00JQFV.pdf","1,183 KB","011492 - Development & Training Services, Inc.

"Funded by the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC), through its Threshold Project on Immunization (MCC-TPI), Imunizasaun Proteje Labarik (IPL) provides support to the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste's Ministry of Health (MOH) with the aims of improving immunization coverage and strengthening routine immunization services. &nbsp;The main project goal is to reach the MCC 'Immunization Coverage' target indicator, which is defined as the average of DPT3 and measles coverage rates in a number of countries receiving MCC support. &nbsp;At project start-up, the MCC target indicator to be reached over the project lifetime was an average DPT3 /measles coverage rate of 81.5%. &nbsp;The evaluation team undertook a qualitative assessment as directed by the statement of work (SOW) for the assignment, and designed a data collection and analysis approach to answer the following four evaluation questions: (1) to what extent has the project achieved its objective of improving the enabling environment for FP/RH in the three target states; (2) which advocacy activities were successful and had a positive impact and which ones had no or limited impact, and why; (3) what roles did traditional, religious and political leaders play in improving the enabling environment for FP/RH in the target states, and how has the development Research Projects Center (dRPC) contributed to this [and] how were these roles different for traditional/religious and political leaders in terms of effectiveness; and (4) what effect did the project's activities have on women and men from the community differently? &nbsp;Based on available data, it appears that IPL has achieved its main purpose of assisting the MOH to reverse a decline in national immunization coverage rates. &nbsp;The project has initiated a wide range of initiatives aimed at supporting and strengthening immunization services, and although a direct link between these activities and increased coverage cannot be proved, it seems likely that together, these have resulted in the rise in coverage rates observed. &nbsp;(Excerpt, modified)","Submitted as: MCHIP Timor Leste IPL program review|Evaluated task order: Imunizasaun proteje labarik (IPL) = Immunization protects children|Project title: Maternal and child health integrated program (MCHIP)","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","GHS-A-00-08-00002-00","","1/1/2014 12:00:00 AM","","","Timor-Leste","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00JQFX.pdf","553 KB","005553 - John Snow, Inc.

"This report presents the findings from the baseline impact evaluation of the Georgia New Economic Opportunities (NEO) Component 2 (Rural Economic Development) and 3 (Assistance to Vulnerable Households) interventions.&nbsp; NEO is a four-year project based in Georgia with the objectives of improving rural incomes, reducing poverty levels, improving food security, addressing production constraints among small-scale agricultural producers, assisting internally displaced persons (IDP) to maintain their households, and aiding communities distressed by natural or other disasters.&nbsp; The purpose of the baseline evaluation round is to establish and report the original conditions among treatment and control households at or near the beginning of project activities.&nbsp; After completing follow-up research rounds, the evaluators will compare the relevant changes that have occurred over time among treatment and control households.&nbsp; The&nbsp; future impact evaluation of the NEO Component 2-3 interventions is designed to provide rigorous and credible evidence to answer the following: (1) what was the overall impact of NEO's rural economic development component on increasing incomes and creating jobs in targeted communities [and] to what degree did the component increase productivity and/or profitability of targeted farms/businesses; (2) what was the impact of providing grants vs. other types of assistance as a means of addressing project goals; (3) what was NEO's impact on increasing access to financial services for underserved agricultural and non-agricultural rural producers, processors, and service providers; (4) what was the resulting impact of micro-grants, in-kind support, cash-for-work, and capacity-building interventions provided to highly vulnerable households toward sustainably alleviating poverty; and (5) did the project affect men and women in the communities differently?&nbsp; (Excerpt, modified)","Project title: New economic opportunities (NEO)","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID-114-C-12-00004","","1/1/2014 12:00:00 AM","","","Georgia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00JQT7.pdf","2,776 KB","012776 - Banyan Global","","","English","application/pdf","","","Woller, Gary|Sommerville, Patrick|et al.","Agricultural development","3 January 2014","","","","Impact evaluation of the Georgian new economic opportunities (NEO) project : report on the baseline impact evaluation of NEO's component 2 and 3 activities","","PA-00J-QT7","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MzQ1NjEw","Georgia",""

"The Alternative Resources in Media (ARM) is a $4 million, four-year program now entering the second half of its period of implementation.&nbsp; The program has three objectives: (1) supporting production and dissemination of alternative content through multiple high and low tech platforms; (2) building consumer demand for news and information by promoting media literacy, critical analysis, and use of latest web and mobile-based media applications; and (3) encouraging public advocacy on media-related issues.&nbsp; The broader goal, as stated by USAID, is to assist citizens to transform themselves from passive users to active information producers in an otherwise controlled media environment.&nbsp; The evaluation addresses a set of five questions focused on identifying what changes should be made in the approaches and directions of the current program, and what recommendations can be made for the design of future media programs.&nbsp; The questions, as stated in the evaluation statement of work (SOW) are: (1) how relevant has the ARM project intervention been to the media field challenges in Armenia; (2) to what extent has the project contributed to creating opportunities for&nbsp;a diversity of alternative sources of information and opinion,&nbsp;increased access to alternative sources of information and opinion, and advocacy for improved enabling environment for media independence; (3) what has the project done or mechanisms has it created to ensure that the project products will be sustained; (4) what have been the added value and/or drawbacks of the project management structure (consortium of three local organizations with an unaffiliated Chief of Party); and (5) how successful has the project been in leveraging resources of (a) the skills and organizational strengths of the consortium members, and (b) private and other donor partnerships?&nbsp; In the remaining project period, it is generally recommended that the ARM project look for ways to be more selective in the activities it supports, giving more focus and resources to those that are most relevant and effective.&nbsp; Specifically, it is recommended that ARM: (1) establish additional Infotuns (regional information centers);&nbsp; (2) take initiatives to support the use of new media tools to promote democratic processes and principles in the February 2013 presidential election -- in cooperation with national and international election monitoring groups, ARM should use its experience and knowledge of new media in projects to help inform citizens about issues, candidates, interest groups, and proper election process, and to assist journalists, monitors, and voters to observe and to report and correct irregularities in campaigning, balloting, and vote counting; (3) be even more creative and proactive in efforts to promote media literacy and educate the Armenian public about the new media environment and how to understand and use the new knowledge that it makes available; (4) make additional grants to assist traditional media making the transition to multimedia news coverage; (5) initiate exploratory discussions on the changing media market with media managers (editorial and business), advertisers and ad agencies, rating companies, and other relevant stakeholders to collect data and ideas on how media will have to adapt to the new environment, and develop concepts for future projects to assist in that process.&nbsp; (Excerpt, modified)","Evaluated project title: Alternative resources in media (ARM)","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID-111-TO-12-00002|AID-RAN-I-00-09-00019|RAN-I-00-09-00019-00","","1/1/2013 12:00:00 AM","","","Armenia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00JR2Q.pdf","529 KB","011933 - Social Impact, Inc.","","008509 - USAID.

"Pakistan's generally low investment in education, and specifically higher education, has severely affected the financial health of Pakistan's universities. &nbsp;In fiscal year (FY) 2007-08, the Government of Pakistan (GOP) cut the Higher Education Commission's (HEC) budget for recurring grants to universities by 21 percent. &nbsp;Also, since FY 2008-09, the GOP has consistently released less money than budgeted for development grants, which support scholarships, infrastructure (e.g., buildings, laboratory equipment) and other development projects, and pay the salaries of development project staff, all of which are crucial to strengthening the ability of Pakistan's universities to meet future needs. &nbsp;In moves that further aggravated the weak financial situation of universities, in FY 2008-09 the GOP mandated 20 percent increases in government employees' salaries (including those of university staff), but did not increase funding levels to cover these increases. &nbsp;In the same year, the GOP waived tuition and fees for 7,354 internally displaced students without increasing funding to the affected universities to cover the lost tuition revenue. &nbsp;USAID responded to the problems posed by these financial cuts to universities by providing two separate cash transfers to HEC. &nbsp;The overall objective of the First Cash Transfer was to expand the availability of university and technical education to students from conflict-affected areas. &nbsp;The transfer was intended to contribute to the ""Investing in People"" objective under the U.S. Foreign Assistance Framework, especially in the areas of higher education and social assistance. &nbsp;The Second Cash Transfer was intended to ""Increase research capacity, improve teaching techniques and laboratory facilities, and enhance the quality and applicability of academic degrees in academic disciplines related to agricultural sciences and hydrology."" It also supported other disciplines which support these sectors including environmental sciences, engineering and economics. &nbsp;The purpose of this evaluation is to determine whether the two cash transfers have achieved expected results. The evaluation should facilitate stakeholder accountability, assess project performance (e.g. effectiveness and relevance), and generate recommendations for improving future cash transfer programs and other programming to support higher education.

"The Liberia Energy Sector Support Program (LESSP) was designed by USAID/Liberia to increase access to affordable renewable energy services in geographically focused rural and urban areas in order to foster economic, political and social development.&nbsp; LESSP interventions were designed to effect the following changes in Liberia: (1) increased, sustainable access and affordability of electricity within urban and rural poor communities; (2) improved performance of local governments, civil society and the private sector in monitoring, regulating and managing the use of renewable energy; (3) an increase in the percentage of households and businesses utilizing clean energy, and a corresponding increase in economic activity; and (4) policy changes that improve the investment climate for the energy sector.&nbsp; Key evaluation objectives of the mid-term evaluation included the following: (1) identifying and assessing progress toward achieving each LESSP objective; (2) identifying unexpected implementation obstacles and the program's responses; (3) identifying which aspects of the program worked, which did not, and why; (4) assessing the effectiveness of the program's grant component; (5) analyzing the relationships between resources available, resources used and results achieved to determine the specific cost-effectiveness of USAID's programming in each objective, as well as the program as a whole; and, (6) making specific recommendations for the final two years of the program, including eventual modification of the program.&nbsp; The evaluation team's findings suggest the following: (1) strengthen the government of Liberia's (GOL) capacity to implement plans for rural electrification as expressed in the National Energy Sector Policy; (2) establish commercially viable pilot plants that provide renewable energy services to population centers in Bong, Lofa and Nimba counties; and (3) collaborate with other international donors for the expansion of Monrovia's power distribution network.

"The Nicaragua Media Program (NMP) was implemented during the period of July 12, 2010-July 12, 2013 by FHI 360. &nbsp;NMP was a cross-cutting program that sought to strengthen the viability of independent media in Nicaragua while improving its ability to produce and disseminate quality information supporting USAID development programs. &nbsp;NMP assisted media outlets in 12 cities and two autonomous regions where other USAID development programs are being implemented. &nbsp;The program's objective was to help independent media outlets improve their content and production quality. &nbsp;Support involved providing grants, each ranging from $10,000 to $15,000, to media outlets and non-governmental organizations (NGOs). &nbsp;NMP sought to advance U.S. interests and universal democratic and human rights through public diplomacy and support for independent media. &nbsp;The program reinforced the mission's goals of: (1) empowering NGOs; (2) promoting economic growth, with equity to private sector-led growth and market-led agriculture; (3) implementing the Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR); (4) supporting at-risk youth; (5) preventing school drop-out; promoting reading to children; and (6) supporting democratic governance and citizen participation. &nbsp;NMP was integral to USAID/Nicaragua's Strategic Objective 1 of Ruling Justly: More Responsive, Transparent Governance. &nbsp;The evaluation of NMP was conducted during the period of July-August 2013, by a team assembled by Mendez, England &amp; Associates (ME&amp;A). &nbsp;The evaluation team consisted of two experts -- one international and one local -- both with experience in the media sector. &nbsp;The main objective of the evaluation was to provide an objective review of NMP in strengthening the viability of independent media in Nicaragua while also improving its ability to produce and disseminate quality information supporting USAID development programs. &nbsp;An integral part of the evaluation mission was to answer a set of pre-determined questions. &nbsp;The findings and conclusions reached will be used to help USAID/Nicaragua make management decisions in a changing political environment and whether, when, and how to continue future support to the Nicaraguan media sector. &nbsp;(Excerpt, modified)","'Prepared under RFTOP No. SOL-524-13-000004'|Translated title provided by submitter|Submitted as: Nicaragua media program final performance evaluation report|Evaluated project title: Nicaragua media program (NMP)","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","9/1/2013 12:00:00 AM","","","Nicaragua","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00JR44.pdf","725 KB","008414 - Mendez England and Associates","","008584 - USAID.
