"The objective of this report is to describe two adolescent family planning and sexual and reproductive health (FP/SRH) programs that have proven to be sustainable, successful, and of high quality.&nbsp; These models are the PROFAMILIA Youth Center program in Colombia and the FEMAP for a Healthy Youth program in Mexico Many countries are working to provide young people with healthcare services that respond to their needs by having specially trained staff, reduced fees, outreach activities, and hours that are convenient.&nbsp; However, government programs are frequently unable to meet the increased demand for services, are insufficient in numbers, and have limited capacity.&nbsp; Increasingly, governments are turning to non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to implement adolescent FP/SRH services.&nbsp; Such NGOs are striving to become financially sustainable; however, this sustainability is difficult to achieve due to the limited ability of adolescents to pay for services.&nbsp; The programs presented here have different financial strategies for achieving sustainability.&nbsp; It is hoped that these models will help other organizations implement or plan locally funded adolescent FP/SRH programs.&nbsp; (Excerpt)","Project title: CATALYST Consortium (family planning and reproductive health services)|Spanish ed.: PD-ACX-267","Special Evaluation","Documents","HRN-A-00-00-00003-00","","1/1/2005 12:00:00 AM","","Family planning services|Reproductive health|Youth|Project sustainability|Family planning promotion programs|Health outreach services|Private organizations|Financial management|Organizational capacity","Colombia|Mexico","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACG352.pdf","973 KB","011907 - CATALYST Consortium|007862 - Pathfinder International","","011262 - USAID.

"This study examined evidence from 33 USAID projects implemented between 1990 and 2005 as the basis for addressing three questions: (1) What interventions have USAID projects employed to strengthen and improve basic education in the developing world? (2) How well have these education projects performed? (3) And, what insight can be gained from these investments that might help shape future USAID funding of education systems? Key findings from the study include: (1) USAID can be proud of some excellent work and documented successes. Projects reviewed in this study contributed to raising education quality, extending access, improving persistence, and strengthening public and private institutions in numerous countries. (2) For the most part, USAID project designs were formulated in terms of education system outcomes (e.g., student achievement, access, persistence, learning) but most project documents available for this review concentrated on the extent project outputs (e.g., number of textbooks printed, number of teachers trained) were delivered. In some respects, this was a reflection of USAID operating practices during the period, as well as the nature of documentation reviewed. (3) A review of anticipated outcomes and targets found unrealistically high levels of initial expectations, which made even reasonable levels of accomplishment appear to be inadequate. Results sometimes were over-promised at the project design stage and modest evaluation findings were sometimes overstated. (4) Findings regarding frequency and magnitude of learning gains and improvements in student flow are consistent with those found in World Bank primary education projects during this same period. Based on USAID and World Bank data, this paper offers estimates of gains in learning and persistence that would be reasonable to use in planning future education projects. Development assistance projects operate in complex political and economic environments, so success of even the best-designed project can never be assured. Results of this study indicate that USAID projects during the 1990s and early 2000s made important contributions to strengthening education systems, extending education access, and increasing student learning. USAID itself was also undergoing almost constant reorganization and reform during this period, which affected systemic continuity and documentation practices. If anything, the results of this review represent a conservative estimate of USAID successes since impacts may have emerged that were not indicated in the documents available for this study. Findings highlight the considerable challenge posed by efforts to influence the operation of national education systems.

"This report reviews the Hillside Agriculture Program (HAP) and other natural resource management (NRM) activities in Haiti and proposes guiding elements of project design for a new agricultural and environmental activity.  The primary objective of this new activity is to stabilize cropped hillsides in key critical areas via reforestation and soil and water conservation, especially on vulnerable sites that pose significant danger to human health and safety.
