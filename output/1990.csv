"Since 1974, A.I.D. has disbursed more than $675 million for more than 120 trade and investment projects.  The majority of these funds were spent in Latin America and the Caribbean, where country experiences with foreign trade are widely diverse. While A.I.D. projects in strong exporting countries have often been successful, there is some doubt as to their impact in constrained economic environments.  This report reviews 15 projects, with emphasis on the following variables:  the country's productive structure; the policy environment; the export capability of the target group; host country support; project delivery mechanisms (public sector, private sector, or mixed); A.I.D. management effectiveness; and level of risk.  The report also classifies the 15 projects according to three generic types: the transmitter approach, which relies mostly on developing and transmitting market information by maintaining data bases and answering investor/exporter queries; the facilitator approach, which provides multisectoral, general investment and export promotion services; and the promoter approach, which offers enterprise- specific technical assistance and brokering services to a limited number of producers in a limited number of sectors.  The report concludes that the promoter approach seems best suited to the weak productive structure and volatile policy environments within which A.I.D. projects typically operate.  The three major strengths of the promoter approach are its high degree of targeting, its focus on demonstrating project impacts early on, and its flexibility in allowing project managers to change the objectives, scope, and level of funding of a project in response to market forces.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","5/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Export promotion|Investment promotion|International trade|Economic aspects|Economic policy","Latin America|Caribbean","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAX237.pdf","100 KB","005742 - Louis Berger International, Inc.

"During the period 1985-1989, A.I.D. supported economic policy reforms in Dominica and Grenada -- island nations strikingly alike in their socioeconomic make-up.  Despite their similarities, however, the countries' experiences with reform were drastically different.  In Grenada, A.I.D. had the opportunity to implement a total reform package after the 1983 U.S. intervention toppled the country's Marxist government.  Nonetheless, reform efforts, which focused on budget deficit reduction and private sector development, were far from successful.  According to the report, these changes failed because they were implemented too rapidly and did not mesh with local business practices, government staff were inadequately trained to implement them, and public and government support and compliance were inadequate.  In Dominica, A.I.D.'s approach was more gradual, first focusing on improving management of the existing tax system and only later working on incremental tax changes and new taxes.  By any economic measure, the Dominica reform program was a success.  It increased revenues, improved tax collection efficiency, and encouraged productive investment. Economic growth picked up sharply and remained strong throughout the reform period.  Critical factors in guiding future planning and management of policy reform programs in these and other countries are identified.","Related document: PN-ABE-171|Companion evaluation summary: PD-ABC-053","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Policy reform|Structural adjustment|Economic reform|Tax reforms|Private sector|Investment promotion","Grenada|Dominica","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAX231.pdf","178 KB","003433 - USAID.

"A.I.D.'s experience with farming systems research and extension (FSR/E) has been mixed.  FSR/E projects have provided opportunities for developing country professionals to acquire training and field experience in this new approach to research. However, most projects have not had the impact on technology development and transfer or institutionalization of FSR/E as had been assumed in project designs. This report, based on a case study review of evaluations of 12 A.I.D.-funded projects, synthesizes the Agency's experience with FSR/E from the mid-1970's to the mid-1980's and assesses the impact of these projects on agricultural development.  Major sections of the report overview FSR/E, summarize project experiences, provide lessons learned, and discuss the approach's future in A.I.D. projects.  FSR/E's performance has been affected by several key constraints, including a lack of the following:  (1) a problem solving approach; (2) effective collaboration across disciplines; (3) links of research with extension; (4) consensus on methodology; (5) stakeholder understanding of FSR/E; (6) agricultural policy and strategy defining FSR/E's role in research and extension; (7) staffing of projects with trained personnel; and (8) government funding to meet recurrent costs. The report concludes that while the FSR/E concept has not been well understood or carried out by project implementers and A.I.D. management, agricultural projects that seek to strengthen technology development and transfer can benefit by using the concept more effectively.

"Interim evaluation of a project to improve the delivery of family planning services in El Salvador by providing TA to involved Government of El Salvador (GOES) institutions in the areas of administration, training, IEC, information management, and policymaking.  The evaluation covers the period 8/85-10/89. Although substantial progress was made in each component, overall achievement was constrained by extremely difficult political and economic conditions.  The project also suffered from administrative problems in maintaining an adequate flow of funding and assuring timely procurement of goods and services. This was due primarily to a complex administrative arrangement between A.I.D., involved GOES institutions, and SETEFE, the GOES organization that coordinates foreign assistance. Training of generally acceptable quality was provided to 20% more personnel than targeted.  However, more attention could have been given to rural health aides, doctors in their initial year of service, and graduate nurses; course design could have been more closely linked to specific jobs; and more emphasis could have been placed on curricula validation. An effective mass media campaign reached nearly 4 million persons. Unfortunately, some of the impact of this campaign was lost due to a delay in implementing a companion interpersonal communication campaign. The management information system has been effective in improving the distribution and warehousing of contraceptives.  In addition, its capabilities have been expanded to include service delivery information that measures progress in terms of couple years of protection.  Success has not been achieved in improving maintenance of medical equipment, primarily due to procurement problems, possibly compounded by less than adequate commitment to concepts of preventive maintenance.  Although a national population policy was adopted, efforts to disseminate this policy and to develop a population data bank have lagged. Several lessons were learned.  (1) Projects involving institution building and developing the capability to conduct coordinated planning should anticipate at least a five-year time frame.  (2) Complicated bureaucratic structures should be avoided.  (3) TA should be provided through a close, day-to-day working relationship with identified counterparts.  (4) Attention to monitoring programmatic functions should equal that given to fiscal matters.  (5) To achieve changes in service delivery, training must be provided to doctors and nurses as well as to lower-level service providers.  (6) Interpersonal communication campaigns require more resources than mass media campaigns.  (7) A computerized logistics management system can be effective in improving contraceptive supply as well as in providing a service statistics system that can be operated by service point staff.","Companion evaluation summary: PD-ABB-859|Evaluation period: Aug 1985-Oct 1989|Project title: Population technical assistance (POPTECH)","Special Evaluation","Documents","DPE-3024-Z-00-8078-00","","1/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Family planning services|Family planning policy|Family planning research|Family planning education|IEC|Reproductive health","El Salvador","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABA289.pdf","1,579 KB","006243 - Dual & Associates, Inc.|000673 - International Science and Technology Institute, Inc.

"Most public agricultural universities in the Third World have developed according to a neoclassical model which limits their ability to remain innovative and responsive to important social needs.  This study synthesizes findings of an evaluation of agricultural universities in ten countries (India, Indonesia, Thailand, Brazil, Dominican Republic, Mexico, Ethiopia, Morocco, Nigeria, and Malawi) and explores an approach for revitalizing agricultural education. Four main problems inherent in the neoclassical model are identified. (1) The effectiveness of agricultural universities in promoting rural and agricultural development is often limited by the policy environment. Three factors stand out here:  the absence of strong linkages to the Ministry of Agriculture; the lack of autonomy concerning enrollment, programming, and finances, together with weak internal mechanisms for keeping university leaders accountable; and policymakers' conservative views of the role of the university.  (2) Another constraining factor is the universities' overemphasis on research in crop and animal production and neglect of broader social and economic concerns and public policy issues.  (3) The traditional university is organized around discipline-based departments, their involutionary tendencies unchecked by cross-disciplinary structures, strong extension services, or well-organized external constituencies.  (4) A final constraint is posed by a highly didactic philosophy of education which views learning as merely transfer of knowledge in the classroom. The paper concludes that a new type of university is needed. This post-neoclassical model would have the following attributes: a broader curriculum to include general issues of rural well-being (e.g., employment, education, tenure security) in addition to the subjects of crop and animal production; an innovative, activist orientation toward both educational methods and educational goals, involving increased cooperation among faculty, students, and local citizens; and a new university structure, in which interconnected task groups are clustered around major programmatic themes.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural education|Universities and colleges|Educational policy|Educational goals|Agricultural colleges|Educational methods","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAX229.pdf","895 KB","003433 - USAID.

"Evaluation of a project to promote breastfeeding in Panama by providing training to health professionals, establishing milk banks, and conducting educational activities for working women and the general public.  The evaluation covers the period 9/83-1987. The project's unique regional focus allowed flexibility in promoting breastfeeding and enforcing related national policies. Regional workshops were conducted for more than 4,000 health personnel.  While no nationwide data are available to assess training impact, small-scale evaluations reflect major improvements in hospital practices and subsequent breastfeeding rates.  Changes include increased rates of rooming-in; increased support by health professionals for breastfeeding; decreased use of formula, glucose, and oxytocin; and decreased intervals between delivery and first breastfeed.  Milk banks established in six Ministry of Health hospitals also helped support improvement in hospital practices. The working women's component is one of the first to examine the problems of breastfeeding in the workplace.  The project held discussions with women in labor unions, conducted a training seminar for 21 women directors of major labor unions, and set up 90 working groups in factories.  During a four-month period, visits were made to each of the groups to distribute information and hold discussions with members. It was found that the women were having difficulty breastfeeding because they lacked creches and facilities for pumping at the worksite. Information activities, implemented by PROLACMA, the local La Leche League affiliate, were also mostly successful.  While the national mass media campaign was delayed and not coordinated with other components, regional campaigns were more successful.  In Chiriqui, Cocle, Colon, and Veraguas, local radio campaigns were developed in coordination with other regional activities, including the milk banks, and helped to support their operations. Overall, information on breastfeeding reached some 49,000 citizens.","Nutrition Communication Project document","Special Evaluation","Documents","DAN-5113-Z-00-7031-00|597-0000-3-76-5304-10","","1/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Breastfeeding|Health education|Health professionals|Hospitals|Working conditions","Panama","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABA439.pdf","2,040 KB","000691 - Johns Hopkins University.

"PACR of a project (6/84-3/89) to develop a phased program to strengthen the monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system for managing rural development projects under the Royal Thai Government's (RTG) Sixth Plan. The project could not be implemented as originally planned due to personnel changes, contracting problems, and procedural difficulties - all of which led to delays in the delivery of project inputs.  Following a mid-term review, the project was redesigned to focus on strengthening M&E at the departmental and provincial levels rather than developing a highly centralized system.  The specific purpose, as amended, was to install data base and decision support systems in the National Economic and Social Development Board's (NESDB's) National Rural Development Coordination Center (NRDCC), pilot implementing agencies, and pilot provinces.  Achievement of this amended purpose proceeded satisfactorily:  microcomputers were installed not only in the pilot agencies and provinces but in all 72 provinces and 30 implementing departments, and management information systems were developed for annual planning and project M&E.  Training in the use of these systems was provided to both service personnel and external information users. However, the decision support models provided in these systems need to be expanded. The project strengthened Thailand's rural development data base (NRD 2C) in terms of reliability and coverage so that it was used to generate socioeconomic information for the National Rural Development Program of the Sixth Plan.  Specifically, the information was used to identify target areas in all below- average villages and some average villages. NRD 2C will be treated as a socioeconomic data base, which will be complemented and supplemented by sectoral data bases.  It should not be more comprehensive as its reliability and economy would be sacrificed. Several lessons were learned.  (1) NESDB is a policy planning and coordination body with limited implementation experience.  In light of this, perhaps USAID/T should have taken a more active role in resolving implementation difficulties rather than adopt a wait and see attitude. (2) Loan funding of TA created problems for NESDB in procuring ""benefits"" (e.g., payment of taxes) for the expatriate advisors who replaced the originally intended TA team from the U.S. Census Bureau (3) Detailed documentation of project modifications after the mid-term evaluation facilitated the ensuing implementation.  (4) Because the project was loan- rather than grant-funded, no funds were earmarked for evaluation. There was a significant delay in securing  PD&S funds for the mid-term evaluation, and no final evaluation was conducted.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Development program evaluation|Development project evaluation|Management information systems|Rural development","Thailand","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABA494.pdf","803 KB","008613 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (1982-1989) to develop the institutional capacity of Thailand's National Energy Administration (NEA) to plan and construct up to 12 micro/mini hydroelectric generating systems. The project fell behind schedule during its first 2 years due to the following:  a flawed model for site selection; delays in negotiating TA contracts and documents for tendering electro-mechanical (E-M) equipment; E-M bid cancellations; and NEA administrative problems.  With a 2-year extension, however, the project managed to construct 8 mini-hydro facilities (4 funded by A.I.D. and 4 by the Royal Thai Government).  These units have directly benefited several thousand families, especially those in newly developed rural areas.  Indirect benefits will be in the form of employment generation, reduction of migration rates, and improved security in the project areas. The NEA received on-the-job training in engineering, contracting, and environmental and socioeconomic impact analysis.  The agency now has the analytical capacity and methodology to select sites and supervise construction of micro/mini hydroelectric generating systems. The environmental impact of the project was minimal.  All of the sites are located in remote areas having little direct environmental impact on villagers and wildlife in the immediate vicinity.  Seven of the units utilize the run-of-the-river method whereby no dam or river impoundment occurs to create a reservoir.  The eighth unit utilizes the power of an older existing dam.  The most significant environmental impact occurred during the construction phase when wide swaths of land were cleared to build the weirs, headrace, penstock, powerhouse, and access roads.  However, soil erosion was later controlled through improved construction techniques. A.I.D./W insisted that the project use the fixed amount reimbursement (FAR) procedure even though FAR is totally inappropriate for a complex hydroelectricity project with diverse subprojects.  While intended to limit the administrative burden, the FAR approach also limited the Mission's ability to monitor NEA actions and processes. Several lessons were learned.  (1) Project design must take into account existing government regulations and procedures. (2) TA should complement existing institutional capabilities and be coordinated with other donor activities.  (3) As economic, financial, and natural resource constraints change, energy project implementors should have some flexibility to change project goals.  (4) The basic economics of and evaluation methods for micro- and mini-hydro as applied to rural electrification should be established.  (5) Evaluations of energy projects should more closely examine the viability as a function of changes in energy costs, capital costs, and discount rates.  (6) A more effective approach needs to be developed for TA contracting and monitoring.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Hydroelectric power|Hydroelectric power plants|Small scale energy systems|Electrification","Thailand","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABA495.pdf","190 KB","008613 - USAID.

"A.I.D.'s experience in promoting democratic institutions in developing countries has produced only modest results.  To review A.I.D.'s involvement in this area, this report examines the Agency's legal institution building programs, using a set of four criteria - management organization, institution building effectiveness, improvements in human rights, and sustainability. The assessment revealed real constraints in the management organization of the programs and projects.  While these may result from inadequate coordination with the Mission or A.I.D./W, they may also reflect a lack of full commitment by the Agency to democratic development.  Further, the more ambitious goals of legal reform or transformation of judicial systems have simply not been met.  Much the same is true of human rights improvements; no sense of broad societal changes in attitudes or behavior could be detected.  Moreover, in cases tested, it did not appear that democratic initiatives would be sustained after the withdrawal of A.I.D. funding. The report argues, however, that A.I.D. can make a significant contribution to improving legal institutional structures in a country which initiates such improvement and openly accepts U.S. assistance.  It is probably also necessary that the initiating country already possesses a basic legal system on which it can build.  Lessons learned are that: (1) to achieve success, the Agency as a whole must transmit the substance and process of democratic development, and not simply the form, to developing countries; (2) regional bureaus must gear program priorities for democratic initiatives to country-specific needs; and (3) Missions must be actively involved in designing and implementing democratic initiatives and not depend simply on a centralized A.I.D./W effort.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","2/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Institution building|Democracy|Legal systems|Administration of law|Legal reform|Social justice|Human rights|Project sustainability|Title IX Foreign Assistance Act","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAX232.pdf","71 KB","003433 - USAID.

"Since 1951, the U.S. Government has provided long-term training in the United States, India, and other countries to 1,719 Nepalese nationals.  This report evaluates the training programs on the basis of case studies of particular institutions and hundreds of interviews with participants and their coworkers.  A major finding is that the programs have introduced large numbers of highly trained people into Nepalese society, who, in turn, have created a multiplier effect by strengthening or creating new institutions.  Most of the trainees have moved to middle and senior levels of government agencies, with a few rising to positions such as cabinet minister, permanent secretary, and head of educational and research institutions.  Many have been effective in diffusing new attitudes towards the work ethic, the merit system, and the need for continuous training into their respective institutions.  It is apparent that Nepal's economic development would have been far less successful without the support of these programs.  The contribution of third country training deserves special mention:  many major development initiatives in agriculture, health education, rural development, and family planning would not have been implemented without it.  On the negative side, trainees have not reflected the Nepalese population as a whole.  Rather, they are drawn primarily from the socioeconomic elite and from the Katmandu Valley and other high-population areas.  Women have been decidedly underrepresented, and in fact, the percentage of women participants actually declined from 14% in the 1955-1964 period to 4% from 1975-1984.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","3/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Participants|Higher education|Education for development|Institution building","Nepal","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAX234.pdf","101 KB","003433 - USAID.

"A.I.D.'s housing and community upgrading project in Helwan, Egypt, has drawn strong criticism.  An October 1988 audit showed that, after 10 years and an expenditure of $134 million, not a single low-income family was living in the new community and many promised improvements in other communities were years behind schedule.  In response to an audit recommendation, this report documents the major lessons learned from the project.  The project context is described, including issues related to Egypt's economy, the USAID/Egypt Mission, trends in international housing assistance, and the level of professional skills required for the project.  Events leading to project authorization are traced, followed by an assessment of the project objectives, the status of the Helwan new community and the community upgrading program, project management and construction, and institutional development.  The report concludes that, in spite of myriad problems, the project should not be viewed as a total failure. Since the 1988 audit, progress has been rapid, with some 7,200 plots fully serviced and most community facilities completed. Housing construction is well underway and initial sales have taken place.  Ultimately, more than 20,000 new housing units will be available to moderate-income Egyptian households.  Moreover, while the project did not follow its planned schedule, a decade is not an unusually long time in the developing world for implementing massive housing projects.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","OTR-1002-C-00-5189-00","","2/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Moderate cost housing|Housing sites|Building construction|Public works|Community facilities","Egypt","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABA548.pdf","2,810 KB","000968 - Planning and Development Collaborative International, Inc.

"In the early 1980's, A.I.D., together with the Government of Egypt, UNICEF, and WHO, developed a strategy for child survival focused on two key interventions:  oral rehydration therapy (ORT) to control diarrheal diseases and an expanded program of immunizations (EPI) against the six major communicable childhood diseases.  This report evaluates the performance and health impacts of the two programs. Both programs have had high levels of success.  ORT awareness and use has spread throughout Egypt and child nutrition during diarrheal episodes has improved.  Statistics suggest that an accelerated decline in infant and child mortality in the mid-1980's is essentially the result of the program, especially of its popularization of home and private rehydration.  However, the actual incidence of diarrheal episodes has probably not changed, indicating that the program's preventive aspects, ranging from promotion of hygiene among mothers to massive investments in potable water and sewage systems, have yet to prove effective. The EPI program has resulted in rapidly increasing and high coverage rates among childen for all antigens.  Although reliable data are not available, EPI has most likely reduced both mortality and morbidity, since unvaccinated Egyptian children are at significant risk from the targeted diseases.  On the negative side, coverage rates for tetanus toxoid injections of pregnant women have lagged considerably in comparison with the rest of the program. The rapid success of the two programs is largely due to Egypt's unique positive circumstances:  the population's cultural and linguistic homogeneity and concentration along the Nile; extensive health infrastructure and large pool of trained health personnel; availability of low-cost ORT and immunization technologies; and wide access to television.  While these factors limit the programs' replicability elsewhere, the programs' flexibility, limited focus, and use of mass media are broadly applicable.  Partly because of the success of the two programs, the patterns of infant and child mortality are shifting in Egypt, with acute respiratory infection now emerging as the leading cause of death and hence the main concern of future child survival efforts.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Oral rehydration therapy|Child survival activities|Immunizations|Child health care","Egypt","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAX235.pdf","68 KB","003433 - USAID.

"A.I.D.'s 1985-89 Economic Policy Reform Program in Mali had two major objectives:  to encourage private sector activity through deregulation and fiscal reform and to improve the efficiency of public services.  The program has decontrolled prices, lowered a number of business taxes, introduced a new commercial code, and loosened restrictions on import-export trade.  Despite the country's inhospitable economic environment, these reforms have produced impressive benefits for the private sector.  The most notable achievement is price decontrol, which has lowered consumer prices across the board.  Business tax reductions have enabled some firms to raise production, investment, and employment (although these gains may be offset by a recent increase in business license taxes), and the new commercial code has simplified business registration requirements.  Changes in import-export regulations are too recent to be assessed, but their effects are expected to be minimal. Although the reform program has made progress in improving the private sector climate, its impact on public sector efficiency has been marginal at best.  An examination of government expenditures indicates that no improvement has been made in the delivery of social services.  Finally, while a voluntary early departure program for civil servants has led to real budgetary savings, there is concern that many of the departees will not be able to successfully establish private sector businesses.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","3/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Economic policy|Economic reform|Private enterprises|Price regulation|Public sector|Taxation","Mali","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAX236.pdf","68 KB","003433 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (1978-1988) to increase the capability of Sudan's Agricultural Research Corporation by constructing research facilities and assisting in the initiation of research programs. The project succeeded in providing the basic infrastructure and personnel for an agricultural research system in western Sudan. However, overall progress was seriously constrained by problems at each of the four research stations.  Construction of the two research stations in Darfur -- El Fasher and Ghazala Gawazat -- was delayed by four years due to governmental policy changes, material shortages, an adverse political climate, and poor management by the contractor.  Neither station is functional.  A director and supporting staff were recently appointed at El Fasher, but research activities are not yet begun.  Work at Ghazala Gawazat is at a standstill due to uncertainty over which government Ministry is responsible for the station.  However, project activities in Darfur will continue, utilizing funding from the World Bank and the Western Savana Development Corporation. The other two research stations, while delayed, are now reasonably well staffed and are carrying out the proposed research activities at satisfactory levels.  At Kadugli, a survey was conducted to identify major production constraints.  Suitable technical and management methods were then tested at the station before being implemented in the fields of participating farmers. However, on-farm research was only partially achieved because of administrative and logistical problems and impassable roads during the rainy season. The El Obeid station had a limited staff, which constrained research efforts in 1983 to a less interdisciplinary program than at Kadugli.  In 1985, however, on-farm trials and other adaptive research activities were conducted. Project training was relatively successful, including 7 Ph.D.'s, 8 M.Sc.'s, and 43 participants in specialized nondegree courses. Two major lessons were learned.  (1) Recruitment, training, and retention of project personnel must receive the highest priority in agricultural research and development activities.  (2) The length of time required to complete a project must be carefully planned, especially for projects with large construction and infrastructure components.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","2/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural research|Building construction|On farm research","Sudan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABA578.pdf","433 KB","008607 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of a project to develop the capacity of Peru's Division of Basic Rural Sanitation (DISABAR) to construct rural water supply and sanitation systems and organize villagers to manage these systems.  External evaluation covers the period 9/80-6/89. The Ministry of Health and DISABAR were insufficiently involved in the project development process and consequently lacked knowledge of A.I.D. regulations and procedures, causing implementation delays. Conditions precedent were not met until 11 months after the project agreement, and construction materials, vehicles, and regional engineers did not arrive until 6 months to 2 years thereafter.  These problems were exacerbated by frequent turnover of USAID/P and DISABAR management staff. Nonetheless, the project made several achievements, most notably in decentralizing and strengthening DISABAR.  The project recruited and trained personnel and provided facilities, commodities, and vehicles for DISABAR's regional offices. Whereas DISABAR/Lima previously controlled all DISABAR programs, the regional offices assumed increasing responsibility for field activities.  Another successful activity was the water supply component, which completed 941 of 1,200 planned systems, with 138 under construction.  The spring-fed gravity systems resulted in high-quality water for 367,000 beneficiaries (87% of target). Several project weaknesses are also apparent.  Village committees organized to manage the water systems received insufficient training and supervision in operation and maintenance, and water users received only minimal health education.  The latrine component failed to meet its numerical targets, and many beneficiaries were dissatisfied with the latrine design.  The goal of coordinating activities with those of the integrated primary health project was not achieved because a formal plan was never developed.  Despite women's roles as principal domestic water users and their contribution to water system construction, no effort was made to involve them in the decisionmaking process. Only 3 of the 75 administrative junta members are women.  While five special studies were proposed in the project paper, only two were conducted. A major lesson learned is that successful rural water supply and sanitation projects require detailed plans for community participation, health education, latrine promotion, and operation and maintenance programs.  Many of this project's difficulties are attributable to its technical focus and lack of attention to social and cultural factors. Finally, under Peru's present economic conditions, programs that build decentralized institutions need continued funding to avoid the collapse of these institutions.","WASH task no. 087","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","DPE-5942-C-00-4085-00","","2/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Decentralization|Institution building|Water supply|Water sanitation|Outdoor toilet facilities|Beneficiary count","Peru","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABA757.pdf","3,346 KB","000333 - Camp Dresser and McKee, Inc.

"From 2/27/89-3/11/89, a five-person PRITECH team was in Zambia to assess the PRITECH-I intervention within the context of the national Control of Diarrheal Diseases (CDD) Program.  Since its launch in 1986, the program has made remarkable progress under the direction of the CDD Secretariat. Among the program's achievements are the extensive training in oral rehydration therapy (ORT) of health workers throughout Zambia, the local production of ORS, the development and distribution of health education materials, and an ambitious and comprehensive baseline survey.  The CDD program appears this year for the first time in the National Development Plan, which lists program objectives and targets as well as budget line items for program components.  The Ministry of Health succeeded in removing antidiarrheals from its formulary and is expected to have legislation passed to ban importation of antidiarrheals into Zambia. These achievements are all the more striking when viewed within the context of the many problems facing Zambia today.  The CDD Program functions in spite of its limited resources -- in personnel, finances, and equipment, in particular, transport.  In addition to these chronic resource deficiencies, the program has had to cope with the acute and worsening problems of the country's economic decline, the AIDS epidemic, and the lack of Zambian doctors (which has resulted in an influx of foreign, non- English speaking doctors who lack CDD training).  To make the most of its limited resources, the Zambia CDD Program has accepted financial and technical assistance from a number of donors and organizations, in particular UNICEF, WHO, DANIDA, and the AID-funded PRITECH Project. This report focuses on the following components of the CDD program (with particular reference to PRITECH's technical contributions):  case management of diarrhea; training; supervision; ORS production, supply, and distribution; program management; health information systems; community participation; networking; evaluation; and problemsolving studies.  The remainder of the report:  provides a country profile of Zambia; discusses the findings of three recent research studies; and details recommendations based on observations at six hospitals and four health centers in Lusaka and in the Southern and Copperbelt provinces.

"Evaluates a project component to provide assistance to Honduran nontraditional exporters through a special debt restructuring fund (SDRF).  The evaluation focuses on credit provided via the fund to two private exporting companies:  Maderas Hondurenas Procesadas, S.A. (MAHPROSA) and Derivados de Maderas S.A. (DERIMASA).  The evaluation covers the period 9/85-8/89. Performance in both companies is improving, but the SDRF's role in these improvements is negligible.  In fact, the SDRF seems to have benefited intermediary banks more than the companies in need.  For example, Banco de Occidente was MAHPROSA's major creditor, yet had no commitment to assist the company.  In both cases, creditor banks received payments in advance without any coordinated arrangement for additional and simultaneous financial support.  In both companies, too much SDRF financing was assigned to pay bank debts rather to provide fresh working capital or acquire key fixed assets. The impact of SDRF was also limited by problems with the Central Bank's revolving credit fund, designed to complement SDRF credit. The two mechanisms are not well coordinated, and neither is very efficient. The loans to be provided under the revolving line were obtained either with delay or not at all, while very few SDRF funds were approved and disbursed, despite a high initial demand.  With regard to socioeconomic impact, results are mixed: SDRF seems more efficient in expanding exports, the revolving line more cost-effective in generating employment. Vague and inadequate SDRF regulations regarding the types of debt eligible for restructuring have permitted questionable types of financial restructuring.  In the case of MAHPROSA, for example, this led to land acquisition and the consideration of loans whose maturities were scheduled for more than two and three years in the future. Further, in the case of both firms the applications for and approval of SDRF credit were not supported by adequate or appropriate feasibility studies.  While there was financial information provided by appraisal documents, there were no restructuring guidelines for the preparation and evaluation of a rehabilitating or a restructuring subproject. Management of the SDRF by the Foundation for Investment and Export Development (FIDE) has been constrained by USAID/H's apparent lack of interest in the fund.  USAID/H has decided to use half of the fund's original resources to finance free-zone parks and plans to eliminate FIDE's role in assessing borrower eligibility for both eligibility for both the SDRF and the Central Bank credit lines. A major recommendation is that the SDRF be redesigned to provide companies the financial support they require for nontraditional exports.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Credit|Debts|Revolving fund|Nontraditional exports|Private enterprises","Honduras","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNABF011.pdf","594 KB","000673 - International Science and Technology Institute, Inc.

"Final evaluation of a Housing Guaranty (HG) program to provide new or upgraded shelter for low-income residents of Abidjan, Ivory Coast, while developing the local capacity to deliver these services.  The program was a joint effort with the World Bank, which financed transportation infrastructure.  The evaluation covers the period 1975-1989. The program radically improved the living conditions and health of the population served.  All infrastructure is functional, generally well conceived and designed, and built at reasonable standards.  Roads constructed under the World Bank program have stimulated informal sector activities, as evidenced by numerous roadside businesses. In terms of policy impact, the slum upgrading and low-cost rental housing components were the most successful.  Both demonstrated that there are low-cost shelter solutions that are affordable to the target population and can be designed and built at greatly reduced standards, and that there are viable means of cost recovery (e.g., property taxes, higher rents).  As a result of new legislation instigated by the program to authorize cost recovery of upgrading programs, full recovery is expected on rental housing.  However, only half of the costs of the upgrading and sites and services programs is expected to be recovered. This is largely due to the failure to provide occupants with legal land titles, which makes it difficult to collect added charges. Another success of the program was that it encouraged the use of small and medium-sized firms for construction, and helped to steer the Government of the Ivory Coast (GOIC) away from the usual practice of contracting very large Ivorian or foreign firms for major housing projects. The least successful component was the sites and services activity. Implementation problems related to land titling complications (particularly for foreign nationals and the urban poor), limited access to credit for the urban poor to build houses on the serviced lots, land speculation, and squatters invading a serviced site under construction. Another weakness of the program was the failure to plan community awareness and maintenance programs.  Although USAID/RHUDO kept commune mayors aware of program progress, there was little follow-up to ensure that beneficiaries were being informed of their responsibilities. Also, most municipalities are still ill-equipped to deal with maintenance needs. The sustainability of the program is evident in that the GOIC is using its own resources to continue financing and implementing upgrading activities that were successfully demonstrated under the program.  In addition, the GOIC and municipalities have continued efforts to improve the property tax collection system by adding more computer equipment and staff and providing training to key personnel.","Delivery order no. 3","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-1008-I-00-9069-00","","3/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Housing sites|Low cost housing|Housing policy|Cost recovery|Rental housing|Urban development|Beneficiary count","Ivory Coast","","","000968 - Planning and Development Collaborative International, Inc.

"Interim evaluation of a project to increase the availability and use of contraceptives in Nigeria through expanded public and private sector service delivery, IEC, and strategic planning. External evaluation covers the period 4/88-12/89. It is too early to assess the project's impact, since the management information system is not operational and family planning (FP) statistics collected so far are unreliable. However, there is evidence that the number of new acceptors has gone from about 96,000 in 1985 to over 400,000 in 1988.  Project progress is clearly indicated by the initiation of subprojects in 16 states and the signing of 104 subcontracts with Nigerian institutions.  Specific achievements include, inter alia, equipping and staffing 107 public health facilities for clinical and non-clinical FP services; training 250 private nurse/midwives in FP services (including IUD insertions); distribution of FP commodities through 3,500 private commercial outlets; initiation of four statewide IEC campaigns; production of an album and music video by Sunny Ade and Onyeka Onwenu promoting FP; and development of a module for the Federal Office of Statistics' upcoming national household survey. Several issues merit attention.  (1) Although the project's contraceptive prevalence goal of 12% will likely be achieved, the project has far to go to establish a well-coordinated FP program. (2) Because the various project components were designed to be largely independent of each other, special efforts will have to be made to reduce the potential for duplication and inefficiencies and to improve the coordination among contractors and components.  (3) Progress in the pivotal private sector component has been slow.  While private companies are participating in contraceptive distribution, plans for commercial marketing and advertising are still in preliminary form. Moreover, the strategy being employed in some service delivery activities with private providers is not sustainable.","Project title: Population technical assistance (POPTECH)","Special Evaluation","Documents","DPE-3024-Z-00-8078-00","","2/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Contraceptive distribution|IEC|Contraceptive prevalence|Family planning services","Nigeria","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABA893.pdf","2,018 KB","006243 - Dual & Associates, Inc.|000673 - International Science and Technology Institute, Inc.

"PACR of a project (1984-1989) to improve the capacity of Indonesia's Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) in policymaking and planning through TA, special studies, training, and commodities and commodity services. Thanks in part ot a highly qualified TA team, the project achieved a number of its objectives and, in the case of training, significantly exceeded targets.  Whereas plans were to provide Master's degree training for 30 individuals and short-term courses in planning and policy analysis for 375 MOA staff, actual outputs were 47 Master's degrees, 8 Ph.D.'s, and 1,633 short-term trainees.  The target number of practica was also exceeded, with 24 completed in three provinces, compared with the planned 10 in two provinces.  The practica, along with short-term training, resulted in better coordination of central and provincial planning units.  The project also provided English- language training to 321 MOA central and provincial staff. Although the implementation of a centralized national agricultural data base was infeasible due to the overwhelming size of the information base, insufficient computer capacity, and inadequate demand, the provision of 73 microcomputers facilitated the development of decentralized data bases throughout the MOA. Since the planned reorganization of the MOA never occurred, the formal system for sharing information among MOA agencies was never developed.  These offices did, however, benefit from project-supported seminars, special studies, and computerization. The special studies completed under the project resulted in numerous reports and recommendations on specific policy issues. For example, project-generated information was used by an inter- ministerial working group in devising a strategy for phasing out fertilizer subsidies and by the provincial House of Representatives in Central Java to draft a law on cropping patterns. Lessons learned include the following.  (1) Host country cash and in-kind contributions should be utilized consistently.  A.I.D. should develop mechanisms to improve monitoring of these contributions.  (2) Members of working groups or project steering committees should not include individuals of high ministerial rank, since it is usually impossible to draw these individuals together regularly to provide effective direction.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","3/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural planning|Policy analysis|Agricultural policy|Participants|Technical training","Indonesia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABA899.pdf","434 KB","008558 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (8/92-6/88) to develop a virus-resistance tomato variety and test it under Somali conditions.  The project began as a 4-year innovative research project under 9365542; in 1986, the remaining funds and the administration of the project were transferred to USAID/Somalia. One participant was sent in 1983 for short-term training in vegetable production at the Asean Vegetable Research and Development Center in Taiwan.  He returned with a number of tomato germplasm samples and initiated testing them at the CARS (Central Agricultural Research Stations of the Ministry of Agriculture) for growth and production under Somali conditions. Several promising varieties were identified. Two attempts (in 1982 and 1984) were made to arrange for the visit of a consultant in tomato research who would help focus the research program and assist in ordering commodities for the laboratory. Arrangements failed because of problems in identifying a qualified consultatnt and differences between the Mission and AID/W as to which party would do the contracting. Upon the departure of the FAO expert assigned to CARS who had assisted the Somali researcher since the beginning of the project, the primary counterpart researcher was sent to the U.S. to get an M.S. in vegetable production, with emphasis on tomatoes. This action was preferred over bringing in a short-term consultant.  Although the Somali researcher was scheduled to return in October 1988 to assume the leadership in vegetable research, he defected to Canada and has not returned to Somalia. Project objectives and purposes were not well-defined.  There was no long-term TA component, and the only consultancy was cancelled.  Scant attention was given to this project by USAID and the MOA.  The result was that the project purpose was not met, and only $54,270 of a planned $218,000 (A.I.D./Somali) funding was spent.  The undisbursed funds will be deobligated and returned to the U.S. Treasury.

"Rwanda is an exception among low-income developing countries in that it has given high priority to environmental and natural resource management (NRM) issues.  This paper describes A.I.D.'s support for these efforts and explores the possibility of integrating them into agricultural and rural development programs in Rwanda and elsewhere in sub-Saharan Africa.  Major findings are as follows.  (1) Government support is a prerequisite to developing the long-term strategies needed to address specific NRM issues.  (2) Developing appropriate NRM technologies is a complex undertaking requiring site-specific applied research. (3) Donors should appreciate the difficulty host countries face in balancing NRM with development, conservation, and equity objectives.  (4) USAID/Rwanda assistance has covered a wide range of NRM activities, many of them complementary to those of other donors, some part of a coordinated multi-donor effort.  Such collaboration is especially necessary in complex projects.  (5) The Mission's program includes several innovative and potentially replicable approaches, including the promotion of ecotourism in conjunction with wildlife conservation and park management, and agroforestry and fish farming to conserve soil and water resources while increasing farm productivity. Since such activities often require costly investments and yield their ecological and economic benefits only in the long term, a broader framework than simple cost-benefit analysis might be needed in attempting to incorporate them into USAID/Rwanda's agricultural and rural development portfolio.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","4/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Natural resource management|Environmental protection|Natural resource conservation|Protected environmental areas|Ecotourism|Project replication","Rwanda","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNABC904.pdf","51 KB","003433 - USAID.

"PACR of a commodity import program (1985-1987) to provide balance of payments support to the Government of Mauritius (GOM) while economic reforms are being undertaken. The program provided support at a crucial time in the reform process, and, largely due to strong GOM commitment, all program objectives were fully met.  Pragmatic economic policies were adopted that are fostering substantial increases in industrial output, personal income, and improved social services for the population.  Specifically, the grant supported significant reductions (from 330% to 127% at the maximum tariff level) to reduce distortions in the manufacturing sector and improve the cost competitiveness of export manufacturing.  These changes played a major role in increasing the exports of manufactured goods, and it is expected that all businesses, irrespective of size, will benefit in the long term.  Additional program outcomes include a significant increase in tourism receipts and a substantial increase in private capital flows into Mauritius in the form of private transfers. Local currency generations were used for the following purposes: (1) promotion of tourism; (2) water supply projects in the north (to encourage tourism there); (3) the GOM's environmental program; (4) TA in health management and export development; and (5) a vocational training facility. No long-term dependency on the part of either the GOM or the private sector is expected to result from the CIP.  The balance of payments registered an SDR 133 million surplus for 1987, and total foreign exchange reserves in the hands of the banking system rose substantially. This strongly favorable situation compels A.I.D. to formulate new strategies for future support to the GOM. This CIP, while delayed significantly during the GOM's structural adjustment negotiations with the World Bank and the African Development Bank, was the first African Economic Policy Reform Program to disburse fully, reflecting the GOM's commitment to reform.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Balance of payments|Economic reform|Tariffs|Commodity import programs","Mauritius","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDBBT213.pdf","182 KB","000026 - USAID.

"Interim evaluation of a project to disseminate population research findings in a succinct and visually appealing manner to developing country policymakers and leaders as well as to the population donor community (including A.I.D.).  External evaluation covers the period 8/85-4/90. The project has produced a large number and range of professional, attractive, accurate, and well-received materials about population issues.  Major subprojects have used a number of dissemination strategies, including radio, newspapers, interactive computer simulations, and country-specific booklets, to inform policymakers of population issues.  Minor subprojects have generated booklets that highlight successful family planning programs in the public and private sectors and that can be distributed to other countries.  In general, the topics are perceived as relevant, important, and useful by different audiences.  One-third of policymakers surveyed say project materials have made a noticeable contribution to population or family planning policy in their countries.  However, it is recommended that the materials be made more credible and appealing by including more local and regional information and by conveying local rather than U.S. endorsement. Project management is functioning smoothly and staff are competent, dedicated, and motivated.  Although in-house recordkeeping systems have been inadequate, they are improving. On the negative side, the project has not been successful in reaching a great number of policymakers, the intended target audience.  The current mailing list strategy is costly, labor- intensive, and somewhat inefficient.  On the other hand, the materials are being used by audiences other than policymakers in such activities as training. A follow-on project is recommended, which should focus on local or regional materials, collaboration with other cooperative agreements, technology transfer, and tighter targeting of audiences.","Project title: Population technical assistance (POPTECH)","Special Evaluation","Documents","DPE-3024-Z-00-8078-00","","5/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Family planning policy|Policy making|Family planning education|Educational materials|Family planning research","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABA977.pdf","2,097 KB","006243 - Dual & Associates, Inc.|000673 - International Science and Technology Institute, Inc.

"PACR of a project (1984-1989) to improve watershed management in Southeast Asia by providing TA, training, and equipment. An interim evaluation found that the original project objective of developing a regional research network was unsuitable and called for a shift in emphasis to training and information exchange.  In response, the project provided a wide range of educational activities, including graduate studies in the United States and Southeast Asia for 11 students, 5 seminars, 6 workshops, 11 training courses, 3 study tours, and a symposium. The 972 professionals who participated in the training activities have contributed to better management of watershed resources and enhanced cooperation among national watershed agencies.  The project also produced a number of publications, including technical manuals for each participating country. Several lessons were learned.  (1) Projects covering broad areas such as watershed management should identify and concentrate on a few important problem areas.  (2) It would be useful to assemble watershed management information into a training manual for university students, professionals, and technicians.  (3) Courses should cover basic principles of socio-economic measurement, incentives, market and infrastructure development, economic production functions, cost-benefit analyses, and case studies. (4) Symposia are costly and have limited impact on watershed management research and skills.","Title supplied by cataloger|Related document: PD-ABP-439","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","4/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Watersheds|Technical training|Environmental research|Natural resource management|Regional development|Scientific cooperation","Southeast Asia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABA983.pdf","86 KB","008613 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (1980-1990) to strengthen the capacity of Burundi's National Office for Peat (ONATOUR) to develop peat for non-industrial thermal energy use. Although the Burundi peat industry is still confronted with formidable marketing and technical obstacles to economic viability, the project successfully accomplished its goal and purpose.  All targets were met in terms of TA, commodity procurement, marketing, training, construction, research, and bog reclamation.  A year after the PACD, ONATOUR appears to be well established and making steady progress.  It has good management, an aggressive marketing strategy, and adequate technical support. In addition to streamlining its peat production and sales position, it has developed a small but profitable market in a peat-based fertilizer product and, with donor assistance, is expanding the production of peat briquettes.  Peat is now an economically competitive fuel, particularly when compared with petroleum fuels.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","4/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Peat|Alternative energy resources|Energy costs|Nonrenewable energy resources","Burundi","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABA984.pdf","136 KB","008522 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (1984-1989) to improve the technical and managerial abilities of small and medium enterprises (SME's) in Southeast Asia by funding training, TA, plant visits, and technical missions to the United States. The project increased interest in SME development and was a great source of information for the new Private Investment and Trade Opportunities project (3980361).  Activities were implemented by 4 agencies.  (1) Technonet provided 20 technical workshops, 9 workshops combined with consultancies, 2 symposia, and 128 person-months of consultancy service to over 2,000 workshop participants.  (2) The U.S.-ASEAN Center for Technology Exchange conducted country seminars for about 3,300 participants and organized technical missions to explore joint ventures with U.S. firms and to study U.S. technology.  (3) The Asian Institute of Management completed 65 case studies and provided 7 short courses on case writing, marketing, finance, and production.  (4) The Institute of Southeast Asian Studies published national studies on financial, marketing, and production management. Several lessons were learned.  (1) A regional approach for SME development is cost-effective, since the same consultants and other inputs are used to serve several countries.  (2) NGO's can provide better service at a lower cost than government agencies. (3) SME's can gain more benefit from consultancies, demonstrations, plant visits, and interaction with other SME's than from formal classroom sessions.  (4) The case method is a preferred way to teach general business principles to SME's and is a sound development investment.  (5) Networking and information exchange have potential for optimizing results of country investments in SME assistance.  (6) Individual country workshops are preferable to regional workshops due to the high costs and language difficulties connected with the latter.  (7) The policy-relevant findings of individual project studies should be consolidated and disseminated.","Title supplied by cataloger","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","4/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Business support services|Small scale enterprises|Medium scale enterprises|Technical training|Management training","Southeast Asia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABA985.pdf","148 KB","008613 - USAID.

"Evaluates RSSA with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) to provide assistance in logistics management and associated activities to improve family planning programs worldwide.  The evaluation covers the period 1987-1989. CDC has a long track record of excellent work, and Mission staff are satisfied with CDC's in-country contributions.  Notable technical innovations have occurred in both logistics and survey work -- the most significant being the computerized contraceptive commodity management information system, the contraceptive prevalence survey, and the young adult reproductive health survey.  CDC's ability to link logistics and survey activities makes it a unique resource for A.I.D. CDC has placed less emphasis on transferring survey and logistics skills to the host countries.  While some institutionalization has occurred in survey work, this has been primarily the by- product of strong TA, rather than a result of thoughtful planning.  With respect to logistics, the level of institutionalization is even lower, especially considering the long duration of CDC assistance in this area.  In part due to personnel constraints, trips to any given country remain typically short and infrequent, particularly those for forecasting contraceptive requirements.  This pattern has changed somewhat over the past year, but will need to change more if skills are to be transferred and institution building is to become a primary objective.  In general, CDC needs to move from a reactive approach -- a major cause of the current malaise of the logistics staff -- to one characterized by strategic program and project planning. long-term PASA which is expected to replace the RSSA, which expires in March, 1990.  A major concern of the PASA should be to ensure a dependable logistics system, preferably one based on institutionalized in-country capabilities.","Project title: Population technical assistance (POPTECH)","Special Evaluation","Documents","DPE-3024-Z-00-8078-00","","5/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Logistics|Family planning surveys|Institution building|Contraceptive prevalence surveys","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABB023.pdf","1,703 KB","006243 - Dual & Associates, Inc.|000673 - International Science and Technology Institute, Inc.

"Evaluates a project implemented by Eye Care in the Anse a Foleur and Saint Louis du Nord districts in northwest Haiti to (1) develop a service delivery infrastructure to improve the nutritional status of and Vitamin A intake by area children, (2) train mothers in oral rehydration therapy (ORT) and nutrition, and (3) conduct an impact study of vitamin A supplementation on childhood morbidity and mortality.  Final evaluation covers the period 10/86 to 2/90. Despite the fact that project activities were carried out under extremely difficult logistics and during a period of political turmoil, Eye Care was generally able to adhere to its timetable and achieve its objectives.  Eye Care made new outreach services available, substantially increasing the accessibility and utilization of primary health care services for children and mothers and the proportion of children receiving Vitamin A supplementation.  Eye Care's research study, the first of its kind in the Western Hemisphere, was successful and probably helped to strengthen the project's service delivery component. Community acceptance of the project is demonstrated by the progressive increase in the rate of coverage over the life of the project. Worthy of particular mention is that the project was designed and carried out entirely by Haitians. On the negative side, the project was hampered by a shortage of field managers; lack of clear plans for training, monitoring, and evaluation; and unnecessary hand tabulation of data.  In addition, extreme delays in data coding resulted in a lost opportunity for detection of differences in morbidity between treatment groups, and for adequate supervision and improvement of data quality.  Additional TA and a midterm evaluation could have improved the quality of interventions and efficiency of operations.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","DAN-5116-C-00-9114-00","","4/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Child nutrition|Dietary supplements|Vitamin A|Rural areas|Child survival activities|Nutrition improvement|Nutrition research","Haiti","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABB065.pdf","1,560 KB","000673 - International Science and Technology Institute, Inc.

"Interim evaluation of a project to strengthen and expand efforts of Peru's Institute for Liberty and Democracy (ILD) to conduct economic research and advocate and implement market-based economic reform.  The evaluation covers the period 2/89-3/90. This first year of the project has been a successful one.  The ILD has made remarkable progress in moving beyond its impressive achievements in research, advocacy, and the drafting of laws to direct involvement in implementing proposed reforms; the Cooperative Agreement should be modified to reflect this important evolution, which will also require ILD to reallocate its resources between research and implementation activities.  In regard to outreach, ILD has successfully launched a training program for international visitors, signed agreements for technical cooperation with three governments (Sri Lanka, Bolivia, and El Salvador), and opened an office in the United States. Internally, ILD has taken concrete and productive steps to improve its financial management, planning, and reporting capacities, and has fine-tuned its research activities very effectively.  It has also made progress in disaggregating and analyzing data to examine the role of women in the informal sector.  While financial reporting and accounting systems require some additional improvements, the Institute has already taken some significant steps in that direction through its selection of new, highly qualified financial management personnel, and through progress in the design of a new accounting system. Organizationally, ILD has grown substantially over the last year in terms of budget, size of staff, and the complexity of its research and implementation activities.  This has put some strain on top management, which is now responsible for supervising six major research circles, a national promotion and information dissemination program, a fundraising/fund diversification program, and general administration and financial reporting activities.  It is recommended that ILD adopt an organizational division into national and international programs, each with its own manager.  A formal personnel policy is also urged. In view of the increasingly complex and evolving nature of the ILD program and its global importance as a laboratory for A.I.D.'s development assistance agenda, it is recommended that USAID/Peru assign a full-time project advisor/coordinator to this project.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","3/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Policy analysis|Advocacy|Policy reform|Institution building|Financial management|Economic policy|Economic research","Peru","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABB066.pdf","1,656 KB","005762 - Ernst & Young","","000165 - USAID.

"Evaluates the delivery of family planning (FP) services by, and the provision of FP training within, Turkey's Ministry of Health (MOH), with an emphasis on the inputs provided by A.I.D. cooperating agencies. The MOH delivers FP services at hospitals and clinics in cities and at health centers and health posts in rural areas.  While policy support for FP has been consistent, implementation has been hindered by frequent changes in MOH leadership and by a widespread reduction in policy-level support for public health in general.  The primary health care (PHC) system works, but places the burden of outreach on frequently inexperienced and inadequately trained midwives. The two most popular contraceptive methods are withdrawal and IUD's, which account, respectively, for 40% and 22% of all contraceptive use. Condoms rank third, and their use is increasing, whereas the use of orals is low and declining. Clinical FP services stress IUD insertion and the provision of condoms for those who cannot use IUD's.  A major problem is the unavailability of sterilization to most women:  there is a large unmet need for permanent contraception. The MOH's in-service training program has trained more than 3,700 midwives and nurses and 2,500 general practitioners to insert and manage IUD's safely.  Although the program's capacity is substantial, it is not sufficient to compensate for the rapid turnover of personnel, especially at rural health care centers, only 35% of which have personnel trained and certified to insert IUD's.  Other needed improvements include: expansion of FP education to include a wider range of contraceptive methods, particularly the pill; expansion and standardization of FP curriculum in medical schools; stronger clinical training for midwifery students; and better training and utilization of male nurses in FP. A.I.D. cooperating agencies in Turkey's FP program include the Program for International Training in Health (INTRAH), the Association for Voluntary Surgical Contraception (AVSC), the Johns Hopkins Program for International Education in Gynecology and Obstetrics (JHPIEGO), the Pathfinder Fund, and RONCO Consulting Corporation. entire FP training effort more effective.  INTRAH helped develop the training curriculum, RONCO trained the central training team in the use of participatory methods, and JHPIEGO helped the MOH expand its training capacity and develop an objective way of evaluating IUD insertion training. Pathfinder helped the MOH develop a FP curriculum intended for all midwifery schools. RONCO assisted the MOH in conducting an important training of trainers project for principals and tutors from midwifery schools that culminated in the development of a FP training manual which is based on field needs assessments, addresses actual problems, and will be used in every pre-service midwifery school.  JHPIEGO has trained and equipped gynecologists to perform laparoscopic tubal sterilizations, and AVSC is training physicians to conduct minilaparotomies and nurses, psychologists, and others to educate and counsel women regarding sterilization and other methods of contraception.","Project title: Population technical assistance (POPTECH)","Special Evaluation","Documents","DPE-3024-Z-00-8078-00","","4/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Family planning services|Health professional education|Nurse midwives|Family planning education","Turkey","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNABF277.pdf","2,448 KB","006243 - Dual & Associates, Inc.|000673 - International Science and Technology Institute, Inc.

"Interim evaluation of a cooperative agreement with Family Health International (FHI) to carry out research on contraceptive methods.  The evaluation covers the period 1984-12/89 and was prepared in preparation for an expected 5-year extension of the cooperative agreement. In general, FHI's work is innovative, useful, and of high quality. In every avenue pursued, FHI has been able to document observable impact.  The clinical trials division (which absorbs about half the project budget) has shifted emphasis from evaluating existing methods to developing and introducing new ones.  This change was appropriate since, in the case of several methods (e.g., IUD's and pills), the most useful avenues of research had been well explored.  Some of the new products under development appear very promising, including NET-90 injectable, plastic condoms, D-propranolol, and iodine delivery for non- surgical female sterilization. The field development and training division (25% of the project budget) manages a unique network of some 200 clinical centers in more than 50 countries and provides support to family health research centers in nine developing countries.  The division also coordinates the introduction of new methods, disseminates research findings, and provides monitoring and support to the other divisions.  An expected expansion of responsibilities is causing some concern, however, since the division's staff is already stretched too thin. The program evaluation division has done some excellent project- specific work.  However, its overall portfolio, which is divided into eight loosely related categories, could be better focused. This dispersion of efforts is the result of FHI's attempts to respond to Mission requests. The reproductive epidemiology and sexually transmitted disease division has made important contributions, particularly in responding to fears about a possible relationship between the pill and cancer. The organization is smoothly run, with high staff morale and good internal communication.  There is concern, however, whether FHI will be able to maintain its high standards as it continues to grow.  Although few funding constraints have been evident to date, some of the new activities (e.g., the introduction of NORPLANT) are potentially of such a size and scale that FHI may have to begin making difficult choices as to what activities to pursue.","Project title: Population technical assistance (POPTECH)","Special Evaluation","Documents","DPE-3024-Z-00-8078-00","","5/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Contraceptive methods|Contraceptive research|Contraceptive agents and devices","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABB077.pdf","2,441 KB","006243 - Dual & Associates, Inc.|000673 - International Science and Technology Institute, Inc.

"Interim evaluation of a project to strengthen the capacity of the Dominican Republic's  Instituto Nacional de Recursos Hidraulicos (INDRHI) to improve irrigation planning and management in two areas -- Azua and Santiago -- totaling 14,400 ha and serving 6,000 farm families. The evaluation covers the period 6/83-1990. Project-constructed infrastructure has largely eliminated water delivery constraints, previously the principal limitations to agricultural production for many farmers.  Moreover, by increasing the area served while decreasing the total amount of water delivered, the project has increased water use efficiency and reduced waterlogging in the lower portions of the system. About 300 ha have been brought under irrigation for the first time and drainage systems have benefited over 2,000 ha which were previously waterlogged. The project has successfully organized local water user organizations to manage the irrigation systems.  These groups have facilitated the following:  (1) equitable water allocation and distribution, (2) democratic resolution of conflicts over water use and system maintenance, (3) farmer willingness to pay water fees; and (4) government willingness to allow the organizations to retain and use fees.  While progress has been good, financial problems are likely.  The Azua group already plans to defer repair and maintenance funds to cover financial shortfalls, a short-sighted policy which could lead to deterioration of the facilities and unreliable water delivery. The project has persuaded INDRHI to transfer the responsibility for irrigation system operation and management at levels below the main system to the water user organizations.  In only two years, the project successfully facilitated transfer of two large irrigation systems to private groups, reversing a 75-year pattern of increasing state control over small farmer production. On the negative side, project-generated data, while voluminous, is rarely analyzed.  Also, while the project is likely to leave a permanent mark on Dominican irrigation institutions, there is still a need to document its achievements and publicize them to the international irrigation community.","Project title: Development strategies for fragile lands (DESFIL)","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","4/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","On farm water management|Water supply structure maintenance|Water user associations|Irrigation","Dominican Republic","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABB086.pdf","4,656 KB","006727 - Development Alternatives, Inc.

"PACR of a project (1980-1989) to rehabilitate seven tank irrigation systems in Northeast Thailand, and provide complementary inputs to farmers. Some 4,600 households directly benefit from the rehabilitated irrigation systems, farmers accept and increasingly use modern production inputs, and farm incomes rose almost to the target level and are expected to increase further.  Cropping intensity during the wet season is 100%, and yields of glutinous rice -- the traditional wet season crop -- are two to three times higher than before irrigation was available.  However, farmers are turning gradually to non-glutinous rice because of better yields and prices.  Dry season cropping is also turning toward quality production of higher priced crops.  During the wet season, land in the project area can now be fully utilized, even in dry years, which is not the case for nearby areas or for the majority of farms in the Northeast. The training program, group organization and development, and various promotion activities have significantly increased farmer capability in production, execution of group activities, business operation for input and marketing, and coordination with staff of line agencies. A major factor in the project's success is the development of Thailand's private sector.  When reservoirs were first constructed in the 1960's, farmers had water but no outlet for their products.  Today, by contrast, private processing plants throughout the region provide incentives by ensuring that farmers can benefit from their labor.  The project's very capable Thai contractor, TEAM Consulting Engineers Co., Ltd., also deserves credit for much of the project's success.  Future projects should make use of the country's many competent engineering firms.","Loan no. 493-T-024","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","4/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Irrigation system construction|Double cropping|Agricultural water management|Commercial farming","Thailand","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABB092.pdf","267 KB","008613 - USAID.

"Mid-term evaluation of a project to strengthen the institutional capacity of the University of the South Pacific's School of Agriculture (USP/SOA) through its Institute for Research, Extension, and Training in Agriculture (IRETA), located in Alafua, Western Samoa.  External evaluation covers the period 1/86-2/90. The project has made several achievements in the areas of training, outreach, and research.  To improve agricultural skills in the region, the project has:  modified and improved USP/SOA courses in extension, education, crops, soils, and engineering; sponsored scholarships, regional and national workshops, and seminars; strengthened the Advanced Certificate in Teaching Agriculture program; and provided M.S. and Ph.D. training for regional staff in the areas of agriculture extension, education, crops, and soils. To strengthen outreach services, the project has:  (1) improved and expanded the agricultural liaison officer network, which serves as a communication link between IRETA and national departments of agriculture and other agricultural concerns; (2) established an agricultural information network encompassing print, radio, video, and satellite media; (3) installed and refined desktop publishing, printing, and darkroom facilities at IRETA for production of extension materials; and (4) expanded the USP/SOA library as a computerized information resource center. Activities in the area of agricultural research have included: (1) construction of an agricultural mechanics instructional and research laboratory at USP/SOA; (2) construction of a screenhouse and a field laboratory for crop science teaching and research; and (3) expanded funding and number of research projects of the National Collaborative Trial program, which has produced two important new cultivars. It is recommended that a third phase of the project be funded and that it focus on developing IRETA and its research, extension, and education activities into an effective, streamlined institution. Two major lessons were learned.  (1) Institution building projects require donor support over a long period of time (15-20 years and sometimes longer) to insure sustainability.  (2) Sustainability issues should be specifically designed into the project from the beginning, agreed upon, and evaluated periodically.","Attached to PD-ABA-094","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","2/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural research|Agricultural education|Agricultural extension|Institution building|Universities and colleges|Agricultural colleges","Oceania|Western Samoa","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDABB094A.pdf","1,054 KB","005093 - USAID.

"Interim evaluation of a project to strengthen private agricultural producer organizations (PAO's) in Bolivia by providing TA, equipment, training, and credit.  The evaluation covers the period 9/86-1990. Confusion and difficulty have resulted from the project design's overly broad definition of PAO's, which lumped together regional agricultural chambers (lobbying groups) and producer associations (primarily service providers).  Despite the very different roles of these types of organizations, little differentiation has been made in project activities.  Instead, the focus for both groups has been on establishing single-commodity service firms.  For the agricultural chambers, this objective has been inappropriate, and to date not one service enterprise has been established within a chamber.  It is recommended that assistance to the chambers emphasize management, financial accounting, and regional agricultural planning. The project has had much greater success in establishing service agencies within producer associations.  The FEGABENI slaughterhouse, the ANAPO seed plant and grain silos, and the ASOBOFLOR flower export enterprise have all shown initial promise.  The major concern is that, unless appropriate action is taken, the subsidy enterprise may overtake the parent producer association, which is the project's client agency. A major lesson learned is that each level of organization requires specific forms of assistance which are complementary and mutually reinforcing.  The project also teaches that the notion of farmer-financed agricultural services does not have widespread acceptance, although farmers are willing to pay (as in this case) for such services when they are of direct benefit.  The most effective model in Bolivia is that of a private sector processor or marketing agency which, when it buys produce, deducts a small percentage for the producers' association, the regional agricultural chamber, and the regional agricultural research institute.","Companion evaluation summary: PD-ABC-340","Special Evaluation","Documents","DPE-5826-C-00-5054-00","","4/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural cooperatives|Agricultural credit|Agricultural enterprises","Bolivia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABB106.pdf","2,802 KB","000223 - Academy for Educational Development, Inc.

"PACR of a project (1984-1990) to establish mechanisms for providing financial and technical assistance to small and medium enterprises (SME's) in Honduras. Although one of the executing agencies was new and the other had no development experience, significant accomplishments were made. A commercial finance company, called Financiera Industrial y Agropecuaria, S.A. (FIA), was established to provide credit to SME's.  FIA reached a loan portfolio level of only L9.2 million instead of the planned L12.7 million due to the infeasibility of a planned cofinancing mechanism with shareholders.  Nonetheless, FIA is a sound financial institution which operated responsibly and conservatively, and generated some 950 new jobs through 332 loans to SME's. The TA coordinator, the National Association of Industrialists (ANDI), exceeded targets.  A business assistance system developed by ANDI's small business enterprise unit (PYME) attracted 22 participating organizations, compared with a planned 6.  Direct TA was provided by PYME to 3,746 SME's, compared with a projected 525.  It is estimated that these activities resulted in the creation of 5,226 jobs. The project teaches several lessons.  (1) The lack of development experience on the part of FIA and ANDI led to a slow start-up and other problems.  (2) The PYME Committee members seemed more committed to SME development than did the majority of ANDI members.  This is probably because PYME was created by ANDI in response to an A.I.D. initiative. Ideally, A.I.D. should support programs that grow out of the commitment of a group.  (3) Since the Pan American Development Foundation's advisor's contract was with A.I.D. and he was not paid by ANDI/PYME he was not accountable to ANDI -- which led to confusion about his role. A.I.D. should allow NGO's more involvement in contracting TA.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","5/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Small scale enterprises|Medium scale enterprises|Commercial credit|Business support services","Honduras","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABB109.pdf","230 KB","008555 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (1985-1989) to provide TA to Eastern Caribbean countries to help improve fiscal policy analysis, decisionmaking, and policy implementation. The project was well received and addressed vital areas for improved fiscal policy.  Its highly practical, problem-oriented approach allowed prompt responses to TA requests and the fiscal performance of many of the participating countries generally improved.  The primary component, which provided TA throughout the project, made some impressive accomplishments, especially in revamping tax systems in at least two countries and upgrading tax administration in at least five countries. The component had more limited success in introducing program budgeting. A component to provide fiscal reform assistance to the Government of Grenada was also successful.  Specifically, the component enhanced the capability and knowledge of public officials, introduced a new tax system (Value-Added Taxes), and created an environment conducive to private sector investment.  A third component evaluated the other two components, giving them good marks.  A final component assisted a multi-donor activity to computerize customs departments by providing an effective training course for 28 customs officers from participating countries. One of the most important lessons learned is that political developments can undermine soundly conceived and technically well prepared projects.  The project also underscored the effectiveness of working with host country officials as a team to identify problems, devise solutions, and implement activities. An additional strength of the project was the location of an office in the Eastern Caribbean, which facilitated acceptance by host country governments.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Fiscal policy|Policy reform|Tax reforms|Taxation","Eastern Caribbean|Grenada","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABB112.pdf","50 KB","001757 - USAID.

"Evaluates a Housing Guaranty (HG) program in Chile to support private sector cooperatives and serve the needs of low-income families.  The HG loan was disbursed by Citibank New York in its full amount of US$5 million during July 1988, and Cooperativa Abierta de Vivienda Popular ((COVIP) and its member associations reached full first-round disbursement by September 1989.  To date, US$1.2 million have been repaid and re-utilized in second-round disbursements. By the end of 1989, the program had financed 1,120 housing units, of which 822 had been completed for an average price of US$5,904 (UF 328) per unit.  The remaining units are in various stages of construction. These prices are affordable to median-income families even without the available Government of Chile (GOC) subsidy.  When the subsidy is considered, they are affordable to families earning as little as UF 6 (US$108) per month. These figures indicate that before its half-way mark, the program will produce approximately 67% of the total housing targeted.  It can therefore be expected that 3,200 units may be produced by the end of the program's 4-year duration -- 60% over target. Housing units completed by COVIP during 1989 were distributed between the Santiago metropolitan region and the rest of the country at a ratio of 90/10 with HG funds and 66/34 with overall funds.  The preponderance of units in Santiago is explained by legal restrictions on cooperatives to operate outside the region where they are established, as well as by high demand for housing in the metropolitan region. COVIP states that use of HG funds has allowed it to increase its housing production by approximately 15% and that, in general, the availability of the funds has permitted housing cooperatives to initiate programs they could not have otherwise funded with commercial banking lines.  Bank loans are not available for land purchases and their construction finance lines are extremely expensive. Although responsibility for very low-income groups (families earning below UF 5) normally falls exclusively upon the GOC, it was found that at least one cooperative has managed to service such groups.  In each of the last 2 years, PROVICOOP, a COVIP affiliate, has more than doubled the number of ""extreme poverty"" families which it has serviced out of its total housing solutions: 4% in 1987, 9% in 1988, and 21% in 1989. The administrators of COVIP member associations unanimously pleased with COVIP's effectiveness in providing representation for the program and the GOC. These officials did not believe that COVIP should be transformed into a financial institution itself and, therefore, it has not been capitalized as one. The currency swap arrangements with Chile's Central Bank are fundamental to the continued success of the Program.  Use of the available local currency alternative with Citibank Santiago could, depending on market conditions at the time, result in higher interest costs. None of the private sector financial institutions is active, nor has any intentions of becoming active, in originating mortgages for housing units of under UF 400 (US$7,200).  In effect, the 2 banks that do originate mortgages only serve markets of UF 700 (US$12,600) and upwards, and the Mutuarias, the market of UF 2,000 (US$36,000) and above.  The Banco del Estado, acting as GOC's agent, is the only financial institution currently active in providing mortgages for housing with unit costs of up to UF 400 (US$7,200) and, as such, it is the only channel for financing the mortgages originated by the program and most other programs of the housing cooperative movement. The Chilean solution to its lower-income housing needs relies to a great extent, on a system of direct subsidies which are granted to qualifying families in fixed amounts to cover an important portion (up to 75%) of their home purchase price.  Contacts with incoming GOC officials confirmed a firm resolve to maintain the housing subsidy system in its current, basic form, with any eventual changes being oriented towards making it even more accessible to lower-income families and utilizing it to promote innovative shelter solutions reaching out to the ""extreme poverty"" levels.

"Interim evaluation of a project to develop Malawi's human resources by strengthening university and governmental training capacities and by providing overseas, in-country, and in-service educational opportunities.  The evaluation covers the period through 4/90. Early indications are that project activities will produce desired results in most instances.  Those activities most successful to date include strengthening of university-based training/education programs, advancement of women, and strengthening of organizations supporting the development of small- and medium- scale enterprises.  Participant training, on the other hand, is weak in post-training planning, and proposals are vague about processes to keep trainees in contact with their organizations while in long-term training.  Use of TA is proceeding well, although there is concern that efforts may not be institutionalized by the PACD. The project's general strategy of linking human resource development to institutional needs assessment seems to be working well with the University of Malawi, but is somewhat problematic for government agencies.  Within the agencies, the wide variation in roles and tasks, as well as frequent staff transfers, make analysis and planning much more difficult.  The agencies are also unaccustomed to the strategy, since donor support for human resource development has historically been tied to individual, rather than organizational interests.  Difficulties have also been experienced in initiating management development activities, due to unrealistic assumptions regarding the project's capacity and commitment to undertake such activities.  Also, while the Project Coordinating Committee is operating effectively, the subcommittee structure has not performed as expected and is in a state of limbo. A key recommendation is to develop an action plan for the remainder of the project, including a monitoring and evaluation system which allows all parties to monitor their progress in a timely and efficient manner. Several lessons were learned.  (1) Projects based on a ""process"" model should be designed -- as this one was not -- so that the project itself becomes a learning experience for the organizations involved. (2) Such projects also need to begin small and proceed slowly, making sure everyone is ""on board"". This project started big, failed to test some key assumptions (e.g., that key development agencies would countenance serious institution building), and has not listened adequately to some of the key actors.  (3) Projects need to pace their activities to determine whether the process is working.  Offering total project funds at the start of the project can lead, as it did in this project, to unrealistic expectations among potential grantees, pressure for spreading funds to resource-poor agencies, an initial flood of paperwork, and lack of funding for future needs.","Delivery order no. 511-22|Companion evaluation summary: PD-ABC-833","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-1109-I-00-7119-00","","4/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Personnel development|Institution building|Management training|Universities and colleges|Education for development","Malawi","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABB178.pdf","2,719 KB","001341 - Creative Associates International, Inc.

"Over the past two decades, donor food aid programs have had their greatest impact on the macroeconomic level in the form of balance of payments and budgetary support; in many cases, these programs were critical to sustaining debtor governments. Recently, however, the severe strain of structural adjustment programs on the poor has renewed interest in the uses of program food aid for its original objective -- the alleviation of hunger. Accordingly, many donors have attempted to influence recipient governments to use local currency generations for agricultural projects and to reform their food policies.  In general, however, this approach has been hampered by limited managerial and financial resources when only one donor is involved, as well as by the complexity of food security issues.  Multi-donor approaches, which have been coordinated by the World Food Programme and focused on implementing food and agriculture policy reforms, have proven more promising. Several related lessons have been learned from these coordinated efforts.  (1) To attain the goal of food security, donors and recipient governments must negotiate a set of mutually supportive strategies for the use of donor common funds.  (2) These negotiations must be supported by multi-year commitments of donor support.  (3) The strategies developed must be based on a joint, unbiased analysis of the underlying causes of food insecurity in the recipient country. (4) The use of food aid to alleviate hunger requires that vulnerable groups be identified at the program planning stage.","Meeting of the Expert Group on Evaluation of the Development|Assistance Committee, Organization for Economic Cooperation and|Development (Feb 1990, US)","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","6/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Food aid programs|Structural adjustment|Nutrition improvement|Policy reform","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAX239.pdf","45 KB","003433 - USAID.

"Mid-term evaluation of a project to establish a Faculty of Agriculture (FOA) within Yemen's Sana'a University to offer undergraduate degrees in agricultural sciences.  The evaluation covers the period 1985-6/90. The FOA has not made sufficient efforts to develop a curriculum which responds to the country's agricultural training needs -- specifically, the need for post-secondary, non-degree technical training of agriculturalists.  Moreover, the curriculum is too heavily weighted toward practical, hands-on skills and attempts to encompass too many subjects for a four-year program.  It is recommended that all students receive strong general training during the first two or three years and then have the option of electing among a few broad specializations in which there are good employment opportunities.  A course on Yemen's rural development that emphasizes the role of women in agriculture should be among the general requirements. The FOA's recent emphasis on faculty development is to its credit, and additional qualified Yemeni professors should be added as quickly as possible.  Some of the faculty trainees have taken appallingly long periods of time to complete advanced degree study, and a five-year limit should be set. The FOA's instructional farm is a unique educational resource, and the new facilities under construction will compare favorably with those at institutions in developed as well as developing countries; use of the farm for research that is compatible with teaching is encouraged.  Also, as there will be an impressive computer network in the new facility, efforts are needed to train faculty members to use computers -- existing ones are underutilized. Subproject management could benefit from greater cooperation among USAID/S, the University, and the FOA.  More generally, FOA's greatest challenge over the next few years is one of sustaining the quality of its programs and maintaining its physical plant and facilities.  Because only limited resources are available from the University, the Faculty needs to reach out vigorously to other financial sources.  Subproject funds should be used more as seed money to facilitate these efforts than as direct support that will likely end with the subproject itself.","Due to Gulf crisis, Mission not able to complete project evaluation|summary","Special Evaluation","Documents","279-0052-C-00-0016-00","","6/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Institution building|Agricultural education|Undergraduate education|Curriculum design|Faculty","Yemen","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABB201.pdf","5,616 KB","000673 - International Science and Technology Institute, Inc.

"Final evaluation of a project to strengthen the capacity of the Research and Development Institute (RDI) at Thailand's Khon Kaen University (KKU) to conduct agricultural and rural development research in northeast Thailand.  Evaluation covers the period 5/83-12/89. The RDI grew rapidly in terms of both staff development and administrative capability and played an important role not only in developing the KKU faculty's research capacity, but also in promoting the application of innovative research methods -- particularly in the areas of qualitative research, participatory research, and the social sciences.  It raised the awareness and skill levels of young faculty members in development-oriented research and acted as a focus for attracting external funds for research.  RDI gained widely recognized prestige and credibility and played an important role in building the capacity of NGO's in the region through its training, coordination, and networking activities.  On the negative side, certain research projects (e.g., the rice bran development project) overemphasized the physical sciences and neglected socioeconomic aspects.  Also, RDI's very limited interaction with government agencies suggests that it has little influence among policymakers. Overall, the project has achieved its objectives.  This success is primarily attributable to:  (1) clear and feasible objectives; (2) a flexible administrative framework that streamlines procedures and provides a consultative management process; (3) an effective monitoring system; and (4) flexible disbursement procedures and mechanisms.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","5/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Applied research|Research centers|Agricultural research|Rural development|Universities and colleges","Thailand","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABB212.pdf","915 KB","005576 - Thailand Development Research Institute","","005048 - Khon Kaen University.

The Shaba project, designed to serve the local population and Zairian refugees returning from Angola, has supported the work of a full- time expatriate drilling team, whose primary concern has been to provide water as efficiently and cost-effectively as possible, but which has also contributed to the technical experience of SNHR staff.  There is some question, however, as to whether drilling operations can be sustained after the contractor's departure in 9/90.  In the Basic Rural Health project, on the other hand, emphasis has been on fostering community responsibility for water systems; this effort has largely succeeded, although there are indications that operations and maintenance are inadequate at several sites.  This project has also supported SNHR's development. Of the types of water systems constructed under the projects, capped springs were the least expensive ($1,100 per system), compared with boreholes with handpumps (about $6,500 per system). Preliminary studies indicate that diarrheal incidence decreases in children under five as the number of improved water sources (e.g., capped-springs), the quantity of water, and access to a source of potable water increase.  There is also some evidence that more accessible water sources free women to spend more time on other domestic or income-generating activities.  Finally, there are indications that communities are better prepared and more motivated to implement other development activities after successfully completing and sustaining a water project. The projects have had less success with respect to SNHR, which is in a precarious position.  It is almost totally dependent on donor funding and resources (which, however, when provided, increase performance only marginally) and lacks the skilled and motivated staff and the organizational solidarity needed to survive.  It is imperative that SNHR consolidate its operations to increase their efficiency (not expand them, as USAID/Z has urged it to do).  Donor patience is waning and donor resources are dwindling.","WASH task no. 150","Special Evaluation","Documents","DPE-5973-Z-00-8081-00","","6/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Water supply|Water sanitation|Institution building|Wells|Rural areas","Congo DR","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABB213.pdf","3,511 KB","000333 - Camp Dresser and McKee, Inc.

"Evaluates the activities of the International Fertilizer Development Center (IFDC) during the years 1984-89. The IFDC has been a trusted and objective resource on issues regarding fertilizer, and has taken initiatives to provide useful services to a wide variety of clients.  The staff display good professional practice for their host country counterparts and are committed to excellence at the Center.  Management of the Center has been also strong, as the executive leaders have effectively communicated their vision of the IFDC.  The Board is well-qualified, but it probably should be more independent of the Managing Director in its review and policy direction roles. Further, funds given to the IFDC have supported efforts directly related to its mission, although an increasingly greater portion of their funds are from restricted core funds. However, funding constraints have prevented the IFDC from providing assistance to a complete spectrum of developing countries.  The Center has recently placed a strong emphasis on Africa, and while this approach is appropriate, it should be aware of the needs which still exist in Asia and Latin America. In addition, while the staff have cooperated well with donors, Consultative Group for International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) centers, national programs, and other organizations involved in fertilizer development, there are still improvements to be made.  For the most part, the organizational climate of the Center is very good, though some conflict and ambiguity about roles exist between the headquarters and the West Africa Center. The IFDC is at a turning point.  Several transitions are occurring and their outcomes will influence the future direction of the Center: the African centers are just taking shape; a new Managing Director is now in place; membership in the CGIAR is pending; funding patterns are changing; new initiatives have been proposed in recently prepared long-range plans; and with most of the IFDC's long-term research and development programs being successful, it is time to consider how some of them will compete for funds. The IFDC is not an old organization, but it faces a dynamic future. The mission that propelled it so far has to be reexamined to fit changing prospects in fertilizer use.  Expected changes in fertilizer demand and population pressures will influence distribution, marketing, and farmer use practices. Work on problems of importance in this changing world will require the whole spectrum of IFDC's skills to devise effective research technology and policy approaches.

"Evaluation of the International Irrigation Management Institute (IIMI), an international agricultural research center (IARC) based in Sri Lanka.  External evaluation covers the period 1/85- 1/90. IIMI performs an important function and effectively complements the efforts of other IARC's.  The institution is engaged in an impressive array of research projects for such a young organization, and its activities have gained the respect of both donors and collaborators.  In addition to its Colombo headquarters, IIMI now has field programs in Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh, India, Morocco, Sudan, and the Philippines. There is also a regional office in Burkina Faso, and consideration is being given to developing programs in five West African countries.  A project in Indonesia was completed in 1989 and work is expected to resume in 1990. IIMI is generally well organized and managed, with a distinguished Board of Governors representing 11 countries and a good balance of disciplines.  However, IIMI's current administrative structure, under which programmatic responsibilities are separated into three divisions, seems to be contributing to a fragmentation of effort and a lack of a cohesive, well-coordinated program.  IIMI's financial situation is also a matter for concern.  The large percentage of restricted funds in IIMI's budget could constrain its ability to address high priority needs.  Many donor projects supported with restricted funds do not adequately cover indirect costs. is, IIMI faces a likely budget shortfall in 1990, calling into question the wisdom of its expansion plans. IIMI training efforts have been somewhat limited but are expected to improve with the recent employment of a full-time training officer. Good progress has been made in implementing a sound information program, and IIMI already possesses an impressive list of publications for an organization of its size and stage of development. During the past three years, IIMI utilized an excellent planning process to prepare strategic and operational plans for the next several years.  However, these plans are very broad, and it is suggested that IIMI narrow the focus of its primary program efforts.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Research organizations|International organizations|Irrigation|Agricultural water management|Agricultural research|Research management","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABB252.pdf","8,553 KB","000180 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to reduce the impact of coffee rust disease on small farmers in Honduras by strengthening the capacity of the Honduran Coffee Institute (IHCAFE) to develop and deliver needed services to farmers and by establishing a credit fund to be managed by the National Agricultural Development Bank and private banks.  Final evaluation covers the period 1981-90. At the farm level, coffee yields increased from 6 to over 25 qq/manzana for those beneficiaries who planted during the 1982-85 period (i.e., those for whom the coffee plants have now reached full maturity). Coffee renovation covered about 13,003 manzanas -- above the goal of 13,000 for 1991. Soil conservation measures were initiated in all regions.  IHCAFE has been able to directly service an estimated 9,815 small and medium size farmers, and the number is increasing about 700 annually.  The goal of reaching 10,400 should be attained by the end of the project.  Training of 119,000 individuals (some more than once) was also achieved in a total of 14,639 planned events.  Farmers report substantial change in their coffee growing practices since the project began:  89% reported the use of field renovation (vs. 56% before); 83% now use fertilizer (vs. 30% before); 80% use insect and disease control practices (vs. 19%); and 89% use shade regulation (vs. 74%). Beneficiary satisfaction is high with 90% reporting few problems, which meets project requirements.  Farmers report 64% of the renovated plots as ""good"" or ""excellent.""  Three main advantages mentioned were: credit (52%); higher levels of production (49%); and technical assistance (27%).  The use of new technology has spread beyond the financed plots with 68% of the beneficiaries also reporting the use of recommended practices on additional plantings of their own, and 55% reporting that their nonparticipating neighbors were using some recommended practices. Credit repayments total over 20 million Lempiras, which will permit continued lending in the future.  On-farm coffee processing facilities were upgraded with the help of credit. Regular bank operating loans to cover annual coffee maintenance costs were extended to almost 50% of the beneficiaries.  The project has given formal credit experience to 62% of the coffee beneficiaries for the first time.  Many of these will now be eligible for regular bank credit. Data validity was good.  Information gathered in the evaluation field survey was largely consistent with data provided by IHCAFE from other studies.  However, some discrepancies exist between project and survey data.  This could be due to bias by the extension agents collecting the data, or lack of accuracy by outside interviewers who were not well acquainted with the farmers' situation.  Reports based on data collected by the project were available and are used in the regional offices.  A central office planning and policy department was established by IHCAFE in 1986 and was beginning to use the reports and data for planning purposes. Key project problems encountered were as follows.  (1) The crop diversification program has not been successful.  (2) Soil testing results have not yet been incorporated in farmer recommendations.  (3) Level of loan repayment is not as high as desired as 25% of the beneficiaries indicated that they were behind in payments.  (4) Although most plots were in good or better condition, 12% were reported as ""poor"" or ""lost."" Finally, beneficiaries listed the major project disadvantages as high interest cost (36%), poor quality of seed plants (15%), and poor advice (10%). The project teaches the importance of (a) profitable technical recommendations to accompany credit, (b) continual efforts to improve intra- and extra- institutional communication, and (c) early attention to loan delinquency problems.  It laos demonstrates the feasibility of incorporating private financial institutions in a small farm credit system and of using paratechnicians for direct farmer contact.  It is laos evident that the poorest farmers are the hardest to reach, that felt needs (e.g., the problem of coffee rust) give incentive for change, and that training will have a lasting impact beyond project goals.

"Interim evaluation of a Housing Guaranty/TA program to improve the institutional capacity of the Honduran private sector and of the municipal governments of seven cities to provide housing, infrastructure, and public services for low-income families. Evaluation covers the period 9/86-3/90. The program is progressing toward its physical output targets. More than 12,000 low-income persons have been provided with water and sewerage systems or mortgages for new housing; nearly 20,000 persons will soon benefit from projects in process; and an estimated 3,000 persons will benefit from projects not yet started.  Infrastructure activities have:  contributed to increased earnings for small businesses and increased land and home values; encouraged residents to make home improvements; provided construction jobs; improved environmental and sanitary conditions; and encouraged the formation of neighborhood improvement groups. new policy changes, especially in San Pedro Sula, to promote the participation of the private sector in urban development. On the negative side, project execution is constrained by macroeconomic conditions that limit domestic resource mobilization.  The amount of mortgage credit available is still only a fraction of what is required.  Other problems include the lack of formal mechanisms for cost recovery and the insufficient capacity of municipalities for maintaining water and sewerage systems (with the exception of San Pedro Sula). The project has demonstrated that the private sector will participate in urban service delivery as long as the public sector provides a suitable framework.  In San Pedro Sula, for example, private sector commitments were made after land use standards were modified and in-kind contributions were made.  The participation of private housing finance institutions, on the other hand, has been limited.  One major obstacle is the lack of interest among S&L's in lending to low-income clients. NGO's are the most viable intermediaries for reaching low-income households, but they are typically unable to access the Fondo de la Vivienda's (FOVI) rediscount facilities because their low-income clients are unwilling to put up their houses as collateral on home improvement loans, as is required by FOVI. Long-term TA has been well balanced between project implementation and specific technical and management assistance. Short-term TA provided by the Unidad de Coordinacion y Asistencia Technica, on the other hand, has generally not been effective. Dramatic differences exist among the seven participating municipalities.  Future projects should be sure to collect baseline data for use in evaluating project impacts.","Companion evaluation summary: PD-ABB-506","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-1008-I-00-9066-00","","4/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Housing credit|Water supply|Sanitation|Housing investment guaranty|Housing finance|Public services","Honduras","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABB262.pdf","3,763 KB","006381 - Abt Associates, Inc.","","004943 - USAID.

"Development finance institutions (DFI's) have for several decades been key instruments of donors aiming to fill long-term credit gaps and channel financial resources to priority groups. A recent review of donor evaluation reports of DFI projects shows, however, that these intermediaries have had and may continue to have considerable difficulty achieving these ends. Three particular problems are highlighted. (1) DFI-directed credit programs have encountered serious problems in reaching targeted beneficiaries, especially the informal sector and marginal farmers. (2) The poor financial and management performance of many DFI's has caused some donors to question their sustainability. (3) DFI's have not proven effective in strengthening Third World financial markets due to increasing competition from commercial banks and other long-term credit sources and the restrictive financial policies of many host countries. Moreover, donors themselves have operated at cross purposes by supporting a multiplicity of DFI's aimed at a wide range of economic sectors. The result has been confusion among sub-borrowers and inefficient use of loan funds. It is recommended that donors: (1) adopt more coordinated responses to promoting DFI's; (2) encourage DFI's to lower the administrative cost of loans, charge real positive interest rates, and emphasize credit and financial market development; (3) reconsider the objective of DFI self-sustainability; and (4) support policy reforms to increase competition among DFI's.","Summary: PN-ABG-034|Meeting of the Expert Group on Evaluation of the Development|Assistance Committee, Organization for Economic Cooperation and|Development (Feb 1990, US)","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","7/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Development finance institutions|Loan administration|Credit","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAX240.pdf","45 KB","003433 - USAID.

"Indonesia's child survival program, a top government priority, has had a positive impact on child health and appears to be reducing infant and child mortality.  The program has also strengthened the country's primary health care system by rapidly expanding services outside the physical and administrative confines of the existing public health facilities.  Principal achievements include:  a rapid expansion of community-level health posts (posyandus), which deliver child survival interventions nationwide; high rates of child immunization (65% for DPT3 and 50% for measles); successful education of mothers in oral rehydration therapy; and nationwide expansion of growth monitoring and nutrition education through the posyandus. Much of the program's success can be attributed to the incremental growth of highly focused and vertical efforts to deliver key services, beginning with family planning and nutrition in the 1970's and later adding immunization and diarrheal disease control.  By 1985, the country began large- scale efforts to integrate these services at the community level. A.I.D. has played a critical role in stimulating and shaping the program, providing $60 million (over and above support for family planning) and supporting more than 25 bilateral, private voluntary organization, and central projects over the last decade. Key elements of A.I.D.'s contribution include: sustained commitment and support for highly focused programs (family planning, immunization), effective policy dialogue coupled with research, provision of some operational costs for major activities, provision of supplemental support from centrally funded A.I.D. programs, collaboration with other donors, and investment in training and education.  Despite the child survival program's achievements, however, sustainability is still in question. Additional efforts are needed to ensure the long-term financial basis, consolidate activities, and solidify political support and popular demand.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","6/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Child survival activities|Community health care|Child health care","Indonesia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAX238.pdf","76 KB","003433 - USAID.

"Evaluates two Secretariats responsible for promoting regional development in the Sahel -- the Permanent Interstate Committee for Drought Prevention in the Sahel (CILSS) and the Club du Sahel.  The evaluation covers the period since CILSS' creation in 1973. Working together, the Secretariats expended enormous energy in the early years on drafting and updating a Sahel regional development strategy intended as a basis for preparing national development plans and aid policies.  Over the years, however, there has been little evidence that Sahelian planners or donors have heeded the CILSS/Club ""global view"" of the Sahel's development needs.  As a result, the Secretariats have moved away from regional strategizing to explore special themes or opportunities. For example, one focus in the 1980's was on generating productive dialogue on cereals-related policies.  In general, however, CILSS and the Club have had limited success in translating regional discussion into national action planning. Direct lobbying at the national level has been difficult, and participants of CILSS/Club conferences have been ineffective in promoting the Secretariats' ideas in their home states. Moreover, much of what has been considered Sahelian-donor policy dialogue has actually been limited to debate among the donors themselves. CILSS and the Club have hosted several regional meetings to help donors better coordinate their development approaches.  These sessions have been more successful in sensitizing donors to their differences than in melding program strategies or standardizing aid procedures.  The quality of dialogue has improved with the help of the donor advisory group, formed in 1986. In the 1990's a key task of the Secretariats will be to use their abilities in information brokering to help Sahelians to discover and capitalize on emerging options.  It is recommended that a Sahel Development Networking System be established which would focus on the Secretariats' two key areas -- food security and environmental management.  The system would be developed not through large staff build-ups or budget outlays but by actualizing unused potential within the CILSS/Club system and strengthening existing linkages.","French executive summary: PD-ABB-744","Special Evaluation","Documents","DPE-5826-C-00-5054-00","","6/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Regional development|Regional participation|Regional relationships|Policy dialogue","Sahel","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABB287.pdf","1,619 KB","000223 - Academy for Educational Development, Inc.

"Interim evaluation of a project to establish an educational radio station in La Mosquitia, the region along the Atlantic Coast in Honduras, where the Miskito Indians live.  Evaluation covers the period 1985-3/90. Although the station, Sani Radio, is extremely popular, it is not fulfilling all of its original objectives.  In 1988, the project grantee, the Asociacion para la Promocion Desarrollo Socio- economico (AVANCE), cut the station's budget; the result was a reduction in staff and the near total elimination of educational and cultural programming. Early in 1990, the station director was fired by AVANCE, and was replaced by a person with no formal journalism training.  As a result, only 75 of a planned 175 interactive Spanish-Miskito classroom language programs were developed, and none are in use.  Nor have any adult literacy programs been prepared, although some Spanish-language adult educational programs have been developed, notably an agricultural program mandated in an Inter-American Foundation grant. However, the station is relied on for news and entertainment, and perhaps most importantly to send messages about births, deaths, travel plans, and emergencies.  Similarly, local institutions, such as the public health station, churches, and development organizations, find Sani Radio the most dependable method of disseminating information quickly and accurately to various constituencies. While the station is almost universally known in La Mosquitia, reception of the radio signal is hampered at time by static; also, some residents lack the kind of radio set than can pick up Sani's ""tropical band"" wavelength, and others cannot afford batteries to run the radio sets.  (The former problem should be solved with transition to the AM band in 1990.)  Additional problems include the lack of qualified personnel for news coverage and educational program development, and the high cost and variable availability of fuel to run the station's generator. Although some local groups and businesses have purchased advertising on the station, the local economic base is almost certainly not strong enough to support Sani Radio.  It is recommended that A.I.D. pursue the transfer of Sani Radio from AVANCE to MOPAWI, a local PVO (funded by national and international organizations as well as by individual donations), which is dedicated to the development of the Honduran Mosquitia and its people.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","LAC-0000-C-00-6074-00","","6/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Educational radio|Indigenous populations|Native languages|Nonformal education|Adult education|Bilingual education","Honduras","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNABF612.pdf","1,679 KB","000223 - Academy for Educational Development, Inc.

"Interim evaluation of a project to expand family planning (FP) services in Jamaica, including commercial distribution of contraceptives, FP education, and the use of long-term contraceptive methods. The project has made strides toward reaching its goal of significantly reducing fertility.  Contraceptive prevalence has increased and both age-specific and total fertility rates have declined. The Ministry of Health (MOH) health centers, which serve the majority of contraceptive users, provide high quality FP services and easy access for most women.  Clinic services provided by the National Family Planning Board (NFPB) and Jamaica Family Planning Association are also of high quality.  On the negative side, difficulties in cooperation betwen the MOH and the NFPB have arisen, and the NFPB's lack of strategic planning and reluctance to use TA have hindered project implementation. Commercial contraceptive distribution programs have enjoyed notable success.  The two types of contraceptives distributed -- Perle oral pills and Panther condoms -- have virtually universal brand name recognition and make up the largest market share for pills (46.6%) and condoms (39.6%).  The project has also increased awareness of the role of condoms in AIDS prevention. However, this component is constrained by the NFPB's structure, which inhibits flexible, timely responses to marketplace changes. The project has helped finance a field network of parish liaison officers and regional supervisors, which will provide a good base for organizing needed informational and motivational efforts.  In addition, the NFPB is just beginning to mount a major information, education, and communication (IEC) program with assistance from other donors. Efforts to reach adolescents have had mixed results, largely because of an ill-conceived and expensive strategy to implement a large number of local subprojects.  While these activities have reached many young people, some have provided only IEC, while others have had only weak linkages between IEC and FP services. As a result, the youth component has contributed a very small proportion to total contraceptives delivered under the project. Another shortcoming is this component's failure, despite the delivery of substantial inputs to the Ministry of Education, to integrate family life education into the country's school system. Referral systems for long-term methods -- i.e., IUD's and voluntary surgical contraception (VSC) --  are less than optimal. This, along with material and staff shortages, has resulted in fewer VSC procedures than expected.  In addition, more training of nurses in IUD insertion is needed. Since contraceptives provided under the project are either received free or with a small donation, financial self- sufficiency is unlikely, as is the expansion of private sector FP services.","Project title: Population technical assistance (POPTECH)","Special Evaluation","Documents","DPE-3024-Z-00-8078-00","","7/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Family planning services|IEC|Commercial retail sale of contraceptives|Sterilization (birth control)|Family planning education","Jamaica","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABB303.pdf","2,323 KB","000673 - International Science and Technology Institute, Inc.

"Mid-term evaluation of a project to promote natural family planning (NFP) methods through research and educational activities.  The project is implemented by the Institute for International Studies in Natural Family Planning (IISNFP), a consortium of Georgetown University School of Medicine, the Los Angeles Regional FP Council, and the University of Pittsburgh Graduate School of Public Health.  The evaluation covers the period 9/85-1/90. The project is being implemented in a very difficult environment. NFP is a relatively new field, with few experts, weak institutions, and limited absorptive capacity.  There are competition and animosity between groups promoting different NFP methods as well as prejudice and hostility against NFP on the part of many mainstream FP agencies. IISNFP, a new institution, had to expend considerable time and energy during the first year in dealing with the political aspects of NFP. Despite these constraints, the project has made considerable progress in several areas.  IISNFP has synthesized scientific findings regarding NFP and the lactational amenorrhea contraceptive method and disseminated them to international leaders in maternal/child health/FP in a manner which has earned respect; that the synthesis was produced by respected medical schools was an important factor.  IISNFP has also helped unify the NFP community by taking a moderate stand on divisive issues and be developing and guiding processes enabling people of different opinions to work together constructively.  The project has produced an NFP trainer's manual and provided high-quality regional courses for 59 NFP instructors who in turn have trained at least 1,200 additional instructors.  Most training efforts have focused on NFP-only service providers (primarily associated with the Roman Catholic Church), while relatively little work has been done to incorporate NFP into multi-method FP services.  IEC activities have extended beyond the church and the health care system and included projects to reach women enrolled in home economics courses in the Ivory Coast and to use mass media and community events to reach women in Peru. Although work on breastfeeding did not start until early 1988, it has become a significant part of the project.  IISNFP acts as secretariat for the Interagency Group for Action on Breastfeeding (IGAB), a coalition of technical staff from UNICEF, WHO, SIDA, and A.I.D.  IGAB has convened several important technical meetings and, focusing on Latin America, has promoted breastfeeding as a contraceptive method in various ways -- developing a breastfeeding curriculum for nursing schools, evaluating breastfeeding interventions in three countries, and promoting breastfeeding among the Indians of Cuzco, Peru, through radio programs, community activities, and training for health professionals and policymakers. Research activities, which comprise about half of project efforts, are not yet completed.  Biomedical studies in progress relate to the physiology and endocrinology of a woman's fertile period, the development of a home test kit for determining fertile days, the fear that NFP may result in defective fetuses, and the extent to which breastfeeding women can use NFP methods to detect their first postpartum ovulation.  Several operations and social science research projects are also underway.  The project has not, however, given sufficient attention to field trials to measure the rates of effectiveness and continuation with various NFP methods or to behavioral studies related to periodic abstinence.","Evaluation summary: PD-ABR-676|Project title: Population technical assistance (POPTECH)","Special Evaluation","Documents","DPE-3024-Z-00-8078-00","","7/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Breastfeeding|Behavioral methods (birth control)|Family planning research|Family planning behavior|Family planning education","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABB306.pdf","2,059 KB","000673 - International Science and Technology Institute, Inc.

"PACR of a local currency funded grant (7/86-9/88) to Accion International/AITEC to strengthen the ability of ASEPADE, a Honduran PVO, to provide credit and management assistance to microenterprises in the urban informal sector. Although 90% of overall targets were accomplished according to AITEC's final report, some of the most important outputs did not reach their planned levels.  For example, the project was seriously constrained by the constant displacement of street vendors by local authorities; this problem particularly affected the project component to unite entrepreneurs in ""solidarity groups"" to serve each other as loan guarantors.  As a result, only 258 of a targeted 750 groups were formed. This component's effect on employment was also disappointing, with only 775 jobs created or maintained, compared with the target of 4,350. A component to provide credit directly to microenterprises also fell short of objectives.  Loans disbursed amounted to nearly L1 million less than expected, primarily as the result of the limited credit capacity of borrowers.  This problem was compounded by the insufficient level of training and TA provided to ASEPADE to establish reliable monitoring, financial, and loan processing systems. A major lesson learned is that the project's objectives regarding ASEPADE's institutional strengthening were optimistic, since indigenous PVO's usually have many unforeseen problems which require additional resources and time.  With this in mind, the follow-on Small Business II project (5220241) includes appropriate resources to strengthen ASEPADE's financial and management systems.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","6/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Institution building|Informal sector|Urban areas|Credit|Microenterprises|Loan administration","Honduras","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABB308.pdf","217 KB","008555 - USAID.

"Evaluates a child survival and rural sanitation project implemented by CARE in Bolivia.  Final evaluation covers the period 8/86-8/90. The project was successful and benefitted some 59,000 people in 200 rural communities.  The health education component achieved most of its objectives, including 90% immunization coverage, 50% oral rehydration therapy use, and 85% regular attendance for growth monitoring.  In addition, the project's water supply systems were generally well constructed and water quality met WHO guidelines.  Latrines were very well received, especially those with pour-flush water seals.  However, some of the dry ventilated pit latrines were improperly constructed, had odor problems, and were unpopular. In a major project accomplishment, the community organization component created new or strengthened existing local groups (e.g., water committees, mothers' clubs) and encouraged community ownership of and responsibility for the water systems.  Further, the project benefitted women, by helping incorporate them in the community leadership through the mothers' clubs and by saving them considerable time and energy in hauling water. The regional development corporations proved reasonably good counterparts, although they were excessively slow in the payment of funds to CARE.  However, the regional health units (unidades sanitarias) showed less interest, partly because they were only asked to collaborate with activities that CARE and the corporations had already developed. Although it improved during its final year, financial monitoring was poor.  As a result, CARE management learned two-thirds of the way through the project that an additional $0.65 million was needed. Key recommendations are as follows.  (1) All counterpart institutions should be recognized as full and equal partners in project agreements. (2) A.I.D. could increase the effectiveness of its projects by urging coordination among projects in the same geographic area.  (3) Due to their ongoing nature, water, sanitation, and health projects should avoid abrupt startup/termination and should run for at least 7 years. (4) In a developing country setting, bacteriologically polluted water should be treated with a slow sand filter (an effective and affordable low-technology technique) and not chlorination.  (5) The project's policy of subsidizing all latrines, no matter how expensive, led to a depletion of funds before all communities requesting latrines could be served.  A moderate fixed subsidy would be more equitable.  (6) Any future project should find a way to provide health care to all children, even those whose parents do not or cannot afford to use the water system.","WASH activity no. 145|Companion evaluation summary: PD-ABB-737|Some issues of this document are dated 6/1990","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","DPE-5973-Z-00-8081-00","","8/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Community participation|Sanitation|Child survival activities","Bolivia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABB352.pdf","2,477 KB","000333 - Camp Dresser and McKee, Inc.

"PACR of a project (5/88-2/90) to promote renewable energy technologies in Sudan by providing support to the two entities of the National Council of Research -- the Renewable Energy Research Institute and the Energy Research Council (ERC). The project established a center of technical expertise that is now the country's primary research agency in several key areas, including stove testing, biomass research, and power systems (including diesel systems).  Planning and implementation were accomplished collegially, with counterpart staff taking primary responsibility, and sustainability appears likely.  A major highlight was the project's ability to avoid the common pitfall of unrealistic, economically questionable research applications. This was accomplished through rigorous, impartial elimination of technologies lacking in replicability or commercial potential and by emphasizing dissemination. The project played a key role in redirecting Sudan's stove programs by a rigorous effort to disseminate a metal stove designed by the University of Khartoum's Faculty of Engineering. The effort demonstrated the weakness of the stove's design in the long term, resulting in its abandonment in favor of a stove similar to the Kenya Jiko stove.  The project also established the country's only stove testing center, located in Soba. A significant number of mid-level and senior-level project staff received short- or medium-term training outside Sudan.  Although an overseas program for Master's degree training proved too expensive, a forestry program was developed within the University of Khartoum, which is providing trained graduates to the ERC. A counterpart small grants program was well managed, with most grants provided to farmers and corporations for forestry/agroforestry activities.  Stronger forestry counterparts would have made these efforts more effective. A major lesson learned is that countries with available counterpart funds and large numbers of trained technical staff can undertake a variety of activities with relatively minimal external TA.  The project also demonstrates that it is possible to develop a research organization emphasizing dissemination, outreach, and impact.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","6/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Stoves|Energy research|Appropriate technology|Renewable energy resources|Research centers","Sudan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABB360.pdf","180 KB","008607 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (8/88-2/90) to locate groundwater in Sudan's Red Sea Province and conduct studies on related business opportunities. Due to insufficient project funds and equipment and insufficient in-country drilling expertise, test drilling and pumping activities were not carried out.  As a result, the findings of project simulations regarding water yields, water quality, and subsurface conditions could not be verified empirically, nor were accurate estimates of available groundwater possible.  Since the Brooke Amendment prohibits further A.I.D. funding of the project, requests for test drilling support have been submitted to other donors.  All other project activities were completed, including final reports on the socioeconomic and geophysical exploration studies; related business plans were also developed. The methodology used by the project for groundwater evaluation/location is promising for select geologic regions with scarce, segregated aquifers.  Other lessons learned concern financial and management matters.  (l) The use of a grant for this type of project was inappropriate, since private contractors should be under TA contracts in order to provide A.I.D. with greater financial control. (2) The Government of Sudan was not among the grant signatories, which led to difficulties in gaining government approval and assistance.  (3) Half of the project budget was provided in local currency at the official rate, rather than the much higher free market rate.  A 200% inflation rate further eroded purchasing power, causing severe budget shortfalls early in the project.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","6/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Groundwater|Drilling|Water supply|Geophysical prospecting|Water sources","Sudan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABB361.pdf","112 KB","008607 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (6/81-12/88) to establish the institutional capacity within the Dominican Republic to provide in-service management training to private and public sector agencies involved in rural development. The project established a Center for Administration of Rural Development (CADER) within the Superior Institute of Agriculture (ISA) to implement training programs.  CADER staff members were recruited from among the country's leading financial and agribusiness concerns; staff training included 37 short- and long-term courses in agribusiness management, production technology, and other subjects, and 5 observational trips. CADER amply achieved the project's purposes, exceeding planned outputs by 30% in most cases.  Specifically, CADER conducted 19 5-week management courses and 54 short courses, held 41 seminars, and prepared 177 case studies.  To contribute to its own financial security, CADER also conducted feasibility studies and provided information services and short-term consultancies. In order to attract top echelon personnel, the project offered salaries to CADER staff which were nearly double those of regular ISA faculty.  This, along with the abundance of project-funded perquisites afforded the CADER staff, caused resentment within ISA, and CADER salaries were subsequently renegotiated at a lower level.  Eventually, the most effective CADER faculty members returned to the private sector. The major lesson learned is that the insertion of a special, externally funded activity into an established institution must address not only the specific project-directed goals, but also the context and needs of the existing institution.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","7/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Management training|Institution building|Agricultural education|Agribusiness","Dominican Republic","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABB372.pdf","204 KB","008537 - USAID.

"PACR of a pilot project (7/83-12/87) to improve and expand rural financial services in the Dominican Republic by providing TA and training, mainly to the Agriculture Bank (BAGRICOLA) and four small rural credit unions. The project substantially expanded the rural population's access to savings, credit, and other financial services.  Approximately RD$29 million in deposits (from more than 70,000 depositors) was mobilized by the 31 BAGRICOLA branch offices and the 4 credit unions.  Of these funds, about RD$15 million was reloaned to rural clients.  Although important improvements in BAGRICOLA's viability and efficiency were attained, improvements in the credit unions were by comparison far more significant and exceeded expectations. The project also helped the Central Bank establish a Rural Savings Mobilization Office, which completed 16 of 18 targeted studies, with 5 more in progress.  It also instilled a level of discipline in BAGRICOLA's lending practices, especially in regard to funds obtained from depositors, and heightened the awareness of many people regarding the importance of positive interest rates. The major lesson learned is that there is an unsatisfied demand for financial services in rural areas.  Access, rather than the cost of these services, is the important factor.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","7/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Financial institutions|Credit unions|Rural populations|Banks","Dominican Republic","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABB373.pdf","239 KB","008537 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (7/85-9/89) to strengthen the capacity of the Organization for Rural Development (ORD), a public sector nonprofit organization which was founded in 1978 in St. Vincent to provide farmers with production and marketing support. ORD has a long history of management problems, which were not overcome during this project, despite the efforts of the Pan American Development Foundation (PADF) as grantee.  PADF fielded a full-time management specialist for 2 years and a full-time agricultural marketing specialist for 3 years, and provided follow-up consultancies in these areas along with short-term TA for other specific tasks.  In addition, the project provided ORD with funds for staff support and some training and commodities. Although ORD has substantially institutionalized (to the extent that could be expected), management systems relating to financial reporting, membership records, and sales, production, and loan data, it cannot be said that ORD operates in a businesslike manner.  As advisor, PADF could only encourage, and not insist that ORD tailor spending to budget and observe conservative financial and management practices. Specific problems included overly optimistic estimates of revenue; lack of control over expenditures; inadequate collection of farm supply loans; diversion of revolving funds to cover operating expenses; and problems in purchasing, pricing, and inventory management at ORD's farm supply stores.  During the last year, ORD focused its attention on producing, drying, and marketing turmeric.  Operations were unsuccessful due to difficulties in managing the newly constructed drying and packing facility, combined with problems in negotiating and pricing turmeric marketing contracts.  All of this has resulted in the accumulation of substantial debt. Because of ORD's inability to correct these deficiencies, the project was shortened.  The project did have a positive impact on some farmers through training and credit, but its overall achievements did not warrant continued A.I.D. support. The project underscores the fact that good management systems do not in themselves ensure good management practices -- sound leadership and good managers are essential.  The ORD experience also emphasizes the importance of fundraising and resource mobilization.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","7/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Management operations|Institution building|Financial management|Agricultural inputs|Integrated management","Saint Vincent and the Grenadines","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABB374.pdf","67 KB","001757 - USAID.

"Mid-term evaluation of a matching grant to Volunteers in Technical Service (VITA) to stimulate economic activity in the Third World by strengthening indigenous information systems that support small-scale economic development.  The evaluation covers the period through 3/90. VITA has cultivated a client base that is willing and anxious to utilize its services and information and has made progress in each area of grant activity.  Progress has been uneven, however. VITA has fulfilled grant objectives for its Technical Information Service, its original mission and the most advanced component of its organizational network.  Other targets have not been met, however. target -- the first due to faulty assumptions regarding the ability of trainees to attend training sessions and of local organizations to arrange for in-country programs; the second due to FVA/PVC's refusal to allow VITA to use federal monies to meet its matching grant obligations, and the withdrawal of public and private support.  Provision of information network support has been hindered by technical factors beyond VITA's control. A more general problem is posed by VITA's poor documentation, monitoring, and management of specific grant-related activities. This stems largely from VITA's expansion from a small PVO dedicated solely to providing information services into an increasingly complex organization and information newtwork.  VITA seems not to have noticed this evolution.  There is no one at VITA headquarters whose sole responsibility is grant oversight. Instead, VITA's executive director and a program officer have lumped grant management along with their other responsibilities. Management confusion is evident in that several VITA managers were unable to distinguish their grant activities from other activities. It is recommended that VITA: (1) concentrate its training activities in three countries (including Kenya), integrate its courses into ongoing in-country programs, and develop a remedial course for beginners and information specialists who lack immediate access to microcomputers; (2) pay less attention to the number of in-country programs and more to grant management needs, local institutional growth, and the possibility of including other VITA African country programs (e.g., those in Chad, Djibouti, and the Central African Republic) as part of the VITA's contribution to the matching grant; and (3) seek a no-cost extension to allow time for achieving the original targets for ground stations and information centers.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","5/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Information dissemination|Databases|Technical information|Information centers","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABB378.pdf","935 KB","000088 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (8/82-6/89) to strengthen three institutions in Sudan's energy sector:  National Electricity Corporation (NEC), National Energy Administration (NEA), and the General Petroleum Corporation (GPC). The project was seriously hampered by external factors, including, inter alia, a crippling drought in 1984, which diverted Mission attention away from the project and toward relief efforts; a coup d'etat in 1985; and the forced evacuation of Americans in 1986 for security reasons.  Yet even under the most favorable of circumstances, the project could not have transformed the overall situation in the energy sector, and many of its specific objectives were unrealistic. Despite these constraints, the project met many of its objectives, including the major ones identified as concretely feasible by the mid-term evaluation.  It helped the Government of Sudan (GOS) address a number of specific and pressing needs, and improved the staff capabilities of both the NEA and the NEC through short-term, on-the-job, and degree training.  (Support to the GPC was never funded due to irregularities in GPC's petroleum purchases under a CIP grant.)  The NEA has become more task- oriented and is now independently preparing energy studies and serving as a consultant for various GOS and international agencies.  The NEC was also strengthened in several areas, and the short-term reliability of its Blue Nile electric power grid increased from 74% to 94%.  In monetary terms, project TA led to a tripling of NEC revenues within 3 years, and the benefits to NEA, while more difficult to quantify, were also considerable. A major lesson learned is that even projects with budgets of several millions of dollars and timeframes of several years cannot by themselves entirely build or largely rebuild a counterpart organization.","Title supplied by cataloger","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","6/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Energy planning|Electric power generation|Management training|Institution building","Sudan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABB382.pdf","188 KB","008607 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (8/83-2/90) to rehabilitate 209 km and maintain 1,469 km of primary roads in southern Sudan, and to strengthen Sudan's Roads and Bridges Public Corporation (RBPC). The deteriorating security situation in southern Sudan severely affected project activities.  In 12/86, the project scope of work was reduced to providing local and overseas training and maintaining Juba town roads, the Juba workshop and compound housing, and the project fleet.  Major accomplishments included: rehabilitation of 150 km of Juba/Torit road; maintenance of 190 km of the Juba/Numili road and of 55 km of Juba town roads; provision of vehicles, loaders, bulldozers, graders, and generators; and training of technicians (mechanics, welders, operators, electricians) to perform maintenance and rehabilitation.  Although the RBPC's capability to carry out maintenance and rehabilitation was improved, additional programs in this area are recommended. Major lessons learned were as follows.  (1) Security conditions should be given proper consideration before starting a project. (2) Depending on security conditions, alternate work programs should be allowed.  (3) Once procurement programs are started, they should be completed for the economic benefit of both the donor and the recipient country.  (4) Local currency funds must be obligated and earmarked at least six months ahead of project execution.  At the start of this project, monthly local currency releases hindered the work program severely.","Title supplied by cataloger","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","6/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Road maintenance|Road construction|Institution building|Security","Sudan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABB383.pdf","107 KB","008607 - USAID.

"Interim evaluation of a project to support urban development in El Alto, Bolivia.  External evaluation covers the period 6/88- 7/90. Progress has been significant in all four components.  (1) On the institutional level, the project has provided substantive and constant support to the El Alto municipality on administrative, technical, and financial matters.  It has also coordinated activities between the Mayor's office, donors, government agencies, and local community organizations. and consciousness raising have proceeded slowly, positive results have been produced. (2) The income/employment generation component has worked with the Banco del Estado to introduce its credit program for manufacturing and small industry in three villas.  Set up just recently, the program is already serving 20 mutual lending groups averaging 5 members each.  This component has also established 5 home-based income-generating pilot projects involving 153 families and offered numerous training courses for small business owners and pilot project participants. (3) Solid progress has been achieved in establishing an effective primary health care system with the opening of a 24-hour health center. It is anticipated that about a dozen such centers will be opened during the next three years and that they will be largely self-financing.  (4) The housing component is establishing a home improvement loan program, which, along with the Banco del Estado program mentioned above, has provided credit to those without access to formal credit.  The component has also helped the Mayor's office regularize the subdivision of lots and building construction to enable the large number of property owners who have built housing without authorization to obtain the necessary documents for receiving formal sector home improvement credit.  As complementary measures, this component is establishing a building materials bank, training courses, and a TA service for those wishing to improve their houses.  More generally, the project as a whole has benefitted El Alto by facilitating development and attracting investments and other resources to the city, having participated in 18 variously funded projects to date. All in all, the project model offers an effective alternative for municipal and community development, though one which high costs and personnel requirements will make it difficult to replicate in its present form.  Given the widespread weakness of municipal government in Bolivia, it is recommended that the project be transformed into a semi-autonomous organization attached to the national association of mayors, with a core central staff, supplemented by local experts, to serve municipalities throughout the country.","Spanish ed.: PD-ABB-498|Delivery order no. 11","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-1008-I-00-9069-00","","7/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Primary health care|Urban development|Income generation|Employment|Housing credit","Bolivia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABB497.pdf","1,388 KB","000968 - Planning and Development Collaborative International, Inc.

"Mid-term evaluation of a project to improve policy analysis and decisionmaking within Morocco's Ministry of Agriculture and Agrarian Reform (MARA).  Evaluation covers the period 1983-1990. The project has made considerable progress in building institutional capability in statistics, economic analysis, and, to a lesser extent, in planning.  Nearly all output level goals have been met.  Under the statistics component, the project established an aerial frame sampling system covering all the nation's agricultural land.  Specified surveys are undertaken regularly and the results published, an aerial photo lab is operating, and computerization is underway for field offices. The system provides data of critical importance to government decisionmakers and is a model for FAO and Francophone countries. The institutional capability to provide the necessary economic analysis for policy making has been put in place.  MARA staff have produced economic studies of reasonably good quality as a result of project training in computers, economic theory, data base management, econometrics, and research.  Progress in planning is less noteworthy since the component was just added in 1988. Nearly all questions regarding the sustainability of the project relate to the management of MARA's Directorate of Planning and Economic Affairs (DPAE).  The DPAE is faced with a conflict between short-term information requests from a diversity of sources and the mandate to conduct medium- or long-term research; DPAE has issued no clear statement of priorities regarding this matter, and resources are routinely shifted on an ad hoc basis to meet the need at hand.  More generally, performance criteria are lacking, there is no precise allocation of time or budgetary resources, and planning is virtually non-existent.  That the organization lacks cohesiveness is evident in the fact that publications are not regularly distributed, interaction among staff members is limited, training and perquisites are allocated in a subjective fashion, recognition for work is not always given, and morale and motivation are not consistent.  These problems also raise questions regarding DPAE's capacity to absorb the 24 staff members who will be returning from long-term U.S. training.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","DAN-4084-Z-00-8034-00","","6/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Economic research|Agricultural planning|Agricultural economics|Economic analysis|Policy making|Decision making|Statistics","Morocco","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABB499.pdf","846 KB","006381 - Abt Associates, Inc.","","000180 - USAID.

"Impact evaluation of a local resource management project in the Philippines.  Evaluation focuses on Phase I of the project (1982-87).  A product of New Directions and the 1983 CDSS, Phase I targeted beneficiaries by differentiating poverty by province, town, and village, and by occupational group. The project, managed by the National Economic and Development Authority, used national and provincial PVO's to help organize village groups and sensitize local governments to beneficiary needs.  Two funds were established -- one for grants to local government for impact projects (mostly small infrastructure), and another for lending to village groups for income generating activities. Project implementation was slow for three reasons:  (1) management problems; (2) disruptions in Philippine society from 1983-88; and (3) the sequential process of working with target groups through analyses, training, organization, registration, lending, and monitoring, and in the case of infrastructure, construction. Although some provinces short circuited the beneficiary analysis and choice, they generally reached the poor, but in far less numbers than planned.  The PVO's, a vital link in the process, each brought their own organizational philosophy to the project, thus vitiating the experimental effort to alleviate poverty through occupational focus. Despite its administrative deficiencies at a variety of levels, the project had several positive attributes -- its direct link to beneficiaries, the role of indigenous PVO's, the initial focus on poverty on the basis of functional occupation, the training and reorientation process of government toward the poor, and its legacy of community self-help.  Foreign donors and local governments are replicating and expanding the project's original concept.  This was an innovative project at its inception in its direct support and capacity-building of local governments, its poverty focus, and its major PVO component.  Now, due to internal political changes, these elements have become Philippine policy, giving added piquancy to the termination of the effort.  Some effort to salvage the processes is recommended. Lessons learned are as follows:  (1) The different organizational approaches of PVO's requires their differentiation and careful selection for the tasks needed.  (2) The capacity to re-borrow may be an important incentive to repay loans.  (3) Assumptions about interdepartmental coordination in project implementation should be questioned.  (4) PVO financing may be an effective counterpoise when the public sector is too fiscally rigid.  (5) Long lead times are needed for projects involving local organizing.  (6) The reasons for people forming community groups may be different from those sustaining them.  (7) Rural credit systems need much more attention at all levels.  (8) Refresher training for projects involving new skills and relationships is required given normal attrition and personnel turnover.  (9) Reporting, monitoring, evaluation, and other management information systems should be addressed early in project formulation.  (10) At the first sign of implementation problems, management reviews should be conducted.  (11) Structural links between participating institutions should be carefully considered in project design.  (12) Capacity building must be a continuous endeavor.

"Interim evaluation of a project to support effective natural resource management in three Afro-montane forest reserves and adjacent areas in southwestern Uganda.  External evaluation covers the period 8/88-6/90. The project has made significant progress in a short time towards the goals of protecting biological diversity in forest reserves, while raising conservation awareness among neighboring farmers. Some 2,225 farmers are now participating, compared with the long- term target of 86,500.  The on-farm approaches are sound because they are farmer-generated and stress recycling of nutrients from plant and animal resources on individual farms.  The emphasis on using indigenous tree species is also commendable. It is too early to determine the impact of these activities on crop yields. Several questions remain, however, regarding the appropriateness of the project structure.  The current arrangement of a grant to the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) and a subcontract to CARE has shown no significant advantage over a single TA contractor, and project officials are overburdened with administrative details.  The choice of the Ministry of Environment Protection and its Departments of Forest and Environmental Education as counterpart agencies has proven unsuitable.  A project focus is on management plans, but it is uncertain who is to implement them in the reserves or coordinate them with parish land use plans. Reserve management will also be difficult due to conflicts between the Forest and Game Departments and a lack of baseline information. There are additional problems.  (1)  Expectations for reduction of soil erosion are unrealistic (though A.I.D. is justified in continuing to support such activities).  (2) Maintenance of swamps may be more important than realized.  (3) Farmers are already practicing sophisticated multi-storied cropping systems, which may be more advantageous than the simple agroforestry interventions encouraged under the project. (5) Reconstruction work on feeder roads in the Bwindi Forest Reserve vicinity poses an erosion threat unless corrective measures are taken. Overall, the project is appropriate -- the  Afro-montane biome is as important as the project alleges -- but it should be redesigned on the basis of experience to date.  The grant agreement with World Wildlife Fund should not be renewed. A total of 21 other recommendations are included.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","AFR-0467-A-00-8043-00","","6/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Natural resource management|Biological diversity|Forestry|Agroforestry|Protected environmental areas","Uganda","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABB507.pdf","5,500 KB","008618 - USAID.

"Evaluates the second year (1989) of the Fertilizer Sub-Sector Reform Program in Cameroon. Some 64,170 tons of fertilizer were imported in 1989, compared to 63,000 tons in 1988; 83% of total imports had arrived by 11/89, and the final shipments were unloaded as the 1989 program closed in 2/90.  The average cost for all types of fertilizer imported was slightly higher than last year. Participation in the program by commercial banks, importers, and distributors was somewhat greater than in 1988.  Two importers participated (one new to the program), each accounting for approximately half of the imports.  A total of 9 distributors took part; 5 were co-ops and 4 were private firms.  For the first time, the Center Province was represented, along with the Littoral, West, and North West Provinces. Two commercial banks were also involved, one of them financing 83% of the shipments. Purchase of fertilizers by distributors (mainly coffee co-ops) was carried out by means of tenders submitted by importers, and selection was primarily based on price.  The entire process from tender to delivery of fertilizer at Douala took 3-4 months, though later in the year there were delays caused by problems in arranging financing. Due to competition between importers, cost increases to distributors were less than would have been indicated by reduced subsidy levels. Although subsidy payments decreased 26% compared to 1988, distributors paid only 14% more, indicating that importers' margins were reduced. Distributors also reduced their marketing margins.  Retail prices increased only 4%.  These figures, however, mask very large differences in costs to individual distributors.  For example, one large cooperative paid only half as much per ton for urea as a small cooperative in the same area.  The large cooperative was also able to bargain for lower transport costs. Resulting variations in retail prices caused serious marketing problems for the small cooperative. While anomalies of this type are inevitable in the transition to a private enterprise system, there are indications that some of the smaller distributors lacked understanding of commercial and banking practices. The performance of the program in 1989-90 was and is being strongly affected by the economic crisis in Cameroon.  The lack of liquidity in both the public and commercial banking sectors has greatly impeded financing of fertilizer import and distribution. Effective demand for fertilizer has been reduced by the failure of the Office Nationale de Commercialisation des Produits Bruts (ONCPB) to pay co-ops and farmers for coffee already delivered.  Under the structural adjustment program in Cameroon, settlement of ONCPB arrears in coffee payments has been scheduled and this is vital if fertilizer sales are to be maintained anywhere near present levels.  Generally, the program's importation and distribution loan facility could do little to ameliorate the extremely tight credit squeeze. Liberalization of coffee marketing has started in Cameroon and should, in time, reduce the role of the ONCPB, making co-ops more independent of government structures and permitting them to export coffee and cocoa directly.  Financing of fertilizer imports will then become much easier for these co-ops since they will be able to use the coffee as collateral for loans. Declining world market prices for coffee and cocoa, from which Cameroonian farmers have been sheltered through ONCPB price policies, are beginning to affect the program with the announcement of drastic reductions in producer prices for 1990. In fact, coffee prices for 1990 are less than half the 1989 levels.  While it is too early to predict the effect on fertilizer sales, it seems clear that some reduction in demand will occur.  Such information as is available on cost/benefit ratios for fertilizer use on coffee indicate that terms of trade for farmers at present are such that fertilizer use may no longer be beneficial for marginal producers. In the shorter term, the program experienced problems due to over optimistic sales expectations by distributors and importers, based largely on 1988's performance.  This has led to the importation of more fertilizer than could be sold during the 1989-90 crop year under present tight credit conditions.  The result was a scaling back of the lifting of fertilizer from the port by distributors, excessive accumulations of fertilizer stocks at the port, and severe financial strains on importers. Importers are likely to be left with substantial unsold stocks until coffee co-ops are again in the market for fertilizer (in 9/90, or possibly not until 3/91). The concept of the program is basically sound and seems to be acceptable to most participants.  Increased participation by distributors, continued interest by a number of importing firms, and proportionally lower fertilizer prices are three encouraging signs that the program is beginning to achieve its objectives.

"PACR of a project (1985-1989) to expand the family planning (FP) services, including clinical, social marketing, community-based distribution, and educational services, of ASHONPLAFA, a Honduran private organization. The project made significant progress, contributing to an increase in the contraceptive prevalence rate from 35% in 1984 to 44% in 1989.  The number of community-based distribution posts and customers was largely increased and, as the result of social marketing activities, ASHONPLAFA's contraceptives are the best known and most widely used in the country.  ASHONPLAFA's IEC department was significantly strengthened, growing from a limited regional activity to a national program promoting all of the organization's services.  The department's nationwide campaign made use of television, newspapers, billboards, and pamphlets, while community outreach efforts used megaphones and educational films.  The pretesting of audiovisual materials to determine public acceptance was also institutionalized.  A training unit was set up to provide coordinated and expanded training to ASHONPLAFA staff and other FP providers. Several problems were experienced in establishing the regional clinics.  Due to costly designs, project funds were insufficient to cover all five planned clinics, forcing ASHONPLAFA to construct two with its own funds.  Although procedures were developed for decentralizing management and administrative functions to these regional centers, the procedures were not sufficiently implemented.  As a result, ASHONPLAFA's internal structure remains rigid -- procedures are cumbersome and too many decisions are made by committee, thus slowing the implementation of important activities. In terms of the number of clinic users, the project experienced a large shortfall, mainly due to an intensive campaign launched in 1988 by the Catholic Church and other groups to eliminate FP services from the country.  As the result of propaganda spread by these groups (that IUD's cause cancer), the number of users, which had increased to 18,000 by 1988, dropped to only 10,500 in 1989.  However, a communications strategy was developed to combat this propaganda, and the number of active users has been steadily climbing to its former levels.  The number of voluntary sterilization procedures was also lower than targeted, but this was largely due to unrealistic expectations in the project paper. Additional problems were faced in attempting to make the social marketing program independent of ASHONPLAFA.  Although sales increased, sales personnel were receiving exorbitant commissions (37%) and accusations of fraud, theft, and mismanagement are being investigated by the Regional Inspector General.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Family planning services|Family planning clinics|Contraceptive distribution|Social marketing","Honduras","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABB525.pdf","498 KB","008555 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of Phase II of a project to establish an institution to provide credit and technical training to small businesses in selected geographic areas in Chad.  VITA was the implementing agency.  External evaluation covers the period 2/87- 3/90. The project has played a vital role in rebuilding a national economy devastated by war and internal strife.  VITA has created a new financial institution with a revolving loan fund, a trained Chadian staff, an operational management structure, and a framework to provide business and advisory services to clients. In comparison with other small enterprise credit activities in Africa, this project is one of the most successful, especially in terms of its high percentage of on-time loan repayment collection (80%) and its low estimated percentage of unrecoverable loan principal (6%). Major project achievements include:  expansion of small private enterprises, including some in agriculture; improved quality of life for low-income people in target areas; increased number and capability of private sector activities, primarily in the urban and outlying rural areas of N'Djamena and rural areas around the city of Bongor; increased self-sufficiency of client entrepreneurs through assistance in business planning and agricultural technology.  The project has acquired an excellent reputation among donors, beneficiaries, the Government of Chad, and the banking, business, and development communities. On the negative side, the project has avoided becoming involved in business brokering and is not very active in providing market information to customers.  Sustainability is in question, since VITA has not yet selected a turnover mechanism or tried to incorporate its credit programs into the Chadian financial system.  An agreement needs to be made with donors on a plan and timetable for institutionalizing the project. Continued A.I.D. support for at least 3 more years (Phase III) is recommended.  Recommendations for VITA focus on improving management and information systems; providing the technical, credit, and computer consultants suggested in the Phase III Concept Paper immediately after Phase III agreement is reached; and taking concrete steps to institutionalize the project, e.g., by recruiting a Chadian Project Director, creating an indigenous Advisory Board, etc.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-2028-Z-00-7186-00","","3/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Credit|Revolving fund|Business support services|Small scale enterprises","Chad","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABB528.pdf","2,656 KB","005762 - Ernst & Young","","008528 - USAID.

"Mid-term evaluation of a project to promote Moroccan private sector exports by increasing the access of exporters to credit, export insurance, and TA in production and marketing.  The evaluation covers the period 5/86-4/90. Although the overall impact on private sector exports has so far been limited, several important constraints to export expansion have been identified and addressed.  As the result of project TA, the Societe Marocaine d'Assurance a l'Exportation (SMAEX) has made strong progress in increasing its export credit insurance coverage and has demonstrated its effectiveness in helping exporters obtain credit, minimize risk, and penetrate new markets. The export pre-financing credit component has had some success, but usage has been limited to only two banks (Banque Marocaine du Commerce Exterieur and Banque Centrale Populaire) and their export customers. The usefulness of the component was reduced because of the following: limited availability of dollar sums; readily available and substantial Bank al-Maghreb pre- financing facilities, which existed prior to the project; and the likelihood that demand for the USAID/M facility will decline as changes in the external environment bring about larger and more efficient production units. Marketing and production TA provided by the International Executive Service Corps (IESC) has been largely successful. Firm-specific assistance has been the most effective, while trade and investment services are also beginning to have a positive impact. Moreover, the project's requirement that TA be related only to exports has limited IESC's range of activities, slightly undermining its effectiveness. Little work has been done with firms in the service sector that could facilitate exports, or in the non-export industrial sector where foreign exchange could be conserved via import cost reductions.  In addition, IESC skills and company needs were mismatched in some cases, due to language problems and the comparatively small size of Moroccan firms. Overall, the project's limited impact can be expected to increase, especially if long-term institutionalization efforts are successful. Remaining constraints include language, weak marketing skills, lack of professionalism, limited awareness of foreign buyers' needs, limited formal business education, and relatively low production capacity.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-2028-Z-00-7186-00","","4/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Wholesale marketing|Private sector|Export promotion|Private enterprises|Business support services","Morocco","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABB530.pdf","6,762 KB","005762 - Ernst & Young","","008579 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (1983-1989) to establish the St. Catherine's Vegetable Producers' Association (SCVPA) in Jamaica as a small farmer producer and marketing organization (PMO). Despite numerous problems, the project can be seen as a relative success with some solid achievements.  The SCVPA was formed and received training in areas such as pesticide use, packaging of agricultural produce, recordkeeping, and water application. SCVPA procured farm inputs at competitive prices for sale to its members, provided postharvest storage for produce, harvesting, and operated a packing facility which reduces postharvest losses and acts as a quality control center for produce from the SCVPA and other PMO's.  The project had a significant impact on its targeted beneficiaries -- small farmers with 1-5 acres.  Some level of planned production was attained, crops were diversified, and incomes raised.  Project training has created a business-like atmosphere among farmers and formulated a systematic approach to agriculture in a small farmer setting. On the negative side, SCVPA failed to become self-sustaining or to stimulate farmers to produce sufficient quantities of high- quality products for the available markets.  Several factors contributed to these shortcomings.  (1) Some SCVPA leaders were alienated when USAID/J shifted the project strategy from establishing a PMO around a few larger farmers to targeting small farmers.  (2) Supply of irrigation water was severely delayed. Bushy Park received no water until nearly 3 1/2 years after project start and other areas have not yet received water.  As a result, the project had to purchase non-SCVPA fresh produce in order to effectively utilize the packing house, vehicles, staff, and supporting equipment provided.  (3) There was initial confusion and competition among involved organizations.  (4) The project received four extensions due to natural phenomena (floods in 1986 and Hurricane Gilbert in 1988) without modifying the already weak project design.  The inability of the SCVPA Board to hire a suitable local manager also hampered the project. The clear benefit of this project to Jamaica may be as an example of an institutional form not to invest in in the future.  The project created a cooperative that is not sustainable.  It would be better to promote private marketing companies with proven cost-effectiveness instead of creating new institutional forms which cannot work without subsidies, price distortions, and some form of monopoly.  The PMO concept does not at the present time seem viable in Jamaica. The number of beneficiaries (350 SCVPA members of whom 100-120 are active at any one time) was very low relative to the life of project budget (U.S.$1,060,000).  This is in stark contrast to the private sector's performance when left to fend for itself. The individual higgler system in particular works well in Jamaica.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Small farms|Agricultural cooperatives|Beneficiary count","Jamaica","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABB543.pdf","165 KB","008563 - USAID.

"Evaluation of a project to conduct long-term applied research on land tenure issues in the Latin America and Caribbean (LAC) region in support of A.I.D. project development and implementation.  The University of Wisconsin Land Tenure Center (LTC) is the primary implementing agency. External evaluation covers the period 8/86-5/90. The project has maintained a high level of responsiveness to Mission and Bureau requests for TA and data on land affairs. Research findings have increased understanding of resource tenure issues and their relation to agriculture and rural development goals and significantly improved Mission and host country capabilities to identify and correct policy and other constraints related directly or indirectly to land affairs.  In Haiti for example, the project helped to define a land tenure policy agenda after Duvalier's overthrow.  Similar assistance has been provided in Guatemala, Paraguay, Honduras, Saint Lucia, and elsewhere, while in Washington the project has helped to provide timely responses to Congressional inquiries. The longitudinal and cross-country nature of much of the project's research increased the validity of the resulting policy recommendations. While research activities were limited to fewer than half of the countries in the LAC region, this was expected due to the time required to organize, implement, and analyze cross-country and longitudinal research. LTC implementation has been cost-effective because of the Center's extensive experience in the LAC region, effective use of host country research institutions, and relatively low overhead charges and salaries. However, the LTC needs to diversify funding sources for its core staff in order to retain specialists in LAC tenure activities. On the negative side, dissemination of research findings to field practitioners and policymakers has been weak.  Although strong efforts in this area have been made by the LTC's Washington-based technical advisor, progress has been limited by the large number of other competing tasks assigned to this position. A follow-on project, with a stronger emphasis on dissemination and a full-time Washington-based technical advisor, is strongly recommended.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","5/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Land tenure|Applied research|Data analysis|Policy making","Latin America|Caribbean","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABB565.pdf","1,390 KB","008330 - J.E.

"PACR of a project (FY84-FY89) to establish an educational counseling office in the Dominican Republic for persons interested in studying at U.S. educational institutions. The project, which was extended 2 years to allow the utilization of all dollar funds, was very successful in providing valuable information to Dominicans as well as U.S. citizens and third country nationals.  The services were in high demand and not offered elsewhere in the country. An estimated 34,000 students visited, called, or contacted the office. Individual counseling services covered selection of and application to U.S. institutions, solicitation of scholarships, and career couseling, as well as distribution of university entrance exam registration bulletins, test score interpretation, and cultural orientation. Despite these achievements, ongoing funding of the office is uncertain.  Since the grantee, Instituto Cultural Dominico- Americano, was unwilling to assume complete responsibility, the office is now functioning with a reduced staffing level.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Student guidance|Student testing|Counseling services|Student admissions","Dominican Republic","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABB581.pdf","293 KB","008537 - USAID.

"Interim evaluation of a pilot project to provide TA and training to promote the production of nontraditional crops for export by agrarian reform cooperatives in El Salvador.  The evaluation covers the period 8/88-9/90. The project has had a significant impact on the development of local exporters and in improving competition among them.  It has also produced some change in marketing to local processors. During the first crop year (1989/90), 12 cooperatives participated in the project; an additional 12 are slated to produce during the coming crop year. On the negative side, the project design overestimated the capabilities of both the cooperatives and the local exporters. False assumptions regarding the cooperatives' managerial and economic capabilities resulted in a relaxation of the selection criteria for participating cooperatives.  This has affected the effectiveness of agricultural TA and raises doubts about the project's ability to provide TA to all 24 cooperatives during the second crop year.  Due to unexpected weaknesses of the local exporters, the cooperatives producing fresh export products (melons) had to adopt the risky tactic of marketing some of the melons on a commission basis.  These problems have significantly increased the cooperatives' dependency on project assistance, thereby decreasing the potential for sustaining project achievements. It is recommended that this pilot project be expanded to a full project lasting at least 4 years and that it:  (1) make the selection criteria for assisting export-oriented cooperatives much more restrictive; and (2) provide export-oriented cooperatives a full complement of managerial assistance in addition to technical agricultural assistance.","Companion evaluation summary: PD-ABQ-113|Delivery order no. 12","Special Evaluation","Documents","519-0353-A-00-8455-00","","9/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Pilot projects|Nontraditional agricultural exports|Export promotion|Agricultural cooperatives|Agricultural product marketing","El Salvador","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABB601.pdf","977 KB","000356 - Checchi and Co.

"Mid-term evaluation of a project to rehabilitate and refocus Uganda's food crop production capability in the direction of small farmer production.  The evaluation covers the period 8/83- 8/90. Progress has been substantial.  Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) research centers at Kawanda and Namulonge have been rehabilitated almost completely, and progress has been made in transferring on- station research findings to extensionists and farmers and in involving these two groups in on-farm trials.  As a result, farmers are adopting technology packages of improved varieties and agricultural practices. Specific research accomplishments include:  (1) two studies on food crop research planning and prioritization and three research plans dealing with commodities (sorghum, maize, and sunflowers); (2) testing of a large number of germplasm materials resulting in 11 food crop varieties being released to farmers and 11 pending release; and (3) the release of new varieties of soybeans, sunflowers, potatoes, and beans. The project has also contributed to the institutional strengthening of the MOA and the Makerere University Faculty of Agriculture and Forestry (MU/FAF).  Members of both institutions are being trained in the numbers and disciplines necessary to develop a critical mass of scientists.  The MOA has established six commodity teams and accomplished a good deal in food crop commodity research planning and prioritization.  MU/FAF has instituted two additional departments (Agricultural Engineering and Food Science and Technology) and adjusted its curriculum to the agriculture sector's evolving demands.  The rehabilitation of its teaching/research station at Kabanyolo should be completed by 12/90. Areas of concern include the need to tighten up and streamline project management and to provide for the sustainability of the institutions being assisted by initiating negotiations among the MOA, MU/FAF, and USAID/U regarding the inclusion of operating costs of faculty and research into the government budget process. Three major lessons were learned.  (1) The development of new technology through commodity teams or the scientist critical mass approach is possible with a reasonable number of local scientists.  (2) Project designs that promote collaboration between the MOA and MU/FAF are more effective and efficient than those which focus on either institution separately.  (3) On-farm trials are extremely helpful in transferring technology and new seed varieties to farmers and in gaining farmer feedback.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","8/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Crop production|Food crops|Agricultural research|Agricultural extension|On farm research|Technology transfer|Varietal research","Uganda","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABB602.pdf","1,631 KB","008618 - USAID.

"This report, based on interviews with key A.ID. decisionmakers, a field survey of Missions, and a review of specific evaluations, analyzes A.I.D.'s system of monitoring and evaluating (M&E) program food aid (P.L. 480 Titles I, III, and II Section 206 and Section 416). The report reaches several conclusions.  In summary:  (1) There is little consistency in M&E practices.  (2) Current practices, while far from ideal, have permitted Missions to meet most of their needs and AID/W to keep reasonably well-informed. Dissatisfaction with existing M&E focuses on possible vulnerability of program food aid to abuse, and lack of comparative and aggregated data on performance and impact.  (3) The greatest opportunities for improving M&E lie in three areas - - descriptive analysis of self-help and local currency measures, and impact assessment of food aid as part of integrated Mission programs. Another option is evaluation of multidonor experience over an extended period of time. (4) Improved M&E presupposes improved clarity as to the objectives of specific programs and, in the case of self-help measures, more consistent articulation of these measures in behavioral terms.  The guidance already issued on the subject would be sufficient were it widely applied.  (5) A simple annual reporting cable should be sufficient for the monitoring of self- help measures.  (6) Increased integration of program food aid into Mission programming and evaluation efforts would appear to be a priority in light of declining development assistance and direct hire staffing levels in many Missions, and the general movement in the Agency toward assessing performance at the program level.  Current efforts to evaluate most program food activities on an annual basis are not conducive to integrating program food aid with other Mission evaluation efforts. (7) Also suggested is improved assessment of how alternative modes of distributing food aid affect benefit incidence and the local private sector.  (8) Generally, it is not useful to introduce distinctions between the various categories of program food aid, but rather to regard the food as an additional resource to pursue development (and other) objectives.  (9) The role for additional central guidance is relatively modest.  with respect to self-help measures and local currency activities, this guidance should be as specific and unambiguous as possible.  In the case of integrated evaluation, emphasis should be placed on illustrative scopes of work and examples of successful evaluation efforts.  (10) There is no obvious need for significant additional training or expenditure to implement the improvements suggested in this report.

"This report reviews a variety of indicators of health status in Nepal, examines the major policy and institutional themes that have influenced the evolution of the country's health care system, assesses broadly the contribution of A.I.D. programs over a 20-year period, and analyzes the impact of the health system.  The major conclusions of the report are as follows. (1) Health status has improved -- reflected by increasing life expectancy, declining infant mortality, and the almost complete control of malaria as a major health threat. (2) A.I.D.-supported programs have made a major contribution to these improvements.  The most important examples are malaria control, the Expanded Program of Immunization, and diarrheal disease control. (3) The family planning program, which has received significant support from A.I.D. in the past, has not been successful.  The contraceptive prevalence rate is only 15%.  The program remains overly focused on sterilization rather than offering a broad choice of family planning methods for individuals. (4) Persistence of high levels of female morbidity, fertility, and neonatal disorders and a high incidence of diarrhea, respiratory infections, worms, and skin diseases suggests a cluster of problems which do not respond well to specific interventions. These debilitating health conditions stem from persistent poverty and low levels of female education. (5) The Nepalese health system has been dominated by the government's effort to live up to its promise to provide a reasonable level of health care to all.  The gains from this approach are undeniable, particularly the spread of health posts and small hospitals. (6) Institutional weaknesses in the health system persist, including lack of a clear organizational philosophy, bureaucratic rigidity, excessive attention to quantitative targets and reporting, staffing problems, and maintaining adequate and consistent medical supplies.  The most important finding is that the demand for health care has outstripped government's ability to supply needed services -- an ability severely limited by inadequate financial resources. (7) The role of private sector health care is poorly defined, in spite of the willingness of many Nepalese to use private, fee- for-service sources.  Experience with health insurance or pre- paid drug schemes is very limited and poorly understood by policymakers in the Ministry of Health (MOH). (8) Until now, government efforts to improve health delivery have focused on regionalization and decentralization of bureaucratic decisionmaking in the MOH.  Little evidence exists that suggest these efforts are more than formal changes in the organizational chart. However, A.I.D.'s efforts to strengthen decentralization are a positive step. (9) The very recent establishment of a corps of women community health volunteers offers some hope that some expression of local demands for improved medical care will be felt by the government. There is a danger that this corps will be incorporated into the system as a new ""bottom rung"" of the health bureaucracy.  A.I.D. support of women's involvement should focus on improving their effectiveness and autonomy. The advent of a new, potentially democratic government affords an opportunity for Nepal to undertake a reexamination of its health care policies, programs, and organization.  Since sufficient progress has been made in laying down a basic infrastructure, the present time may be an excellent opportunity to focus on the quality, efficiency, and financial sustainability of both public and private health care in the country.  As a still respected development institution in Nepal, A.I.D. has a unique opening to help the new government chart a fresh approach to health care. This opportunity should not be lost.

"In 1987, A.I.D. provided The Gambia with a $6 million grant to support a series of financial and agricultural marketing reforms as part of a multi-donor economic reform program.  The sectoral reforms were designed to encourage greater private sector involvement in productive activities and discourage the Government from regulating and controlling activities that could most efficiently be done by the private sector. Specifically, the Government of The Gambia agreed to:  implement appropriate policies regarding term lending, agricultural credit, and development lending; enforce market-determined interest rates; prohibit preferential access to credit; and ensure equal allowances for all buyers involved in agricultural marketing. After only two years, it is too early to determine the effects of this complex policy reform program.  However, it is evident that the program faces a number of barriers:  (1) an inadequate amount of technical assistance and institutional development; (2) poor donor coordination; (3) continued government control over fertilizer grants, which undermined the liberalization of groundnut marketing; (4) high interest rates; and (5) resistance to market reforms by government organizations and parastatals. On the other hand, several external factors have improved the economic climate and helped the reform process, including good weather, which helped improve agricultural production; a halt in the secular deterioration of the terms of trade; a strong pro- rural political bias; and satisfactory relations with neighboring Senegal.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","9/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Policy reform|Economic reform|Credit|Interest rates","Gambia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAX241.pdf","283 KB","003433 - USAID.

"In 1986, A.I.D. initiated a program to reform Senegal's system of tax and revenue administration.  The program was designed to complement industrial sector reforms managed by the World Bank, since industrial stagnation was largely attributed to years of heavy tariff protection and high taxes on both the agricultural sector and consumers.  A.I.D. contributed $14 million in cash transfer funds and $1 million in technical assistance to promote the reforms, almost all of which were implemented by 1988.  The Government of Senegal substantially reduced quantitative restrictions on imports; implemented a new commercial investment code; reduced across-the-board tariff protection; and designed a dramatically revised tax revenue system that included major provisions for taxing urban real estate.  Contrary to expectations, the immediate impacts of the reforms were negative -- economic activity in the formal industrial sector slowed and government revenues seriously declined.  Private firms, accustomed to decades of protection, had made no provisions for competing in an international market.  Their competitiveness was also weakened by an unfavorable national political and economic climate, increased administrative fraud following the reduction in customs rates, and the failure of donors and the Government of Senegal to implement additional, complementary reforms.  Despite these constraints, the reforms are now showing signs of the desired effects, particularly with regard to promoting private sector competitiveness and reversing the decline in government revenues.  It is expected that the medium-term impacts of the reforms will meet the program goals.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","9/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Taxation|Tariffs|Industrial development|Structural adjustment|Economic reform|Nonproject assistance|Tax reforms|Economic policy|Policy reform|Trade liberalization","Senegal","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAX242.pdf","67 KB","003433 - USAID.

"Evaluation of the sustainability of six health-related projects in Tanzania, including a series of urban water projects, maternal/child health (MCH) aide training, a pilot primary health care program in Hanang District, cancer control, school health programs, and continuing education for health workers. Activities that were sustained included all the urban water projects, the health components of the MCH aides training project, the curative aspects of the cancer control project, and the village health services component of the Hanang project. However, even most of these efforts were having difficulties in continuing to provide services.  The water projects were all continuing to provide services, although maintenance was weak and future demand could not be met with present capacity.  The MCH aides who were trained were still providing services although there was some deterioration of services.  The hospital-based cancer control center was fully operational and gaining an international reputation. The village health worker program was still active in many villages although there had been a significant dropout of trained workers. The continuation of project activities was negatively affected by a significant decline in Tanzania's economy, which has severely limited the government's ability to continue project funding and import necessary medical and transportation supplies and equipment.  On the other hand, sustainability has been supported by the political environment, which is characterized by a broad- based and strong ideological commitment to the poor, as well as a very high level of donor coordination. The success of the sustained projects underscores the importance of the following design and implementation characteristics:  (1) the integration of project activities into existing administrative structures and the avoidance of vertical project design; (2) a high or increasing level of project funding through national sources (e.g., budgetary and cost recovery mechanisms); and (3) the provision of visible services and demonstrated effectiveness of project activities to develop demand among provider and beneficiary groups.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","9/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Project sustainability|Economic aspects|Health finance|Political aspects|Cost recovery","Tanzania","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAX243.pdf","191 KB","","","003433 - USAID.

"Factors affecting the sustainability of health projects in Zaire are identified in this report.  Four projects are examined -- maternal/child health (MCH) clinics administered by Mama Yemo Hospital, community health-integrated rural development implemented by the Salvation Army, and two projects (health systems development and malaria control) implemented by the Ministry of Health (MOH).  All of the projects were completed at least three years prior to the study. Only two of the projects were sustained.  The MCH project is still providing clinical and family planning services, and using the educational materials developed during the period of A.I.D. assistance. Most activities under the Salvation Army project are also continuing, with the majority of recurrent costs being covered by user fees.  By contrast, the malaria project has been completely dismantled, and none of the direct activities of the health systems project are continuing. The report concludes that the sustainability of projects in Zaire is strongly affected by contextual factors, such as the country's weak, poorly funded, and corrupt state institutions; continuing economic crisis; and weak implementing institutions (e.g., the extremely fragmented MOH).  However, while more effort is necessary to strengthen the economic and institutional contexts of projects in Zaire, several improvements could be made even in this difficult context to enhance the sustainability of future projects.  These improvements include:  (1) project integration into the normal administrative structure of implementing institutions; (2) the involvement of implementing agencies in the project design process; (3) strong training components; (4) increased community participation; (5) utilization of cost recovery and other alternative financing mechanisms; (6) demonstrated appropriateness and effectiveness of projects; and (7) high-quality technical assistance. Appendices include an assessment of the sustainability potential of current health projects.  Also available are papers on the sustainability of health projects in Senegal (PN-AAX-245) and Tanzania (PN-AAX-243).","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","9/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Project sustainability|Health care|Economic aspects|Political corruption|Institution building","Congo DR","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAX244.pdf","182 KB","","","003433 - USAID.

"This evaluation of the health care components of two projects -- Bakel Irrigated Perimeters and Casamance Rural Development -- in Senegal focuses on the sustainability of the projects, which were implemented during the period 1977-1985. One component of the Bakel project, an epidemiological survey, was unsustained, while another component, primary health services, was fully sustained; in fact, activities of local communities and of the Ministry of Health have further improved primary health care since the end of the project. The health and nutrition component of the Casamance project was moderately sustained. The modest success of these activities is largely attributed to contextual factors, including: weak state institutions and a lack of commitment to social welfare; an economic crisis which limited the government's ability to continue project funding as well as the beneficiaries' ability to pay for services; fragmented and unstable implementing agencies; and weak national commitment to primary health care and family planning. However, even in this unfavorable environment, several steps could be taken to enhance sustainability: (1) integrate projects into existing administrative structures; (2) ensure that the national government absorbs progressively larger portions of project costs and/or develops cost recovery mechanisms; (3) provide training in both technical and administrative subjects; (4) avoid short-term projects and include significant TA components; (5) design projects with visible benefits that create demand for project services; and (6) include community participation mechanisms in projects with cost recovery.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","9/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Project sustainability|Economic aspects|Health care|Political aspects|Cost recovery","Senegal","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAX245.pdf","2,221 KB","","","003433 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (7/80-5/89) to strengthen natural resource management in Honduras through improved governmental policymaking and planning, integrated watershed management, and farmer training in improved land use practices. The project met or exceeded almost all major targets in terms of the number of farmer and women's groups organized, trained, and participating in improved cropping/soil conservation, agroforestry, range management, and vegetable production.  The target number of trees produced and planted was not met, but this shortfall was due primarily to a change in emphasis away from massive reforestation of unprotected public lands and towards on- farm agroforestry activities in which trees have a much higher survival rate.  Unusually high accomplishments were made in women's activities, reflecting a change midway through the project to emphasize women's participation.  In addition, the project treated five sub-watersheds, established 31 field agencies, and produced 23 major manuals and other publications, as well as numerous audiovisuals, which were utilized extensively in project training and promotional events. As a result of these accomplishments, the area covered by the project experienced substantial increases in agricultural production, nutritional levels, and incomes, and the natural resource base has been significantly stabilized.  The improved cropping and farm management technologies are being continued in some areas through local farmers trained in promotion; they will further extended through the follow-on project, Land Use and Productivity Enhancement. Major lessons learned relate to the following key factors in the project's success:  the use of one outreach mechanism to deliver a wide range of services; independence from bureaucratic constraints; utilization of low-salaried, nonspecialized paratechnicians supported by a few professional extensionists; early training programs for both technicians and farmers; constant farmer feedback; less reliance on subsidies as incentives for participation; gathering baseline data in order to measure project impact; simplified forest management plans for fuelwood and saw timber production in small areas; and particular attention to training and orientation of female extensionists and paratechnicians.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","6/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Natural resource management|Watersheds|Agricultural extension|Farmer participation","Honduras","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABB817.pdf","289 KB","008555 - USAID.

"Final external evaluation of a project to provide financial resources and TA to Bolivian savings and loans to promote private sector financing of water and sanitation systems for low-income communities.  The evaluation covers the period 1983-3/89. The project provided about $1.2 million in loans to fund 5 subprojects (SP's) which are supplying water services to about 16,500 families in 5 of Bolivia's 9 departments.  The SP's, in whose design and implementation 12 different public and private entities participated, range from simple water connections to more complex systems serving large populations.  The project model is replicable and can be afforded by households.  In addition, participating communities have demonstrated their capacity to manage water supply systems and solve technical, financial, and operational problems. Despite these achievements, improvements need to be made in several areas.  (1) Compliance with national standards for water systems needs to be ensured.  (2) Water supply and sanitation should be coordinated so that wastewater is properly disposed of. (3) ""As-built"" drawings should be produced for the SP's so operators have accurate information on SP construction.  (4) SP's should be planned for easy maintenance that can be carried out without interrupting service.  (5) In areas without sewers, beneficiaries should be educated in proper methods of wastewater disposal.  (6) Planning and control functions also need to be strengthened within the Caja Central de Ahorro y Prestamo para la Vivienda (CACEN), which channeled loan resources to the individual savings and loans. It is recommended that the deadline for repayment of the loan be extended for at least 10 years to allow other SP's to be implemented. Recommendations to help CACEN improve its planning and control functions are also provided.","WASH task no. 152|Companion evaluation summary: PD-ABC-342","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","DPE-5973-Z-00-8081-00","","9/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Water supply structures|Potable water|Water sanitation|Loan administration|Savings and loan associations","Bolivia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABB807.pdf","897 KB","000333 - Camp Dresser and McKee, Inc.

"PACR of an OPG (1985-88) to the Pan American Development Foundation to help the National Development Foundation of Honduras (FUNADEH) to establish a TA and credit program for small enterprises. The project was largely a success.  A 10/86 evaluation found FUNADEH to be a cost-effective, well-managed organization with a highly qualified and trained staff. achieved in regard to number of loans made, number of direct and indirect beneficiaries, number of direct women beneficiaries, number of clients becoming eligible for credit from other financial institutions, and income and employment increases. On the negative side, due to insufficient funding FUNADEH did not reach a total loan portfolio of $2.2 million, nor did it reach self-sufficiency. Nonetheless, it is expected that self- sufficiency goals can be met during 1990. Several lessons were learned.  (1) Private sector leadership is key to the organization and support of programs such as FUNADEH. (2) Well organized management information and computerized data base systems are essential to track clients' enterprise development, monitor impacts, and manage the loan portfolio and finances effectively.  (3) Self-sufficiency in credit and in training should be separate issues. (4) Although close loan supervision can lower loan delinquency rates, it requires an intensive use of staff resources, which can also lower client coverage.  Future projects should analyze this trade-off before adopting the FUNADEH model in its entirety.  (5) The strategy of hiring and paying competitive salaries to extension officers with strong academic backgrounds contributed to the program's success and should be employed in similar programs.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","8/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Small scale enterprises|Credit|Loan administration","Honduras","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABB822.pdf","190 KB","008555 - USAID.

"Mid-term evaluation of a project to increase the quality and level of natural resources management activity in sub-Saharan Africa by providing TA, training, and special studies to Missions and participating PVO's. The evaluation covers the period 8/87- 2/90. The project has succeeded in attracting the Missions' attention to A.I.D.'s Plan for Supporting Natural Resources Management, which was initiated by Congressional mandate.  It has increased the overall level of natural resource management activities in the Africa region, and accelerated natural resources programming in Missions.  TA provided by the project to the Missions and PVO's has generally been highly valued. Less positively, however, Missions have evaluated many products of the project as being of mixed quality and overall not very useful. While the contractor has performed credibly and professionally, problems have occurred due to a lack of biodiversity expertise, a lack of gender analysis with regard to natural resource activities (as well as a shortage of women professionals on the team), and time constraints on collecting information outside the specific focus or from host government personnel. Moreover, a number of the Missions have felt that many of the project's activities (e.g., the Sahel subregional and other assessments, action programs, and action plans) were not based on problem assessments and are of little relevance or use.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-5517-I-00-7137-00","","2/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Natural resource management|Development project design|Environmental protection","Africa south of Sahara","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABB830.pdf","2,395 KB","005072 - Tropical Research and Development, Inc.","","001554 - USAID.

"Mid-term evaluation of a project to implement emergency locust control activities in Africa and develop the institutional capacity within Africa to prevent future locust plagues.  The evaluation covers the period FY88-1990. The project has been remarkably successful in combatting the current locust outbreak by providing Missions with the TA, commodities, and aerial spraying services necessary for plague control.  Although some problems have occurred, especially in procurement, the commitment of the project staff and other involved agencies has made the emergency assistance efforts a success. The project has made less progress in facilitating the longer- term control of such plagues.  There are two main reasons for this.  (1) The short-term demands of emergency assistance have overridden those of long-term development; this commonly occurs when these two objectives are combined in a single project.  In the present case, even the few resources devoted to longer-term activities have been poorly used. Research, for example, has been inadequate and largely unusable.  As a result, any future outbreaks of locusts will have to be dealt with in the same costly manner as at present, namely, aerial bombardment with pesticides.  Institutional development, including the capacity for remote sensing and field verification, could reduce the number of outbreaks that become plagues.  Now that the locust emergency appears to be waning, the project should focus on developing these institutional capacities.  A long-term follow-on project should also be planned. Other recommendations include: (1) establishing implementation mechanisms for emergency control operations; (2) implementing short-term actions such as providing specific assistance to Missions, in-country training for health personnel, and public information campaigns; and (3) establishing technical panels to review research proposals.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-5517-I-00-7137-00","","1/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Locusts|Plagues (pests)|Emergency relief|Pesticide spraying","Africa south of Sahara","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABB836.pdf","13,774 KB","005072 - Tropical Research and Development, Inc.","","000013 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of a project to provide TA to Missions, PVO's, and others in utilizing food technology in nutrition-oriented projects.  The evaluation covers the period FY83-FY88. Most project activities were centered around three general areas: (1) the development and manufacture of cereal-based weaning foods; (2) the design of new processes to fortify food products with vitamins and minerals; and (3) development of technological methods of food fortification.  For example, the project assisted in the development of low-cost extrusion cookers which were adopted in a number of countries (Sri Lanka, Guyana, Guatemala, Tanzania, Mexico, and India) for the production of weaning foods. These foods are being marketed and distributed through private and public sector outlets (dependent on the particular country). The addition of vitamins and minerals to processed foods has been accomplished through iron and nutrient supplementation of wheat flour in Bangladesh, and through vitamin fortification of food products (particularly monosodium glutamate) in Indonesia. TA provided was generally of high quality.  Project staff were competent, and appropriate private sector companies, individuals, and educational institutions were selected as consultants. Although there was a pattern of seeking advice from the same educational institutions for several projects, these institutions were responsive, productive, and produced good results. The impact of TA, however, is not easy to quantify.  Some activities were clearly successful, such as the Thriposha project, which resulted in the availability of a high-quality, low-cost, nutritious food product for numerous young children and poor mothers in Sri Lanka.  In other cases, success is probable but not yet assured.  For example, a white vitamin A pre-mix was formulated to be blended with monosodium glutamate to reduce vitamin A deficiency in Indonesia.  This product was difficult to develop and required years of persistence by project staff, but it is now being test-marketed in three provinces, and the chance for full success is very good.  Other activities were constrained by a high level of technical complexity or nontechnical factors related to the political, economic, marketing, and managerial environment. The project's loose management structure caused some problems, including minimal communications and strained working relations between project staff and the S&T Bureau.  The project also lacked an independent advisory committee, regular planning meetings between the grantee and the grantor, and external reviews.  At times the project's approach to problem-solving was too single-minded and unyielding.","Delivery order no. 6","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-1406-I-00-7028-00","","2/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Weaning foods|Blended foods|Nutrition research","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABB670.pdf","1,329 KB","002781 - Sigma One Corp.","","000189 - USAID.

"Interim evaluation of a project to provide TA to developing countries in assessing nutritional status and establishing nutrition surveillance systems.  The project implementing agencies are the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the Cornell Nutritional Surveillance Program (CNSP). The evaluation covers the period 1984-1988. Overall, the project has been highly successful in implementing a large number of surveys throughout the world.  Survey results have been very useful in documenting nutritional status, and have made a significant contribution not only to nutrition planning, but also to planning in the areas of health, agriculture, and economics.  CDC was instrumental in planning and implementing the surveys, training host country personnel, and maintaining high scientific standards for the assessment of nutritional status. CNSP performed well in providing short-term TA and training, in carrying out regional workshops, and in publishing materials. On the negative side, the project has not made satisfactory progress towards implementing national nutritional surveillance systems, neither in terms of actual implementation nor in terms of the development of methods appropriate for the resources available in most developing countries.  Progress has been particularly disappointing in developing timely warning and interventions systems for preventing extreme reductions of food consumption.  Possible reasons for this shortcoming are:  (1) an arbitrary division of labor between the two contractors; (2) a project design which prevented stronger linkages between survey- based baseline data and surveillance methodology; and (3) a need to develop more effective means for motivating country decisionmakers towards the use of the available information. CNSP's successful collaborations with the Government of Indonesia and UNICEF in East and Southern Africa should be studied more thoroughly to determine how this model has worked so that it can be institutionalized and promulgated in other regions.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-1406-I-00-7028-00-01","","1/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Nutritional status|Nutrition surveillance|Famine early warning systems|Food consumption","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABB792.pdf","2,889 KB","001036 - Research Triangle Institute (RTI)|002781 - Sigma One Corp.","","000189 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (1979-1989) to assist the Government of Swaziland (GOS) in expanding rural water systems to combat diseases related to water supply and poor sanitation. The project greatly increased the GOS Rural Water Supply Board's capacity to construct rural water systems.  Although only 64 of a targeted 78 water systems were completed, the population served by the systems is about 42,000, or 35% more than originally planned.  The latrine component also made good progress, with 3,500 begun and 2,000 completed, compared with the target of 3,000 completed.  These achievements resulted in an increase in the rural population's access to water supplies from 20% to 45% and to rural sanitation from 15% to 25%. has been incorporated into the Ministry of Health's budget and will continue indefinitely. The project also strengthened the Health Inspectorate Unit.  More than 90% of the Unit's staff were actively involved in latrine construction and can now adequately respond to community requests for construction assistance.  Training was provided to health assistants, health inspectors, and community development officers in the supervision of community latrine programs, communication skills, and community motivation.  Water committees in all regions of the country were trained in basic bookkeeping and preventive maintenance of their water systems. The project also supported development of a manual containing minimum design criteria for pit latrines which continue to be used in all pit latrine construction.  Finally, project TA contributed a great deal to planning activities in the water and sanitation sector, culminating in a two-year plan which was updated in 1989. Three major lessons were learned.  (1) The Fixed Amount Reimbursement mechanism is inefficient for funding such projects in Swaziland, since price increases which occur during the time gap between approval of cost estimates and actual construction can lead to cost overruns.  (2) Interministerial linkages are essential if more than one implementing office is involved in project activities.  (3) Long-range sectoral planning can be effective if the mechanisms focus on host government participation and not just external consultants.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Water sanitation|Water supply structures|Outdoor toilet facilities|Water related diseases|Disease prevention and control","Swaziland","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDBBT219.pdf","96 KB","008609 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (1984-1990) to establish an umbrella PVO to evaluate and fund development projects implemented by individual Honduran PVO's. Although the umbrella PVO, the Federation of Private Development Organizations of Honduras (FOPRIDEH), developed the institutional capacity to fund development projects and provide TA, it did not become self-sufficient.  This shortcoming can be attributed to: (1) the project's insufficient timeframe; (2) the attitude of FOPRIDEH members that FOPRIDEH staff should devote their time to member needs rather than organizational development; and (3) the lack of a budget for specific personnel or resources for work on self-sufficiency. FOPRIDEH has provided substantial training and TA to member PVO's, but the impact of the training was not measured, and much of its value has probably been lost due to high staff turnover in the PVO's.  Efforts to develop a TA and training bank were unsuccessful, because the PVO's were not willing to contribute their own resources. all subprojects was neglected by both FOPRIDEH and the PVO's. Three major lessons were learned.  (1) Conflicts of interest arise when federations are controlled by their members but dependent on outside financing.  Staff time and other organizational resources are absorbed by the members to the detriment of the long-term development of the federation. Problems are even more apparent when members resist repaying loans to the federation.  (2) Specific activities should be designed to promote self-sufficiency and impact evaluation.  (3) Training should be concretely programmed and based on an assessment of the institutions' real needs.  When PVO's are given the freedom to choose training courses, the training is often used as a reward for staff or as a means for furthering particular ideologies rather than as a resource to improve staff skills.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","8/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Federations|Economic self sufficiency|Development project evaluation|Private voluntary organizations","Honduras","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABB846.pdf","407 KB","008555 - USAID.

"Mid-term evaluation of a project to encourage the adoption by developing countries of national population policies and programs aimed at reducing fertility rates.  The evaluation covers the period 10/86-9/89. The project has performed well, with particularly strong success in helping countries adopt population policy statements.  Four countries have adopted such statements while five others have developed draft policies.  The project's greatest contribution in this area has been its creation of useful policy tools, including:  analyses of rules and regulations that assist or inhibit fertility reduction; benefit-cost analyses; programming and budgeting methodologies; and management information systems. These tools have been applied in 35 cases in 22 countries. The project has also had a strong impact on the shift of resources to population programs, and has helped a considerable number of countries build indigenous capacity to provide family planning services and initiate action plans to implement these services.  Various support activities (e.g., training, observational travel, long-term TA, fellowships, and information services) appear to have contributed to the project's overall success, although precise impact is difficult to measure.  The project's success is also evident in that it is ahead of schedule, has been fully supported by regional office and Mission buy-ins, and has received a favorable review from Mission staff and participating governments. Impact on the private sector has been limited, partly due to the project focus on Africa, where the private sector is not well developed. (A.I.D. should consider how project emphases on both the private sector and Africa can be reconciled.)  However, some noteworthy achievements have been made in encouraging public- private sector collaboration and in developing policies to support private sector provision of family planning services. The project has been instrumental in redefining policy as a set of actions rather than a mere statement of intent.  The stage is now set for a follow-on project that will focus more directly on these programmatic and operational aspects, especially in regard to contraceptive availability, where project work is just beginning.","Project title: Population technical assistance (POPTECH)","Special Evaluation","Documents","DPE-3024-Z-00-8078-00","","8/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Population policy|Policy making|Family planning policy|Pregnancy rate","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABB848.pdf","1,256 KB","006243 - Dual & Associates, Inc.|000673 - International Science and Technology Institute, Inc.

"Interim evaluation of a a project to conduct collaborative research on tropical soils management.  External evaluation covers the period through 1990. The project has contributed to the development of soil management methods for sustained, productive use of soil, water, and crop plants under tropical high rainfall, savanna, and semi-arid conditions. Commendable progress has also been made in developing a decision support system for dealing with soil acidity problems, and critical research has been conducted for developing other decision support systems.  The participating universities offer a pool of outstanding scientists who are knowledgeable and experienced in management of tropical soils. In past years they have made a concerted effort to encourage the practical application of their research findings by farmers and other land users. Despite these strengths, the project cannot continue activities at the current level due to cuts in A.I.D. funding.  The project conducts research at three prime sites -- the minimum desirable number for a global program.  However, while the prime site mode may be ideal, it appears to be beyond the project's capacity under present and prospective funding.  The project should consider a shift to another mode of operation, such as locating prime sites in areas where operations can be conducted with or through other international agencies.  The project also needs to shift to a more collaborative mode in which host country researchers are more involved in planning and conducting research.  Currently, the project is dominated by the U.S. institutions.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Tropical soils|Soil management|Soil research|Universities and colleges","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABB849.pdf","127 KB","","","000180 - USAID.

"Interim evaluation of a project to introduce the use of Norplant as a contraceptive method in three Peruvian clinics.  The evaluation covers the period 7/88-12/89. From the clinical standpoint, the project has advanced well and Norplant is now a well-accepted hormonal method.  Of the 302 women who have accepted Norplant, none have become pregnant, and only 12 have had the Norplant removed.  Reasons for removal included:  headaches (4), bleeding irregularities (2), pain at the implant site (1), other medical reasons (2), and personal reasons (3). Acceptors are predominantly young women under 30 years of age who are highly educated.  Most have 1 or 2 children, and only a few have more than 3.  Two-thirds have previously used modern contraceptives, with 1 out of 2 having used the IUD or the pill. An important finding is that 57% of the acceptors do not plan an additional pregnancy and half have had 1 or more abortions.  The project has made a special effort to visit acceptors who failed to comply with follow-up appointments, and only 3 acceptors have had no follow-up, since they evidently gave incorrect addresses and references. The project has faced two related problems.  (1) Enrollment of new acceptors has been slow, due to the frequent labor problems affecting the university hospitals.  (2) The country's hyperinflation and rapid currency devaluation have caused administrative difficulties.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","DPE-3005-A-00-3003-00","","1/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Contraceptive implants|Contraceptive research|Contraceptive agents and devices","Peru","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABB853.pdf","98 KB","006465 - Cayetano Heredia Peruvian University|000974 - Population Council","","000191 - USAID.

"Final external evaluation of a 1986-90 project to provide East African health professionals with (1) distance teaching services and (2) health planning and management assistance.  The project was implemented by the African Medical Research Foundation (AMREF). Both components were successful in improving the supervisory, management, and service delivery skills of health care professionals. AMREF's Distance Teaching Unit (DTU) exceeded its objectives, developing ten new courses and adapting five others, producing 191 radio programs and 38 audio cassettes, conducting numerous demonstrations in clinical skills and management, conducting 5 audio/radio production workshops for Ministry of Health (MOH) officials, and providing the latter with consultations on distance teaching programs.  Through its dedicated and highly qualified staff, the DTU generated wider acceptance of distance teaching as an effective training strategy for health workers.  Course enrollment increased dramatically, reaching a total of more than 5,000 health workers in Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, and the Sudan during the life of the project. Participants surveyed were satisfied with the program and feel that their job performance and professional status improved as a result.  They also indicated satisfaction with the radio programs and written materials provided, as well as the written and personal contacts with tutors. The second component also achieved significant accomplishments. AMREF established a Health Planning and Management Unit (HPMU) of well trained and experienced personnel, who functioned well as an interdisciplinary team.  Achievements of the Unit included: training of all 40 district health management teams in Kenya in the preparation of annual health plans; the development of learning materials and guidelines in planning and management for MOH's and PVO's; 13 consultancies in Kenya and Uganda; 5 health systems research projects; and provision of technical inputs to AMREF's own projects.  HPMU's collaboration with local institutions contributed to a climate of willingness to accept and adapt modern management practices.  Sustainability of both components is augured by the fact that AMREF is perceived as a valued resource throughout the region at all levels of the health delivery chain. Since both the DTU and the HPMU focus on management issues, it is recommended that in future they collaborate in this area to their mutual improvement.  Numerous more specific recommendations are made.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","PDC-0276-G-SS-6126-00","","8/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Health professionals|Health professional education|Health care planning|Correspondence education|Health care administration","East Africa","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABB858.pdf","1,790 KB","002940 - African Medical and Research Foundation (AMREF)","","000088 - USAID.

Most of the research is conducted by graduate students with supervision from project leaders and other experienced individuals.  Almost all research grants include a training component to strengthen research capacity.  In addition, the project is improving research policy and programs in the Ministry of Agriculture, Commodity Boards, regional institutions, and the University of the West Indies.

"PACR of a CARE project (8/85-1990) to develop community-operated water supply systems and provide related health education in the southwestern region of the Dominican Republic. Except for the Las Baitos system, which was completed in 2/90, all activities were completed before the PACD to the benefit of 33,932 people in 31 small communities.  A total of 49 handpumps and 5 piped water systems (4 pump-assisted and 1 gravity-fed) were built.  Although all of the water systems function properly, only about 25% of the handpumps are in optimal working order due to the mechanical problems of the Santo Domingo handpump and the difficulty of maintaining sufficient replacement parts; the piped systems have proven more reliable as a source of community water supply.  Water quality is acceptable and, with one exception, water quantity is sufficient.  Since the project did not provide material support for sanitation units, only 2 latrines were installed. Community organization and participation activities were carried out successfully.  Community members -- especially women -- were most active in the construction phase, with labor, local materials, money and food as the most common contributions. Health education activities, on the other hand, being informative in nature, did not allow the community much room for active participation; a major exception was the effort to maintain cleanliness and order at public standpipes and pump sites. Health censuses indicate that many of the original project beneficiaries continued to follow improved hygiene and water use practices after the termination of health education activities. Although water system management committees exist, the sustainability of the project is jeopardized by the failure of the communities to develop maintenance plans.  In most communities tools for maintenance are not readily available, and spare parts for the handpumps cannot be purchased locally. Additionally, the collection of water user fees is insufficient, and there is significant dependence upon CARE. USAID/DR should periodically monitor the project, which CARE has continued beyond the PACD, especially since CARE may seek to expand the project in the future.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Water sanitation|Water supply structures|Water supply structure maintenance","Dominican Republic","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABB865.pdf","694 KB","008537 - USAID.

"Title II food aid played an important role in supporting maternal/child health (MCH) feeding programs in the developing world during the 1980's.  If this role is to continue, however, major changes will need to be made in program orientation, design, funding, and implementation, according to this report. The study, which assesses MCH feeding programs from 1976-1989 and examines their potential for the 1990's, found that programs which are properly designed and implemented can be effective in improving the nutritional status of the recipients. In addition, while the need for MCH supplementary feeding is increasing (particularly in sub-Saharan Africa), the number of programs and beneficiaries is on the decline.  The report identifies the following as key elements of program success:  (1) adequate initial assessment of the magnitude and causes of the nutrition problems; (2) locally appropriate project designs; (3) community participation (especially by women); (4) sustained supply of culturally appropriate food; (5) strong administrative capacity of the implementing agency; (6) complementary inputs, e.g., education and primary health care; (7) feasible, cost-effective targeting of those in need; and (8) functioning logistics and monitoring/evaluation systems.  Major program constraints are also listed:  (1) inadequate needs assessment and design; (2) inadequate implementation and evaluation; (3) insufficient resources of the implementing organization; (4) the low priority accorded supplementary feeding by PVO's and governments; (5) funding gaps unmet by host governments or donors; and (6) cumbersome administrative requirements. Twelve specific recommendations are provided.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-0262-I-00-7151-00","","9/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Maternal child feeding programs|Dietary supplements|Nutrition improvement|Food for Peace Title II","Africa south of Sahara|Asia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNABG242.pdf","3,557 KB","006070 - Logical Technical Services Corp.

"Since 1980, A.I.D. has invested about $77 million in projects to improve Nepal's natural resource management, particularly in the hill regions where most poor farmers live.  This paper reviews the two largest projects -- Rapti Area Development and Resource Conservation and Utilization (RCU); it also describes how USAID/Nepal is supporting multidonor forestry projects.  The review identifies several important lessons.  (1) USAID/Nepal has been more effective in influencing policymaking and institutional changes when supporting multidonor projects than when acting alone.  (2) The Rapti and RCU projects underscore the difficulty of implementing large projects that involve technologies far beyond the host country's capabilities.  More importantly, they demonstrate that support for resource conservation need not always be technically sophisticated, but sometimes can -- and should -- begin by integrating research and extension activities into existing agricultural and rural development projects.  Such activities should concentrate on developing simple, low-cost technologies that can be undertaken and sustained by farmers individually or on a communal basis to improve livestock management, replant forests, and curb soil erosion on hill slopes and in catchment areas.  To gain farmer support, such activities should increase livestock and tree production without compromising food crop production.

"Mid-term evaluation of a project to increase national cereal production in Senegal, mainly by privatizing cereal seed multiplication and agricultural input distribution.  The evaluation covers the period 3/87-10/90. The project has shown very little progress.  Of $9 million in planned credit, none has been extended.  Seed certification, quality control, and promotional activities are concentrated in one region and on one crop (irrigated rice).  Two of the five long-term TA positions remain unfilled due to disagreement about their roles.  Only five of the projected nine host country personnel have been sent for long-term training.  Only a few months of the proposed 58 months of short-term specialized TA have been provided -- none in the key areas of privatization strategy and policy formulation. These shortcomings are mainly due to a hasty and careless project design based on insufficient analysis and unverified assumptions and resulting in overly ambitious and unrealistic goals -- particularly concerning the project's nationwide geographic focus, its complexity, the timeframe envisioned, and the resources provided.  More basically, the linkages between the project's components and the goal of increasing national cereal production were unjustified.  Attainment of that goal depends in fact on several factors totally lacking in the project -- improved availability and quality of cereal seed varieties, distribution of seed to isolated areas, effective extension and demonstration support, and efficient processing technologies. Furthermore, the project's credit delivery mechanism (commercial banks) is unsuitable for the particular risks of lending to small and medium-scale agribusinesses and seed multiplication operations.  Any such mechanism should accept more flexible guarantee requirements, have outreach and monitoring capabilities, and be guaranteed an interest spread higher than the project's 5-7%. Several lessons were learned.  (1) Pressures to accelerate project design should be resisted.  Proceeding with a project which is based on unverified assumptions can lead to a waste of project resources as fruitless activities are pursued or as resources are expended to validate assumptions and develop alternative strategies.  (2) Project designers should resist including activities which, though otherwise useful, do not directly contribute to achieving the project's basic goals.  (3) Clear lines of authority and responsibility must be established between any participating institutions and individuals.  (4) Projects with multiple and diverse objectives and managing entities are extremely difficult to manage and require excessive time and effort to achieve effective results.  (5) Privatization is not a panacea for public sector problems.  (6) Private sector collaborators require attractive incentives, clear yet not overly restrictive guidelines, and more timely feedback than do public sector institutions. The project should be suspended and redesigned.","Companion evaluation summary: PD-ABC-439, French evaluation:|PD-ABB-953","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-0085-I-00-9089-00","","10/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural credit|Privatization|Cereal crops|Agricultural production|Seed production|Development project design","Senegal","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABB952.pdf","1,734 KB","006434 - Devres, Inc.","","008600 - USAID.

"PACR of a project component to conduct country studies of health sector financing in Latin American and the Caribbean.  The component was implemented under a contract with the State University of New York at Stony Brook. The contract was a success.  It effectively engaged local researchers and health policymakers in the targeted countries (which included Belize, Peru, Ecuador, St. Lucia, Bolivia, Guatemala, and the Dominican Republic).  Local institutions gained experience in carrying out health economics research, and more than 40 scholars in the region participated in 4 regional seminars designed to analyze research results and derive policy implications from them.  These individuals also benefitted from the opportunity to develop a professional and personal relationship with members of the contract's Technical Advisory Group, which included professionals from the World Bank, PAHO, and U.S. public and private health organizations. The contract was also successful in developing and/or adapting technologies for application in the field, including a hospital costing scheme for Belize and St. Lucia and methodologies for costing primary care in Ecuador and Belize.  In applying rigorous demand analysis in Santo Domingo (the first such application in the Caribbean Basin), the contract used interactive data entry programs which reduced the time needed for compiling household survey data by 75%.  The contract also presented reviews of private sector options in Peru and Guatemala, and developed an exceptionally successful methodology for projecting the financial viability of a model private health organization. Three major lessons were learned.  (1) Studies conducted in response to specific Mission requests tend to be utilized and applied.  (2) Policy dialogue in the health sector takes time and requires ongoing support.  Future research contracts should provide follow-up support. (3) Costing methodologies used in the U.S. private sector must be greatly modified or simplified for application in Latin America, while other technologies, such as the use of microcomputers and interactive data entry programs, are directly usable and can be invaluable.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","3/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Health finance|Private health care|Cost studies|Policy analysis","Latin America|Caribbean|Belize|Peru|Ecuador|Saint Lucia|Bolivia|Guatemala|Dominican Republic","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABB954.pdf","244 KB","001373 - USAID.

"Mid-term evaluation of a project to develop a prototype computer program to support agricultural research and decisionmaking in developing countries.  The University of Hawaii at Manoa is the implementing agency.  External evaluation covers the period 9/87- 7/90. The project is well managed and highly productive.  The cornerstone computer program, the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) Version 2.1, has excellent documentation and has been distributed to 162 subscribers around the world. DSSAT combines soil, weather, and crop information to produce scientifically validated simulations of crop growth and yield; it currently includes four crops -- maize, soybean, wheat, and peanut -- with others in various stages of development. DSSAT has been used by policymakers to guide their decisionmaking and by research scientists to improve experimentation planning. In an unexpected application, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has used DSSAT to study global climate change.  Still further applications, e.g., for evaluating sustainable agriculture, pest management strategies, etc., are likely. Planned additions to DSSAT include:  (1) a socioeconomic dimension that will greatly assist in understanding on-farm choices and the consequences of policy decisions; (2) modules dealing with biological and physical constraints to crop growth; and (3) a multiple cropping/crop sequence module for small farm evaluations. The project's success is largely attributed to:  (1) the high quality and commitment of scientific and technical staff, (2) the collaboration of scientists from around the world, and (3) its foresight in selecting a minimum data set for crop simulations. Several lessons were learned.  (1) A successful project has a conceptual framework that is common to all participants, with stated and consistently applied goals.  (2) A process-oriented approach is effective in conducting multidisciplinary research. (3) A working group is an effective means of extending a project's membership and enlisting the cooperation of other collaborators.  (4) A network can serve as an effective clearinghouse of information and as a means for coordinating activities for a research project.  (5) When a project has intensive data requirements, the minimum data set and the means for integration of disciplines should be defined early.  (6) Open architecture computer programming allows replacement of individual modules which describe aspects of the overall program. (7) People will use quality products.","Delivery order no. 2","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-1406-I-00-0034-00","","1/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Computer software|Research planning|Computer technology|Agricultural research|Technology transfer|Decision making|Computer networks","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABC001.pdf","900 KB","006958 - International Resources Group (IRG)","","000180 - USAID.

"Evaluates the Regional Housing and Urban Development/Caribbean's (RHUDO/CAR) Regional Network and Training Program (RNTP).  The program was initiated in 1987 to improve RHUDO's training capacity and provide more effective assistance on shelter and urban development issues to countries in the region. In the nearly 3 years since the RNTP was formalized as an important RHUDO function, it has carried out numerous activities to assist the 17 countries that RHUDO covers -- providing opportunities for training to housing and urban development professionals and promoting information exchange throughout the region.  The RNTP is well designed and structured to support and promote RHUDO program and policy goals.  It has met many of its targets, and its overall impact at the policy and technical levels of regional shelter and urban development professionals and institutions has been positive.  Moreover, the RNTP has been effective in establishing dialogue in the region (including with the Regional Development Office/Caribbean); as a result, opportunities for training have emerged. However, the RNTP has been unable to provide training support for specific A.I.D. projects in the region.  Nor has it helped A.I.D. Missions to incorporate shelter and urban development interests into their strategies and training plans.  Moreover, since the RNTP is RHUDO's only public presence in many Caribbean countries, RHUDO is regarded by many as a networking and training promoter, and not as a provider of TA or project loans.  In sum, while the RNTP is an effective set of activities, it nevertheless lacks genuine integration into RHUDO's overall program. A major recommendation is that RHUDO clarify its policy agenda for the region and integrate RNTP activities into that agenda. It is also recommended that the RNTP:  strongly support the Caribbean Shelter Network in a way that makes the latter independent of A.I.D.; focus training more directly on country- identified needs; and strengthen its ties to A.I.D. Missions in the region, as well as to other donors, especially the UN Habitat and its networking activities.","Delivery order no. 10","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-1008-I-00-9066-00","","11/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Regional development|Urban development|Technical training|Housing","Caribbean","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNABG448.pdf","641 KB","006381 - Abt Associates, Inc.","","002960 - USAID.

"Interim evaluation of a Housing Guaranty program to help the Government of Indonesia (GOI) enhance urban services through decentralized administration and the strengthening of municipal financing capability.  External evaluation covers the period 8/88-7/90. Although the program has been delayed in some areas, overall performance has been adequate over the past year.  The GOI has: (1) completed studies on expanding private urban services and begun a number of private-public partnership ventures; (2) strengthened the property tax and improved the administration of local taxes and service charges; and (3) completed a number of new, integrated local investment programs. the program remains high, and a sense of urgency has persisted in all program components. On the negative side, progress in establishing a lending facility to support local government borrowing has been slow, and the overall volume of work accomplished during the past year has been below that of prior years.  This seems largely due to a temporary reduction in donor assistance.  Capital funds from previous agreements ran low and promised TA teams were being recruited but had not begun work.  However, substantial resource increases appear certain for 1990-91, as TA teams are being mobilized and major new World Bank lending programs get underway.  The proposed policy action plan for 1990-94 calls for actions to solidify accomplishments under the current plan and adds important new objectives, e.g., the full integration of the program into the regular local government budgeting processes, the expansion of cost recovery goals to other sectors besides water supply, the design of improved methods for pricing local services, and the establishment of a loan-grant linkage mechanism. In sum, the GOI's program for decentralized urban development is one of the most innovative, forceful, and pragmatic in the developing world, and there is every indication that the GOI remains seriously committed to its implementation.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-1008-I-00-9067-00","","8/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Urban development|Housing investment guaranty|Urban planning|Decentralization|Low cost housing","Indonesia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABC024.pdf","2,968 KB","002711 - Urban Institute (UI)","","002960 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of a project to assess mineral, petroleum, and groundwater resources in Egypt.  External evaluation covers the period 9/80-9/90. The project was effectively executed, with very positive results. The three primary objectives of data collection, data handling and management, and private sector investment were substantially achieved, though the impact of private sector investment may not be apparent for several years due to the nature of the natural resource development business.  Primary achievements included: (1) effective in-country and overseas training of the four participating Government of Egypt (GOE) agencies, all of which received substantial institutional strengthening through the project; (2) provision of equipment and related training to enhance technical information management by said agencies; (3) creation of a remote sensing data processing center of world class standards; (4) location and evaluation of groundwater aquifers in the Eastern and Western Deserts; (5) negotiation of three mineral concession agreements; and (6) completion of aeromagnetic, basin, and seismic surveys of interest to international oil companies. Despite these achievements, the project failed to meet expectations in several areas.  There was a disappointing lack of cooperation among GOE agencies, partly because of the failure of the GOE coordinating committee, but also as the result of long-standing competitiveness between agencies.  Due to conflicts in management, the Egyptian Geological Survey and Mining Authority was separated from the project in 4/87, fully 3.5 years prior to project completion.  This probably could have been avoided through efforts on all sides.  Finally, the completion of the Landsat Atlas was delayed by at least 3 years, primarily as the result of contracting problems which led to significant delays in the delivery of key equipment.","Delivery order no. 16|Companion evaluation: PD-ABC-046","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","PDC-5517-I-00-7136-00","","9/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Mineral resources|Petroleum|Groundwater|Geological surveys|Remote sensing|Data collection|Pre investment surveys","Egypt","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABC046.pdf","1,558 KB","006502 - Dames and Moore","","008539 - USAID.

"A comparative review of evaluations submitted by Africa Bureau Missions from 1987-89 is presented.  The 65 evaluations (44 interim and 21 final) reviewed indicate that progress has been mixed.  Projects in A.I.D.'s more traditional areas (i.e., agriculture, education, family planning, and transportation) as well as small enterprise development activities were showing good promise.  Progress was less positive in the newer areas (e.g., combatting childhood communicable diseases and natural resource management).  Several innovative approaches and successes in implementation are noted.  Particularly worthy of attention are grassroots efforts in agriculture, job skills, natural resource, and small enterprise development projects, as well as a computerized tracking and monitoring system, developed in Kenya, for the Commodity Import Program. Although not enough time had passed to assess project impacts, several lessons were learned which could be useful in future planning. (1) Project complexity was a root cause of many implementation problems. (2) Faulty project design assumptions contributed to a number of breakdowns during implementation.  (3) Institutional development should be given higher priority in project design, implementation, and management.  (4) A stronger focus on sustainability is needed both at the outset of project planning and during implementation.  (5) More systematic efforts to gather impact data are needed.  (6) Gender role implications require more attention.  (7) Mission management needs were frequently underestimated.  (8) External evaluations should be continued, but more systematic in-house monitoring and evaluation efforts need to be made during earlier stages of implementation. A final section of the report summarizes progress by sector (agriculture; health, nutrition, and family planning; education; natural resources; transportation; private sector; and nonproject assistance).","","Special Evaluation","Documents","AFR-0510-O-00-0040-00","","10/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Development project implementation|Development project design|Development planning|Development project management","Africa south of Sahara","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNABG683.pdf","1,261 KB","006504 - Solloway and Associates, Inc.","","000004 - USAID.

"Mid-term evaluation of a project to strengthen nongovernmental organizations (NGO's) in Bangladesh by providing TA to NGO support organizations and learning networks.  External evaluation covers the period 1/89-8/90. Thanks largely to its Senior and Associate Coordinators, the project is off to an excellent start, with 100 subproject commitments met and 40% of funds obligated.  It appears to have established a credible reputation, as evidenced by the number of subproject proposals submitted.  This achievement is noteworthy, given that the project is the first in Bangladesh to work with NGO's in sectors outside population/family planning; this new terrain is not automatically receptive to an American presence. The project has devoted considerable effort and support to the Association of Development Agencies in Bangladesh (ADAB), the largest NGO support organization in the country and the major representative voice for NGO's in their dealings with the Government of Bangladesh and its new and centralized NGO Bureau. In view of ADAB's central importance to the entire NGO enterprise in Bangladesh, this effort is well-invested, despite ADAB's current management problems.  The project has also provided effective support to smaller support organizations. The project has contributed to the proliferation of learning networks which bring together NGO's concerned with a specific topic, such as literacy.  Such groups are increasingly necessary, given the rate of NGO growth in Bangladesh and the constant introduction of new development practices and techniques. It is recommended that a strong monitoring and evaluation capability be built in order to consolidate project strategy. Creating an agenda to give greater coherence to research is also urged.","Companion evaluation summary: PD-ABD-538","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","8/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Private voluntary organizations|Institution building|Management training","Bangladesh","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABC096.pdf","1,887 KB","","","008511 - USAID.

"PACR of a program (7/87-9/90) to provide a $5 million cash transfer to the Government of Grenada (GOG) in support of economic policy reform. The program's original goal was to encourage the GOG to participate in a multi-donor structural adjustment program.  When this effort failed, A.I.D. became the major supporter of GOG policy reform, which entailed a drastic, rapid overhaul of the existing tax system.  While the reform succeeded in reducing the deficit and raising needed revenue, the economic benefits of the new taxes were not fully achieved because of structural and implementation problems.  Personnel to implement the new value- added tax (VAT) were insufficient and inadequately trained, and continual changes in VAT regulations and procedures created confusion and uncertainty in the private sector.  Private investment and construction activity flourished, but further development was hindered by the lack of coherence and continuity in tax policies. The VAT allowed higher income individuals and corporations to pay less taxes on their incomes, while lower income groups, previously exempt from taxation, were now taxed.  However, this effect was somewhat compensated by increases in welfare and income levels for all income groups, and there is no evidence that the program caused undue hardship to the poor. The program also implemented a plan to reduce the fiscal deficit by requiring a 25% retrenchment of public service personnel.  The plan backfired when skilled and senior personnel voluntarily departed, taking with them large severance payments.  With the departure of these key personnel, replacements had to be found, so retrenchment and recruitment were operating concurrently, overburdening the GOG administration.  The retrenchment plan proved demoralizing to staff and created social and political instability.  It was discontinued after only 6% of public service personnel had been retrenched. Several lessons were learned.  (1) A traditional VAT system is unlikely to succeed where tax administration is weak and proper accounting records are not available.  (2) Staff education and the mobilization of public support for policy reforms are critical to success.  (3) A phased and sequential technique is a better approach than a major overhaul of a tax system.  (4) Multi-donor support is preferable to U.S. bilateral assistance. (5) A.I.D. should not assume that developing countries share its belief in the efficiency of the private sector.  (6) When A.I.D. is a major donor, it should guard against instilling a client- state mentality of dependency in the recipient country.  (7) Institution and policy development projects should be extended to 6-10 years.  (8) Frequent changes in A.I.D./W's local currency guidance made it difficult to ensure that the program met all requirements.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","9/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Structural adjustment|Nonproject assistance|Tax reforms|Value added taxes|Policy reform","Grenada","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABC125.pdf","170 KB","008549 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of a subproject (SP) to establish a secondary agricultural training institute (SAI) at Ibb in Yemen.  In 1985, the SP's scope was broadened to include establishment of additional SAI's at Surdud and Sana'a and to strengthen the Ministry of Education's Department of Agricultural Education (DOAE).  External evaluation covers the period 1979-10/90. Except for strengthening the DOAE (which activity only began after the TA team moved to Sana'a in 1988), SP objectives were fulfilled.  The three SAI's have adequate facilities and equipment.  Instructional farms, agricultural mechanics laboratories, food technology facilities, and teaching resources centers are functioning, and a food technology facility at Surdud is under construction.  Trained Yemeni SAI staffs are in place and utilizing a common competence-based curriculum with 17 ""Yemenized"" textbooks (references) and 132 specifically designed instructional modules. Although enrollments fluctuated early in the SP, they are now high. Female students, however, are not admitted, since co- education is not condoned at the secondary level, in contrast to the primary and postsecondary systems.  Graduate placement is well developed, and many graduates aspire to college-level training.  Establishment of a postsecondary agricultural institute should be considered to serve the technical needs of the rapidly developing agricultural sector. Sustainability of the SAI's largely depends on continued strong commitment and support by the Republic of Yemen.  At the Ibb SAI, however, viability is threatened by problems related to an inadequate new director, who has caused great dissension and demoralization of teachers and support staff.  High-level attention should be given to resolving this problem. A number of physical needs also require attention -- serious structural failures at Ibb (which pose a safety hazard), insufficient land area and dormitory capacity at Sana'a, and maintenance and equipment inventory/repair systems at all three SAI's. Several lessons were learned.  (1) The SP should have encompassed the entire secondary agricultural education system at the outset and included plans to establish a teacher training program within the Faculty of Agriculture of Sana'a University.  (2) U.S. training of all Yemeni teachers would have resulted in better training at lower cost than training in Egypt.  (3) American- Yemeni co-directors of the Ibb SAI would have enable more rapid development, while providing valuable counterpart training for the designated Yemeni director.  (4) The World Bank's standard secondary school design requires extensive adaptation for SAI usage.  (5) The methodology of the project as a whole -- namely, the attempt to systematize several SP's under one umbrella project -- was naive and unnecessarily complex.  (6) SAI staff should instill a sense of pride and dignity in practical, hands- on activity by students. This may require some cultural and attitudinal adjustment by the staff.","Due to Gulf crisis, Mission not able to complete project evaluation|summary","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-0085-I-00-9089-00","","10/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural education|Secondary education|Agricultural schools|Institution building","Yemen","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABC126.pdf","3,930 KB","006434 - Devres, Inc.","","008624 - USAID.

"Since 1942, A.I.D. and its predecessor agencies have funded 19 major health-related projects in Guatemala in five areas:  health services, water sanitation, malaria control, family planning, and nutrition. These projects have brought significant and in many cases sustained benefits to the country.  This report identifies two kinds of factors affecting project sustainability -- contextual factors, i.e., those beyond the control of project designers and managers, and project characteristics. In regard to contextual factors, national commitment to project goals and support from influential groups had positive impacts on sustainability, whereas the inadequacies of the implementing institutions (in terms of fragmentation, conflicting goals, and poorly trained staff) had an adverse influence.  Sociocultural differences adversely affected sustainability when they were not taken into account, and had a positive influence when they were.  Other contextual factors, such as natural disasters, political environment, U.S.-Guatemalan relations, economic changes, the private sector, and donor coordination, seemed to have little impact on sustainability.  Project characteristics important to sustainability included:  visibly effective achievement of project goals, integration of the project into the structure of the implementing agency, qualified and stable leadership from both the implementing agency and A.I.D., ability to provide for progressive absorption of recurrent costs, provision of significant professional or paraprofessional training and technical assistance, and cooperation between A.I.D. and the Guatemalan Government in project design.  Project characteristics which did not seem important for sustainability include: foreign exchange demand, cost recovery, cost-effectiveness, appropriate technology, and community participation.  Policy implications are presented in conclusion.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","9/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Health delivery|Project sustainability|Health finance|Technical training|Health workers","Guatemala","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAX248.pdf","136 KB","003433 - USAID.

"Summarizes external evaluation (PD-ABC-183) of USAID/Haiti's Hillside Strategy, which aims at promoting sustainable agricultural production through reforestation, hill cropping systems, and soil conserving farming practices.  Evaluation covers the period 1971-6/90. The Hillside Strategy is not succeeding.  Nowhere in the Haitian hillside is the use of fertilizer, soil conservation devices, or other techniques or intervention packages promoted by USAID/H projects having a significant impact on the quality of life and well-being of farmers and their families.  In most areas, the standard of living is worsening. There are several factors underlying USAID/H's lack of success. None of its projects have successfully integrated the many elements necessary for successful hillside agriculture -- a combination of forests and woodlands, permanent pasture with controlled grazing, intercropping with permanent tree crops, and intensive agriculture.  The strategy has also failed to recognize that erosion control measures need to be subsumed to existing agricultural patterns; that small kitchen gardens producing calorie, protein, and vitamin-based crops are requisite even on hillsides; and that most of the country's food will ultimately have to be grown on the plains.  The strategy also seems dissociated from the harsh realities of Haiti's peasant farmers, who barely eke out a living with no margin for risk and no effective cash flow, and it is constrained by a lack both of investments in hillside farming and of planning to secure such investments, especially from the private sector. Beyond resolving these problems, the strategy needs to be strengthened by adding three more components:  (1) achieving a gradual decline in the hillside population, (2) promoting off- farm and non-agricultural employment, and (3) developing markets for permanent crop and livestock products and perishables. Despite these shortcomings, there is no doubt that the Haitian peasant is in need of the services offered by the projects. However, it is critical that the projects be redesigned and reformulated immediately so that the benefits of the overall program can be realized in this decade.  In rethinking the strategy, the following considerations should be paramount.  (1) Local experts can often adapt new methods to local conditions better than outsiders.  (2) Local people may need time and a series of small successful changes in order to develop the will and the capability for further change.  (3) It is usually preferable to build upon and branch from existing technologies rather than to introduce entirely new ones.  (4) The purpose of joint participation is to establish trust and shared goals, not to reach a facile compromise on conflicting or unrelated objectives.  (5) Dialogue must take place within communities as well as between the community members and outsiders.  (6) External constraints can often block local initiatives.","V. 2: PD-ABC-183","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","11/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Hills|Agricultural development|Development strategies","Haiti","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABC139.pdf","988 KB","006434 - Devres, Inc.","","008554 - USAID.

"Interim evaluation of a subproject (SP) to strengthen the capabilities of Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) centers to conduct research on postharvest losses of fruits and vegetables. External evaluation covers the period 10/82-11/90. Postharvest research units have been successfully established within each of the four participating ICAR centers, and inputs and activities have laid the foundation for accomplishing the overall purpose.  The SP has provided U.S. training for 28 scientists as well as research equipment and TA by 8 U.S. consultants.  The A.I.D. inputs received early in the project have had a positive impact on research quality and type, although delays have occurred in construction and remodelling of research facilities and in the purchase and delivery of research equipment.  Additional assistance will be required to install and provide proper training in the latter. Substantial progress has been made on the following research topics: (1) pre-harvest and harvesting factors; (2) loss assessment, handling, and transport; (3) storage techniques; (4) processing methods; and (5) waste utilization.  The planned establishment of collaborative research between U.S. and Indian scientists will greatly benefit the centers.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","386-0000-C-00-5039-00","","11/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural research|Post harvest food losses|Research centers","India","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABC146.pdf","988 KB","004307 - Winrock International.

"Interim evaluation of a project to assist the state-owned Bank Rakyat Indonesia (BRI) in transforming its more than 3,000 sub- district branches (Unit Desa) into self-sustaining commercial financial intermediaries.  The evaluation covers the period through 8/90. This is an excellent project.  The Unit Desa system has registered impressive growth and is fully self-sustaining.  In 1989, it earned a $25 million profit, a remarkable turnaround from its loss of more than $24 million in 1984.  Total assets increased 617% during this period, while returns on average assets have shown a steady upward trend, rising from 2.7% to 3.6% from 1986 to 1989. Progress towards EOPS indicators has been very good.  (1) The amount of Kredit Pedesaan Umum (KUPEDES) loans outstanding for enterprise expansion has risen to more than Rp.1.1 trillion, against a target of Rp. 800 billion, although the long-term loss ratio of 3.28% is still above the target of 2.5% or less.  (2) Unit Desa savings deposits have increased dramatically since the introduction of the Simpanan Pedesaan savings scheme in 1985 and account for over 50% of the KUPEDES loan volume, as planned. (3) The labor costs of intermediation have fallen from 14.4% to 10.2%.  (4) Unit Desa has a formal reporting network and BRI has established a research department which performs borrower and product research for the Unit Desa system. The income distribution profile of Unit Desa customers is roughly that of the rural population:  about 73% are landless or nearly landless and 15.1% fall below the poverty line.  Just under 25% are women -- fairly high by Indonesian standards.  Profits earned by borrowing enterprises have grown in real terms at an annual rate of 24.6% during an average of 3 years of participation. Borrowers' total household income grew over a similar period at an annual rate of 20.7%, with per capita incomes increasing by 3.8% per year.  Total employment in borrower enterprises has increased at an annual rate of 18.2% in terms of persons and 22.5% in annual labor hours. The project has been extremely effective at the policy level.  In particular, TA has played a major role in shaping BRI's interest rate policy, the structure of lending and savings instruments, and overall BRI policy toward the Unit Desa system. Significant contributions have also been made in facilitating the automation of BRI functions and in constructing BRI regional training centers.  However, inadequate staff development and training are serious constraints on the Unit Desa system.  There are about 900 staff vacancies and more than 4,000 persons need to be recruited for 1990. Numerous lessons were learned.  (1) A combination of policy input and hands-on TA has been necessary to accomplish project objectives.  (2) TA effectiveness has largely been due to long- term relationships between the TA team and senior Indonesian officials.  (3) Project success has been heavily dependent on BRI commitment.  (4) Government-owned institutions can be effective when they are responsive to market signals and use market-based performance incentives.  (5) An intellligent interest rate policy has been essential to the success of the Unit Desa system.  (6) Development impact is impossible without a viable institution. (7) Provision of financial services as opposed to targeted credit offers greater opportunities for developing a large customer base, a self-financed funding base, and institutional self- sustainability.  (8) The demand for liquidity among the rural population is far greater than the demand for credit.  (9) Financial services to low-income rural populations can be profitable.","Project title: Growth and equity through microenterprise investment|(GEMINI)","Special Evaluation","Documents","497-0341-C-00-5092-00","","10/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Financial institutions|Banks|Credit|Rural populations","Indonesia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABC147.pdf","2,353 KB","006727 - Development Alternatives, Inc.

"External mid-term (FY87-4/90) evaluation of a project to support private enterprise development in Guatemala. Though behind schedule and chaotically managed, the project has strengthened USAID/G's policy leverage and it has promoted the institutional development of participating Guatemalan agencies. Moreover, three of its four components have been quite successful to date. (1) The Guatemalan Management Association (AGG) has organized a center to provide training and TA to the small and medium enterprise (SME) sector.  To date, training has been provided to 1,760 persons. However, since few trainees avail themselves of TA offered by the center, only 46 have received the complete training/TA package, against a target of 1,000. (2) The export development component is making good progress. The Nontraditional Product Exporters Guild (Gremial) has produced manuals on 18 nontraditional agricultural exports, helped improve export performance by a number of firms, and improved its own income-raising capacity and its targeting of technical support. The Chamber of Entrepreneurs (CAEM) has played a key role in the passage of Free Zone and Maquila legislation and the actual development of free zones, three of which are being constructed or planned with A.I.D. support.  CAEM has also established the planned Free Trade Production Facilities (FTPF) Investors Services Center, though aggressive promotion has not yet begun and an FTPF strategy remains to be formulated.  The Ministry of Economy (MOE) has established a technical unit in the National Export Promotion Council (CONAPEX) which has proven to be a dynamic forum for debate and action on issues vital to Guatemala's private sector.  Plans to establish an Export Promotion Fund (FODEX) in the Central Bank appear stalled, however, at least until after the elections. (3) The MOE is also succeeding in creating a supportive public policy environment for SME's among the Direccion de Politica Industrial and other export-related agencies. (4) The financial markets component is not succeeding, however. The planned loan guaranty fund for SME's has been delayed due to reluctance among bankers to extend loans to SME's.  A second activity, to promote financial market research by the Chamber of Finance has made no meaningful progress. The project's approach of supporting but not directing private sector initiatives is well founded.  The indirect approach promotes a sense of ownership of project elements on the part of participating institutions, and contributes to sustainability. Nonetheless, the informal operating style of the Project Management Unit (part of CAEM), should not continue. Development of a dedicated managerial staff is a key need. The project timeframe is unrealistic, given the  complexity of its activities.  Contributing to this problem is the fact that the project is the first major private sector effort for USAID/G. The project is in fact a program and should be renamed and reorganized to reflect this reality.  A 2-year extension is also recommended. For lessons learned, see abstract of PD-ABC-152.","Attached to PD-ABC-152","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Private enterprises|Small scale enterprises|Medium scale enterprises|Beneficiary count","Guatemala","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDABC152A.pdf","3,656 KB","003970 - Management Systems International, Inc.

"Final evaluation of a project to promote the Billings Ovulation Method (BOM), a natural family planning (NFP) technique, through the production and worldwide distribution of educational materials as well as U.S. training courses for BOM teacher trainers.  The project was carried out by the Family of the Americas Foundation (FAF).  External evaluation covers the period 1984-88. The project seems to have had little or no significant impact on general interest in BOM.  The BOM educational film did not, as stipulated, target FP providers (though it may be adaptable for them), and other educational materials, while technically accurate (if incomplete), were sometimes culturally inappropriate and impractical. This may have been due to FAF's failure to pre- test the materials, a requirement for which was omitted from the Cooperative Agreement.  FAF did not have information on the distribution of these educational materials readily available, but it is evident that distribution was biased in favor of organizations with FAF approval.  Organizations which did not embrace FAF's philosophy about FP (which included A.I.D./W, Missions, and other A.I.D. cooperating agencies) had a very difficult time obtaining the materials. The training workshops seem to have been well organized and taught, and the curriculum remains useful, especially as a reference tool.  In the long term, this training is expected to professionalize, standardize, and increase the training of new BOM instructors and thereby promote NFP.  In some cases, however, participants developed more negative attitudes toward other contraceptive methods.  This may aggravate the conflictive relationship between NFP and multi-method FP agencies, contributing to an environment in which both sides produce misinformation which hinders informed public choice. Overall relations between A.I.D. and FAF, which cannot be called a ""cooperating agency"" in any meaningful sense, were stormy.  FAF was rigid and uncooperative in respecting A.I.D. guidance and priorities for participant selection, and failed to exercise caution in avoiding controversial topics beyond the content of the curriculum.  In addition, FAF's production of the BOM film for other than the targeted audience and its failure to deliver to A.I.D. all footage, preprint materials, and the master print constitute serious breaches of the Cooperative Agreement. Why the Agency continued to support the project are unclear, although there is evidence that it may have been influenced by members of the U.S. Congress.  Finally, because of the possible integration of religious doctrine in the training courses, A.I.D. may have violated the First Amendment, which precludes the use of tax revenues for nonsecular activities. A major lesson learned is that A.I.D. and its umbrella projects should fund only those agencies that can demonstrate a willingness and ability to cooperate with A.I.D. and other Cooperating Agencies and that conform with A.I.D. population policy.  In the field of NFP, such organizations do exist.","Companion evaluation summary: PD-ABC-511|Project title: Population technical assistance (POPTECH)","Special Evaluation","Documents","DPE-3024-Z-00-8078-00","","12/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Family planning|Contraceptive methods|Behavioral methods (birth control)|Family planning education","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABC162.pdf","1,591 KB","000673 - International Science and Technology Institute, Inc.

"PACR of an OPG to the Salesian Society, Inc. (SSI) for a project (8/87-8/88) to reconstruct the Ricaldone Technical Institute in El Salvador, damaged by an earthquake in 1986. Despite delays caused by the rainy season and the discovery of polluted soils at the project site, three modular classroom buildings were completed.  In addition, SSI saved $121,900 on the construction and was allowed to use the funds to help finance construction of an additional multiple purpose building, thus making effective classroom and office space double what it was prior to the earthquake.  The Ricaldone Institute now has the most modern training modules of any vocational school in the country and is capable of providing technical training to 1,200 students per year. The project's ultimate value, however, lies in the Institute's ability to alleviate human misery by providing skills training and the chance for a steady job to those otherwise trapped in a cycle of poverty.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","11/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Technical training|Vocational training|Training centers|Building construction|Disaster response|Earthquakes|Poverty","El Salvador","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABC171.pdf","132 KB","008540 - USAID.

"Interim evaluation of a subproject (SP) to test a methodology for extending credit to small rural enterprises in the Egyptian regions of Damietta and Sharkia through the National Bank for Development (NBD). The evaluation covers the period 1987-10/90. The SP has exceeded expectations.  Since lending began in 10/89, the SP has made 4,816 loans -- against a target of 2,000 -- in the amount of L.E. 3.96 million.  High demand has resulted in full utilization of the loan fund and has brought the SP to the break-even point in operational income and expenses.  SP success is attributable to both the strong leadership within the NBD and the responsiveness and hard work of small entrepreneurs. More specifically, the loans have been made at market-based rates to small entrepreneurs in 93 villages in 38 village council units on an unsecured basis.  Women comprise about 9.3% of borrowers, receiving about 10% of the amount loaned.  There have been no loan losses and the loan delinquency ratio is 0.3%.  More than 100 different types of activities have been funded.  Although working capital loans are common, most loans have been made for the purchase of small machines, equipment, and tools. Borrowers reported increased income as a result of the loans and many have hired additional employees. Because of these outstanding results, this pilot activity can be replicated in Cairo in its current form with minor modifications to reduce operational costs.  However, an independent financial audit should be carried out before the SP is extended to other areas, since NBD operational expenditure data have been unreliable.","Project title: Growth and equity through microenterprise investment|(GEMINI)","Special Evaluation","Documents","DHR-5448-Q-10-9081-00|263-0161-A-00-7254-00","","10/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Credit|Commercial credit|Rural areas|Small scale enterprises|Loan administration","Egypt","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNABG829.pdf","619 KB","006727 - Development Alternatives, Inc.

"Final evaluation of a project to increase Zimbabwe's pool of skilled professionals by training personnel (public sector, parastatal, and private sector) in key development areas and by strengthening technical colleges and the University of Zimbabwe. External evaluation covered the period 7/82-9/90. The project succeeded in increasing Zimbabwe's supply of skilled personnel, helping the country cope with severe skills' shortages, and strengthening key training institutions.  Targeted outputs were exceeded by 30%, as 158 persons obtained academic degrees (53 Bachelors, 82 Masters, 19 Doctoral, and 4 Diploma) and 209 participated in U.S. or third country short-term professional or technical programs; about 14% of trainees were faculty and staff of the University of Zimbabwe. Moreover, some 300 person-months of TA were provided, mainly in the form of lecturers at local training institutions. The relevance of the training provided is evident in that many former participants now hold positions of authority with increased salaries, improved job performance, and greater mobility.  Project beneficiaries, across the board, say that the project was highly effective, and officials of major participating institutions view it as one of the most successful in Zimbabwe's history, with benefits described as immense and far-reaching. Project management was characterized by effective interaction and cooperation among implementing agencies; management shortcomings were confined primarily to three areas:  limited advance planning time on the part of the GOZ, inadequate data in the field on U.S. training programs, and a lack of short-term, practical skills' upgrading courses.  Another weakness was that Historically Black Colleges and Universities made up only 5% of participating institutions, which was far short of expectations. Representation of women participants was relatively high, however, with women making up 23% of the total. Two major lessons were learned.  (1) Performance expectations must be backed by performance criteria and actively managed systems of accountability.  (2) Participant training programs should provide highly personalized services so that each individual's programmatic and personal needs are taken into account.  This project did. Included are brief case studies of some of the project's most successful activities:  training of six pilots for Air Zimbabwe; training in public health, firefighting, and water management for seven employees of the City of Harare; and implementation of an in-country management training seminar for senior executives.","Delivery order no. 24","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-1109-I-00-7119-00","","10/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Education for development|Participants|Universities and colleges","Zimbabwe","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABC193.pdf","1,232 KB","001341 - Creative Associates International, Inc.

"Mid-term evaluation of a subproject (SP) to strengthen the capacity of Consejo Hondureno de la Empresa Privada (COHEP) to promote economic policy reform in Honduras.  External evaluation covers the period 9/87-9/90. The SP has had mixed results. COHEP's economic research has more than met expectations.  Eighteen studies on such topics as agriculture, credit, trade, and investment constraints were conducted and ten position papers prepared.  The impact of these studies included bringing to full public attention a number of key economic issues, and most importantly, supplying the analytic framework for the Government's economic restructuring. Public relations, conferences, and publications have for the most part been successful.  Nonetheless, the Consejo's basic image -- a group of well-to-do merchants, based in Tegucigalpa and supporting the Nationalist Party -- has not changed substantially. Nor have COHEP's positions always reflected the views of its membership.  In fact, even though COHEP is the private sector's lead institution for representing broad issues, COHEP lacks professionalism in this area, and many key private sector leaders with close ties to the government are not active in COHEP. Member associations still go directly to the government to resolve their problems.  Services to members are improving, however. Internally, COHEP has established adequate accounting systems, operational plans, and personnel standards, though covenants regarding reorganization of COHEP and reform of its by-laws remain unfulfilled (reorganization is underway, however). In addition, COHEP has yet to develop a stable, trained, professional staff, it lacks a plan to achieve financial self-sufficiency, and collection of a capital fund has barely started. Income from non-grant sources covers only about 13% of budgeted spending, though with the change in the exchange rate, COHEP will probably not use the total grant by the 9/92 PACD. Several lessons have been learned.  (1) More effort should have been made up front to secure COHEP's understanding of the full implications of the Cooperative Agreement.  (2) The assumption that strengthening COHEP would unite the private sector in support of a market economy was ill-founded.  For COHEP to both promote economic modernization and serve as an open democratic umbrella organization of the private sector is close to being a contradiction in the Honduran context.  (3) Promoting the value of a market economy in Honduras entails educating not only the public but entrepreneurs as well.  (4) COHEP's staffing problems illustrate the importance to project implementation of the availability of human resources.

"PACR of a pilot project (1979-1988) to support decentralized regional project planning and implementation and establish a funding mechanism for priority subprojects in market towns and rural areas in the Departments of Junin and Cajamarca. The project made respectable progress, and the processes of decentralization and administrative simplification are being implemented.  Personnel trained by the project are working at different levels of the Government of Peru (GOP) and the private sector. Institutional strengthening/TA activities included:  (1) establishment of TA and training programs within the Ministry of the Presidency (MIPRE) and National Institute for Municipal Development (NIMD); (2) a study of the issues involved in regionalization and administrative simplification, which resulted in the revision of legal provisions and norms governing programming and budgeting; (3) the provision of vehicles and machinery to Departmental Development Corporations (DDC'S) of Junin and Cajamarca; (4) the installation of microcomputers in four municipalities as demonstration models for other municipalities; and (5) provision of TA/training to all 24 DDC's and 482 municipalities. The market town development component executed 38 activities benefiting 22,540 families, mainly by providing them with electricity, markets, slaughterhouses, and a trout processing plant.  The component's success is evident in the GOP's establishment of a revolving fund for financing similar activities. Under the rural public works component, 99 activities were implemented for the benefit of 46,980 families, mainly through community highways, irrigation canals, and reservoirs.  The major strength of this component was the high degree of local participation in selecting finance priorities, contributing resources, providing labor, and maintenance and repair.  To further support community participation in development, promotion offices were established to organize community activities and provide training in such areas as community leadership, family planning, crop handling, crafts, agricultural marketing, and home economics. Several major lessons were learned.  (1) Although Peru's budgetary and administrative process is antithetical to decentralization, it is possible to create decentralized local development organizations by drawing almost exclusively on local human resources.  Indeed, there is a strong rationale and basis for decentralized development in Peru.  (2) Promoting rural development by strengthening rural-urban linkages in and around market towns is a viable development concept in Peru.  (3) Municipalities are a critical source for mobilizing capital and human resources for development at a time when the central government has scant resources.  (4) Local participation in project selection, planning, labor, and in-kind inputs is a vastly underutilized resource in rural Peru.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","4/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Integrated regional development|Market towns|Decentralization|Public administration|Development planning|Rural development|Beneficiary count","Peru","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDKAR981.pdf","243 KB","008591 - USAID.

"Final external evaluation of a 1983-12/90 program to provide budgetary support to help the Government of Zimbabwe (GOZ) expand its educational and vocational training systems. Prior cash transfers and commodity import programs had funded primary and secondary school construction, creating the necessary infrastructure for expansion of teachers and materials. Expansion is evident in the rise between 1980-1990 in:  (1) enrollments in primary (1.236 million to 2.282 million), secondary (75,000 to 708,000), technical (3,600 to 9,400), and teacher training schools (2,800 to 16,500), and universities (2,200 to 9,300); (2) number of instructors in primary (28,500 to 58,500), secondary (3,700 to 28,000), technical (0 to 450), and teacher training schools (260 to 720), and universities (300 to 700); and (3) number of primary (3,100 to 4,500), secondary (200 to 1,500), technical (2 to 10), and teacher training facilities (7 to 14).  Also, enrollment shifted from 94%, 5.4%, and 0.6% for primary, secondary, and tertiary schools, respectively, to 75%, 24%, and 1%.  The number of qualified teachers quadrupled to 36,000. Unit costs grew 13% in real terms for primary education but declined 57% for secondary education.  Public spending on education (c. 22% of recurring public expenditures) increased 175% in real terms.  Policies to increase cost recovery (beginning in 1991) may have an impact on cost-effectiveness, but equity effects may be problematic. The program made important contributions.  (1) Needed foreign currency helped the GOZ reallocate resources to redress inherited inequities, e.g., by building/equipping tertiary schools and for producing/distributing distance learning materials, books, and technical kits, most of which went to schools with few resources, although kits tended to be distributed to schools with better equipped classrooms and more storage space, i.e., pre- independence elite schools.  (2) Teacher training was very useful, although the inability to attract and retain qualified secondary/tertiary instructors remains a constraint.  (3) The program developed relevant curricula and syllabi at all 3 levels, developed a degree program, and modified secondary school exams and materials.  (4) The GOZ made substantial use of the limited resources allotted for planning and administration, e.g., it installed a computerized management information system to help decentralize certain functions, localized examinations, and improved procedures for producing and distributing learning resources.  At the tertiary level, program resources were instrumental in starting a Human Resources Research Center (University of Zimbabwe), which is providing in-career management training for the education sector.  However, the lack of a comprehensive plan for human resources development in Zimbabwe generally, and in the education sector specifically, as well as a growing climate of professional uncertainty suggested by turnover in GOZ mid- and upper management, show that planning and administrative capacity are not given sufficient attention. The program's sector approach was appropriate, providing the GOZ with budget support and the private sector with access to foreign currency during times when both needed assistance.  As sector assistance, the program's focus on budgetary support rather than policy dialogue proved effective, since it kept A.l.D. out of implementation issues and allowed the GOZ to gain a sense of initiative and control over policy implementation during the first decade of independence.  Regarding cost-effectiveness and sustainability, the program performed as well as and perhaps better than other forms of assistance.  Fully projectized assistance might have had more explicit measures of effectiveness, but the GOZ may not have been able to provide the needed monitoring capacity.  Further, project assistance would not have provided needed flexibility and budget assistance.  Many of the program-funded projects, such as the distance learning materials, were cost-effective, and others, such as technical colleges, will be more cost-effective when fully utilized. Several lessons were learned.  (1) After the initial burst of development efforts following independence, it is important that activities planned for a large scale are first tested on a small scale. (2) In designing and implementing pilot activities, people at the operational level (school heads and teachers) need to be involved; coordination needs to be carefully planned where different levels or subsystems come together.  (3) Failure to allocate sufficiently for human resource development reduces the effectiveness and threatens the sustainability of infrastructure and system-strengthening activities such as construction and curricular reform.  (4) Plans to maintain equipment and obtain spare parts after assistance ends need development early on, while foreign currency exists.  (5) Program assistance (as distinct from budget assistance) needs long-term planning in order to provide follow-up assistance to efforts that are working well and to respond to new crises and opportunities.  (6) Programs need to develop more specific goals and outcomes such as are normally found in projects. In the present program, linkage between broad sector goals and specific projects supported by program funding enabled the development of quantitative outcomes to complement the qualitative measures of sector performance.

"Final impact evaluation of a project to improve pre- and in- service training of primary school teachers in Swaziland. External evaluation covers the period 3/84-8/90. The project has had a significant impact in all areas, including curriculum revision, teacher training, teacher performance, and Government of Swaziland (GOS) awareness of the significance of primary education.  All objectives were met, with the exception of the number of teachers graduating from the teacher training colleges (TTC's) and the University of Swaziland (UNISWA). Highlights include the following:  (1) institutionalization of contributions to teacher education as a line item in the GOS yearly budget; (2) new three- and four-year programs for primary school educators in both the TTC's and UNISWA; (3) in-service teacher workshops for all 504 primary schools; and (4) development and use of improved classroom instruction materials. The system established by the project is continuing to function without TA.  Its sustainability, however, is dependent on the Ministry of Education's ability to properly manage and coordinate needed program modification and to support areas in which slippage has occurred over the past year.  This ability is in question, since the program was neither reviewed nor modified during the past year due to a lack of leadership and coordination by the Inspectorate of Teacher Education and Curriculum Development.  Numerous recommendations are made to ensure purposeful nurturing of the young system and the sustainability of its tremendous impacts.","Delivery order no. 25|Companion evaluation summary: PD-ABC-835","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","PDC-1109-I-00-7119-00","","8/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Teacher training|Primary education|Teachers' colleges|Teacher education|Universities and colleges","Swaziland","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABC234.pdf","4,147 KB","001341 - Creative Associates International, Inc.

"Interim evaluation of Phase II of CORE subproject (SP) to strengthen the capacity of Yemen's Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries (MAF) to plan and monitor a program supportive of private sector agriculture production and marketing.  The evaluation covers the period 1985-4/90. CORE was redesigned after a 1984 evaluation of the overall project, but it took almost 3 years after the redesign to recontract the SP and obtain new SP management.  Progress has been unsatisfactory.  The MAF remains understaffed and in need of extensive training in technical agricultural economics, statistics, and management.  Its internal planning processes are generally informal and unstructured, with little monitoring or accountability, and its budget is inadequate to maintain staff or supplies.  The SP has purchased many expendable office supplies and furniture as well as equipment for which MAF may not be able to cover recurrent costs. SP focus has not been clear or consistent.  Long-term TA has lacked continuity, and many advisors have played almost exclusively operational roles.  Long- and short-term trainees have not been selected on the basis of MAF needs or budgets, and the development of a MAF training unit -- a major SP objective -- has not been pursued. Nonetheless, progress has improved during the past year, with a shift towards areas that are central to improving MAF capability to supporting private sector agricultural production and marketing.  These areas include:  planning and policy analysis, agricultural economics and marketing, and statistics and data collection.  MAF has begun to be involved in designing annual work plans, and numerous monitoring and recordkeeping systems have been instituted.  However, this progress is very recent, and much effort will be required to sustain it. The major lesson learned is that institution building requires the incorporation of several elements, including narrowly focused activities in a limited set of entities, a strong monitoring system, sensitivity to the socio-cultural-political environment, financial controls that limit spending on unsustainable activities, and selection of an experienced contractor with at least some bilingual capabilities.","Due to Gulf crisis, Mission not able to complete project evaluation|summary","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","4/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Institution building|Government departments|Private sector|Agricultural production|Agricultural product marketing","Yemen","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABC224.pdf","2,587 KB","006559 - Ricards International, Inc.","","008624 - USAID.

"Final external evaluation of a subproject (SP) to improve the capacity of Yemen's Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries (MAF) to support increased fruit production through extension activities, plant protection, and delivery of disease-free plant materials.  The evaluation covers the period 2/83-12/89. Rated as marginally satisfactory, the SP suffered many serious management and implementation shortcomings, including turnover of team leaders, insufficient recruitment of qualified U.S. TA staff, and changes in SP direction from applied research and extension training to mass production.  Responsibilities and roles of USAID/Y and MAF were unclear, and participant training was unsatisfactory in achieving effective institution building and sustainability.  No job placement plan was developed for U.S.-trained technicians, and many returned participants did not occupy MAF positions.  A pervasive weakness was that the SP design ignored the need for water resource evaluation and failed to provide long-term TA in water management. The SP established horticulture stations at al-Jarouba and al- Irra which have identified improved fruit crop varieties which appear suitable to Yemeni conditions.  However, management of the stations is weak, and basic records on varietal evaluations are inadequate.  Station personnel are unable to determine simple varietal yield responses because of the lack of plot design and supervision.  Moreover, training of MAF personnel involved in the stations' nursery operations was inadequate, and the emphasis given to mass production of nursery plants was not compatible with the Project Paper and proved a major distraction from training and research.  Without continued USAID/Y support, it is unlikely that either station will be sustained. The SP failed to provide sufficient technical information and recommendations to foster the development of a model system for the fruit industry.  MAF research and extension linkages are not clearly defined, and critical gaps remain within MAF which hamper information development. The SP increased awareness and understanding of integrated pest management within the General Directorate for Plant Protection. However, there are very few qualified plant inspectors to implement the priority programs of plant quarantine and nursery plant certification. Since fruit production in Yemen remains highly profitable and supports a favorable return for research and extension as envisaged in the Project Paper, efforts should be made to eliminate the above SP flaws in the upcoming Farming Practices for Productivity Project.","Due to Gulf crisis, Mission not able to complete project evaluation|summary","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","4/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Fruit crops|Horticulture|Agricultural training|Agricultural extension","Yemen","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABC225.pdf","1,681 KB","006559 - Ricards International, Inc.","","008624 - USAID.

"Interim evaluation of a project to provide scholarships at the pre-Ph.D. level at Latin American universities and the Ph.D. level at U.S. universities.  The evaluation covers the period 1/89-11/90. The project is proceeding in a timely manner.  The four participating Latin American universities -- the Autonomous Technological Institute of Mexico, the Argentine Center for Macroeconomic Studies, the Pontifical Catholic University, and the University of Tucuman (Argentina) -- are providing rigorous academic training, and have been useful in screening candidates for U.S. graduate programs.  This is evident in that, while the students chosen for the pre-Ph.D. training were among the best in their respective universities, many find the scholarship program far more rigorous than their previous training, and may not be prepared for U.S. Ph.D. programs. Project success is largely attributable to the academic director, whose extensive network of professional contacts has facilitated the recruitment process and ensured academic excellence. However, monitoring of the academic aspects of the project needs to be better documented. This includes documentation on such activities as final approval of participants, students' academic progress, and site visits to participating institutions. Furthermore, more effort should be made to recruit from a broader number of countries, including Panama and Nicaragua.  Currently, almost all participants come from only four countries:  Costa Rica, Ecuador, Bolivia, and Peru.  While it is possible that these countries have a larger number of qualified candidates, they are also the target of the strongest recruitment efforts. A.I.D.'s participation in the program is not sufficiently publicized, with only two limited references in the implementing agency's annual report and one indirect reference in the materials provided to the participants.

"Evaluates three human resource development projects implemented by AMIDEAST in the West Bank and Gaza (WB/G). Evaluation covers the period 1978-1989. The projects have been instrumental in developing a viable system of higher education in WB/G, as well as a pool of technical and administrative talent in a wide range of areas.  Continued progress is jeopardized, however, by the continuing Israeli occupation:  for the second year in a row, universities and colleges remain closed by Israeli military order, although many classes continue to be held informally and on-the-job training continues. Overall, the projects have trained almost 1,000 individuals, including advanced degree training of 332 persons, U.S. short- term technical training of 259, and local training of 350.  An additional 2,200 undergraduate students have received aid through grants to five local institutions.  About 99% of those trained in the United States have returned to WB/G and are contributing to society there, and about 20% of those trained have been women. Faculty development has been especially successful; 45% of WB/G university faculty have received U.S. training.  However, due to swelling enrollments, the ratio of advanced degree holders to students has decreased, indicating a continuing need in this area. Professional development training has increased professional competencies in wastewater treatment, science teacher training, and emergency medicine and has contributed to a proliferation of new technologies such as microcomputer applications in WB/G institutions. With respect to institutional development, over 40 individuals from 12 institutions have received short-term and graduate training in administration and management, and further training is planned.  In addition, collaborative planning has been undertaken with selected institutions to address long-term personnel needs. Two other project components, business-university linkages and small business creation, are still in the early stages of implementation.  The projects have sponsored eight internships and encouraged other avenues for students to gain practical work experience.  About 35 participants have received short-term and degree training in business, accounting, and hotel management.  A small but growing number of businesses set up by university professors are employing university students, and Bethlehem University has received assistance in developing small business support activities and joint ventures between faculty and private business.  Activities under these components are expected to expand. It is recommended that AMIDEAST diversify its funding sources, provide more public administration and business training, and engage in a dialogue with those it has trained in order to rethink the future of post-secondary education and its relation to the broad development needs of WB/G.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","2/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Personnel development|Higher education|Universities and colleges|Faculty|Institution building|Teacher education","West Bank|Gaza Strip","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABC242.pdf","2,851 KB","003970 - Management Systems International, Inc.

"Evaluates the sustainability of projects implemented by USAID/Ecuador.  The evaluation focuses on three nongovernmental organization (NGO) projects involved with environmental education, drug awareness, and agricultural research, education, and extension; and three public sector projects, including forestry, child survival, and water and sanitation. The NGO projects did not adequately plan for sustainability, but these oversights have been addressed by USAID/E during the implementation phases.  The Mission has clarified sustainability expectations, encouraged the development of alternative income sources, and strengthened financial management, particularly in budgeting. However, USAID/E has been negligent in developing systems for tracking and monitoring sustainability.  Moreover, income generation strategies have yielded relatively little, and sometimes at a high cost.  It appears that, although the projects are seen as important by outside donors, demand for their services is lacking. Public sector planning for sustainability is weak.  Most projects lack commitment to sustainability strategies, contain no phase- out arrangements, and include only perfunctory analyses of recurrent costs. The issue of sustainability is usually not raised until the mid-term evaluation.  The slowest progress has been in projects with central coordination and management mechanisms, while some sustainable service delivery is evident at the local level.  All public sector projects suffer from unfavorable bureaucratic and economic environments. Ecuadorean bureaucracies are characterized by low morale, high turnover, low commitment, nonacceptance of decentralized management, and frequent leadership and policy changes.  Economic problems result in inability or unwillingness of beneficiaries to pay for services and government inability to pay employees and cover recurrent costs. Two overall lessons were learned.  (1) The failure of most development projects to attain sustainability is due to a lack of incentives.  While needy organizations (and countries) receive free resources and TA, sustainable ones do not.  (2) Criteria need to be established for public sector sustainability.  The following are recommended:  the value of outputs is proved through a monitoring and evaluation system and funding is provided reliably, on a performance basis, and to increasingly ambitious objectives.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","9/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Project sustainability|Private organizations|Public sector|Development project management|Development project design","Ecuador","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNABG998.pdf","1,448 KB","003970 - Management Systems International, Inc.

"Mid-term evaluation of a project to assist India's State Agricultural Universities (SAU's) in establishing Agroforestry Departments.  External evaluation covers the period 1985-12/90. The project, which runs until 1995, has made numerous achievements. Agroforestry research programs were established at 26 SAU's throughout India; 14 of the universities offer  academic programs leading to a B.Sc. in agroforestry, 5 offer M.Sc. degrees, and 5 offer Ph.D. programs.  Specialized training at U.S. universities has been provided to 72 (of a targeted 206) SAU faculty members, and these have assumed roles in the newly created Agroforestry Departments.  Trainees feel that the training was relevant and useful.  However, more trainees are required in some specialized areas, including some areas not yet covered by the project. Despite these achievements, several problems need to be addressed. (1) Several SAU's have moved the Agroforestry Department to relatively remote forested sites, thereby reducing access to main campus libraries, laboratories, and interdisciplinary activities.  (2) Some Departments have hired their own graduates as faculty members instead of recruiting educators with diverse experiences.  (3) Efforts are needed to identify new constituencies for the agroforestry programs, and to eliminate institutional barriers to the employment of graduates of the programs. (4) Program development should aim at assuring high-quality, specialized programs rather than size and diversity.  (5) Computer technology should be more available to faculty and staff.  (6) More funding is required to support faculty research.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","12/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Agroforestry|Institution building|Faculty|Teacher education|Universities and colleges","India","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABC252.pdf","1,166 KB","","","008557 - USAID.

"This report presents an interim evaluation of the Human Resources Development Assistance Project in Lesotho. The project has strengthened the human resources base in Lesotho by providing training to key management and operational personnel in strategically located institutions throughout the economic spectrum. Training activities have succeeded in upgrading targeted organizational staff capabilities and increasing knowledge and skills in critical public sector management areas. The relevance of the project is attested to by employers, entrepreneurs, participants, business service organizations and the government.  The greatest impact thus far, in terms of numbers of persons trained, has been in the project's outreach to small- and medium-sized business owners in rural areas countrywide. The project is well on its way to reaching its 80% target for private sector development training.  The project has already substantially exceeded its 50% goal for the participation of women in training activities.  Overall, the project has supported training for more than 350 Basotho.  In-country training accounts for more than 90% of project activities.  A concerted effort has been made to utilize local training resources and third country African training institutions to the maximum extent possible. Project shortcomings relate to the slow pace at which activities have been initiated and the absence of requests from several targeted institutions.  The underlying factors are multifaceted, but some of the issues that impinge negatively on the project's process are systemic grantee management and organizational constraints and lack of clarity about project objectives and the types of activities that may be supported.

"Final evaluation of a project to assist Honduras' Controller General of the Republic (CGR) in applying modern audit techniques and in helping other government entities implement internal control systems and related financial management practices. External evaluation covers the period 8/88-10/90. Despite delays in long-term TA, all project objectives were either met or surpassed.  CGR now has the capability to perform modern-style audits.  As of 9/90, it has conducted 5 such audits, 2 financial-related audits, and 3 financial statement audits. All were extremely well done. One of the most significant project achievements was the training of virtually all CGR auditors in a 4-month intensive course.  Response to the course was favorable among all involved, including students, CGR management, clients, and long-term TA personnel. Additional highlights of the project included the following:  (1) modernization of the CGR's administration and structure through new training and standards offices, a personnel classification manual, and a data processing department with computer applications for administrative areas; (2) drafting of legislation to improve CGR's legal basis for performing the new style of audits and charging audited entities for CGR services; and (3) introduction of generally accepted auditing standards. The project's success can be attributed to the high level of competence and dedication among project management and Price Waterhouse TA staffs.  Sustainability will depend on the passage of the draft legislation, CGR budget allocations, and the attitudes of future CGR management appointees. Three major lessons were learned.  (1) CGR upgrading required only modest amounts of TA combined with support from a receptive government. (2) Auditing productivity is likely to increase measurably as the result of project training.  (3) Initial training needs to be followed up with increased supervision and quality control to ensure that newly acquired knowledge is put into practice.","Spanish ed.: PD-ABC-555|Companion evaluation summary: PD-ABC-728","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-0085-I-00-9059-00","","10/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Auditing|Financial management|Public administration","Honduras","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABC260.pdf","1,162 KB","003970 - Management Systems International, Inc.

"Mid-term evaluation of a project to help Missions, host governments, PVO's, and other host country organizations to design, implement, and evaluate nutrition information, education, and communication (IEC) activities.  External evaluation covers the period 9/87-11/90. There are few outcomes to assess at this time, since the project is only now becoming fully operational.  Achievements have been as follows. (1) Specialists have completed several short-term field assignments, and their efforts have been well received. The project has also established a small, computerized reference library on communication and educational issues in nutrition. (2) Some 30 separate training events, mostly concerned with the social marketing of nutrition, have been conducted.  The training appears suitable and intellectually stimulating.  The problems that have arisen -- with recruiting the correct audience, balancing theory and practice, and trying to cover too much in a short time -- are endemic to most development training programs; they should be of continuing concern to S&T/N.  (3) Only one resident advisor (RA) has been assigned (Honduras); the ""up to six"" mentioned in the Project Paper was unrealistic.  Despite the lack of RA's, several country projects have been developed. Three are currently active (Mali, Burkina Faso, and Honduras), though it is still too early to draw firm conclusions.  (4) Adequate baseline data are being collected to assess project impact at the consumer/beneficiary level; a process evaluation will need to be carried out to assess the value of training and TA at the institutional level. The Academy for Educational Development (AED), the primary implementing agency, is performing well in meeting contract objectives, but administration is fragmented, even in the countries where nutrition education activities are focused.  This shortcoming is due in part to the buy-in process, which entails inordinate paperwork and confusion, a problem which may be alleviated through a new streamlined dual contracting mode, which involves one contract for core costs and another for buy-ins.  At the same time, AED could better consolidate its efforts and focus them on fewer activities.  AED should also make greater use of its subcontractors to complement its core staff. In the remaining year of the project, A&T/N should instruct AED to: (1) reassess country projects to ensure that they follow a coherent strategy for truly innovative, state-of-the-art activities; (2) develop state-of-the-art syntheses of lessons learned; (3) conduct, as part of existing country projects, one or more experimental pilot activities in a community-based mode; and (4) ensure sustainability by developing cadres capable of training others in nutrition communication interventions.","Companion evaluation summary: PD-ABC-515|Delivery order no. 26|Nutrition Communication Project document","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-1406-I-00-7152-00","","11/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Nutrition education|IEC|Communications aspects|Health education","Mali|Burkina Faso|Honduras","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABC081.pdf","1,760 KB","000981 - Pragma Corp.","","000189 - USAID.

"The Education Sector Support Project for Afghanistan, now in its fifth year of operation, has produced a substantial set of accomplishments in a short period of time.  The impressive array of products include:  (1) 3.5 million primary textbooks produced and distributed; (2) 7,200 teacher and staff salaries paid inside Afghanistan; (3) 166,000 students served inside Afghanistan; (4) Education Center for Afghanistan created and maintained; (5) 82,000 lower secondary textbooks produced and distributed; (6) nearly 2,000 adult literacy courses conducted; (7) 15,000 literacy kits and 320,000 mine awareness kits produced; (8) 91 scholars participating in 1 or 2 year studies in the United States; and (9) 2 vocational training centers created with 141 graduates produced. These accomplishments have been the cornerstone of educational services provided to Afghans in the resistance areas inside Afghanistan and an important element of services provided by PVO's and other groups in camps in Pakistan. As Afghans move from a period of refuge to reconstruction, the nature of educational services required must reflect this shift. The refugee period has been characterized by the need to mobilize rapidly the production of goods and services to meet basic needs. The reconstruction period will require great attention to cost- effective planning and provision of basic educational services, a rational redevelopment of the physical and administrative infrastructure, and the development of both educational materials and trained personnel required to ensure quality of student performance. Finally, the major focus of the project is and should continue to be on primary education.

"Evaluation of five projects to provide credit to rural populations in Liberia, Cameroon, Kenya, Lesotho, and Malawi. The evaluation covers the period through 1989. The projects had mixed results in achieving their primary objective of increasing agricultural production.  Short-term increases occurred in Kenya, Malawi, and Liberia, while little impact was seen in Lesotho and Cameroon.  Moreover, it is doubtful that long-term sustainable increases can be achieved solely as the result of credit, since such increases depend on other factors, such as farmers' knowledge and technical skills as well as sectoral and macroeconomic factors.  For example, Kenya's lack of marketing channels and of government trade and pricing policies may ultimately determine the sustainability of production increases. The projects' socioeconomic impact also varied.  The vast majority of borrowers lacked the productive capacity to repay the loans, and delinquency rates were high.  Hence, only a small number of progressive farmers had the knowledge and ability to apply loan funds to sound investments and improve their socioeconomic status.  The most successful activities were those that improved liquidity at key times by making credit available in cash rather than in-kind.  In fact, liquidity appeared to be a more important factor than access to credit, since farming households were often in need of cash during the planting time. Participating lending institutions benefitted significantly when projects helped introduce or reinforce effective, financially sound management practices.  Government or donor involvement in targeting credit beneficiaries had a deleterious effect on the financial viability and independence of credit unions and other financial institutions. Moreover, the institutions' absorptive capacity was sometimes overwhelmed when supplemental funds were provided to ensure additional directed credit for target groups. Only the Cameroon project had a strong, positive impact on rural financial market development.  Its success is attributable to a well-managed credit union which effectively bridged the gap between rural, informal financial markets and urban, formal sector financial markets.  This was achieved by building upon existing indigenous informal savings and credit associations. Three key lessons emerged.  (1) Success is dependent upon local participation and local control at all levels.  (2) Entities are most valuable to farmers when they offer both savings and credit services. (3) Agricultural credit institutions must have sound management and financial viability in order to make a sustainable impact on rural development.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","3/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Credit|Agricultural credit|Loan administration|Financial institutions|Rural areas","Malawi|Liberia|Cameroon|Lesotho|Kenya","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABC294.pdf","686 KB","000004 - USAID.

"Interim evaluation of a matching grant to strengthen the capacity of Plan International (PI) to implement income generation and microenterprise (IG/ME) activities.  External evaluation covers the period 1987-9/90. Although PI has adopted IG/ME as one of its three major program areas, the project has had only limited success, largely as the result of weak central coordination and a lack of field-level training.  PI headquarters has not provided clear guidance on what constitutes an IG/ME project or how to implement such activities.  As a result, field directors have often used project funds for activities which do not necessarily involve income generation or the establishment of small businesses.  Moreover, it is impossible to readily determine which initiatives are funded under the project, since IG/ME funds are commingled with all other IG funds.  Field staff also lack specialized training and technical manuals in IG/ME.  As a result, IG/ME projects are often designed in the same way as other activities. Project shortfalls are largely due to PI's lack of experience in areas other than charitable assistance.  The new focus on IG/ME entails new activities, including feasibility studies, loans, and TA in administration, production, and marketing.  Although some field offices are making individual progress in these areas, PI will have not only to provide stronger coordination but undergo a restructuring. Evaluation includes case studies of PI activities in San Pedro Sula, Honduras; Bolivar, Ecuador; Kandy, Sri Lanka; and Bali, Indonesia.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","OTR-0250-C-00-7237-00","","9/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Income generation|Microenterprises","Honduras|Ecuador|Sri Lanka|Indonesia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABC306.pdf","2,150 KB","002892 - Automation Research Systems, Ltd.","","000088 - USAID.

"Evaluates an information, education, and communication (IEC) project in Burkina Faso.  Using both quantitative and qualitative measures, the evaluation team gauged knowledge, attitudes, and behavioral changes at the conclusion of this three-year project. The Johns Hopkins University/Population Communication Services (JHU/PCS) and The Ministry of Health and Social Action (MOHSA) launched this $257,077 IEC program in 1987.  The project's overall goal was to expand the demand for family planning (FP) services. Evaluation data affirmed that the project's IEC activities had a sizable impact on increasing women's demand for FP services and significantly heightened public awareness of FP.  Several key indicators of project impact are detailed below. Behavioral Changes:  (1) The total number of FP clients at eight Ouagadougou clinics tripled between 1/88 and 12/89; new clients doubled. (2) Women's use of modern contraceptive methods at these clinics jumped from 8% to 14%, during this same period. Knowledge Changes:  92% of survey respondents correctly identified at least one provider of FP services, well above the 40% initially targeted by the project; 89% of these respondents recalled having seen the national FP logo; and 63% correctly associated the logo with FP. Attitudinal Changes:  The proportion of women desiring FP services at the eight clinics more than doubled (6.1% to 12.9%) between 1/88 and 12/89. Exposure to Project Interventions:  (1) 77% of adults surveyed had attended at least one discussion on FP.  (2) 75% recalled having seen the national FP logo at maternal child health centers, clinics, or dispensaries, 57% recalled seeing the FP logo on billboards and 48% on posters.  (3) 93% of those who had seen the project's theater forum performance correctly recalled its FP themes 18 months later. Cost Recovery:  85% of production costs for 6,588 meters of printed cloth with the FP logo were recovered through sales. In the course of this three-year project, the Division of Family Health expanded its capacity to develop quality IEC materials and conduct effective FP/IEC training of outreach workers.  The project produced FP promotional materials impressive in quality, variety, and number.  The MOHSA developed a rigorous FP communication curriculum and with it trained 140 outreach workers. Both the clinic and the impact surveys demonstrate that the Burkina Faso IEC Project went beyond raising popular awareness of FP, and contributed to changing contraceptive behavior.  This change is reflected in an increased demand for FP services, growth in the numbers of clinic clients, and increases in contraceptive use.  The growing acceptance of FP in Burkina Faso demonstrates the potential of a carefully conceived, well-implemented IEC strategy to generate demand for FP.

"Evaluates USAID/Sri Lanka's PVO Co-Financing projects for the period 1979-89.  Both projects, Co-Fi I and II, had roughly the same purpose -- to enhance opportunities for local communities to participate in their own development.  Co-Fi II, which began ln 1987, put more emphasis on strengthening NGO management capabilities as the means of reaching Sri Lanka's poor majority. Subprojects (SP's) supported by USAID included small-scale agricultural production, savings generation and credit access, family planning services, vocational training, and services for the mentally handicapped.  The SP's have had a positive effect on the lives of a significant number of people in need; over 300,000 people benefitted either directly or indirectly. Invariably, those assisted were poor and disadvantaged, as intended.  A large percentage of beneficiaries were women.  This achievement is all the more significant because the SP's operated during years that Sri Lanka's people and economy suffered greatly from a rapid succession of tragic episodes of violent civil strife. Under the Co-Fi II Project, on which the evaluation team was requested to focus, the Mission has already financed 27 NGO SP's and to a broader range of NGO's than in the earlier project. Diversification of the number and geographic spread of NGO's supported was a particular concern of USAID.  The project was also found to be making substantial progress in strengthening NGO management through a major grant to support one of Sri Lanka's most respected and long-established umbrella agencies, the Central Council of Social Services, which has over 80 member agencies. Sri Lankan NGO's are entering a new phase of sophistication and, given the present situation in the country, are in a position to make a large contribution to the country's development.  USAID, having invested considerable funds, time, and effort in NGO's, is uniquely positioned to continue taking a key role in the support of NGO's. USAID might have done many things differently and in some cases better over the past 10 years.  For example, USAID's monitoring of SP's could have been more systematically handled.  In general, USAID has given insufficient attention to formulating a clear overall strategy for its NGO program.  Inconsistently applied processes for the selection, design, monitoring, and evaluation of Co-Fi activities were also of concern. The strengths and weaknesses of a range of USAID s Co-Fi activities from the recent past suggest the need for important conceptual and managerial changes.  But it is obvious that USAID has already performed a valuable service to the community of Sri Lankan NGO's.  Its wide-ranging portfolio of NGO activities has improved the quality of NGO programs in Sri Lanka and increased understanding of the contribution such agencies can make.  The evaluation strongly recommends that USAID make a long-term commitment to continue supporting NGO activities in Sri Lanka. The study recommends changes in USAID's conceptualization of its PVO Co-Fi Project.  These include:  (1) deepening the relationship with the GSL by encouraging line government ministries and its own technical staff to review SP's in their sector of specialty; (2) revising the project's Logframe to incorporate current objectives and reflect monitoring requirements; (3) developing a means to clearly communicate to NGO's the types or themes of activities USAID will consider funding; (4) more thoroughly analyzing SP design assumptions and the likelihood that required inputs can be supplied in a timely manner and in the necessary quantity; (5) considering sustainability according to the following three dimensions:  (a) whether beneficiaries can continue activities begun through NGO interventions in the absence of continuing NGO involvement, (b) whether the NGO itself can continue implementing activities similar to those being supported by USAID following the discontinuation of USAID funding (or, in cases of demonstration projects, can pass the activity to either the public or private sector), and (c) whether the NGO itself is institutionally and financially able (with or without USAID funding) to continue its operations over the long-term; and (6) designing and sponsoring, perhaps in conjunction with other donor agencies, a special initiative to support NGO's operating in the North and East.

"Interim evaluation of a project to promote and facilitate U.S. investment in Egypt.  The evaluation covers the period 1981- 11/90. The project was unable to achieve its original goal of stimulating U.S. investment and therefore was drastically revised in 1989.  Although some increases in U.S. investment occurred, the overall U.S. corporate presence remains small -- particularly for a country as large as Egypt. The total number of U.S. investments amounts to about 50 ventures. The project's shortcomings in investment promotion are primarily due to the lack of improvement in Egypt's business environment. However, numerous internal weaknesses in the project were also present.  Until 1986, the project remained merely responsive to investor inquiries, rather than actively carrying out formal marketing campaigns.  Until 1989, the project was hindered by a series of institutional shortcomings, including a lack of clearly defined methods and performance targets; an absence of specific strategic annual work plans; inappropriately experienced or motivated personnel; staff rivalries and personality clashes; and a lack of promotional tools. Beginning in late-1988, serious steps were taken to change the project's focus, goals, and implementation strategy.  Promoting exports, rather than investments, became the major focus, new personnel were recruited, and the existing staff restructured. The project was also made responsible for conducting private sector feasibility studies. Since this time, project management and oversight have improved markedly.  While achievements have been limited, they are improved over the previous period.  The project has assisted about 25 companies in gaining export contracts.","Companion evaluation summary: PD-ABD-537","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","11/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Export promotion|Investment environment|Investment promotion|Business support services","Egypt","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABC362.pdf","524 KB","003338 - SRI International.

"PACR of an OPG (1985-90) to the Jamaica Family Planning Association (JFPA) to promote family planning (FP) through the private sector. The objectives of all components were achieved and the project can be seen as highly successful.  The information, education, and communication (IEC) component produced two developmental dramas, ""Naseberry Street,"" a radio program in soap opera style, and ""Pepper,"" a traveling theater production.  Both dramas produced clear and well-received messages about child spacing, pregnancy prevention, family size, the value of contraceptives, and responsible parenthood.  However, while ""Naseberry Street"" was enormously popular early on, as time progressed listenership declined and the program became primarily an entertainment vehicle with little or no FP information; the show was canceled in 4/89.  Additional activities under this component included the development of educational materials, including a video, brochures, posters, and booklets, and a mass media campaign utilizing print and electronic media and public relations activities. The component to promote employer-based provision of FP services has demonstrated a steady increase in the number of contraceptive acceptors at the workplace.  The program was especially valuable in reaching men. Male participants developed positive attitudes toward contraceptives and began adapting to condom use.  On the negative side, the program was constrained by inadequate educational and motivational sessions, dissatisfaction with the brands of condoms and pills distributed, reluctance of some companies to allow time for public education services, and low recruitment levels (15-20% of staff).  In addition, some workers were uncertain of the confidentiality of the FP services and some feared contraceptive side effects. The vasectomy promotion component progressed very slowly, with only 9 participants.  Due to cultural taboos, none of these men would admit having undergone the procedure.  At the same time, such feelings of shame have not been documented among men who have undergone the procedure at the Lenworth Jacobs Clinic.  This suggests that better coordination between the project's male FP counselor and the Lenworth Jacobs Clinic staff could have increased the success of this component. JFPA made slow progress in fundraising, but strategies are now in place for soliciting funds from companies and individuals.  In a related area, there is a welcome trend toward establishing steering committees to provide expert guidance to JFPA.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Family planning promotion programs|Family planning services|IEC|Family planning education|Contraceptive distribution|Private sector|Employer based delivery|Vasectomies","Jamaica","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABC388.pdf","884 KB","008563 - USAID.

"Mission close-out report on a program to provide food aid to offset the adverse effect of a reduction in Malawi's sugar export quota to the United States.  The report covers the period 3/87- 1990. The program met its primary objective of providing resources to replace foreign exchange lost because of the quota reduction. The program provided 18,294 MT of U.S. wheat, of which 17,878 were reported received.  The program also helped control the price of bread in the country. Wheat sales generated local currency totalling MK11 million.  To date, the Ministry of Finance has received and deposited MK6.87 million into a special account and disbursed MK4 million for two development activities -- divestiture of estates held by the Agricultural Development and Marketing Corporation and the upgrading of the Bunda Agricultural College Road.  The delinquency of outstanding wheat proceeds is due to the Government of Malawi's problems in tracking and utilizing local currency generations.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","7/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Food for Peace|Foreign exchange|Balance of payments|Local currency","Malawi","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABC393.pdf","143 KB","008573 - USAID.

The program provided about 27,600 MT of U.S. wheat to Zimbabwe in exchange for the provision of an equal amount of Zimbabwean white maize to Malawi.  A total of 16,852 MT of maize was milled in Limbe and Lilongwe and distributed to some 650,000 Mozambican refugees.  The remainder of the maize was distributed, mostly in whole grain form, to the Malawians in the mealy bug-affected Lake Shore Region and drought-affected areas in the Shire Valley.  In- country transportation, storage, and distribution losses totalled 258 MT, which were considered reasonable. Transport of the maize from Zimbabwe to Malawi experienced some difficulties initially due to poor communications and problems in working out routes, organizing transport, and coordinating communications.  Maize distribution to the refugees also encountered some problems due to inadequate storage and reporting procedures.  These problems were eventually alleviated.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","7/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Food for Peace|Emergency food distribution|Maize|Wheat","Malawi|Mozambique|Zimbabwe","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABC394.pdf","129 KB","008573 - USAID.

This trilateral program was the best implemented of any USAID/Malawi food agreements.  The maize was milled and distributed to the approximately 640,000 refugees within a period of three months with no appreciable loss.  In addition, 3,000 MT of maize which had been diverted from a previous Malawian relief program was returned for distribution to about 400,000 Malawian victims of drought in the lower Shire Valley and mealy bug infestation in the North. The program's success was due to good planning and communications; experience gained by all parties through previous food aid agreements; and a lack of major difficulties with maize transportation or storage.

"Mission close out report on a program to provide P.L. 480 Section 416 maize to 650,000 Mozambican refugees in Malawi and 750,000 Malawians affected by drought and crop losses due to mealy bug infestation.  The report covers the period 3/88-1990. Refugee feeding operations were concentrated in the southern, southwest, and southeast areas of the country bordering Mozambique. Relief for the Malawian population was concentrated in the drought-affected areas of the lower Shire Valley and the mealy bug infested areas of the Nkhata Bay, Rumphi, and Karonga. The program was basically effective, with most of the maize reaching its destination and helping to alleviate hunger and malnutrition.  The program provided a single shipment of 28,500 MT of both bulk and bagged yellow maize.  Bulk maize was bagged upon arrival at the port of Durban, South Africa.  The maize was transported to Malawi via train to either Harare or Lusaka and then trucked from these points to either Blantyre or Lilongwe. The Malawi Red Cross distributed the maize for the Mozambican refugees, while the Government of Malawi's Agricultural Development and Marketing Corporation was responsible for receiving, storing, and dispatching the maize for Malawians. Some 780 MT of maize was lost during the overland transport. This was attributed to poor loading of bags onto rail cars, improperly tied tarpaulins on railcars, and incorrect bagging in Durban.  These problems have resulted in changes in the procedure for maize shipments through Durban.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","7/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Maize|Food for Peace|Emergency food distribution|Refugees","Malawi|Mozambique","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABC396.pdf","227 KB","008573 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (1980-1990) to support community-based family planning and health service posts, or ""posyandu,"" in Indonesia. For the first time, FP services were available at the village level, moving beyond the previous pattern of clinic-based services only.  The number of posyandu increased from 90,000 in 1985 to more than 200,000 in 1990, although the quality of services is still variable.  The project also funded 58 studies, far in excess of the 20 originally planned. Research activities helped shape the posyandu as a delivery model, provided opportunities for improving research skills, and, in some cases, influenced policy decisions.  For example, the Government of Indonesia recognized its role in providing technical support for the posyandu while allowing villagers to take an active role in service development (e.g., through contributing space, selecting staff, and promoting the services). On the negative side, the project lacked strong supervisory activities, due to a shortage of personnel and funding.  In addition, the posyandu were underutilized by mothers and children, especially pregnant women.  This was caused by the distance of the posyandu from homes, inconvenient schedules, boredom with the weighing routines, and a lack of comprehension of the child growth card.  The problem of referring high-risk pregnancies was also a major obstacle.  Traditional birth attendants made referrals as a last resort, often when the patient was in a critical condition.  Possible explanations for this problem include lack of knowledge about the referral system, inability to identify a high-risk pregnancy, or a sense of failure in referring a patient. The project also needs more imaginative social marketing approaches. Although the posyandu is regarded as a community activity, there is confusion as to whether management and responsibility lie in the communities or in the Ministry of Home Affairs.  In order to achieve self-sufficiency among the posyandu, a clear plan for transferring responsibility to the village must be developed. Several lessons were learned.  (1) The project's integrated task force structure was useful in directly linking researchers with policymakers and program managers and in establishing priorities to guide researchers.  (2) Data flow and feedback to the village leaders on the results of posyandu service needed to be strengthened.  (3) The training strategy, under which staff from higher administrative levels were responsible for training their subordinates, was only partially successful.  Future training should concentrate more on specific identified problems.  (4) The most serious problem remains the shortage of professionals in the sub-health centers, which link to the posyandu.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","11/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Family planning services|Health facilities|Community based delivery|Community health care|Child welfare","Indonesia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABC401.pdf","123 KB","008558 - USAID.

Overall, weak management, the lack of entrepreneurial skills, and lack of professional staff in the DRS have been the principal constraints to achievement of the project purpose.

"Final evaluation of a program (1988-90) to establish a PVO network, the Programa de Coordinacion en Superviviencia Infantil (PROCOSI), to enhance the capacity of member PVO's to implement child survival activities in Bolivia.  The evaluation covers the period 1987-10/90. PROCOSI's relationships with its members (most are U.S. PVO's) were characterized by tension and misunderstanding during the first one and a half years, mainly due to problems in clarifying the roles and responsibilities of its organizational components. Noticeable improvements have been made as the result of a new manager, greater involvement by the rotating executive committee, and more focused administrative and financial assistance from Save the Children Federation, the member PVO legally responsible for the grant.  However, significant improvements are still needed, including reorganization of line units and the implementation of basic financial and administrative procedures. More also needs to be done to improve coordination with Bolivian entities, especially as PROCOSI moves to gain national PVO status.  As a local PVO, PROCOSI will be able to shed its image as a U.S. dependency and open membership to national PVO's. PROCOSI's efforts to improve its members' operations have led to changes, but it is not certain whether these will have a positive effect or be sustained.  Subgrants are an obvious benefit to the membership and have been strongly supported.  However, the system for reviewing subgrant applications is weak.  Review criteria are not well established and equity has been the overriding criterion for proposal endorsement. In addition, no outside technical expertise has been used in the review process. PROCOSI TA has been generally well received and is highly regarded by the field staffs of its members and others, including the Ministry of Health.  However, PROCOSI lacks a coordinated system for providing and evaluating TA. Progress to date suggests that a new grant to PROCOSI should be awarded, since the network is wholly dependent on USAID/B support. Several lessons were learned.  (1) In the area of organizational development, it is essential to delineate clearly a network's internal roles and function at the design stage.  If the organization is to be viable, the donor must be supportive, patient, and persistent, but not intrusive or directive.  (2) Concrete indicators of sustainability should be defined at the design stage.  (3) TA can be an important service, motivating organizations to seek and continue membership.  (4) When creating a network, it is essential to include benefits (e.g., subgrants) (5) Effective collaboration requires a long effort to create mutual trust and confidence.  Such an effort must precede any expansion of the network.  (6) To be successful, a network should be separate and autonomous, offer members a clear inducement to join, make an experienced member responsible for organizational systems, promote sustainability by diversifying funding and adopting a common approach to TA, have a limited and well-defined programmatic focus and a staff with strong technical and organizational skills, and have a shared vision of development and the support of its members.","Cover date: Jan 1991|WASH task no. 179|Project no. erroneously listed on the title page as 836-1249","Special Evaluation","Documents","DPE-5973-Z-00-8081-00","","12/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Private voluntary organizations|Child survival activities|Grants","Bolivia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABC405.pdf","7,446 KB","000333 - Camp Dresser and McKee, Inc.

"The Chapare Regional Development Project (CRDP) in Bolivia, begun in 1983, has as its general goal the reduction of Chapare's coca leaf production, processing, and marketing.  The Chapare project was the ""carrot"" by which coca producers were to be induced to leave off their highly profitable operations and switch to alternative crops through the use of incentives such as cash rewards for eradication, loans for financing conversion to alternative crops, research and extension to promote alternative crops, and training and infrastructure development. The ""stick"" was to come from a special Government of Bolivia (GOB) strike force, UMOPAR, operating with the support of the U.S. Embassy but independently of the project, or ""carrot"". The enterprise began badly.  The international demand for coca grew very quickly fast in the 1980's, followed by rises in coca prices.  This led to a boom in the number of Chapare farmers wishing to cash in on the soaring demand for coca.  Market forces began to reign freely, with total disregard for Bolivian laws or norms.  In fact, the cocaine traffickers effectively ran the Chapare as a free-trade, free-fire zone for several years.  This situation was partially a result of a national political crisis, complicated by an economic crisis in the 1980's.  In 1985, after only twelve months of project activity, the CRDP was all but immobilized due to ""lack of GOB progress in eradication"".  At the same time, natural disasters were assailing the area; CRDP funding was insufficient to compete with the coca industry; and project gains were quickly overshadowed by the violence of the UMOPAR interdiction forces. The project's agricultural research and extension branch, IBTA, managed to do some work, but the rest of the project nearly stood still. In November 1987, the project was amended to include the Associated High Valleys (AHV's) in its strategy, effectively shifting project emphasis from the Chapare to its southern districts, or distrito sur. Although officially approved, Amendment 7 was opposed by key functionaries in La Paz of both the Bolivian and the U.S. Governments. Together they sabotaged the project, removing PDAR, the Bolivian agency responsible for funds from the newly-arrived AHV Advisory Team.  The GOB, meanwhile, managed to reclaim control over the Chapare, so that research and extension work could proceed in most of that area. Late in 1988 the project was further amended, restoring some of its original focus on the Chapare.  PDAR was restaffed, and work proceeded in both geographic areas. The evaluation team found that the Chapare project does have some serious problems in its design.  For example, although the project's success will depend on the economic viability of alternative crops adopted by farmers, there have been no marketing studies of the markets for the proposed crop substitutes.  There has never been a project agricultural economist working on marketing issues.  Similarly, there is no sound economic basis for the credit allocations, in part because of the lack of a credit and marketing database and in part because credit is granted on coca eradication criteria, not economic criteria. Additionally, there is a contradiction between the coca interdiction effort and agricultural development project goals: new roads, for example, which are essential to the marketing of alternative crops in the Chapare have not been constructed for fear of aiding narcotics traffickers; lime, essential for soil preparation, is banned because it can be used in coca processing. Although in bureaucratic terms the project is more than five years old, due to start-up problems CRDP actually began implementation in earnest one year ago (September 1990).  In the short time the project has been implemented, it has achieved some notable outputs. IBTA/Chapare, for example, has conducted some excellent research and followed up with extension to farmers to the extent possible under extremely difficult working conditions. Coca producers in the Chapare have responded to the project's ""carrot and stick"" approach. of September 1990 is already above the yearly target (5,000 hectares) and may, in fact, be double that figure.  This development has been paralleled by an upswing in farmer interest in IBTA/Chapare's alternative crops technology. With coca leaf at $U.S. 80 per hundredweight, and given the correctness of prices quoted in the IBTA/Chapare study on alternative production systems, it appears that pineapple, coconuts, banana, coffee, black pepper, and palm heart all compete successfully with coca, while a small dairy system is about equal.  Some of those systems are suitable in one micro-region and not in another, but the productivity potential of coca is likewise variable. Project activities in the AHV's at this stage are concentrated on upgrading roads and irrigation works.  Some applied research/extension on irrigated crops is being carried out by NGO's with support from PDAR and USAID.  Baseline studies of the various natural resources in the High Valleys are required before a program for sustainable agriculture and forestry production can be designed.  Except for a soil survey now underway, there is no evidence of significant work in that direction. The evaluation team recommends that key project evaluation criteria should be economic.  The current focus on coca eradication should be reduced.  In the long term, farmers will shift away from coca production only if it is in their economic interest to do so, and the project will be sustainable only if farmers profit from project activities.

"Evaluates a matching grant to Lutheran World Relief (LWR) to support the efforts of NGO's and other indigenous organizations to plan and design development projects.  Midterm evaluation covers the period 9/88-10/90. Major grant objectives are being attained, and the project is a wise use of A.I.D. resources.  LWR is funding 124 projects in the 13 countries included in the matching grant.  Only 37 of these projects are officially under the grant (vs. a target of 80), according to LWR, but this represents LWR's choice to avoid fulfilling A.I.D.'s reporting requirements for each project. LWR assistance was found satisfactory in almost all the cases reviewed.  Except in Niger, LWR's assistance is indirect, i.e., takes place through partner agencies, usually NGO's.  These include intermediary partners which offer a national perspective and through which LWR can extend assistance to grassroots partners.  LWR has chosen partners which are capable and willing -- particularly impressive is its use of major intermediary agencies in India, which enable LWR to maintain relationships with many projects without having its own staff in the country. In Niger, LWR has a unique, intense presence, deriving from a commitment in the early 1970's to address the special needs of that country and from the fact that the Government of Niger insisted that NGO's work through government agencies. The grant objective of influencing host country governments is unrealistic and should be modified to state that LWR will support host country development activities that are in accord with LWR development goals.","Evaluation period: Aug-Nov 1990","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","11/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Development projects|Development cooperation|Host country counterparts|Indigenous private voluntary organizations|Private voluntary organizations","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABC464.pdf","1,521 KB","","","000088 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of a 1983-1989 project to develop Oman's fishery sector by strengthening the technical capabilities of the Directorate General of Fisheries (DGF). The project's impact on DGF institution building and the development of Oman's fishery sector has been minimal. Major problems were the project's unrealistically ambitious design and lack of an institutional management component, and erroneous assumptions about the commitment of the Government of Oman and DGF management. Other problems included: the use of host country contracting, which only exacerbated administrative problems at the DGF; significant professional differences between the two project contractors; and less than rigorous oversight by the Omani-American Joint Commission (OAJC). Weak management and lack of political will at the DGF prevented the adoption of appropriate policies and regulatory decrees and created numerous administrative and logistical obstacles to institution-building efforts. In addition, the DGF was and is structurally incapable of supporting effective fishery development. Lines of authority and responsibility for program planning and execution are poorly defined or non-existent, and mechanisms for promoting coordination are ineffective. As a case in point, the tenuous relationship between the DGF's central office and the Director of Fisheries for the Southern Region impeded the integration of the national and southern regional programs. Training activities, though critical to project design, were poorly planned and largely ineffective. A considerable amount of the training was unstructured and based on informal contact with counterparts; in only a few cases (e.g., statistics) was this kind of training successful. Off-shore, long-term, non-degree training proved expensive and, given the qualifications of participants, generally inappropriate. Extension efforts were impeded by lack of a realistic strategy and of motivated DGF extensionists knowledgeable about traditional fisheries. Marketing efforts were misconceived, and the substantial investment by the government in infrastructure and by the project in TA resulted in little tangible benefit. The statistics program focused on generating stock assessment rather than production data, while project research was constrained by lack of personnel, support, and of the problem- solving approach needed for long-term impact. The following lessons were learned. (1) Given Oman's weak administrative base, project assistance is staff-intensive and thus inconsistent with OAJC's mandate. If such assistance is continued, OAJC staff should be supplemented with contractors. (2) Sector development programs such as this should identify a clear set of objectives and concentrate on a limited number of constraints. (3) In the absence of strong management skills in the implementing agency, A.I.D. direct contracting is the most effective means of providing TA. (4) Further investment in Oman's fisheries sector should be reconsidered unless there is a significant increase in DGF's commitment.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","PDC-0085-I-00-6095-00","","12/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Fishery development|Marine fisheries|Fishing industry|Institution building|Government departments|Host country cooperation|Absorptive capacity|Management aspects","Oman","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABC576.pdf","3,993 KB","006434 - Devres, Inc.","","008587 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (1987-1990) to establish an institutional mechanism to provide credit, TA, and training to small entrepreneurs in the Dominican Republic. The project established a revolving credit fund administered by the Fondo de Inversiones para el Desarrollo Economico (FIDE) to provide loans to small borrowers through private financial intermediaries (PFI's).  However, the PFI's were not interested in extending loans directly to small entrepreneurs because the transaction costs of handling such loans were too high. Furthermore, the loan approval process took several months whereas the project design had envisioned a 24-hour turn-around time once applications had been submitted by the Central Bank. In periods of high inflation, these delays meant that by the time loans were disbursed, they frequently no longer covered programmed purchases and borrowers were forced to look for other sources of funds. The project also failed to meet its objectives in providing TA and training.  Grant funds were used to support technical assistance centers (TAC's) which were in turn assisted by a central assistance facility (CAF) located in FIDE.  It was intended that the TAC's would be self-sustaining by the fourth project year, but this was not achieved because the CAF did not provide adequate TA to TAC personnel and charges for TA were not sufficient to cover salaries and operating costs.  In addition, entrepreneurs frequently did not need TA and went directly to the PFI's for their loans. Despite its problems, the project resulted in significant benefits for entrepreneurs who had received credit.  The real income of loan recipients increased over 100%, and many of the beneficiaries used the increased income to satisfy their basic human needs. Two major lessons were learned.  (1) Graduating individual entrepreneurs to the formal banking system may not be a viable goal. Instead, credit organizations specifically designed to deal with these clients could be graduated to formal sources of credit.  (2) The most successful credit programs for small entrepreneurs in the Dominican Republic are those operated by NGO's.  Turn-around time for these loans is two weeks at the maximum.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","12/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Credit|Loan administration|Business support services|Entrepreneurs","Dominican Republic","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABC663.pdf","508 KB","008537 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (1984-1989) to make the U.S. Army power barge Impedance available to meet the emergency power requirements of the Dominican Republic. The barge did not operate at full capacity for much of the time it was in the Dominican Republic.  This was due to a series of problems, including damage to its hull, a fire in one of its smokestacks, and chronic fuel and supply shortages.  Moreover, the presence of the barge may have allowed the Government of the Dominican Republic (GODR) to postpone dealing with the problem of insufficient electrical generating capacity and the country's long-term electrical power needs.  Although it was intended that power plants would be repaired and constructed during the project period, the country continues to fall short of meeting power demands. Other problems occurred with the Dominican personnel assigned to the barge.  Staff levels were insufficient for proper maintenance and operations, and union members working on the barge held strong anti-American sentiments which posed a security concern to the U.S. Army staff. Despite these shortcomings, the barge served an important symbolic purpose by reflecting the U.S. commitment to helping the GODR overcome its energy crisis.  For example, the U.S. Ambassador requested that the barge not be removed until after the May 1990 elections because the opposition parties were expected to make electrical energy into a major election issue. In addition, the project facilitated the transfer of technical training to the Dominican staff assigned to the barge.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","12/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Electric power generation|Ships|Electric power generation equipment|Emergency relief","Dominican Republic","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABC664.pdf","251 KB","","","008537 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (1983-1990) to strengthen the capacity of the Dominican Republic's Direcion General de Caminos Vecinales (DGCV) to rehabilitate and maintain rural roads and construct pack animal trails. The project was successful in several areas.  It expanded the DGCV's institutional capacity by enlarging its existing supervision, sociology, and cost estimating units, establishing a regional center for rural roads maintenance, and creating a new unit to assist PVO's in implementing P.L.480 activities involving the construction of trails for pack animals.  In coordination with private contractors and PVO's, the DGCV rehabilitated 786 km of the planned 962 km of rural roads and constructed 150 km of pack animal trails.  It employed 10,000 subsistence-level farmers on a short-term basis to rehabilitate roads in their areas, thus developing skills and fostering a greater sense of community responsibility for rural roads.  Improvements in the roads system in turn increased the efficiency of agricultural transports from farms to markets. The project also provided TA for mapping rural roads, researching the use of local materials to surface and stabilize roads, and training personnel to operate, maintain, and inventory the heavy equipment procured with project funds. telecommunications system for the DGCV, and constructed 12 ""mini-mercado"" shelters to protect agricultural products at points where several trails converge on a rural road. In the long-term, there is cause for concern about the Government of the Dominican Republic's commitment to rural roads rehabilitation and maintenance.  This is evident in that the various road-building agencies still lack uniform standards for constructing, maintaining, and rehabilitating roads. project required a number of commitments from the GODR which at times were not forthcoming.  For example, when the President began a national campaign to erect monuments and large public works, cement and equipment were diverted away from rural roads maintenance.  There were also problems of commitment within SEOPC (DGCV's parent agency), which had six Administrators within the 7 years of the project -- one of whom fired en masse 712 village- level maintenance workers.  All were eventually reinstated, but the incident shows the difficulties encountered in dealing with institutions that view such jobs as patronage positions.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","12/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Road maintenance|Road construction|Farm to market roads","Dominican Republic","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABC666.pdf","493 KB","","","008537 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (1983-19??) to establish a local currency trust fund for the Dominican Republic's Oficina Nacional de Planificacion (ONAPLAN) to cover the agency's administrative and operating costs and increase its capacity to implement foreign-funded development activities. The project enabled ONAPLAN to procure computer equipment and software and to send a staff member to English-language training. It also allowed A.I.D. the opportunity to provide input to and review ONAPLAN's contracts for A.I.D.'s own programs and activities.  However, the project does not seem to have in any way strengthened ONAPLAN's ability to design, execute, supervise, and evaluate projects financed by international agencies and foreign governments -- which was its main purpose. The project underscores the dilemma faced by A.I.D. as it attempts to support institutional development.  Trust funds such as this one, while intended to strengthen the host country institution, actually place an added management burden on the Mission and constrain the institution's independence.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","12/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Institution building|Development project design|Government departments|Indigenization|Development project implementation|Development project evaluation","Dominican Republic","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABC667.pdf","103 KB","","","008537 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (2/77-2/88) to supply the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' power barge ""Andrew J. Weber"" to the Dominican Republic for emergency power generation.  During the 11 years the barge remained in the Dominican Republic, it produced nearly a billion kilowatt hours of power and helped to maintain voltage levels in the eastern part of the country.  The project also facilitated the transfer of technical training to the Dominican staff assigned to the barge.  However, the project proved only a stopgap measure and the country suffers more shortages of electrical power than when the barge first arrived. Several lessons were learned.  (1) Despite its temporary value, the loan of the barge may have allowed the Dominican Electric Corporation (CDE) and the government to ignore seeking long-term solutions to the country's electrical energy problems.  (2) CDE frequently lacked qualified supervisors to staff all of the barge's operating shifts, thus lowering the crew's efficiency and posing dangers to the entire operation.  (3) CDE had difficulty obtaining the financing needed for counterpart contributions, due, in part, to its reliance on government institutions that were not economically sound.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","12/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Electric power generation|Electric power generation equipment|Electrification|Ships|Energy supply","Dominican Republic","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABC675.pdf","205 KB","008537 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of a project to upgrade livestock production in Mali.  The evaluation covers the period 1982-1990, 1 year prior to the 9/91 PACD. The project has made many significant achievements which should ultimately benefit large numbers of livestock farmers. Implementation has been significantly better than that of previous livestock projects in Mali due to the introduction of the Management Development and Support Team (MDST), which has provided effective procurement, financial management, and administrative services.  Unfortunately, in an effort to facilitate speed and efficiency, the transfer of management skills and the integration of improved systems were deferred, thus limiting the institutional impact of MDST activities. Implementation of a directive in the 1988 grant amendment to address this problem has been constrained by bureaucratic problems. With project support, the National Research Institute (INRZFH) has conducted a wide variety of useful research for the improvement of animal production.  Varietal research for improved forage was well planned and implemented, but most of the technical packages developed are still in the pre-extension stage.  Useful research and extension activities have also been conducted in such areas as supplemental feeding trials for milk cows, livestock management, fodder production and storage, composting manure for use as fertilizer, and poultry raising. The cattle fattening component, though terminated early because of a poorly designed and managed loan program, has nonetheless had a major impact.  Overall, the time allowed for development and extension of research has been insufficient. Through applied research several protocols have been developed to control important animal diseases.  Serological surveys have shown the extent of two zoonotic diseases, one of which has important implications for the dairy industry.  Research has also produced an easy method which could reduce the tsetse fly population by almost 99%.  Animal vaccines are being supplied to the field in increasing amounts, a cold chain is in place and functioning well, and the potential for local production of vaccines is being explored.  The project has also fostered increased cooperation between the Central Veterinary laboratory (CVL) and the National Livestock Directorate (DNE), though not between DNE and INRZFH. Although women play an important role in agriculture, efforts to promote their participation in the livestock sector have been neglected. Other areas which deserve more emphasis include the project's management information system, genetic livestock improvement, small ruminant and poultry research and extension, diffusion of project information through radio and other media, disease diagnosis, and privatization of project activities.","Delivery order no. 8","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","624-0510-I-00-9039-00","","9/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural production|Agricultural research|Applied research|Agricultural extension|Livestock|Animal husbandry|Livestock diseases|Research management|Animal health|Animal nutrition","Mali","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABC685.pdf","7,150 KB","000480 - Experience, Inc.","","008575 - USAID.

"Evaluates a cooperative agreement with the Christian Reform World Relief Committee (CRWRC) to improve the quality of rural life in Bangladesh and Belize. All provisions of the cooperative agreement are on track.  The detailed goals developed by the CRWRC for the country activities supported by A.I.D. have been converted to country programs, and the degree of goal attainment, recorded in annual and semi-annual reports, has been, in the judgment of this team, satisfactory. Field evaluations have been frequent and for the most part comprehensive. Benefits delivered to farmer groups and refugee communities have been identifiable and are recognized by the intended beneficiaries.  The degree of institutional sustainability is still in some doubt in both northern and southern projects in Belize, and alternative approaches for their continued usefulness and viability are under review.  Prospects for institutional adaptation in Belize will constitute the major concern for the future of the program, which is scheduled for phase-out by 1993. Both Bangladesh sites show evidence of group institutionalization and mounting activity.  The establishment of a national board is underway to assume responsibility after CRWRC's support has been withdrawn. Relations between A.I.D. and CRWRC/Grand Rapids are formal but distant.  A.I.D.'s policy of rotating personnel has precluded the development of strong personal ties; A.I.D. has responded perfunctorily, but for the most part adequately, to CRWRC initiatives, but without much consideration for CRWRC's distinct qualities as a PVO, especially in matters involving financial flexibility.  TA has been rendered effectively to field operations through joint A.I.D./CRWRC training activities. A.I.D.'s field missions have not had close relations with CRWRC staff members, especially in Belize, but the general posture has been supportive and sympathetic, particularly in Bangladesh. Distribution of this report within A.I.D./PVC should be accompanied by a frank discussion of future relations between the two parties, held at A.I.D.'s expense in Washington and including three or four CRWRC representatives. Communications between CRWRC/Grand Rapids and the field are excellent.  There is some reason to believe that evaluations and field visits have been, if anything, too frequent to be cost-effective.  The policies regarding abstention from the direct supplying of capital to beneficiaries are sound, given the goals of the program, and given CRWRC's ingenuity in generating support from other sources that could provide longer-term continuity to the local institutions involved.  But the goal of sustainability needs to be reviewed carefully to insure that it does not result in unwise and premature withdrawal from projects that could continue to benefit from continued collaboration.  The austerity of management style dominating project operations is appropriate and cost-effective, and should not be altered.  The interjection of diaconal goals is in harmony with the basic philosophy of the organization and is a powerful support to field operations and the morale of both staff and beneficiary participants.  The use of quantitative indicators as measures of progress should be continued, but the formal reporting of goal attainment should be simplified, and the field should devote less attention to the injection of numbers and more to the consequences (including indirect effects) of CRWRC outputs.  The indicators themselves should be carefully reviewed to insure that they do not displace other measures of success that would be more meaningful to field workers.

"The Liberian Primary Education Program (PEP) is an instructional system adopted by the Ministry of Education as the national program for primary education in Liberia.  PEP, formerly called the Improved Efficiency of Learning (IEL) Project, was designed to overcome a shortage of adequately trained primary school teachers, textbooks, and other educational materials. The program includes 510 instructional modules (or lessons). Each module is comprised of reading booklets, practice booklets, and review booklet tests to determine how well students have mastered the material of each module, block and semester. A program to train teachers in the methodology of the system comprises an additional component. In 1989, 60 in-service PEP pilot radio programs were produced to follow-up on the initial training by reinforcing elements of the programmed instruction modules for selected groups of PEP teachers (second-grade reading and fifth-grade science teachers) and principals. The broadcasts began on 6/5/89 and ran during that semester and the following one. In 1989, the Academy for Educational Development (AED) contracted with Applied Communication Technology (ACT) to conduct an evaluation of the pilot radio programs.  The purpose of the evaluation was to determine the programs' impact on the administrative performance of school principals and the teaching performance of second and fifth grade PEP teachers.  To measure changes in job performance, self-reported information was collected from the target groups using a pre-test/post-test design.  Because it was not known prior to the collection of the data whether it would be possible to arrive at quasi-equivalent intervention and control groups, as many of the 360 PEP schools as possible were included in the sample. The pilot radio programs were evaluated by testing teachers and principals both before and after the programs were broadcast, to see if there was any detectable difference in what they did as PEP teachers after the broadcasts.  It was found that the radio programs alone (after removing the impact of in-service supervision visits) did indeed help to improve about one-third of the skills that were measured.  The specific instances in which this occurred were helping principals to handle teacher shortages and to prepare for and monitor faculty meetings; helping second-grade teachers to read poetry and identify vowel sounds and word sounds; and helping fifth-grade teachers to prepare for class by taking module booklets home and to administer tests. The combination of supervision and radio improved teachers' and principals' performance on almost every item except those on which the initial score was so high to begin with that there was little room for improvement.  Skills which improved as the result of a combination of radio and supervisory visits were, for principals, keeping attendance records, taking responsibility for module and test booklets, and holding faculty meetings more frequently; for second grade teachers, going to the principal or Ministry for more booklets, taking modules home to prepare for class, and providing remedial help to students; for fifth-grade teachers, providing remedial help to students, using PEP methodology to promote and monitor student progress, and forming peer groups.  In several of these instances, groups which lagged behind on the pre-test were brought up to the level of the other groups on the post-test.  In the case of helping second-grade teachers pronounce vowel sounds, results indicate that supervisory visits made an impact, but that the radio programs did not. The results of the evaluation indicate that radio and supervision play an important role in improving the performance of those teachers and principals whose skills are not up to the standard of the group as a whole.  Several cases were observed in which the score of a group which was notably lower on the pre-test rose to the level of the other groups on the post-test:  principals keeping attendance and taking responsibility for booklets, and second-grade teachers turning to principals and the Ministry for additional booklets. Almost all of the teachers and principals (99% or more) reported that they liked the radio programs, that the programs were helpful, and that there should be more programs next semester. On the basis of these positive (though possibly inflated) assessments, and the improvements in performance that have been recorded in this report, the PEP Program should look favorably on the continuance of radio broadcasting to PEP schools.

"Evaluates the Family Planning Private Sector (FPPS) project in Kenya to strengthen family planning (FP) services within existing clinic-based health programs of private firms and institutions. Interim evaluation covers the period 12/84-5/90. The project's approach of working through private organizations is a sound one; currently, about 10% to 13% of all modern FP use in Kenya flows through such arrangements.  An estimated 238,000 couple years of protection (CYP) have been provided under FPPS subprojects (SP's) to date, at an overall average cost per CYP of about $25; however, costs tended to decline dramatically after SP startup, and in 1990 average CYP cost was $12.52. Most numerical goals have been met or surpassed:  SP's have been completed or are currently in operation in 54 institutions, with 60 planned by the 9/91 PACD; approximately 88,300 Kenyans are using FPPS services, surpassing the goal of 85,000; an estimated 828 mid-level workers have been trained in FP service delivery, far more than the target of 525; and 6 of 7 planned operations research projects have been completed.  While a data and evaluation system was established, its outputs were not published or disseminated as proposed; also, 2 planned workshops on data management and evaluation have not been conducted. The clinical training program was in limbo due to a dispute with the training provider. SP sustainability is encouraging but faces certain limitations. FPPS policy is to discontinue assistance to SP's after 2 years, but smaller and nonprofit organizations (e.g., nursing homes and religious organizations) often cannot sustain the full range of FP activities after assistance is withdrawn, and must continue to depend on FPPS for contraceptives, IEC, and training.  All 44 SP's which have passed the 2 year point continue to provide FP services.  Apparently, even some unaffiliated organizations have been motivated by project educational activities to start their own FP programs. Some of the most important recommendations are:  (1) conduct a survey of unmet FP needs in Kenya before designing possible follow-on project(s); also, review the role of child survival in future FPPS activities; (2) consider a more flexible policy for SP support based on the character of the organization; e.g., extend assistance to religious organizations beyond the 2 year cutoff date; (3) resume training, possibly under direct FPPS guidance; (4) immediately begin work on publishing technical reports to share the experience and results of this project with FP planners throughout Africa and the world; (5) use the eight determinants of project success identified in this evaluation as a guide when planning or evaluating SP's; (6) to the full extent possible, incorporate voluntary surgical contraception (VSC) as a standard part of FPPS activities; and (7) place less emphasis on operations research. Some of the lessons learned are:  (1) SP's which provided integrated care were more successful than those with solely FP interventions; (2) local IEC subcommittees increased SP success; (3) contraceptives should be promoted and distributed by non- threatening persons such as subunit heads, rather than senior managers; and (4) better contraceptive supply and logistics systems are needed.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","5/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Family planning services|Private sector|Private voluntary organizations|Family planning promotion programs|Contraceptive agents and devices|Family planning surveys|Contraceptive distribution","Kenya","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABC830.pdf","2,374 KB","008565 - USAID.

"A.I.D. Mission experience with health policy financing reform during the 1980's is documented in this report.  Individual sections examine (1) the Missions' role in the health financing policy dialogue; (2) the main issues covered in the dialogue; (3) the factors promoting and hindering policy change on the part of the Ministry of Health (MOH); (4) the factors that support and (especially) that constrain Missions' ability to promote health financing schemes; and (5) Mission reflections on health financing policy reform. A major finding is that policy reform in this area is as much a political as it is a technical process and requires politically and culturally sensitive assistance.  Moreover, there is no global formula for success; health financing schemes that work in one country may or may not work in another.  For example, the MOH in El Salvador has increased budget allocations for preventive, rural services, but in Bolivia the MOH has been reluctant to allocate more funding to primary health care.  The review also demonstrates that policy reform takes time, in part because it involves substantial institutional change. Sometimes years are required before a MOH will adopt or even consider adopting one component of a new health financing scheme.  A final lesson is that to have a lasting impact health financing policy dialogue must go beyond discussions with the MOH to include dialogue or consultations with other government ministries.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","DPE-5927-C-00-5068-00","","8/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Policy reform|Policy dialogue|Government departments|Health finance|Political aspects|Institutional aspects|Constraints|Host country cooperation","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNABI240.pdf","619 KB","005553 - John Snow, Inc.

"External mid-term evaluation of a project to conduct research to develop more cost-effective approaches to education in the Third World. The evaluation covers the period 9/85-3/90. The project is an important, creative approach to an international educational problem of immense proportions.  So far, it has produced a total of 6 research reports, 4 development discussion papers, and 75 casual papers.  In addition, 6 computer-based simulation models have been developed, dozens of short-term training and demonstration programs have been carried out, and significant contributions have been made in improving education information systems in at least two countries. Activities have been concentrated in the countries of Burundi, Egypt, Indonesia, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Thailand. On the negative side, there are a number of unfulfilled expectations and persistent difficulties in project operation. The main obstacles stem from the project's ambitious scope, complexity, and limited resources of time and money.  Initial expectations regarding the time needed to collaboratively design and carry out research and development tasks were overly optimistic.  Despite creative management, target dates could not always be met. The project also suffers from frustrations common to educational development projects.  Problems associated with educational development and reform resist complete understanding and educational research does not easily or often result in clear, non-controversial directions for educational policy.  Attempting to generalize about the acquired insights across countries compounds the difficulty.","Companion Evaluation Summary: PD-WAY-100|Project title: Basic research and implementation for developing|education systems (BRIDGES)","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","3/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Educational research|Educational policy|Research collaboration|Information services","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABC960.pdf","1,519 KB","003970 - Management Systems International, Inc.

"Evaluates a project in the Sahel region to reduce the transmission of onchocerciasis and associated disease symptoms. Interim evaluation covers the project through 10/90. In spite of serious obstacles, the Onchocerciasis Control Program (OCP) has achieved remarkable success in the past 16 years. Onchocerciasis has ceased to be a public health problem in all of the original program areas:  over 30 million people are now protected from the disease.  Since the program began, about 7 million children have been born virtually free of risk of onchocercal blindness; about 1.25 million people who were seriously affected are today completely free of the parasite, and about 100,000 who would otherwise have been blind still have their sight. The program's success can be attributed to its:  (1) clearly defined objectives; (2) realistic time frame; (3) right choice of technology; (4) contracting out of highly specialized aerial spraying operations; (5) strong emphasis on operational research; (6) high degree of autonomy from the World Health Organization (WHO) and its bureaucratic procedures; (7) clear delegation of authority allowing operational flexibility; (8) medium-term planning and sustained donor commitment; (9) unrestricted flow of information among all concerned parties; and (10) strong management and high quality staff. Protection of the OCP's achievements will require continued donor commitment to the program strategy, which is based on vector control for a minimum of 14 years from the start of larviciding in any given area. Critical areas are the sources of re-invasion in the Western Extension and selected pockets in the core and Southern Extension areas. The OCP has virtually eliminated transmission in the core area of the program, overcoming the major obstacles of resistance and re- invasion. It has made significant advances in vector control and larviciding, ecological monitoring to minimize environmental impact, entomological research on the vector species, epidemiological monitoring and assessment, and disease treatment. The program and its sponsors, donors, and participating countries must now turn their full attention to devolution.  OCP can contribute through the creation of a new devolution unit, as part of its overall effort to strengthen the institutional capabilities of participating countries.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","10/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Disease prevention and control|Onchocerciasis|Disease transmission|Disease vectors|Disease research","Sahel","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABD011.pdf","2,727 KB","","","000032 - USAID.

"PACR of a project to expand expertise in fishery management in countries belonging to the Southern African Development Coordination Conference (SADCC) through research and training. The project was implemented by USAID/Malawi. The project achieved its research and training objectives.  Two technical studies, on the Regional Fisheries Training Center and regional documentation, were completed and are expected to attract donor funding.  Eight seminars/workshops were supported by project funds, and fishery experts from the SADCC region were brought together for 14 meetings to identify common problems, solutions, and strategies.  In addition, a network of communication has been established among SADCC fisheries experts. Three major lessons were learned.  (1) Regional programs can be seriously constrained by the need to reach consensus and compromise among members.  (2) A regional program can be used to identify common problems affecting members, but projects to resolve those problems must be planned bilaterally, as solutions to the problems may not be common to all members.  (3) SADCC's Department of Fisheries had weak management, since it had relied heavily on expatriates to manage its programs.  When their contracts ended, they left behind an organization unable to carry out its mandate.  An implementing agency that relies heavily on expatriates is a potentially weak organization, and A.I.D. should take this into account when funding future programs.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Fishery management|Inland fisheries|Fishing methods","Southern Africa|Malawi","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABD024.pdf","71 KB","000029 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (1980-1988) to assist the Government of Malawi in expanding the country's rural piped water system. The project significantly exceeded its goal by completing 22 new systems serving 314,000 people, compared with the target of 241,000 people.  Villagers provided local infrastructure (water tap and health committees), labor (all the trenching for pipes), and maintenance of aprons, slabs, and plumbing hardware. Hygiene education and sanitation promotion (HESP) activities reached an estimated 270,000 people with messages promoting improved latrines, washing slabs, and behavioral practices.  The Ministry of Health significantly improved its HESP capabilities. One noteworthy achievement was the development of rural demand for HESP services as well as water supply services.  Both the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Works have expressed strong interest in expanding their collaboration in HESP to fully complement the well-established water program. A list of 15 high priority projects (14 new schemes serving 245,000 people and one augmentation project involving the replacement of deteriorating asbestos-cement pipes with PVC pipes) have been proposed under USAID/M's new Promoting Health Interventions for Child Survival project.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Water supply|Water sanitation|Hygiene|Water pipelines","Malawi","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABD025.pdf","209 KB","008573 - USAID.

"Some 10 years of experience in water supply and sanitation (WS&S) projects in 60 countries under USAID's Water and Sanitation for Health (WASH) Project are distilled into ""lessons learned"" in this report.  The lessons -- 19 general lessons and 52 more specific ones -- are addressed in some instances to funding agencies, and in others directly to project planners and implementors.  Thematically, four topics are covered.  The first set of lessons deals with establishing a technical assistance program and is particular relevant to donors and central governments. Lessons in this category stress the importance of institution building, interdisciplinary work, a participatory approach, coordination and collaboration, and an active information service.  The second set of lessons deals with linkages, particularly the importance of linking WS&S projects to hygiene education, which in turn leads to behavioral changes on the part of the beneficiary community and enhances health benefits. Next, lessons for achieving system sustainability focus on the areas of institutional development, training, appropriate engineering design, and early planning for operations, maintenance, and financing.  The final set of lessons addresses the issue of shared responsibility, outlining the respective roles of national governments, donors, NGO's, the community, and private enterprises.","Later ed.: PN-ABQ-522|Later Spanish ed.: PN-ABQ-787","Special Evaluation","Documents","DPE-5973-Z-00-8081-00","","1/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Water supply structures|Water sanitation|Rural areas|Technical assistance|Technology transfer|Development project design|Development project implementation|Financing|Community participation|Project sustainability|Development cooperation|Institution building","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABD028.pdf","2,703 KB","000333 - Camp Dresser and McKee, Inc.

"PACR of a project (1979-89) to support development subprojects (SP's) in rural Indonesia and upgrade the capabilities of local and central government agencies to plan, implement, and support decentralized development programs. A total of 2,379 SP's, mostly in agriculture and public works, were completed in the six target provinces -- Bengkulu, West Java, South Kalimantan, East Java, West Nusa Tenggara (NTB), and East Nusa Tenggara (NTT) -- directly benefitting about 348,840 poor, rural families. Particularly outstanding were the rural credit programs, which were the catalyst for the Financial Institution Development Project.  Other successes included food crop production, livestock development, and drinking water SP's. On the negative side, estate crop SP's for tree production, though widespread, produced little benefit due to the time lag between investment and first harvest, and small-scale industry and fisheries SP's had only limited success.  Except for some of the new technology transfer activities, the experimental SP's were generally not successful enough to be replicated. The project had significant positive impacts on the intended beneficiaries, an estimated 65% of whom were correctly targeted project-wide.  Household incomes were increased an average of 120% in real terms; NTB led the way with a net gain of Rp. 143,000. By sector, small industry created the highest net gain at Rp. 223,000.  Training was a key element in this success, with more than 34,000 villagers receiving some kind of training through the project. In terms of sustainability, 73% of SP's were judged sustainable, with the highest rate (86%) in NTT and the lowest (68%) in South Kalimantan. By activity, irrigation SP's had the highest level of sustainability (90%) and fisheries the lowest (43%).  It is estimated that 56% of SP's are likely to continue, provided the current minimum net gain of Rp. 30,000 remains an acceptable level of return to the beneficiaries. Project TA and in-service training, as well as U.S. training of 41 officials, increased government capacities to manage development, especially at the provincial and sub-provincial levels.  A comprehensive, decentralized development planning system was developed and implemented by the lead agency, the Directorate General for Rural Development (BANGDA), and the regional development planning bodies (BAPPEDA's); the new system was even adopted by non-project provinces. Also of significance is the Government of Indonesia's commitment to continuing project approaches and systems. The project has clearly demonstrated the feasibility and viability of a decentralized, ""bottom-up"" approach to development involving provincial, district, subdistrict, and village levels of administration, as well as inputs from PVO's, NGO's, women's organizations, and the public at large. were identified regarding:  (1) administrative coordination and information exchange between lead and local agencies; (2) market development constraints, especially those affecting small-scale industry SP's; and (3) funding delivery mechanisms of the Government of Indonesia and the project.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","9/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Development projects|Development administration|Rural areas|Poor|Decentralization|Municipal level|Government departments|Institution building|Development planning","Indonesia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABD290.pdf","1,008 KB","008558 - USAID.

"Evaluates Pakistan's A.I.D.-assisted Malaria Control Program (MCP). The review was conducted in two stages.  First, an insecticide resistance expert visited Pakistan 1/14-19/90. Later, a team of malaria specialists from the Vector Biology and Control Project, WHO and the Government of Pakistan worked with officials and staff at facilities of the MCP and General Health Services (GHS) 3/4-26/90. The team found four very different provincial programs, with adequate coordination and training support but less than adequate operational research capabilities.  Integration of malaria control into the GHS, so far as it has gone, has strengthened the MCP by granting it a degree of stability and permanence, but has weakened its once formidable discipline, direction, and operational resources.  MCP activities in Punjab are relatively strong and successful, but technical, administrative and security problems impair performance to a greater degree in Northwest Frontier Province (NWFP), Sindh, and Baluchistan. The malaria surveillance effort remains substantial.  Annual reported cases increased from 59,386 in 1988 to 104,447 in 1989, due partly to a continuing shift from active case detection (ACD) to passive case detection (PCD), which produces fewer blood slides from those who have had a recent fever and more from those with a current fever.  In 1989, 22.3% of all slides came from PCD, an increase of 5% since 1988.  But the rising number of malaria cases is also due to increased incidence because 9.03% of all 1989 PCD slides were positive, compared to 5.76% in 1988. This is troubling, particularly because falciparum malaria increased from 37% to 53% of all cases.  The total number of malaria cases and number of falciparum cases increased dramatically in Sindh, markedly in Punjab and NWFP, and decreased slightly in Baluchistan. Falciparum malaria cases occurred mostly in the Sindh and adjacent areas in Punjab and Baluchistan.  Because of increasing evidence of chloroquine-resistant falciparum malaria at the regional and national levels, and because chloroquine is given to each suspected case of malaria in the country, drug resistance should be considered a possible cause of this dramatic rise in falciparum malaria. The other resistance problem is the potential impact of the widespread resistance of Anopheles stephensi to malathion, which was documented in January.  The important field research necessary to determine the role of this species in malaria transmission in Pakistan remains incomplete.  This evaluation team's considerable effort to relate disease surveillance findings to sites with known A. stephensi resistance produced no epidemiologic justification for any substantial replacement of malathion with fenitrothion. In 1989, just one house in 10 was sprayed with malathion to control malaria.  Only houses in localities where malaria cases were most abundant were sprayed.  They only received one application of malathion, whose residual effect may not exceed 30 days. This rather marginal control measure may have limited impact on disease transmission.  The MCP strategy is to reduce dependence on insecticides while implementing alternative control measures.  The reduction has occurred, but the alternative measures, which were to be identified through an active operational research program, have not been defined.  We found the malaria control operational research capacity very limited and without much promise.  For now, spraying residual insecticides remains the most cost-effective means of malaria control in Pakistan. Microscopy services have remained strong during this time of integration and decentralization.  However, the planned tenfold expansion of microscopy services to provide services in each Basic Health Unit (BHU) seems excessive. The team's major recommendations are as follows.  (1) Because of increased malaria incidence, spraying criteria should revert to those used in 1988.  (2) Epidemiologic evidence does not justify the immediate use of fenitrothion in the Punjab, but supports its careful introduction in NWFP.  (3) Research into critical operational issues, such as the vectorial capacity of A. stephensi, the extent and importance of vector resistance to malathion and of chloroquine-resistant falciparum malaria, and the usefulness of alternative control measures, must be conducted on a large scale if the MCP is ever to become sustainable without donor assistance.

"Evaluates project component to strengthen Honduras' court system. Midterm evaluation covers the period 9/87-12/90. Progress has been slow, due in part to inadequate definition of the roles of USAID/H and the contractor (Georgetown University). Nonetheless, outputs can be achieved by the end of the project if the Supreme Court and the government have the political will to implement the Judicial Career law, if high priority is given to planned activities, and if USAID/H allows more direct interaction between the Court and GU, and does not allow needs in other components to slow down activities in this one. The experimental program to assign new law graduates as Justices of the Peace has been at least partially successful.  Three groups of 27 law school graduates have been assigned as Justices of the Peace and most have been retained as such or promoted, with their salaries assumed by the Judiciary.  Some questions have been raised about the selection process, however, and the Court has not yet decided whether to extend the program. The legal portion of the in-service training program for Justices of the Peace has been provided by the Latin American Institute of the United Nations for Crime Prevention and Treatment of Criminals (ILANUD) and has been well-received.  ILANUD has also prepared a manual for use by Justices of the Peace and recently prepared a training needs assessment.  Administrative training carried out by a GU subcontractor has not been as well received. Also, since re-organization has been lagging, it has not been possible to establish administrative training needs.  However, a promising 9/90 report on the organizational structure of the Judiciary is under review. One of the project's most significant achievements has been the establishment of a Public Defenders program in Tegucigalpa and San Pedro Sula, with plans to extend the program to the interior of the country. The proposed Public Defender System study has not been done, however, and no legislation has been passed authorizing the program. Two of eight planned observation visits to the United States were carried, and one of two planned graduate level fellowships is underway. However, no technical training for permanent staff of the support offices has taken place.  Support to training programs should increase substantially. Plans to carry out two mass media campaigns on the law and the functioning of the court system and to hire a permanent public information officer have remained dormant. Most significantly of all, after this evaluation was conducted, the Supreme Court accepted the organizational development plan for implementation of the Judicial Career Law and the President of the Court declared the law in effect March 1, 1991.  The Court has since worked diligently to develop the personnel regulations and procedures need to fully implement the law. The attempt to shift activities originally funded under the regional Administration of Justice Project to this bilateral project led to some turf battles and some financial and management problems.","Related documents: PD-ABD-501, PD-ABD-502, PD-ABD-503|Companion Evaluation Summaries: PD-ABJ-168 and PD-ABJ-169|In: Evaluation report : strengthening democratic institutions|project, no. 1","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","12/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Judiciary|Courts|Administration of law|Institution building|Technical training|Civil service|Pilot projects|Beneficiary count","Honduras","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABD500.pdf","3,378 KB","000436 - Development Associates, Inc.","","008555 - USAID.

"Evaluates project component to strengthen the Honduran National Congress.  Midterm evaluation covers the period 9/87-12/90. Implementation has been minimal, primarily due to contracting delays. Legislation creating the Center for Informatics and Legislative Studies (CIEL) was not passed until year later than planned.  Further, the law was much weaker than the proposed law, which had been structured to isolate CIEL from politics.  Nonetheless, passage of the CIEL legislation is the most important achievement of this component, and USAID should accept CIEL in its present form even though it is not a separate institution as planned. In 8/90, Georgetown University (the prime contractor) submitted a plan for equipping and staffing CIEL.  The plan calls for a mainframe computer for CIEL; the evaluation team takes issue with this proposal and recommends instead a computer plan prepared by A.I.D./W's Information Resources Management (IRM) in 11/90. There appears to be within the Hnoduran Congress too much faith in computer hardware and too little appreciation of what it takes to build and use data systems. In 1989, GU submitted proposals for improving Congressional organization and functioning, including the functioning of committees, but no action had been taken by the Congress yet and none appears to be in the offing, as priority has been given almost exclusively to CIEL. Training activities to date have been minimal, but they should become very important during the rest of the project. Although Conditions Precedent and Covenants in the MOU have not been complied with, they have not been changed and the team found no official correspondence with the Congress regarding these.  It is recommended that:  (1) USAID/H take up the condition regarding an administrative career service with the Congress; (2) the condition regarding a career service for the National Registry of Persons (which actually is concerned with a separate project component) be changed to a covenant, and targeted for implementation in 1991. The project's potential impact on women has not been addressed. The evaluation recommends that USAID fund a study to determine the openness of the political system to women who wish to run for Congress.","Related documents: PD-ABD-500, PD-ABD-502, PD-ABD-503|Companion Evaluation Summaries: PD-ABJ-168 and PD-ABJ-170|In: Evaluation report : strengthening democratic institutions|project, no. 2","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","12/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Institution building|Political development|Democracy|Legislature|Laws and legislation","Honduras","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABD501.pdf","1,065 KB","000436 - Development Associates, Inc.","","008555 - USAID.

"Part of an ongoing USAID effort to assess the sustainability of project activities and benefits after U.S. funding ceases, this study reviews U.S. assistance in health, population, and nutrition programs between 1942 and 1988 in six countries -- Honduras, Guatemala, Senegal, Tanzania, Zaire, and Thailand.  The analysis reveals striking differences in the levels of project sustainability within and between countries, between project types, and between regions.  In Thailand, many activities were sustained at high levels, while in Central America, significant levels of continuation also existed.  In Africa, however, many projects were sustained at much lower levels of activity than during the project life.  Health services projects, such as health worker training, clinic construction, and water projects were the most highly sustained in all countries.  Malaria projects received an average sustainability score, while nutrition and family planning projects ranked poorly.  Contextual factors most closely related to sustainability were the political, economic, and institutional environments, along with national commitment to project goals.  Six project characteristics closely related to sustainability were identified:  (1) perceived effectiveness; (2) integration into existing institutional hierarchies, (3) established financing, (4) training components, (5) a mutually respectful project negotiation process, and (6) community participation.","Summary: PN-ABG-032","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","11/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Project sustainability|Health care|Nutrition|Family planning services","Honduras|Guatemala|Senegal|Tanzania|Congo DR|Thailand","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNABK410.pdf","2,175 KB","003433 - USAID.

"Evaluates special programs, funded under Project Development and Support Project 5190177 in El Salvador, to find nonmilitary means to combat the insurgency in that country.  The special programs were initiated in Chalantenango as a pilot effort in 1988, an outgrowth of the popular Municipalidades en Accion (MEA) program, which funds small physical infrastructure.  The Chalantenango experiment differed from MEA in that it utilized national as well as local agencies, funded larger infrastructure, and was implemented in an area of strong insurgency, which moreover, historically had been relatively neglected by the central government.  Upon implementation of three successive phases of the special approach in Chalantenango, the same approach was initiated in 1989 in 18 municipalities in the Department of Morazan in the eastern region. The programs have been a success.  Economic and social output are extraordinarily high for relatively low cost, and the programs have proven superbly effective in promoting local democratic processes and social stabilization.  Beneficiary attitudes have changed significantly. There is a growing level of community participation, appreciation for the infrastructure built and its employment and income effects, an emerging sense of local control over community affairs, and a newfound ability to hold local and national officials accountable to the people. Military attitudes toward the special programs approach also have changed radically, from polite tolerance to enthusiastic support. Similarly, the Comision Nacional de Restauracion de Areas (CONARA) and some of the collaborating agencies are modifying their traditional attitude by delegating authority to lower levels. The programs demonstrate that a technically efficient program which is apolitical and responds to people's perceived needs can induce impressive attitudinal changes in a relatively short time. However, a key need now is to commission a poll to provide more statistically reliable answers to a number of questions regarding beneficiary reactions and attitudes.  Also recommended are inclusion of income-generating projects in the private sector (through support of FEDECCREDITO credit programs) and intensified efforts to improve municipal finances through fees and cost recovery for public sector investments.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-1008-I-00-9068-00","","8/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Civil war|Counterinsurgency|Pacification|Municipal level|Public works|Attitude change|Community participation|Decentralization","El Salvador","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABD844.pdf","2,439 KB","001036 - Research Triangle Institute (RTI)","","008540 - USAID.

"The Resources for Child Health Project (REACH) provided substantive TA for both the Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) and health care financing (HCF).  Because of the subsequent development of REACH II before the completion of the REACH Project, this evaluation will refer to the REACH Project as REACH I. Nine cognizant technical officers (CTO's) were responsible for REACH I during its 5 years and, making a virtue of necessity, the project was permitted to evolve responsively and progressively. REACH I was not subjected to bureaucratic inaction as could have been the case with the discontinuity of CTO's. HCF is an increasingly fundamental component of sustained health services worldwide.  HCF has evolved from a minor component of REACH I into a new, separate project, Health Financing and Sustainability.  EPI was not inhibited by the growth of HCF activities during this phase of REACH I.  Indeed, demand for EPI services likewise evolved into a new project, REACH II, that includes an additional component designed to reduce the impact of acute respiratory infection upon child survival (CS). REACH I was a successful project.  Most of the people the evaluation team interviewed thought it had been flexible and responsive to the needs of regional bureaus, and especially to mission and host country requests.  Consultations were generally of high quality and performed in a timely fashion.  While REACH I was a centrally funded project, USAID missions were allowed to ""buy-in"" using their funds.  This mechanism successfully stimulated project growth and evolution.  Because of buy-ins, the budgeted ceiling of the allocated funding level was achieved much sooner than anticipated, resulting in REACH I having to ration requests for service. The goal and objectives of REACH I coincided closely with the CS endeavors of the World Health Organization (WHO), the United Nations Children's Fund, PVO's, and others.  Close collaboration, coordination, and communication should have been important aspects of project implementation.  Unfortunately, the discontinuity of CTO's, the paucity of staff resources, and the inadequacy of CTO travel funds constrained the role of S&T/H in collaborating with other agencies and managing and coordinating REACH's CS endeavors.  The effectiveness of S&T/H as a major player in international CS activities should not be compromised; the resources needed for adequate A.I.D. managerial oversight should be committed.  The contractor, John Snow, Inc. (JSI), appears to have performed well despite these problems. As only one of the many organizations involved in EPI, REACH I had to identify a role that would complement and supplement the activities of other EPI donor organizations.  REACH I emphasized cost-effective delivery, strengthening information systems, and improved monitoring of immunization coverage.  It also focused on working with NGO's and PVO's to enhance their capacity to use sound public health practices in their delivery of EPI services. REACH I significantly enhanced the training of health workers and increased the production and dissemination of information materials.  Especially noteworthy was the production of the popular field guides, EPI Essentials:  Guidelines for Identifying and Implementing HCF Activities and Costing of Health Services Delivery Guidelines. In collaboration with WHO, REACH I installed and customized a computerized EPI information system in nine countries.  REACH I also developed a standardized methodology for EPI costing with WHO, and tested a nonreusable syringe and needle to prevent the transmission of hepatitis B and AIDS. REACH I stimulated the development of new ideas and helped initiate policy dialogue, including a renewed commitment to eliminate neonatal tetanus, a leading killer of infants.  Urban areas with their growing population of underserved children are a special challenge to effective EPI administration.  REACH I called attention to and, through REACH II, continues to address this problem. Initially, USAID had anticipated that HCF would constitute only a minor part of REACH I system support for primary health care technology. Instead, USAID missions submitted so many requests for HCF technical assistance that initially REACH I could barely meet the demand.  As a result, significant quantities of resources were dedicated to health financing activities in such areas as accounting, social insurance schemes, user fees, health maintenance organizations, hospitals, primary health care, and systemwide reform. At the inception of REACH I there was a shortage of HCF experts, particularly within PVO's.  Thus, it took JSI and its HCF subcontractors some months to develop PVOs' HCF capacity. Currently, however, JSI contributes positively to the worldwide HCF effort. REACH I represents an ongoing development program, not a distinct and isolated project.  The evolution of priorities during the course of REACH I changed the project's components in a positive and desirable way. Efficient, effective management is required to ensure the flexibility, responsiveness, and change characteristic of successful programming.  Indeed, without the continuity of a CTO who possesses the requisite support, technical, and managerial skills, the risk of project failure increases dramatically. REACH I owed its success largely to the aptitude and professionalism of JSI and its subcontractors.  USAID must strengthen the capacity of its CTO's to exercise the kind of leadership required to ensure success.

"PACR of a project (1981-87) to promote economic development in the lands surrounding Clark Air Force Base, including the Sacobia resettlement area, in the Philippines by constructing access roads and testing pilot soil and water conservation techniques. The project completed approximately 7 km of asphalt-paved road (built to national highway standards), and approximately 5 km of all-weather gravel road, complete with slope protection and drainage facilities.  A portion of the reverted baselands at Clark, including the Sacobia resettlement area, is now accessible, as planned. Less positively, however, the soil/water conservation component was terminated 12/31/86, with only 10% accomplishment.  The component went through various redesigns.  During its one year of operation with funding, it concentrated on field testing of soil and eater conservation techniques on approximately 20 has, planting fruit and forest tree species along contour lines with mulching and stone retaining walls halfway around each tree. Overall, the component was considered expensive ($50,000/ha) in comparison with other A.I.D. projects of this kind ($15,000/ha). The following lessons were learned.  (1) The primary constraint to the implementation of the access road component was the awarding of contracts to contractors without adequate resources. Other issues to be addressed are the need to review project plans before they are bid on and implemented, overhaul payment procedures to ensure up-to-date payment of progress billings, and improve project monitoring.  (2) Activities under the soil and water conservation component were inappropriate; when a developing country is suffering from an economic crisis, the construction of new research facilities outside the context of existing agricultural research structure, which requires equipment, personnel and maintenance, should be seriously questioned.  It may have been more cost-effective and administratively sound to strengthen existing research stations. In general, research should be conducted at operating research stations, while field demonstrations should be conducted by researchers on field sites and/or by farmers on farmers' fields.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","12/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Access roads|Road construction|Pilot projects|Soil conservation|Military bases|Water conservation|Economic infrastructure","Philippines","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABJ806.pdf","1,131 KB","008592 - USAID.

"Presents final evaluations of the Food Crop Research project (8/82-6/90), Watershed Development (5/84-12/90) project, and P.L. 480 Title II, Section 206 program in Cape Verde. All three activities were well-designed, competently managed, and effectively assisted by project technical advisors; inputs were provided at planned levels and in some cases, notably training, exceeded them. The Food Crop Research project focused its assistance on INIA, the national agricultural research institute.  INIA has made great strides toward becoming a mature agency capable of carrying out a broad research mandate covering the entire complex of rural development -- improvement of all aspects of dryland and irrigated crop agriculture, social/economic considerations, and natural resource conservation technology.  INIA has also trained the project extension agents who organize the P.L. 480-funded laborers who carry out conservation works in watersheds.  The project's overseas training has produced a staff of researchers of good potential. Some trainees are still to return; additional training is also required for a complete research staff. INIA's research planning, strategy, and administration are rated as good. Research products have begun to flow, but there are still shortcomings in analysis, dissemination, and utilization of the output. Field experiments and demonstrations are few as yet, and INIA is only now at the point where it can begin to develop research applications with direct utility to conservation and agriculture.  Nor is there an effective extension service in place to transmit such research to users. The Watershed Development project's physical achievements are impressive.  Some 12,500 structures (vs. a target of 8,060) have been installed, including contour furrow and rock walls, checkdams, embankment groins, catchment tanks, reservoirs, water conductors, etc. More than 4 million trees have been planted, providing 286,000 person days of employment. In addition, some 600 members of communities in watersheds received instruction in tree planting, conservation, irrigation, and public health.  The project is significantly behind schedule, however, in the production of the basic document to govern future annual workplans in each watershed and sub-basin, called Phased Watershed Development Plans.  The plans require specialized personnel, extensive data, and administrative planning, which have not yet been brought together.  From a technical standpoint, moreover, the structures in place are not adequately maintained, nor are they well-designed for durability; these deficiencies pose the danger of expensive breakdowns and loss of capital infrastructure.  Finally, the  scientifically based integrated watershed planning vital to a sound and enduring conservation program has not yet been adopted. The P.L. 480 Title II program, administered directly and well by USAID/CV and its Cape Verdean counterpart, has achieved its nominal purpose.  Nearly 18,000 MT of corn, rice, vegetable oil, and beans with a total CIF (cost, insurance, and freight) value of $32 million have been imported to meet to a carefully calculated food requirement. Approximately $25 million in local currency has been made available to watershed operations, primarily for labor costs, generating employment and income; the labor has been reasonably well-utilized.  At any given time in the non-agricultural season, 4,000-8,000 thousand men, women, and children, representing half of the working population of the designated watersheds, are employed by the Watershed Development project and paid with P.L. 480 counterpart. While program administration is good at handling and accounting for imports, problems remain regarding:  (1) the amount of sales proceeds made available to the watershed project; (2) delays in paying laborers; and (3) the sale of some imported corn to animal-feed processors.  Finally, and most importantly, the socially and technically difficult problem of labor mobilization for the conservation work has not been fully resolved.  Different organizing methods have been tried, but none is fully operational. The evaluation includes design recommendations for a FY 1991-95 follow-on project to consolidate all three efforts.","Delivery order no. 2","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","3/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Rural development|Agricultural research|Food crops|Natural resource conservation|Watersheds|Food for Peace Title II","Cape Verde","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABM790.pdf","7,113 KB","","","004517 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (6/86-6/90) to improve financial management in public and private organizations in Mauritania. The PACR was written by the head of the TA team. The four key elements of the project were completed. (1) General accounting systems were fully implemented at Mauritania's Commission for Food Security (CSA), local staff were trained to maintain those systems, and annual accounts were prepared for 1986, 1987, and 1988.  (2) Section 121(d) certification assistance was provided biannually to the USAID Mission. (3) Accounting systems were set up and monitored in food security projects financed out of USAID/CSA counterpart funds. Two Food for Peace Budget Analysts were trained.  One was obliged to leave the country as a result of political events but is employed in Mali under the regional project, and the other is providing valuable support in tracking counterpart funds, reviewing project financial reports, training project accountants, and taking over Controller responsibilities. Additionally, four counterpart fund project accountants were trained, three of whom are still working in the country.  (4) The private sector development component provided direct assistance to four manufacturing companies, held a workshop on cost accounting for eleven local accountants received workshop training, and provided follow-up assistance to two of them. The author of the PACR describes an extreme lack of cooperation on the part of CSA, and recommends that assistance be focused on the private sector.  Donors should be more demanding in their dealings with the government.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","6/1/1990 12:00:00 AM","","Financial management|Financial records systems|Accounting|Technical training","Mauritania","","","000032 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of a project (9/85-12/90) to facilitate the communication of population and family planning (FP) research findings to policymakers in developing countries (IMPACT project). The project was a success.  Through research, evaluation, and trial-and-error, IMPACT has developed an approach to developing, ""packaging"", and distributing materials to targeted audiences that can be used by other future projects and other donors.  Major outputs include 97 separate booklets on 40 topics, including region- or country-specific versions in English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Arabic, Turkish and, Somali, as well as 37 separate posters, 6 population data sheets, an international satellite teleconference, 3 videos, and a variety of audiocassettes, slide sets, fact sheets, press releases, and conference folders and agendas.  In all, some 200,000 booklets and 50,000 other educational materials have been distributed to targeted lists of leaders in 26 countries and to USAIDs and requesters in 50 additional developing countries.  In addition, IMPACT has developed and supported population-policy communications programs through major subprojects in 6 countries (Ghana, Madagascar, Somalia, Zimbabwe, Nepal, and Turkey) and for a nine-country Sahel consortium. Through these programs, IMPACT has brought the attention of thousands of developing country policymakers to a number of key messages: FP saves lives; modern contraceptives are in general safe and effective; rapid population growth imperils the quality of the environment in development countries; and case histories show that FP programs do work in developing countries. IMPACT activities contributed to certain advances in the complex process of building support for population and FP among developing country leaders.  (1) IMPACT brought population and FP issues to the attention of far more developing country leaders than originally expected.  IMPACT expected to send about 15,000 booklets to 5,000 leaders in all 69 A.I.D.-supported countries.  But by narrowing its focus to 25 countries and working through in-country representatives, it developed a list of 13,200 leaders, who received about 40,000 booklets. About 30,000 more booklets were distributed through secondary requests from developing and developed-country organizations that collaborate with or train FP personnel. (2) IMPACT materials probably stimulated some policy-relevant activities among at least several thousand developing country leaders. Over half the recipients surveyed had read the IMPACT materials and over 40% had discussed them with colleagues, used them for articles, presentations, or for training, or in some other capacity; another 40% had said they planned to do so.  The external evaluation found that one-third of the developing country audiences surveyed felt that IMPACT materials had contributed noticeably to their country's population policy or FP policy. (3) In Jordan, IMPACT's FP Saves Lives (FPSL) had a catalytic effect among the large numbers of leaders to whom it was distributed.  The politically volatile health rationale for FP -- based on demographics -- presented in the booklet was embraced enthusiastically, and formed the basis for a new kind of information campaign. (4) IMPACT's subprojects contributed to incremental policy change. For example, the Government of Ghana's endorsement of a population authority to implement Ghana's 20-year-old population policy has been attributed to an IMPACT subproject.  In Madagascar, a joint IMPACT/OPTIONS I subproject has contributed to the adoption of a population policy.  IMPACT's assistance (often in collaboration with OPTIONS I) to the Center for Applied Research on Population and Development (CERPOD) has inspired more interest in population policies and CERPOD assistance among the Sahelian member states.  In Turkey, the country-specific version of ""Contraceptive Safety: Rumors and Realities"", was so popular that an extra print run permitted distribution to every obstetrician and gynecologist and every medical school in the country. (5) Global Edition, a subproject to improve the quality and quantity of press coverage of issues related to population and the environment, has taken on a life of its own. A collaborative effort with editors of newspapers and magazines throughout the developing world, it is now supported by the MacArthur Foundation.  Global Edition has retained its original participants and has added editors in Egypt, India, Nigeria, and Indonesia.  It is now developing plans to expand into radio networks.  This former IMPACT activity now reaches an estimated 12 million readers. (6) IMPACT materials are useful for policy dialogue between donors and top country leaders.  On a recent trip to Africa, the A.I.D. Administrator brought special presentation copies of IMPACT's African Population Images to present to national leaders.  In addition, the State Department Coordinator for Population Affairs uses IMPACT materials for briefings with U.S. ambassadors and ambassador-nominees to provide them with the information they will need to discuss population assistance with their national counterparts. Project experience indicates that brief, attractive materials written for non-specialists are effective, especially if they focus on country-specific topics and are written by and distributed under the aegis of highly regarded country nationals, and targeted to balanced categories of leaders.
