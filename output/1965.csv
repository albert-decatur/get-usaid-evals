"EVALUATES PROJ PERFORMANCE AS OF 10/65 IN MOROCCO.  PURPOSE OF PROJ WAS TO BRING ABOUT THE IRRIGATION OF APPROX 176000 ACRES OF FARMLAND AND THE INTRODUCTION OF SOUND IRRIG FARMING PRACTICES IN THE TARGET AREA. US DEPT OF AGR/US DEPT OF INT ERIOR STUDY TEAM OBTAINED THE INFORMATION FOR THIS EVAL THROUGH INTERVIEWS WITH GOM, USAID, US EMBASSY, UN, AND HYDROTECHNIC CORP OFFICIALS;ON-SITE OBSERV AT TARGET AREA FARMS;AND DISCUSSIONS WITH FARMERS AND THE STAFF MEMBERS OF THE EXPERIMENT STATIONS, LIVESTOCK BREEDING STATIONS, PROCESSING PLANTS & THE PERIMETER (PROJ AREA) HEADQUARTERS OF BOTH THE TADLA AND LOWER MOULOUYA PROJS. ALTHOUGH AT TIME OF EVAL ONLY 32000 ACRES HAD BEEN BROUGHT UNDER IRRIG,THE FUTURE OF THE PROJ,GIVEN ADEQUATE FUNDING,APPEARED FAVORABLE.IT WAS DETERMND THAT: THE GOM PLACES A HIGH PRIORITY ON THE ACHIEVEMENT OF PROJ GOALS; GOM PLANS FOR THE DEVEL OF THIS PROJ ARE FEASIBLE & EFFECTIVE; COMPLETED CONSTRUCTION FOR THE PROJ IS OF HIGH QUALITY; THERE ARE SUFFICIENT WATER RESOURCES FOR THE TARGET AREA AND THE SOIL QUALITY OF AREA IS GENERALLY GOOD; UPPER-LVL GOMPERSNNL ASSIGNED TO PROJ ARE WELL-QUALIFIED; AND THE TARGET FARMERS ARE PERHAPS THE BEST IN MOROCCO. THERE DID APPEAR TO BE A SHORTAGE OF QUALIFIED GOM PERSNNL AT THE PERIMETER LEVEL;GOM HAS RESPONDED TO THIS THROUGH PERSNNL CHANGES.

"Evaluates project performance from 3/30/62 to 6/30/65 in Peru. Program assists Govt of Peru (GOP) to increase knowledge, skills & capabilities of its populatn through the establishmt of a total educatnal program.  Evaluatn methodology not defined. A great deal has been accomplished in GOP's attempt to upgrade educatnal skills.  Columbia Univ (CU) has provided Peru's Ministry of Educatn (MOE) with educatnal planning assist, inservice & pre-service teacher training, curriculum & teaching materials for the Developmt Center, technical and/or educational services, constructn & equipmt acquisitn, and overseas training for 32 Peruvian educators.  With CU assistance, MOE worked out plans to improve educational programs through primary, secondary, technical, and industrial educational systems; community devel; educational admin; scholarship programs; and educational evaluatn. Team members have visited all types of schools, analyzed instructn methods & materials, and studied building constructn.  Team has also engaged in orientatn activities; assisted MOE develop its 5 year educational plan & organize a scholarship program; and conducted training sessions for educators.  USAID has exhibited understanding of Peru's educatnal difficulties & offered MOE timely suggestns. Despite progress, improvemt is slow, since Peru's literacy rate at program's inceptn was only 50%; skilled & semi skilled personnel were lacking.  The frequent changes in administrative personnel, poor laws or failure to implemt useful laws on the books & insufficient funds are a constant obstacle.  Other probs have been CU team member's inability to communicate in Spanish and quickly assess cultural & governmental motivatns. Evaluator feels Peru's educational solutn depends on its ability to provide adequate technical assistance, and persuade its private sector to provide funds & training.  Since MOE's requests are too extensive to be accomplished by a staff of 10 technicians, these needs should be realisticly revised according to major priorities.","Evaluation period: 30 Mar 1962-30 Jun 1965","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","","","Educational development|Teacher training|Textbooks|Educational methods|Universities and colleges|Educational administration|Management training|Educational planning|Technical training|Participants|On the job training|Data collection|Educational research|Cost benefit analysis|Communications technology|Curriculum|Educational materials|Educational centers|Leadership training|Beneficiary count","","","","008591 - USAID.

"EVALUATES PROJECT TO ASSIST THE GOVERNMENT OF LIBERIA (GOL) DEVELOP A PROFESSIONAL AND HIGHER EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM AT THE UNIVERSITY OF LIBERIA (UL) FROM 6/64 TO 12/64. CONTRACTOR /(CORNELL UNIV) HAS A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF THE SCOPE AND NATURE OF CONTRACT OBJECTIVES AND HAS SUBMITTED ALLL REQUESTED INFORMATION TO THE GOL IN A TIMELY MANNER. ATTEMPTS ARE BEING MADE TO STRENGHTEN THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN UL AND CORNELL UNIV (CU) AND TO MODIFY THE STAFFING PATTERN. UL HAS MADE GREATER PROGRESS IN THE PAST 2 YEARS THAN IN ANY PREVIOUS DECADE DUE TO THE EXCELLENT ASSISTANCE OF CU AND LEADERSHIP OF UL'S CHIEF OF PARTY. UL'S PARTICIPANT TRAINING PROGRAM AND ON-THE-JOB TRAINING CONDUCTED BY CU TEAM IS PREPARING LIBERIAN STAFF AND FACULTY TO REPLACE CU MEMBERS AND TO IMPROVE UL ADMINISTRATION PRACTICES. SU IS IN TURN BEING INCLUDED IN MORE DECISION MAKING ACTIVITIES. GOOD EXAMPLES SET BY THE EUROPEAN AND AMERICAN FACULTY AND STAFF MEMBERS (50% OF UL STAFF) ARE INFLUENCING THE LIBERIAN UL PERSONNEL TO SHOW MORE INITIATIVE AND FOLLOW BETTER WORK HABITS. UL FUNDING HAS BEEN INCREASED, WHICH ALLOWS PRESENT PROGRAMS TO BE EXPANDED AND IMPROVED. IT IS HOPED THAT INCREASES IN THE NUMBER OF SCHOLARSHIPS AND DORMITORY FACILITIES FOR PROMISING STUDENTS WILL ENCOURAGE A LARGER NUMBER OF QUALIFIED LIBERIAN STUDENTS TO ENROLL AT UL. ARRANGEMENTS ARE BEING MADE TO HAVE LIBERIAN COUNTERPARTS TO THE CU TEAM EDUCATED AND TRAINED IN THE US. THESE COUNTERPARTS WILL REPLACE THE CU TEAM MEMBERS AFTER PROJECT IS TERMINATED. MAJOR OBSTACLES STILL NEEDING IMPROVEMENT ARE: 1)DEVELOPING A SYSTEM FOR IMPROVING BUILDINGS AND GROUNDS PLANNING,MAINTENANCE,ETC; 2)ESTABLISHING OF PERSONNEL POLICIES AND PROFICIENCY RATINGS; 3)IMPROVING ADMINISTRATIVE PRACTICES AND UNIVERSITY BOARD OF TRUSTEE PERFORMANCE; 4)REDICING POLITICAL INFLUENCES IN UL DECISION MAKING,AND 5)DECREASING GO;'S SLOWNESS IN RESPONDING TO CU REQUEST.","Evaluation period: 1 JUL 1964-31 DEC 1964","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/AFE-3-A-1","","5/1/1965 12:00:00 AM","","On the job training|FACULTY|Universities and colleges|Educational administration|Higher education|Educational development|Technical training","Liberia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAP729.pdf","398 KB","008570 - USAID.
