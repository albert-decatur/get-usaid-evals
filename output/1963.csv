"In-depth analysis and case history up to 1/10/63 of 1954-initiated National Agric Dvlp Research Tech Assistance Project in Afghanistan. Proj designed to improve the quality/quantity of agric production & exportable crops through research programs, testing, & demonstrations. With assistance of Univ of Wyoming (UWy) contract and direct-hire technicians/advisors and an FAO technician, proj accomplishments thus far include six fully operational agronomic research stations; a model dairy and model poultry farm; over 100,000 fruit trees distributed & budded; annual distribution of 400,000 plants to farmers; development of high-yield varieties of cotton, sugar beets, and other crops; and testing of hundreds of varieties of agronomic crops.  Per acre production has increased seven times in certain cases and dvlp of rust-resistant wheat assures more uniform yields in this basic crop. Hampshire Red roosters introduced by the proj have become the dominant poultry breed. While proj exceeded original goals in some respects, it failed to reach many goals, hampered in large part by the Afghan Govt's incapacity in supply of personnel, land & funding resources.  Of particular consequence has been a failure to institutionalize proj outputs. Ministry of Agric (MOA) officials have not demonstrated sufficient interest in proj.  American technicians have superseded advisory roles to achieve proj results.  The number of Ministry officials assigned to proj has been reduced.  Of 12 BS partic trainees, only 2 remain directly associated with MOA component of proj.  USAID faulted for not insisting on joint coordination & planning. Proj results remain for most part unpublished. In marked contrast, full senior-level Afghan participation has helped shape steady progress & usable results in Helmand Valley Authority component of proj:  2 research stations are in operation and 2 partic trainees now head the agronomy & livestock programs. USAID has decided to phase out the UWy contract and retain a direct-hire staff equivalent to the number of Afghans assigned, making meaningful future progress dependent on Afghan commitment.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1963 12:00:00 AM","","FOOD STORAGE|Cultivars|Crop yield|Export promotion|IRRIGATION|SOIL MOISTURE|SOIL RESEARCH|Cropping patterns|Varietal research|Vegetables|Poultry|Animal husbandry|Sugar|Food industry|WHEAT|Participants|Agricultural training|Laboratories|Agricultural research|Institution building|Project change","Afghanistan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAC429C1.pdf","1,715 KB","008504 - USAID.
