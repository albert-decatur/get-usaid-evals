"Final evaluation of the Hillside Agricultural Project (2/87-2/97) to increase production of domestic and export perennial tree crops by hillside farmers in selected watersheds in Jamaica. The project was highly successful in achieving its objective; under the auspices of 32 subprojects, perennial tree crop production was improved on 18,000 farms, or over 16,000 acres.  These activities led to the return of small farmer production of cocoa and coffee -- Jamaica's traditional export crops -- after Hurricane Gilbert.  However, while the strategic focus on introducing perennial tree crops permitted the project to reach many farmers, it also compelled the project to ignore other kinds of activities (program sustainability, involvement of women and youth, agricultural product marketing, socioeconomic monitoring, and development of a management information system) that are just as important to the success of hillside agriculture.  The project broadened its scope to address these issues after a mid-term evaluation, but without the commitment of the project team or the resources needed to pursue the new project design, achievement of the new objectives was mixed. Some of the numerous lessons learned from the project are as follows: (1) A large, decentralized effort such as this required independence from the traditional Ministry implementation mechanisms, which can be slow, cumbersome, and subject to arbitrary decisions about resource allocation.  A Project Coordinating Committee can be effective in linking a complex project with USAID and host government officials without relinquishing control of it to a single host government agency, as well as in preserving a single line of accountability.  (2) The integration of perennial trees into hillside farming and natural resource management systems contributes to the control of erosion and provides watershed protection.  Further, the integration of a diverse mixture of these trees along with improved management practices helps to increase production and minimize risk for limited resource farmers. Overall, hillside agricultural development should focus on the whole farming system, promoting annual and perennial tree crop production under mixed cropping patterns.  (3) It is doubtful that the large input subsidies were needed to attract farmer participation.  Many Jamaican farmers are willing to invest in the production of perennial tree crops even if it requires their financial contribution.  Further, farmers are also willing to pay for access to marketing and input delivery services. (4) The sustainability afforded by community participation has a cost. A project must work with existing local institutions or devote resources to facilitate community development.  The time and resources devoted to community development will delay and/or reduce the other outputs which the project can be expected to achieve.  (5) The project's focus on tree crop production to the exclusion of agricultural product marketing and post-harvest activities excluded women, who traditionally have primary responsibility for these activities, from the project.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","LAG-4200-I-00-3056-00","","2/1/1997 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural development|Upland cropping|Hills|Watersheds|Agricultural productivity|Crop production|Mixed cropping|Cropping systems","Jamaica","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABN670.pdf","9,286 KB","005072 - Tropical Research and Development, Inc.","","008563 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to help Indian industries adopt environmentally sound practices while promoting sustainable linkages between U.S. and Indian firms (TEST project).  The project is being implemented by the Industrial Credit & Investment Corporation of India (ICICI) and Sanders International (SI). This mid-term evaluation, covering the period 9/92-3/96, is more of a planning tool than a traditional mid-term evaluation because it was conducted less than one year before the PACD and aimed to help the Mission redesign TEST as the Clean Technology Initiative (CTI/I), a new project due to begin in 1997. Both ICICI and SI have energetically met their commitments to the satisfaction of their beneficiaries.  TEST has contributed toward the Mission's Strategic Objective 5: ""Improved air and water quality at selected industrial sites and municipalities"".  It will be a few years before the types of commercial transactions at the core of TEST's design blossom, and the sustainability or failure of new partnerships and multiplier effects will become apparent.  Detailed analysis of program impacts would take more time, information, and analysis than is anticipated in the TEST logical framework or was possible during this evaluation. Some management issues require the urgent attention of USAID and its institutional partners.  (1) How should the pending loan applications be handled in order to minimize inconvenience to applicants and problems in program management? ICICI feels strongly that about $5-6 million should be awarded for loan applications currently in the pipeline.  This would have major implications for the redesign of TEST because of the amount of money involved, unless this money would come from a source other than the funds projected for CTI/I.  (2) How should the disruption between the end of SI's contract on 1/31/97 and the beginning of the new TA contract be minimized? USAID expects to redefine the role of the U.S. institutional contractor for TEST and to award a new contract in early 1997. The following are lessons learned.  (1) TEST should distinguish between markets for:  new and/or growing, forward-looking industries; older, mostly medium- or small-scale industries; and environmental services.  (2) A major financing component for TEST is no longer appropriate; there seems to be adequate financing in India for promising commercial transactions with environmental benefits, although ICICI disagrees with this conclusion. However, consideration should be given a limited financing component for demonstration projects of pollution abatement technologies that can readily be implemented on a wide scale, if the tested technologies prove environmentally and commercially viable.  (3) Special commercial services provided to TEST participants have facilitated some commercial transactions, but there is no ready way to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of these services.  Therefore, they should either become self-supporting or their environmental and economic merits should be evaluated to determine whether they are worth the extra cost. (4) CTI/I will present increased opportunities and needs for TEST to expand its partnerships, primarily with the U.S. Asian Environmental Partnership (USAEP) and a broader range of Indian institutions.  (5) For some of the new measures to be adopted, TEST will need to shift from a demand-driven to a more targeted approach (e.g. by sector, region, or environmental issue) in order to enhance program implementation and performance monitoring of some CTI/I measures.  (6) CTI/I should increase emphasis on how to design performance indicators and monitor performance.  (I) As USAID already recognizes, Strategic Objective 5 needs to be re-evaluated in light of CTI/I.  (ii) Performance indicators and the structure of performance monitoring should reflect the need for longer time horizons to evaluate project impacts.  (iii) It is important to maximize learning from the initial three-plus years of TEST.  (iv) USAID should structure reporting requirements for TEST to facilitate project monitoring and evaluation, and consider making tracking and analysis of TEST performance a performance indicator, at least for the next 2-3 years. Overall, the first phase of TEST occurred during a time of rapid change in India's environmental market.  The most important driving forces appear to be economic liberalization and globalization (for pollution prevention) and judicial activism linked to citizens' lawsuits (for upgrading of older facilities). USAID's plans to redesign TEST for CTI/I are consistent with the results of this evaluation.  Overall, the most crucial lesson learned for CTI/I may be the need to strengthen design, monitoring, and reporting for project indicators to enhance feedback for ongoing project improvement. This is particularly important since TEST is intended as a ""cutting edge"" project, with potential as a catalyst for other U.S. Government programs and other international donors.

"Evaluates project to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the Guyanese justice system.  Mid-term evaluation covers the period 9/94-12/96.  The project is being implemented by the Ministry of Legal Affairs, the University of the West Indies (UWI), and the University of Guyana. There is a reasonable chance that many of the project's components can be substantially completed. Initial grants have been made to the Bar Association and the Georgetown Legal Aid Clinic.  Eight Magistrate Courts outside of Georgetown have been completed, and work has begun on three others, on the Supreme Court's facility in New Amsterdam, and on the building for the High Court Library.  Some materials for the Library have arrived and staff are being trained.  Several workshops and lectures for judicial personnel and practicing lawyers have been held, and one person has completed the course in legal drafting at UWI. However, the largest targeted output -- improving the management of the court system -- will be difficult to achieve.  Implementation has suffered from 3 main problems.  (1) The Government of Guyana has not met its commitments to appoint a full-time, professional court manager or to provide the level of salaries and support required to attract and hold the personnel needed by the court system.  (2) There have been serious delays in carrying out the various implementation steps, such as getting personnel in place and completing the planned analyses -- with much of the important work having taken place only in the last 6 months.  (3) There are still gaps in the preparation for stage two of the project. An integrated program for working with the Registry of the High Court and a comprehensive training plan for the administrative personnel of the court system have not been completed; no work has been done in preparing for possible additional activities; and there is a need for significant programming work, including further revision of the project's budget and greater specification of the outputs and end of project conditions to be achieved. Confronting these problems has required more effort on the part of the USAID Project Manager than would be expected, and such effort is likely to be required in the future as well.  Fortunately, that official is well-prepared and well-received.  However, steps should be taken to strengthen UWI's implementation performance.","Task order no. 5","Special Evaluation","Documents","AEP-0085-I-00-6018-00","","2/1/1997 12:00:00 AM","","Institution building|Judiciary|Legal education","Guyana","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABN701.pdf","3,936 KB","003970 - Management Systems International, Inc.

"Final evaluation of a project (2/92-6/96) to provide TA to the Government of Bangladesh's (GOB) Financial Sector Reform Program (FSRP), aimed at restructuring the commercial banking system. While the project's contribution was significant, it has not solved major banking problems; it would take 10 years for the 5-year project to achieve its goals.  Perhaps one of the project's most significant contributions has been to make the financial community, the GOB, and donor agencies aware that the banking sector was in much worse condition than previously thought. As the project progressed and the severity of the deficiencies in the banking sector revealed themselves, the project focused its efforts on training personnel from the four Nationalized Commercial Banks (NCBs), primarily by training trainers who introduced state-of-the-art techniques in the field of banking.  The benefits of training were widespread, but sustainability is in doubt in two of the NCBs.  Overseas training for high level professionals from the central bank, the Bank of Bangladesh (BB), the Ministry of Finance, the NCBs, and training institutes was also important, with the programs of Citibank in New York and the U.S. Federal Reserve System representing the summit of banker training programs. Noteworthy efforts to revitalize the Bangladesh Institute of Bank Management (BIBM) included introducing a Master's in bank management, updating courses, and providing the institution with computers for classroom use, and updating its facilities with air conditioning.  To redirect the NCBs, the project's principal focus, the project introduced improved management techniques, providing NCBs with computers and computer software for producing financial reports, and, most importantly, introducing a revised loan ledger, which represented the first step in developing a loan accounting system.  The project improved the BB's supervisory capacity by introducing an off-site surveillance system called CAMEL, and upgrading the BB's Credit Information Bureau (CIB).    The NCBs, BB, and the Central Bank significantly improved their operations after they were introduced to a dramatically improved Management Information System (MIS).  However, the usefulness of the MIS was limited as senior managers were not thoroughly trained in its use. The project helped the NCBs gradually improve their financial performance.  Specifically, FSRP TA helped them to improve implicit inter-relationships in terms of monitoring, with the most visible impact on the performance planning statement used by bank management in policy decisions.  The effects of the use of the Loan Risk Analysis (LRA) are not yet visible. Unfortunately, none of the interventions focused on monitoring loan recovery, a serious and known problem. The BB received significant assistance, primarily through the institutional development of the Monetary Management Technical Unit (MMTU).  This unit produced a monthly report focusing in changes on monetary variables in the economy for meetings of the Monetary Policy Committee, established seminars for the BB staff, and created a data bank of financial and economic statistics, which has been well-received. Training was provided BB staff, including MMTU, although training sustainability is doubtful since many staff members have been transferred to other offices where their training is not utilized.  FSRP contributed indirectly to the reform of monetary policy by assisting in the production of regular papers on financial variables and economic conditions for the Monetary Policy Committee. In sum, FSRP TA helped to reform the banking system in Bangladesh. The use of new methods introduced has varied among different institutions, although there is an awareness of these new techniques among a wide range of employees.  The TA would have been of more use to senior managers and NCBs bank boards had theses two types of personnel been adequately oriented as to the what the new techniques, equipment, and training programs were intended to do.  On the whole, however, as one authority put it: ""In the long run, provided the success so far is not allowed to diminish, Bangladesh will benefit greatly from the foundation of skills, systems, and procedures, provided through FSRP TA.""","Related document: PD-ABN-716","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","AEP-0085-I-00-6016-00","","2/1/1997 12:00:00 AM","","Financial institutions|Capital markets|Commercial banks|Economic reform|Institution building|Financial management|Management development|Management training","Bangladesh","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABN715.pdf","3,636 KB","005072 - Tropical Research and Development, Inc.","","008511 - USAID.

"Evaluates grants to World Education (WE) for two projects in Mali: (1) Urban Revitalization (1991-96); and (2) Promoting Economic Opportunities for Women (1990-94). Phase I of the Urban Revitalization project aimed to increase morale and ease social tension in the aftermath of the March 1991 coup d'etat by generating incomes in urban communities and by strengthening civic organizations working on urban cleanliness and the restoration of buildings.  These efforts seemed to have succeeded; tensions never reached explosive levels and the scheduled elections took place without violence.  Phase II consolidated Phase I gains and reinforced the capacities of some NGOs, economic interest groups (GIEs), and civic groups already supported; it also created new GIEs to provide sustainable solutions to the needs of the population. Phase III aimed to strengthen Phase I and II outcomes and replicate their successes in six secondary cities. However, the project remains most sustainable in Bamako, where it had been underway for some time; where NGOs were already active and familiar with the populations' needs; where there were more resources for follow-up support, TA, and complementary activities such as health education; where population density made garbage pick-up more viable because it more clearly responds to a perceived need for which people are willing to pay; and where there existed water systems that made delivery of potable water a viable activity.  In other secondary cities, most of the GIEs were in serious trouble, due in part, to faulty pre-project surveys and feasibility studies, the lack of the enabling conditions found in Bamako; use of inappropriate technologies; and NGOs' lack of understanding of environmental and sanitation issues, and inadequate technical capacities in construction, adult education, survey techniques, and feasibility studies. Phase III has suffered from administrative and budgeting constraints caused by USAID action, e.g., initially reducing the period of the grant from 3 years to 1 and then only approving 1-year extensions.  This hampered community participation in the project and the provision of training to NGOs, groupes civiques, and GIEs, particularly in the secondary cities. The Women's Micro-enterprise grant initially provided beneficiaries with business and leadership training associated with a grants mechanism; and then initiated savings and credit associations to support business trainees and mobilize local resources for the provision of credit to women savers.  The Bamako WE Office established a Management Committee which extended credits to seven women's groups, which then formed four credit unions, three of which are still part of the program. In 12/94, the project was folded into the Urban Revitalization grant. Since then, seven new credit unions have been put into operation, with nine more expected by the end of 1996. The project, implemented directly through Malian NGOs, was dependent on the quality of NGO personnel.  At the same time, WE followed no Logical Framework for the administration of the grants (no quantitative goals).  As a result, USAID has been dissatisfied over the effectiveness of the programs, and the NGOs have been disillusioned with the amount of capacity-building assistance they have received from WE. Evaluating the project was difficult; while the reporting of concrete accomplishments (e.g., number of latrines built) was quite good, though needing improvement in secondary city activities, documenting of decisionmaking was poor.  WE has taken steps to improve monitoring. Allegations have been made that WE employees are board members of NGOs receiving grants from WE, and that the transparency of WE's process for selecting NGOs for participating of the program is questionable. These seem unfounded, but steps should be taken to eliminate the lingering concerns of the NGOs. The two programs have not been integrated in any way; greater synergy for greater impact could be achieved through, for example, incorporating health education in all training and literacy programs (for credit union members, groupes civiques, GIEs, Parent-Teacher Associations [APEs]), and by developing courses and research activities in which all representatives could participate.","French ed.: PD-ABN-845|Delivery order no. 1","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","HNE-0000-I-00-6030-00","","3/1/1997 12:00:00 AM","","Women in development|Economic development|Income generation|Economic recovery|Urban development|Urban renewal|Microenterprises|Internal conflict","Mali","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABN741.pdf","5,597 KB","000436 - Development Associates, Inc.","","008575 - USAID.

"Evaluates matching grant to Opportunity International (OI), a U.S.-based PVO that supports microenterprise development in developing countries.  The grant will be used to accelerate the pace of OI's agency creation and expansion model by linking local NGOs and their beneficiaries to the formal sector and by leveraging market-based funding.  Midterm evaluation covers the period 9/93-3/97. Progress toward meeting the three objectives of the Cooperative Agreement are as follows.  OI has been very successful toward the fulfillment of Objective #1; it has used the money from the matching grant to form new partner agencies in South Africa, Bulgaria, and Ghana, and to obtain grant and soft loan money from other sources to leverage the PVC grant funds with funds from other sources.  Regarding objective #2 -- to link existing strong partners (in Indonesia, the Philippines and Zimbabwe) to the formal sector for access to market-based funding -- OI has had less success, although some substantive movement has been made.  OI has achieved Objective #3, by substantially strengthening the international mechanisms for cross-fertilization and support for its 49 partners in order to accelerate the learning curve for national impact programs and to increase partners' capacities to respond to natural disasters through business rehabilitation loans for microenterprises. The progress made in achieving the three grant objectives demonstrates that OI is well on its way to achieving the purpose of the USAID matching grant.  It has clearly accelerated its agency creation and expansion through the use of grant funds, although it still has a long way to go toward developing a link with the formal sector.","Delivery order no. 5","Special Evaluation","Documents","FAO-0539-C-00-5036-00","","3/1/1997 12:00:00 AM","","Economic development|Microenterprises|Development cooperation|Private voluntary organizations|Indigenous private voluntary organizations|Development organizations|Institution building","South Africa|Bulgaria|Ghana|Indonesia|Philippines|Zimbabwe","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABN814.pdf","3,837 KB","003970 - Management Systems International, Inc.

"Evaluates the ZdravReform program to help the New Independent States (NIS) of Central Asia, Ukraine, and Russia apply the latest technology to health care financing in order to bolster the social safety net during the period of economic transition.  The evaluation covers the period 1993-4/97. The program quickly evolved to address service delivery as an important element of reform and to reevaluate the assumption that health care delivery would quickly shift from the public to the private sector. In fact, the project's ""rolling"" design, which allowed its evolution as conditions warranted, was one of the strongest contributors to project success; clinical delivery was not included in the project's design, but was added to improve health care delivery. Unfortunately, Western concepts of quality improvement have not been well-received in the region, where the former Soviet Union's traditional management approach, which places much greater emphasis on control, still prevails. An immense amount of work has been undertaken in setting up model systems of health care finance and service delivery reform throughout the NIS -- from Almaty in the east on the border of China to a rural rayon in Ukraine on the border with Moldova in the west, from Issyk-kul in the Kyrgyz Republic in the south to Central Russia and Siberia in the north.  Emphasis has been at the local (oblast) rather than the national level. This tactic has been highly productive.  In Russia alone, more than 100 subprojects have been developed. Communications between test sites and health care providers working at them should be encouraged to ensure dissemination of lessons learned.  In the case of Russia, the decision to move the project management function out of Washington to the field was the proper one.  For the Central Asia and Ukraine programs, discussions between USAID and the field about streamlining communication are underway and should be continued to preserve project momentum. Any follow-on work should continue to test the primary payment models that have been at the core of the current effort.  Declining health budgets and a limited tax base to finance national health insurance systems have reinforced the use of under-the-table payments throughout the region.  Finally, the work on information management is also important to the success of health care finance reform.  This is a new aspect of the health system and needs continued technical support. Broadly, the program has demonstrated that health care reform is critical to the success of economic transition in the NIS, and vital to the success of the ENI Bureau's strategic objectives in economic transition and democratic liberalization.  Health care reform -- work on which has been so far technically sound and successful -- should remain part of the policy dialogue agenda of each of the U.S. Missions in the region.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","DHR-0037-C-00-5067-00","","4/1/1997 12:00:00 AM","","Health finance|Sector policy|Development project design|Local level|Payment systems|Health professional education|Financial management|Economies in transition|Societies in transition|Health delivery|Health care reform","New Independent States","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABN840.pdf","478 KB","008485 - Basic Health Management International (BHM)","","009520 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of a program (11/94-11/96) to demobilize the Haitian armed forces (the FAd'H) and assist in their reintegration into Haitian civilian society.  The International Organization for Migration (IOM) implemented the program. The IOM staff had the political sensitivity, experience, knowledge, and person-to-person skills needed to implement the program, and generally performed well.  Some 88% of the estimated 6,250 demobilized soldiers registered with IOM, and all but a few hundred of these accepted the 6-month vocational training course that IOM offered.  Good USAID-IOM coordination led to a timely startup, as well as flexibility in implementation, although the program's controversial nature made it difficult for IOM to coordinate with high-level Haitian officials and forge links with other aid programs.  The IOM training program was high-quality, provided soldiers timely entrance to courses, provided the types of training requested, and increased the capacity of existing schools.  Of the more than 4,800 graduates of the training program, over 4,500 participated in IOM's Opportunity and Referral Service (ORS), which offered training in job search skills, employment referrals, and vocational tool kits.  Unfortunately, only 304 graduates obtained employment through the ORS. Promoting social reconciliation also proved difficult.  Despite several efforts, IOM was unable to introduce civic education into the program (the FAd'H continued to view themselves as ""entitled"" victims of an unjust dismissal).  There were also no systematic attempts by IOM to promote the efforts of some schools to foster local reconciliation through local projects, although IOM tried to support such programming. The demobilization program had a significant impact in several areas. (1) By holding out the promise of aid and engaging the former FAd'H in the short term (6 months), the demobilization program probably helped to protect the U.S. military force, and contributed to the maintenance of a secure and stable environment.  (2) By continuing over 2 years as more soldiers were demobilized, the program probably helped to lessen threats from the former FAd'H, which, in turn, provided a breathing space to enable other security, political, economic, and social transition activities to occur.  However, other factors also contributed to this breathing space, including the UN presence and the threat of vigilantism.  Moreover, the unexpected complete demobilization of the FAd'H (which had also served as a police force) left Haiti without police.  Building a new police force that could contain potential FAd'H threats proved difficult and time-consuming.  (3) Although the demobilization program gave the former FAd'H some of the skills required for employment, full reintegration is not occurring due to poor economic conditions in Haiti, lower-than-expected economic growth, and the stigma of being a former soldier. The Haiti experience teaches the need for flexibility, extensive coordination with inter-connected transition activities, keeping the demobilized soldiers occupied so that they cause no trouble, and, what is most difficult of all, promoting reconciliation between former soldiers and society, possibly by embedding demobilization programs in efforts to aid the local community.  The Haiti experience also demonstrates that demobilization programs are appropriate USAID/OTI projects because -- depending on their outcome -- they may help maintain the momentum of a transition by assisting peacekeeping forces, providing a breathing space to enable other transition activities to occur, and reintegrating former soldiers into society.

"Evaluates grants to World Education (WE) for two projects in Mali: (1) Urban Revitalization (1991-96); and (2) Promoting Economic Opportunities for Women (1990-94). Phase I of the Urban Revitalization project aimed to increase morale and ease social tension in the aftermath of the March 1991 coup d'etat by generating incomes in urban communities and by strengthening civic organizations working on urban cleanliness and the restoration of buildings.  These efforts seemed to have succeeded; tensions never reached explosive levels and the scheduled elections took place without violence.  Phase II consolidated Phase I gains and reinforced the capacities of some NGOs, economic interest groups (GIEs), and civic groups already supported; it also created new GIEs to provide sustainable solutions to the needs of the population. Phase III aimed to strengthen Phase I and II outcomes and replicate their successes in six secondary cities. However, the project remains most sustainable in Bamako, where it had been underway for some time; where NGOs were already active and familiar with the populations' needs; where there were more resources for follow-up support, TA, and complementary activities such as health education; where population density made garbage pick-up more viable because it more clearly responds to a perceived need for which people are willing to pay; and where there existed water systems that made delivery of potable water a viable activity.  In other secondary cities, most of the GIEs were in serious trouble, due in part, to faulty pre-project surveys and feasibility studies, the lack of the enabling conditions found in Bamako; use of inappropriate technologies; and NGOs' lack of understanding of environmental and sanitation issues, and inadequate technical capacities in construction, adult education, survey techniques, and feasibility studies. Phase III has suffered from administrative and budgeting constraints caused by USAID action, e.g., initially reducing the period of the grant from 3 years to 1 and then only approving 1-year extensions.  This hampered community participation in the project and the provision of training to NGOs, groupes civiques, and GIEs, particularly in the secondary cities. The Women's Micro-enterprise grant initially provided beneficiaries with business and leadership training associated with a grants mechanism; and then initiated savings and credit associations to support business trainees and mobilize local resources for the provision of credit to women savers.  The Bamako WE Office established a Management Committee which extended credits to seven women's groups, which then formed four credit unions, three of which are still part of the program. In 12/94, the project was folded into the Urban Revitalization grant. Since then, seven new credit unions have been put into operation, with nine more expected by the end of 1996. The project, implemented directly through Malian NGOs, was dependent on the quality of NGO personnel.  At the same time, WE followed no Logical Framework for the administration of the grants (no quantitative goals).  As a result, USAID has been dissatisfied over the effectiveness of the programs, and the NGOs have been disillusioned with the amount of capacity-building assistance they have received from WE. Evaluating the project was difficult; while the reporting of concrete accomplishments (e.g., number of latrines built) was quite good, though needing improvement in secondary city activities, documenting of decisionmaking was poor.  WE has taken steps to improve monitoring. Allegations have been made that WE employees are board members of NGOs receiving grants from WE, and that the transparency of WE's process for selecting NGOs for participating of the program is questionable. These seem unfounded, but steps should be taken to eliminate the lingering concerns of the NGOs. The two programs have not been integrated in any way; greater synergy for greater impact could be achieved through, for example, incorporating health education in all training and literacy programs (for credit union members, groupes civiques, GIEs, Parent-Teacher Associations [APEs]), and by developing courses and research activities in which all representatives could participate.","English ed.: PD-ABN-741|Delivery order no. 1","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","HNE-0000-I-00-6030-00|688-0247-G-00-1076-00|688-0247-G-00-0196-00|688-0247-G-00-1303-00","","3/1/1997 12:00:00 AM","","Women in development|Economic development|Income generation|Economic recovery|Urban development|Urban renewal|Microenterprises|Internal conflict","Mali","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABN845.pdf","6,499 KB","000436 - Development Associates, Inc.","","008575 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to improve the welfare of street children in Jakarta, Indonesia -- the RESCUE II (Reaching Street Children in an Urban Environment) project.  The project is funded under the Displaced Children and Orphans Fund (DCOF) and is being implemented by Participating Agencies Cooperating Together (PACT).  The evaluation covers the period 7/94-1/97 against a PACD of 6/97. The project has scored many successes.  Working with nine NGOs, it has assisted some 1,500 street children and helped make communities more aware of street children.  The project's main activities, which address education, health, economic skills, training, and public awareness of children's rights, are viewed positively by all involved, including the street children with whom the evaluation team spoke.  RESCUE also seems to have helped build a critical momentum at the policy level.  On the down side, because their success is difficult to assess, it is not clear whether microenterprise activities are providing viable options for street children.  PACT and its local partners are addressing this need to the extent possible.  Also, the development of a separate institution for street children (street kids university) has raised some concerns. RESCUE II's attempt to continue the approach of RESCUE I of testing new projects has led to both successes and failures.  The modules developed for street literacy were innovative, but, because they were new, organizations had varying degrees of success incorporating them at the local level with only one training session.  The training considered most useful was that which presented information, gave participants the opportunity to incorporate it at their sites, and then provided follow up. Most of the NGOs chosen by RESCUE were already involved with street children; primarily because of the dedication of their leaders, most will continue their efforts when RESCUE's involvement ends.  NGOs said that RESCUE's presence allowed them to pursue activities that they otherwise would not have undertaken.  They also noted that RESCUE was able to promote the coordination of diverse organizations in solving the complex problems of street children and adolescents.  PACT also deserves credit for creating, despite the diversity and varied skills of the NGOs, an NGO network that increased opportunities to share ideas and to advocate at the local and regional levels.  However, no PACT/RESCUE identity seems to exist; most NGOs relate to the children with whom they work, and networking seems to be a function of geographic location and philosophies about street children. In terms of management, it is to USAID's credit that the Agency supported this project despite the absence of a clear link to one of USAID/Jakarta's strategic objectives.  As for PACT, the dissolution of its agreement with its local partner, YKAI, led to an increased management burden that was not matched by an increase in staff.  As a result, objectives had to be prioritized and a different leadership style had to be adopted.  Although this new leadership was suitable for many NGOs, a mentoring approach may have been more appropriate for groups in the nascent stage, especially those outside Jakarta.  Finally, even though most of the NGOs practice a top-down management style, program implementation was democratic and seemed to take into account both the children's and the street educators' suggestions. Lessons learned are as follows:  (1) In-country partnerships should be inherent in all programs, to the extent possible.  The dissolution of the relationship between PACT and YKAI poses problems for the sustainability of the effort.  (2) The street educator approach, which reaches out to the children in their environment and on their turf, seems most appropriate in light of the current environment for NGOs in general and for street children in particular.  While street educators with ""street sense"" are able to quickly develop a trusting relationship with the children, academia-type educators are equally successful in forging positive relationships and serving as their mentors.  (3) A successful program/project is characterized by vision, collaboration, and cooperation.  Local programs that encompass community participation and have a large vision and outside support appear to be more sustainable.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","HRN-6004-C-00-5004-00","","1/1/1997 12:00:00 AM","","Child welfare services|Street children|Urban areas|Private voluntary organizations|Indigenous private voluntary organizations","Indonesia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABN856.pdf","791 KB","003366 - TvT Associates","","008291 - USAID.

"With universal basic education beyond the modest means of most developing countries, they and their development partners are looking increasingly to local communities for vital inputs.  Save the Children/Mali's community school project is one example of this approach, making use of local school management, local villagers with limited to no formal schooling as (low-paid) teachers, local language instruction, parity in girls recruitment, and other innovations. Learning levels of community school students matches those of students in government schools in arithmetic and exceeds them in reading and writing (of the local language).  Classroom management and enrollment and retention also seem better.  Although not high, the level of community school committee and parental involvement is notably greater than in government schools.  Despite these favorable results, it is doubtful that students completing a six-year community school cycle will be prepared to enter the government formal school track, which is taught in French.  The community school teachers are incapable of bringing their students' French ability to a suitable level, due to their own poor mastery of the language.  This and other issues, notably, teachers' remuneration, school committees' abilities, and the role of government school authorities and technicians must be resolved before the model can be replicated on a massive scale and long-term sustainability can be ensured.

"This study was an evaluation of a six-year effort to improve the quality of teaching and learning in the primary schools of Kisumu Municipality in western Kenya.  The treatment involved extensive training of teachers, head teachers, inspectors, and staff of the Municipality's Teacher Assistance Centers.  The project was supported by the Aga Khan Foundation, Overseas Development Agency, Canadian International Development Agency, and Comic Relief.  It began in early 1990 and concluded in July 1996.  During the first three years, the project focused on teachers in standards (grades) 1-3, and in 1994, began also working with teachers in standards 4-6 and head teachers. Workshops were offered on an ongoing basis, and, each school term, teachers in three schools were offered intensive, classroom-based coaching and TA by project staff, with the primary intention of making their teaching more child-centered (i.e., children working in small groups, class discussions, activity-based learning, and asking questions that evoke thinking, analysis, and reasoning).  The evaluation study compared three levels of the project intervention representing different times and extent of treatment exposure and used a neighboring district as a control.  Results showed that pupils in the treatment groups learned significantly more than did control pupils, but all groups performed extremely poorly on tests that measured simple reading and writing in English.  Treatment teachers exhibited significantly more child-centered teaching and classroom-management behaviors than did control teachers, but only classroom-management behaviors were correlated with improved test scores.  Workshop attendance was positively and significantly correlated with increased test scores. Although treatment teachers' behaviors were more child-centered, few teachers actually engaged pupils in discussion, asked thinking-type questions, or had pupils work in small groups.

"This report assesses the effectiveness and sustainability of an innovative community school model run by Save the Children Federation (SCF).  The report compares four SCF-sponsored village-based schools (VBSs) in Chilipa Zone, Mangochi District, Malawi, with two types of government schools (GSs) -- three not assisted by SCF, and three that received some assistance from SCF.  The VBSs differ from both types of GSs in the following ways:  community selection of teachers; regular supervision; smaller curriculum, focused on core subjects; smaller catchment area; regular refresher courses for teachers; and a large proportion of teachers who are primary school graduates.  Both VBSs and assisted GSs received textbook and school material supplementation, and access to SCF's other programs, such as child sponsorship.  Generally, the VBSs were rated higher than the government schools on all measures. Specific findings are as follows.  (1) Supervision and instructional support are better in VBSs.  (2) VBS children performed significantly better in English and Chichewa than children in other schools.  (3) Little difference in community support was observable in the different communities, however the VBS parents had more contact with teachers. (4) Gender balance was better in VBSs, with respect to teachers and school committees than in the other schools, but no significant difference was observed with respect to pupil enrolment.  (5) Promotion rates appear to be higher, and repetition rates lower in VBSs than in the government schools.  (6) The VBS committees all exhibited a more active form of supervision of teachers than in the other types of school.  The report makes recommendations for the government and SCF.","Also known as: Advancing basic education and literacy (phase 2) :|village based schools in Mangochi -- evaluation report, August 1996|Project title: Advancing basic education and literacy 2 (ABEL 2)|Project title: Political/Economic Research and Development Support|(PERS)|Project title: Health and human resources analysis for Africa|(HHRAA)","Special Evaluation","Documents","AEP-5463-A-00-4015-00","","2/1/1997 12:00:00 AM","","Educational research|Community participation|Primary education","Malawi","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNACA327.pdf","443 KB","005921 - University of Malawi.

"In 1995, USAID launched an effort to measure the performance of its humanitarian assistance program.  This document summarizes lessons learned from that experience; these lessons should be considered tentative and preliminary, given the relatively short time that this evaluation effort has been in effect.  The first section presents lessons learned regarding management (i.e., flexibility, preparedness, timing, oversight, design, monitoring/evaluation, the transition from relief to development, training, donor coordination, NGOs/PVOs, and staffing).  The second section describes technical lessons learned that are unique to particular program areas in humanitarian assistance, namely:  health; water; food relief; food for work and food for cash programs; security; orphans; education/training; and logistics.  This is not an exhaustive list of humanitarian assistance activity areas; it is limited to those subjects that have been analyzed by the documents reviewed. The last section presents a bibliography of sources used in the review; these include publications of USAID's Center for Development Information and Evaluation, evaluations produced by the Agency's regional and functional bureaus and development partners, and documents from USAID's 1996 country strategy reviews.

"Evaluates project to reduce the prevalence of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and HIV/AIDS in the Philippines through programs in surveillance and education (ASEP project).  Evaluation covers the period 1993-2/97 against a 9/97 PACD.  ASEP is the principal activity under the Mission's Special Objective for HIV/AIDS. Although HIV Sentinel Surveillance (HSS) has clarified current STD/HIV prevalence, several problems need to be addressed.  Current survey methods do not provide adequate coverage of individuals from high-risk groups for testing, and include too many risk groups per round.  In addition, HSS has expanded to too many sites, and there is no uniform behavioral surveillance questionnaire for use by the Department of Health (DOH) for HSS or by NGOs for their behavioral monitoring surveys. The World Health Organization (WHO) has provided effective support for the HSS, but has been hard pressed to continue its services since the end of the Global Program for AIDS (GPA) grant in 12/95. In the education component, Program of Appropriate Technology in Health (PATH) and the implementing NGOs have generally done an excellent job in developing new institutional capacities to inform high-risk individuals about STD/HIV/AIDS prevention. Mass media information, education, and communication (IEC) have been of high quality, and PATH has consistently fielded high caliber professional staff who have worked effectively with counterparts, particularly at the local government and NGO levels.  On the down side, the NGOs do not routinely address the psychological, social, and environmental correlates of risk, and their primary IEC strategy of using peers to deliver health education messages is probably inappropriate for young girls, who are increasingly being used as commercial sex workers.  Further, while the training of health care workers in syndromic management of STDs has been positive, the widespread lack of STD drugs hinders successful STD control, and resistance to antibiotics is a serious and growing problem.  Finally, a number of systemic barriers thwart risk reduction among ASEP target groups, including poor access to STD treatment, discouragement of condom use by commercial sex establishment managers and the related lack of public monitoring in this matter, the failure of the legal system to suppress child health work, and inadequate financial support for STD/HIV prevention. As a result, ASEP's primary target groups remain at high risk, though HIV prevalence in the general population remains low. At the organizational level, the Philippines National AIDS Council (PNAC), though still weak, recently produced a national AIDS strategic plan, and the DOH is reportedly planning to institutionalize its STD/HIV/AIDS unit. Also, new linkages are being developed between the DOH and the local government units (LGUs), and working models of LGU-NGO collaboration in STD/AIDS prevention and control have been produced in three cities.  However, coordination between ASEP's education and surveillance components remains weak.  ASEP needs a working steering committee that will bring together the surveillance and education components as well as the STD/HIV/AIDS program management.  In addition, it is unclear how current surveillance and education activities will be sustained after USAID assistance ceases.  National and/or local governments are unlikely to allocate adequate funding for these activities from their existing budgets.  Identifying new revenue sources to fund these activities is necessary. Based on the recommendations of this assessment, the Mission should consider revising its indicators at the Special Objective, Intermediate Results (IR), and Activity levels.  The IR currently focuses solely on behavioral changes to measure progress.  USAID needs to consider expanding the IR to include knowledge and attitudinal changes as intermediate or precursor steps to achieving widespread behavioral change. The overall recommendation is to extend ASEP activities for 3 years until 9/2000 and to increase funding for LGU and NGO education programs, identification of local financing mechanisms for STD/HIV-related activities, and policy analysis and advocacy.","Companion evaluation summary: PD-ABP-807","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","2/1/1997 12:00:00 AM","","Disease prevention and control|Sexually transmitted diseases|HIV/AIDS|Epidemiology|IEC|Sex education|Beneficiary targeting|Human sexual behavior|Health surveys|Disease surveillance","Philippines","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABN906.pdf","1,312 KB","","","008592 - USAID.

"Evaluates the HIV/AIDS portfolio of the Asia/Near East (ANE) Bureau, comprising efforts of the AIDS Control and Prevention Project (AIDSCAP), the International HIV/AIDS Alliance, the National Council for International Health (NCIH) in partnership with the Asia/Pacific Council of AIDS Service Organizations (APASO), the Centre for Development Population Activities (CEDPA), and The Asia Foundation (TAF). ANE's HIV/AIDS regional program has basically been well directed toward its objectives and has been absolutely critical as a catalyst of money and support.  (1) The HIV/AIDS epidemic in many parts of Asia shows a pattern of cross-border transmission by large-scale movements of populations or specific sub-populations.  The ANE regional approach has been a powerful response to this pattern.  (2) Under the AIDS Technical Support Project II (ATSP II), Thailand, Indonesia, and India were priority countries for AIDSCAP.  After HIV/AIDS epidemics developed quickly in other countries that lacked bilateral AIDS programs, ANE regional funds were used to help develop associate country programs. (3) When the ATSP/AIDSCAP approach of proven interventions, developed at the beginning of the project, was not flexible enough to address the myriad of regional epidemics, the ANE regional program was able to fill in the gap with more innovative, responsive, and creative activities. (4) ANE's Areas of Affinity (AoA) approach has enabled it to address problems in non-presence countries, though only in a limited way.  (5) The enormous size of the region has enabled ANE's regional approaches in training, policy support, and research to achieve economies of scale. This has been particularly important considering the relatively small amount of funding available for HIV/AIDS.  (6) ANE's regional approaches have helped to build consensus and coordinate response among countries experiencing constant cross-border movement of populations.  (7) Finally, in the future there will be fewer bilateral programs, fewer missions, and fewer personnel.  As a result, it seems that a regional emphasis will be the primary approach by default. The evaluators' major concern was with the scope and scale of ANE programs.  Although most current interventions are based on proven efficacy, and are generally well designed and implemented, they are being implemented on a minute scale.  The resources available for national HIV/AIDS programs are likewise small relative to the likely impact of the AIDS on adult morbidity and mortality in the region.  In assessing future interventions, then, it is important to consider whether or not they:  (1) are demonstration or model interventions, (2) stimulate large-scale replication by others, (3) are limited to prevention rather than absorption of impact, (4) are targeted at high-risk situations, and (5) encourage policy support. Recommendations include the following.  (1) Efforts to control the spread of HIV/AIDS must concentrate on developing and demonstrating or disseminating existing models that can be replicated by other organizations and donors on the necessary scale.  Such models will be small-scale and easily-managed and will target training, policy, and research activities at areas where maximum effect can be achieved, the need is greatest, the demand is urgent, and impact can be coordinated to fill in gaps in other organizations' and donors' activities.

"Final evaluation of a project (9/91-9/96) to establish a process for formulating and implementing health care financing policies, regulations, and legislation supportive of health care market improvements in the Philippines (HFDP project). HFDP played a catalytic role in supporting the Department of Health's (DOH) effort to reform the country's health sector. The project supported: (1) research that established a process of informed health policy formulation and decisionmaking; (2) studies, reports, and demonstration projects that added valuable information about the country's health system and examined policy options and their implications; (3) training programs, site visits, the use of numerous local consultants, helping to create a local community of knowledgeable and experienced experts on health care issues; (4) workshops, seminars, and conferences, creating a multisectoral forum for policy dialogue and reform; and, while not part of its mandate, (5) the provision of information and mechanisms needed by the Government of the Philippines and others to launch and continue the implementation effort. The next few years may prove as pivotal in shaping the Philippine health care system as the last few years have been in launching a new direction. While the passing of the National Health Insurance Law has been a significant accomplishment, it is not yet clear how its financial powers will be used to shape the health care system of the future. The role of DOH is changing, but it is still exploring how best to use its regulatory powers, manage retained hospitals, support and influence decentralized health services, and mobilize the resources of the private health sector. It will need to be thoughtful and aggressive in assuming its new responsibilities, and to develop a clear vision of its new role and a strategic plan to make that role a reality. DOH will also need to follow through on reengineering its organization so that it can address its new priorities effectively by assigning capable people with clear and unambiguous responsibility to each major task, especially financing policy, managing retained hospitals, promoting primary care and prevention, and supporting the devolution of health services. While much of this can be accomplished through the DOH's own human and financial resources, there will at times be need to seek donor assistance to provide external technical expertise, facilitate the policy fora, and provide training to officials in DOH, local government, and managers throughout the health system.

"PACR of a project to repair and restore economic infrastructure in El Salvador.  The report covers the period 8/89-3/95 against a PACD of 9/96. The project was a success.  The restoration of public services permitted the continuity of utility and transportation services during the war, thereby helping to preserve the national economy and the livelihoods of those in the industrial and commercial sectors and creating an economic climate that attracted foreign investment even before the Peace Accords.  The project has rehabilitated 1,200 km of rural roads, a third of them in the ex-conflictive zones, and created access to potable water for 100,00 rural residents (with 171,400 more to be added by the PACD).  Latrine research has led to community acceptance and use of latrines; as a result, the Social Investment Fund (FIS, IDB-funded) and others will resume building latrines as part of their water supply and sanitation (WS/S) activities.  Women have played a key role in the project's own WS&S programs.  While health impact data are not yet available, mothers feel strongly that their children are getting sick less frequently, indicating the importance of health promotion (and the active involvement of health committees therein) in any rural WS&S program.  In terms of employment, the project generated some 18,300 person-years of work directly and 40,000 persons-years indirectly. The following progress towards institution building has been made. (1) Project training, especially in the Management Units, has developed marketable skills, as evidenced by high turnover in some components. (2) TA has strengthened the management capability of the Administration for Machinery and Equipment (AME), established under a previous USAID project, and is now servicing the Roads and Urbanization Directorates of the Ministry of Public Works (MOP).  (3) Work done by the Road Rehabilitation Management Unit (MU) has developed valuable managers for the Directorate General of Highways (DGC).  A former MU manager, for example, has been made manager of the much larger highway and road program funded by loans from other donors.  (4) The Autonomous Port Executive Commission (CEPA) communications with its subsidiary organizations were substantially improved, while computer system expansion has made the Acajutla Port more efficient in managing port operations.  (5) The project highlighted the need for change in host government organizations and methodologies in order to ensure the delivery of public services to rural areas and small municipalities. Specific needs are for a national entity to accept the responsibility to support independent municipalities and rural water committees in the development and maintenance of small water systems, and for new funding and management mechanisms to ensure road maintenance and protect the recent investment in road rehabilitation. The following lessons were learned.  (1) The more complicated an activity's implementation arrangements, the more likely the chance for implementation failure.  Large and complex projects, especially those with serious implementation problems, require strong management.  While special implementing units for projects or activities can aid implementation, they can also impede institutional improvement.  (2) PIOs for services or commodities that are critical to implementation should be issued immediately after the Project Agreement is signed.  (3) USAID funds and/or influence within a country can be strong enough to persuade a host country agency to undertake an initiative that either it is not equipped to handle or not interested in.  (4) A project to maintain basic infrastructure may be critical to the avoidance of economic collapse during civil war.  Having such a project in place at the end of the war can also accelerate the implementation of reconstruction interventions.  (5) WS&S infrastructure construction projects in rural areas will not have the desired health impact nor be sustainable unless there is organized community participation and meaningful health promotion activities before, during, and after the construction period. Health education is rarely effective unless it is coordinated with continued monitoring and support by local groups, e.g., Water and/or Health Committees, and carried out in cooperation with mothers, lay health promoters, teachers, and other local personnel.  (6) The possibility of unauthorized use of project-funded vehicles commonly exists in USAID projects.  Commodity end-use rules need to be reexamined and revised so that they are not an encumbrance to implementation.

"Evaluates pilot effort of the BASICS project to implement a combined case management (CCM) approach to child survival interventions in Niger. CCM is a form of integrated case management.  The evaluation covers the period 1993-1996. The project has worked with the Niger Ministry of Health (MOH) to combine training, supervision, and management efforts for three programs in the health districts of Boboye and Say:  the control of diarrheal diseases, acute respiratory infections, and malaria control.  In addition, the project emphasized the verification of children's vaccination status and nutritional condition. The principal project activities included planning and conceptualization; a baseline survey of health workers' case management practices conducted in January 1995; the development of training and supervision materials; training of trainers and health workers; supervision and problem resolution; and a follow-up survey in December 1996.  BASICS collaborated with the Quality Assurance Project (under 9375992) to develop and use appropriate supervision and problem resolution tools. BASICS' intervention was perceived positively by the project's main partners in Niger.  At the central level, the national disease control program directors and other MOH staff have been active participants in the development and use of training and supervision materials.  This experience should prove helpful, since it is clear that the integrated (or combined) case management approach can be effective in treating childhood diseases and associated problems in Niger, where 65-92% of children have more than one pathology and problems of malnutrition are common. In general, the results of the case management surveys show that health workers' practices have notably improved from the baseline survey, with the exception of the assessment of diarrhea and dehydration cases.  Other aspects of integrated (or combined) case management that still need improvement include advice to parents and assessment of management of malnutrition. Some aspects of the combined approach, such as weighing children consistently and the emphasis on interpersonal communication, are relatively new to health workers.  Making these practices part of their routine will take more time than the 2-year time period of this intervention and will require steady reinforcement by the health system. Project activities, lessons learned, and recommendations are presented for each of the main project components and for combined case management in general.  The quality assurance approach to problem resolution and supervision, including an emphasis on the client's viewpoint, teamwork, analysis of available data, and causal analysis, appears to be an effective tool to prioritize problems and to enable health workers to solve practical case management and communication problems. Problems encountered by the pilot project include issues of compatibility between the treatment guidelines used for the BASICS intervention and the treatment protocols that were used in the two districts, and throughout Niger, before the intervention.  In addition, health workers say that the new, more comprehensive approach to assessing and treating children takes more time and requires reorganization of their work.  Possible solutions for these issues are discussed in this report. The overall advantages and disadvantages of the integrated case management approach are discussed and the prerequisites and resources needed at each level of the health system are described.  The report concludes with recommendations for next steps for the MOH and for BASICS/Niger.  A summary of all recommendations is included at the end of the report.  As the MOH and donors move to implement the integrated management of childhood illnesses (IMCI) strategy, the experience of BASICS' pilot project provides important and helpful lessons.  The BASICS' experience will also help to guide the implementation of IMCI in other countries of the West African region.

"While Ukraine's 1996 Constitution gives local government the right to resolve local matters independently, the legal framework to implement this right is missing, and the structure and operations of government remain as they were before independence.  Through its Municipal Finance and Management Project, USAID is working to bolster democratic local governance in Ukraine, supporting efforts to increase the effectiveness, accountability, and openness of local governments, and boost citizen involvement in three pilot cities and to replicate these accomplishments in other Ukrainian cities.  USAID also supports democratic local governance through programs to bring about private ownership of housing units and link national housing policy with local privatization demonstration projects.  In addition, the Agency supports PVOs working to increase citizen participation and input in local government. Despite daunting obstacles, signs of emerging democratic local governance in Ukraine are visible.  Mayors of the pilot cities in the Municipal Finance and Management project have begun to involve the citizenry in developing the municipal budget and are actively seeking their input on other local government matters.  In these same cities, local governments have become more open and accountable, while improving delivery of essential municipal services.  Individuals are also beginning to get involved politically at the local level, organizing to improve housing, challenge business interests, and help others for whom the government no longer provides. USAID's experience with democratic local governance in Ukraine teaches the following lessons.  (1) Building democracy can and should be included in efforts to strengthen traditional areas of local government, such as public administration and service delivery.  (2) Donors need to do more to link democracy and governance programming with other areas of development activity. (3) Donor assistance should be coordinated and comprehensive, including a viable legal framework, enhanced local government capacity, and increased citizen involvement.  (4) Donors need to shore up resolve at the national level to create and sustain the necessary enabling environment.  (5) Advocacy organizations are needed at the national level to represent the interests of local governments.  (6) USAID should support valid alternative models of democratic local governance.  (7) Study tours in the United States are valuable because they take visiting local government officials beyond abstract notions and give them concrete examples to follow or adapt.  (8) Onsite resident advisers can boost a project's overall success because of their sustained, hands-on involvement.

"Final evaluation of two projects to promote renewable energy (RE) use in developing countries:  (1) RE Applications and Training (REAT) (1985-PACD of 9/97), implemented by the United States Export Council for Renewable Energy (US/ECRE), a consortium of RE trade associations; and (2) Biomass Energy Systems and Training (BEST) (1989-PACD 11/97), implemented by Winrock International. Both projects have changed in shape and direction over the years, allowing them to serve as flexible instruments of policy implementation. Key to both projects has been the development of a portfolio of ""bankable"" projects attractive to investors, the private banking community, and multilateral lending agencies.  It is in this area that the projects have met their most difficult challenges.  Both projects heavily favor working in tandem with the private sector -- REAT more so than BEST -- in USAID-assisted developing countries as well as the United States.  Whether an intended objective or not, integrating the energy needs of developing countries with the technologies and experience available from U.S. manufacturers and suppliers is a significant achievement of these projects.  All in all, the beneficiary pool from both is quite broad, extending from remote villages who receive electricity for the first time, to governments that are better managed and paid for through rational energy policies, to U.S. manufacturers and suppliers of RE technology and expertise, and to the world community that benefits from a less-polluted environment.  Gaps in quantity and quality of information made the evaluation most difficult. Specific accomplishments are noted below. US/ECRE implemented REAT through member associations or outside consultants or cooperators, five in particular.  (1) The Center for Renewable Energy and Sustainable Technology (CREST) produces educational multimedia CD-ROMs and operates Solstice, an Internet service for the sustainable energy field.  (2) The International Fund for Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency (IFREE) supports access to funding for RE and energy efficiency projects under its ""Pre-Investment Funding"" and ""Financial Engineering and Innovation"" Programs.  (3) The Renewable Energy and Efficiency Training Institute (REETI) facilitates the transfer of training and technology expertise from U.S. industry to international markets and institutions in Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the United States, with a focus on solar, wind, biomass, geothermal, microhydro, hydrogen, and energy efficiency technologies.  Training is conducted in partnership with the international public and private sector RE and energy efficiency communities and is conducted by highly qualified U.S. industry representatives recruited for their special expertise in this area.  (4) Volunteers in Technical Assistance (VITA) has collaborated with US/ECRE in demonstrating the value of low orbit satellites for RE technology transfer to developing countries. The system has been used to transmit information via e-mail and to monitor and control remote hybrid RE power stations in Indonesia. (5) Winrock International (see next section). During the first 4 years, BEST focused on applied research into transferring and commercially replicating U.S.-based biomass technologies in USAID-assisted countries.  The first task was performed in ""working laboratories"" that blended U.S. and developing country technologies.  The second task was not as successful; the concept of producing power commercially for sale to a national or regional grid was often not well received.  In 1993 BEST shifted emphasis to the commercial development of existing technologies, and from megawatt- to kilowatt-sized technologies in an attempt to reach more isolated rural dwellers.  It was at this time that Winrock began to establish formal links to the U.S. private sector through US/ECRE and its member trade associations and began implementing biomass activities under both the BEST and the REAT projects.  By 1995, BEST had reached two critical indicators called for in the Project Paper:  more than 200 MW of electrical capacity based on biomass cogeneration had been installed in USAID-assisted countries; and bilateral, multilateral, and private financial institutions were managing lending programs that allocate hundreds of millions of dollars for investment in biomass cogeneration systems.  BEST also supported the formation of RE Support Offices (REPSOs) in Costa Rica, Indonesia, Philippines, India, and Brazil to provide an in-country institutional base to sustain and expand the impact of the BEST project.  In addition, the REPSOs implemented a promotional exercise consisting of pre-investment support grants for cost-shared feasibility and pre-feasibility studies, preparation of RE Trade Guides, workshops, trade fair expositions, and the identification of potential biomass and other RE projects.  Other BEST activities included a Multilateral Development Bank Initiative, which resulted in the preparation of five power export projects based on biomass energy; a Utility Initiative; a Carbon Inventory; a Cane Energy Development Program; and an Information Dissemination Program. On the down side, a 1993 decision of the Office of Procurement ruled out using Mission funds to augment a non-competitively awarded cooperative agreement limited the amount of financing available for BEST, though by how much it is impossible to say.  A lengthy approval process for feasibility studies also limited the project.","Delivery order no. 1","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","AEP-0085-I-00-6016-00","","6/1/1997 12:00:00 AM","","Renewable energy resources|Alternative energy technology|Technology transfer|Energy resource development|Energy conservation|Biomass|Sustainable development|Development projects|Partnerships","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABP040.pdf","7,962 KB","005072 - Tropical Research and Development, Inc.","","008710 - USAID.

"Although the Philippines has made major progress toward more autonomous and accountable local government by enacting the Local Government Code in 1991, traditional political values and behavior still hold the country back from full-scale democratic local governance.  Too many local bosses build power bases through relationships based on favors (often reinforced by threats).  Local political party organizations are fairly weak, and local bosses in many cases are loath to grant civil society organizations or citizens the roles carved out for them in the Local Government Code.  Thus concludes this evaluation, which reviews USAID's long history of support for democratization in the Philippines.  In the 1970s, for instance, the Agency sponsored a trip to the United States for mayors and other local officials (including the principal author of the Local Government Code) to receive training in public administration.  Over the past 15 years, USAID has given more than $78 million to NGOs and people's organizations to support their role as agents of democratic change and reform.  Since 1992, the Agency has supported civil society directly, with $15.1 million to help fisherfolk, urban poor, and indigenous peoples form coalitions. Through the Local Development Assistance Project (1990-95), USAID provided $50 million to help decentralize government functions; increase local governments' authority, and resources; and broaden citizen participation.  In 1995, the Agency began the Governance and Local Democracy project, to which USAID has already committed $20 million to support development through decentralized governance. These programs have had a visible impact on the progress of democratic local governance in the Philippines. However, the country still faces the formidable barriers of patronage-style politics, electoral fraud, exclusion of civil society, weak local party organizations, and citizens' lack of knowledge about democratic rights and responsibilities. Lessons learned from USAID's experience with democratic local governance in the Philippines include the following.  (1) It is important to build an understanding of democratic processes and develop tools for implementing democracy, even if it means having to wait for the right time to pursue related reforms.  (2) Political will is essential at both the national and local levels.  (3) Civil society organizations can fill the void when local political parties aren't strong enough to ensure citizen participation and government accountability.  (4) Donors need to be flexible and anticipate changing circumstances. (5) Promoting democratic principles and attitudes is essential, but is often ignored in the traditional emphasis on improving local government administration and service delivery.

"From 1965 through 1994, U.S. food aid to Ghana under P.L. 480 totaled nearly $340 million, more than 50% of all the food aid received by that country. This report assesses the impact of that aid. All P.L. 480 food aid to Ghana has been provided as a part of a much larger U.S. policy reform assistance package, which, in turn, was part of a much larger multidonor package.  Either the whole package worked or failed.  The package delivered from 1966 through 1972 primarily failed; though Ghana launched a series of economic reforms and received a large amount of P.L. 480 assistance during this period, a political coup prevented the reforms from taking hold and subsequent reforms planned for 1979-83 fell victim to broken government promises. However, during the last dozen years or so USAID's food aid package to Ghana has largely succeeded. Since 1983, assistance has led to the privatization of government agricultural marketing, eliminated the fertilizer subsidy, and encouraged nontraditional agricultural exports. In addition, thanks to the economic reforms supported by food aid, the GDP increased during the period 1983-1993 at an average rate of 5%, one of the longest and highest growth rates in all of Africa. Moreover, the share of those living in poverty fell from 37% in 1988 to 31% in 1992, and nontraditional agricultural exports, which help primarily the rural poor, increased from $2 million in 1984 to $160 million in 1995. Assistance provided during this later period included Title II feeding programs aimed at those most at risk (pregnant and lactating mothers, malnourished infants and children, and those living in drought areas). These programs have clearly achieved results.  Each year, Title II fed over 200,000 hungry Ghanaians, fulfilling the program's specified goal.  Some Title II and III projects have addressed specific food and development problems, including food-for-work projects and projects in which food was sold to generate local currency to fund development projects.  These were also found to be effective; those suffering from malnutrition were fed, schools and roads were built, village-based microenterprises were developed, and new economic opportunities were created.  On the down side, these projects reached only 5% of those in need.  Moreover, the underlying economic, political, social, and environmental factors that caused food insecurity still exist -- a high population growth rate, low growth in agricultural productivity, low per capita income, and a significant proportion of the population living in extreme poverty. In sum, despite the overall success of P.L. 480 food aid to Ghana in the last decade or so, a large part of the country's population, 31%, still suffers from malnutrition, a problem in which Ghana still ranks near the bottom among sub-Saharan countries.  The rural poor in the northern half of the country, for example, are as poor as any in Africa, and there is disquieting evidence that the urban poor, even in the largest cities of the south, are becoming poorer. Lessons learned are as follows.  (1) Title I and Title III food aid is a highly flexible development tool in support of policy reforms.  (2) Food aid commodities that do not compete with domestic crops do not create a disincentive to local production. (3) Food aid can create a dependency or preference for an imported commodity, such as wheat.  (4) Title II feeding programs are a ""social safety net"" or ""holding action"" temporarily helping beneficiaries.  (5) More study is needed of the relative importance of factors causing food deficits in highly food-insecure recipient countries.  (6) Increased Title II monetization and the increased availability of local currency resources from Title III have significantly boosted the ability of NGOs to increase the impact of development projects.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1997 12:00:00 AM","","Food aid programs|Food for Peace Title I|Food for Peace Title II|Food for Peace Title III|Economic reform|Economic policy|Conditionality|Economic impact|Social impact|Food security|Policy reform|Food aid monetization","Ghana","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNABY237.pdf","285 KB","008058 - USAID.

"Midterm evaluation of the Reach the Educationally Excluded (REX) project to help local development organizations in selected countries incorporate the Active Learning Capacity (ALC) model into efforts to increase enrollment in and completion of primary school.  ALC combines attention to traditional educational inputs with attention to child-based factors such as health, nutritional, and psychosocial status. The project is being implemented by Education Development Center (EDC).  The evaluation covers the period 10/94-9/98. Program staff have made significant accomplishments in reaching target beneficiaries and in working with partners on ALC programming. Most noteworthy are the institutional partnerships developed at the central level and in Bolivia, now being replicated in Ecuador and Nepal; the creation of qualitative reference materials on ALC and ""Human Capacity Development"" initiatives; and an unanticipated level of scale in the Bolivia program (at nearly 20 times its planned level), in turn providing increased educational access to many times the number of expected beneficiaries.  New program initiatives in Nepal, Ecuador, and Honduras suggest an emerging focus and methodology that is likely to be cost-effective and of significant impact, with a high level of contextual support.  This work should continue to be supported. Implementation limitations lie in the area of developed program and managerial systems and related structures.  At this stage of implementation, the program has exceeded its objectives and would benefit from a redefined strategic plan that consolidates methodology, program foci, and commonality of goals throughout three parallel lines of implementation (direct assistance, partnership/institutional strengthening, and research and development).  The basic ingredients exist to accomplish this, and EDC should dedicate time to molding the next steps.  The program could have significant potential to demonstrate impact if resources were directed toward gathering reliable baseline data, defining indicators, and collecting standardized performance information.

"Final evaluation of a project (9/92-6/97) to promote democratic governance (DG) in Zambia. The project succeeded in some of its endeavors, but not all.  The political context in which it was implemented deteriorated as the government's relations with opposition parties and advocacy groups became increasingly polarized, and the intensity of the conflict has made implementation of some project components difficult if not impossible. Project support for liberalizing the constitution was frustrated because the government insisted on focusing the constitutional revision process on its own political objectives, specifically on limiting the effectiveness of the opposition and preventing former President Kenneth Kaunda from running in the 1996 Presidential elections. The civic education component did not reach the grassroots population to any significant extent through the strengthening of the Foundation for Democratic Process (FODEP); aid to FODEP only succeeded in training a cadre of democracy trainers.  The project in its last 2 years, however, did provide democratic education at the community level through its Civic Action Fund (CAF).  In addition, this component helped to completely revise the junior secondary school civics curriculum (including two new textbooks) which should have a major impact on exposing schoolchildren to democratic values. Assistance to the Zambia Institute of Mass Communication (ZAMCOM), a journalism training institution, helped make it autonomous of the government.  However, USAID was unable to deliver a significant portion of the equipment it had promised because of Washington's decision to sanction Zambia for regressing on democratization.  ZAMCOM's long-term survival was thus jeopardized. Strengthening of the Cabinet's Policy Analysis and Coordination unit, while progressing steadily, has not achieved a number of objectives, including training in policy analysis and intergovernmental negotiation and the installation of a local area network system.  In part, this component was not completed because of the U.S. Government's decision to cut democratic governance aid to Zambia in 1996. The Legislative Performance component was suspended in 1995 when the National Assembly Administration refused to come to a working agreement with project staff on a specific agenda. Michigan State University (MSU) produced the planned monitoring and evaluation products, but their impact on the project seems to have been marginal in a number of instances. The baseline study on indicators of democratic progress collected little data, and the Mid-Term Review's recommendations regarding structural improvements were only partially implemented due to the Mission Director's concerns about the report's objectivity. MSU produced a number of special studies which were of excellent scholarly interest but of little relevance to project decision making. Project management was more complex than originally envisioned.  A major flaw was the lack of Zambian ownership, particularly Zambian involvement in high-level decision making. Also of concern is the high cost of the cooperative agreements with MSU and Southern University (SU).  Also, management responsibilities were not well coordinated among SU, MSU, and the Democratic Governance (DG) advisor. Lessons learned include, inter alia:  (1) democratization and economic reform can proceed concomitantly without interfering with each other; (2) DG projects must assume that the local political climate may become adverse to their goals; (3) DG projects may effectively use patronage under certain circumstances to sustain their objectives; (4) policy research should focus on important decisions confronting project staff; (5) local participation in project decision making is imperative and requires innovative approaches; (6) caution should be exercised in asking social organizations to undertake new functions; (7) democracy projects can easily become part of domestic political conflicts and thus lose effectiveness; (8) more controversial programs are better undertaken at the local than the national level. The next stage of the program should be focused, flexible, politically cautious, simple to monitor, include Zambian participation, possess concrete gender objectives, make lines of authority explicit, be less expensive to manage, progressively reduce financing provided to beneficiaries, and have realistic goals.  Possible components include, in order of priority:  judicial and legal reform, civic action fund, civic forums, media independence, civil society dialogues with government, and a national visioning exercise.

"PACR of a project (6/89-12/96) to increase the capacity of the Dominican Republic's Instituto Superior de Agricultura (ISA) and its Center for Rural Development and Administration (CADER) to train personnel for the nation's growing agribusiness sector, especially in areas relating to nontraditional commodities.  ISA implemented the project with assistance from the Midwest Consortium for International Activities, Inc. (MUCIA). Results of the project were positive; through curriculum development, faculty and administrator training, and development of an endowment fund, ISA now has the capacity to provide well-trained mid-level personnel to the country's agribusiness and agro-industrial community. At present, ISA graduates are employed primarily by the private sector, and the Institute has an Endowment Fund that covers 20-25% of its operating costs.  Moreover, ISA has achieved international status, with 90 foreign students out of its 270 total student body. On the down side, several assumptions in project design proved false. USAID was able to provide only $8.5 million of the planned $12 million. Consequently, the PACD was shortened by 9 months, the levels of inputs for the MUCIA grant were reduced, especially for long-term TA, and the level of long-term professional exchange under the ISA grant was cut back. The following lessons were learned.  (1) The goal to increase non-traditional commodity-based incomes was too ambitious and beyond the project's ability to influence.  Nontraditional agricultural exports actually declined over the project period because of an unfavorable macroeconomic environment and the exclusion of Dominican products from U.S. markets due to illegal pesticide residues.  (2) The private sector's ability and willingness to contribute to an Endowment Fund was overestimated.  A declining rather than expanding nontraditional agriculture sector certainly contributed to reduced contributions.  (3) Although the institutional strengthening of ISA was not explicit in the design of the project, it was perhaps its most significant outcome. The principal changes made in ISA were the establishment of a new undergraduate curriculum tailored to the project purpose, a strengthened capacity for continuing education and research, closer ties to the agro-industrial community, and the development and institutionalization of new administrative capabilities in the areas of planning, accounting, budgeting, personnel management, and academic affairs.  In addition, the project put ISA in the position to lead and coordinate the large-scale project for the Rehabilitation of the Natural Resource Base of the Yaque del Norte River Watershed.  ISA improved its financial structure with the development of income-generating activities in farm production, continuing education, conference services, and TA.  With the establishment of the Development Office, the infrastructure for fund raising was established.  (4) Faculty retention remains a problem, especially for persons in the areas of agribusiness and agricultural economics who have excellent opportunities for work in the private sector.  This requires that ISA direct more attention to raising salaries and incentives for supplementary income.  This, in turn, depends on generating more income; but fundraising for an Endowment Fund is difficult, especially for an institution without such experience and the transition being experienced by the agricultural sector due to increased competition from imports.  USAID also provided similar endowments to Junta Agroempresarial Dominicana (JAD) and the Fundacion de Desarrollo Agropecuario (FDA), which are actively competing with ISA for donations from the same sources and for the same sector.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","3/1/1997 12:00:00 AM","","Agribusiness|Agricultural development|Institution building|Nontraditional agricultural exports|Personnel development|Human capacity development|Agricultural education|Training centers|Partnerships","Dominican Republic","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABP107.pdf","387 KB","008537 - USAID.

"Evaluates the Biodiversity Support Program (BSP).  Internal evaluation, made primarily with the input of the program's own stakeholders, covers the period 1988-96.  BSP is implemented by a consortium of three institutions:  the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), The Nature Conservancy (TNC), and the World Resources Institute (WRI). BSP's programs are organized and managed by four regional programs -- Africa/Madagascar, Latin America/Caribbean (LAC), Asia/Pacific (A&P), and the Biodiversity Conservation Network (BCN) for A&P.  BSP has also supported programs in Bulgaria and the Ukraine.  The Africa Program manages a current portfolio of 11 projects, operating both in and outside protected areas, and focused primarily on analyzing and disseminating information on the relationship between biodiversity conservation and improved human livelihoods.  The LAC Program has focused to a large extent on supporting USAID as a technical resource for facilitating participatory processes aimed at identifying conservation priorities, and for implementing integrated conservation and development projects (ICDPs); this has involved significant investments in institutional development. The A&P Program has focused on supporting a scientific basis for conservation decisionmaking and on legitimizing the role of local communities in biodiversity conservation. The BCN is dedicated to supporting site-specific community-based conservation and evaluating the effectiveness of enterprise-oriented conservation activities at 20 sites across the A&P region. The evaluation assessed BSP's effectiveness in four functional roles, as:  (1) a partner with, and technical resource to, USAID, including acting as a grants manager and administrator; (2) a facilitator of processes involving multiple stakeholders and a catalyst for new partnerships and projects; (3) an analyst and communicator on biodiversity issues, strategies, and lessons; and (4) a supporter of individual and institutional capacity strengthening. The evaluation concluded that BSP's approach to conservation through these four roles has been effective.  As a partner with USAID, BSP has efficiently programmed funds through its flexible approach and administrative practices that strive to minimize burdens on grantees. BSP's emphasis on monitoring projects in order to analyze lessons that can be shared with USAID and the broader conservation community is seen as valuable.  Most BSP projects are contributing to capacity-building of local NGOs, community organizations, and government agencies. Improvements should be focused in two areas:  communicating the results of BSP programs, and engaging the three consortium institutions more in BSP programs. Examples of conservation impacts in BSP-supported projects include the following.  (1) In Mexico, BSP support for sustainable development in wildland areas (ICDPs) has improved knowledge of conditions under which ICDPs can be successful, mobilized additional financial resources, and reduced deforestation.  (2) A BSP-led effort to develop a geographic priority setting framework for the LAC region has resulted in USAID's adoption of the priorities and a methodology that is being applied by a number of conservation organizations to define their investment priorities.  (3) BSP's analyses of global climate change in Central Africa, and initiative in creating new partnerships has led to the development of the CARPE regional program for Central Africa, which involves a partnership of five NGOs and four U.S. government agencies to address deforestation in the second largest tropical rainforest in the world.  (4) Improved protection of 4 million hectares of tropical forest has resulted from community-based mapping and land use planning in Indonesia, the Philippines, and Bolivia. (5) Twenty community-based projects in the A&P region are generating widely applicable lessons about the conditions under which enterprises can create incentives to conserve biodiversity.  New legislation regarding the recycling of some portion of tourism tax revenues collected in Nepal has been adopted as a result of one of the grants.  (5) BSP has supported the development of sustainable financing mechanisms through the establishment of the KEHATI foundation in Indonesia (with a $16.5 million endowment), strengthening of Fundacion Vida in Honduras, and planning for trust funds in the Philippines and Papua New Guinea.

"Final evaluation of a project (4/90-5/97) to promote microenterprise development in Jamaica. Results were mixed.  Institutional support provided to the Enterprise Development Trust (EDT), ASSIST, Ltd., and the City of Kingston Cooperative Credit Union was generally unsuccessful, resulting in loan portfolios that, in terms of size, quality, and impact, were well below expectations. Problems included difficulty in contacting borrowers due to poor transportation and violence in the targeted communities; the NGOs' failure to adopt the project's minimalist lending approach; overly optimistic expectations for loan portfolio development; and failure to coordinate TA, training, and project management inputs with credit delivery.  In contrast, TA and an in-house training program have benefitted the Workers Bank Program, the pace and quality of which is on target. The training component comprised institution-building and entrepreneurial training.  Training of the first type helped 269 staff and board members from lending and donor institutions improve operations; study tours were especially effective in promoting the adoption of minimalist lending. Overall, however, the training did not have the anticipated impact, since it failed to match the developmental needs of participating institutions and did not sufficiently target decisionmakers.  Entrepreneurial training was provided to EDT and ASSIST, and, on an introductory level, to over 5,000 microentrepreneurs. The impact of this training is not yet measurable.  The training component also supported the production, in concert with the University of Technology Entrepreneurial Extension Center, of training videos in dressmaking, tailoring, day care, small-scale restaurants, and furniture manufacturing.  These proved part of an interesting training model that can be duplicated in other countries.  TA provided the East Westmoreland Craft Producers Association improved production, marketing, and sales, and had small but measurable impacts on income.  The project provided the National Development Foundation of Jamaica (NDF/J) with equipment for a computer center, scheduled to open 5/97, which should reach over 400 entrepreneurs annually. Under the information and research component, modest project financing leveraged over $500,000 from other donors to support the National Surveys of Microentrepreneurs in 1992 and 1996, quarterly panel surveys, and other studies.  These efforts increased the availability of reliable information on and hence planning in the microenterprise sector.  The component also led to elimination of the interest rate ceiling for credit unions. Outreach to women was successful; 56% of loans were to female-owned enterprises, and 54% of entrepreneurs trained were female.  The main weakness was lack of information on gender-disaggregated constraints and opportunities in the microenterprise sector.  Overall, the project increased economic opportunities for the poor, though not as much as if APPLE anti-poverty loans had been disbursed. In terms of implementation, the provision of TA through centrally funded projects contributed to delays and lacked continuity.  In addition, TA was not sufficiently emphasized in the project's first 3 years; more focused efforts with decisionmakers would have increased acceptance of the minimalist lending approach.  Also, the first Project Manager, who also functioned as the USAID Project Officer, left the project in 3/97; his replacement will likely have difficulty assuming both roles. Lessons learned are as follows.  (1) It takes a minimum of 3-4 years to bring a credit institution to operational efficiency.  During the developmental phase of a program, TA should be programmed on an ongoing basis and be designed to match the developmental time line of credit institutions.  (2) Adoption of minimalist lending strategies requires a new way of thinking about credit for microentrepreneurs.  (3) Every effort should be made to synchronize inputs from centrally-funded projects with those of other projects.  (4) Management of complex projects such as this is enhanced through separation of the Project Officer and Project Manager functions.  Use of an institutional contractor may be warranted.  (5) To ensure its impact, training to strengthen lending institutions must be offered in conjunction with training for policymakers, which requires an ongoing mix of study tours, conferences, dialogue with directors of successful programs in other countries and ongoing interaction with technical advisors.  (6) Experience with the studies program indicates, inter alia, that clearly delineated contracting arrangements for project-funded research are required.","Delivery order no. 27","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","PCE-0025-Q-00-3071-00","","5/1/1997 12:00:00 AM","","Microenterprises|Institution building|Business support services","Jamaica","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABP210.pdf","5,324 KB","009184 - Barents Group LLC","","007975 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of the Information and Referral Service (IRS)/Provincial Fund (PF) component (4/94-1/97) of a project to help demobilized soldiers (DSs) in Mozambique make the transition from military to civilian life.  The objective of the IRS/PF component was to provide DSs, respectively, with (1) information on demobilization benefits and economic opportunities, and (2) small grants for small business and microenterprise initiatives. The IRS/PF successfully attained its objectives and contributed positively to the reintegration of DSs into Mozambican society. Over the course of the project, 79,496 visits were made by DSs to provincial IRS/PF offices, and an additional 30,449 were contacted through outreach programs in rural areas. Requests to the IRS were made for training, employment, assistance with Reintegration and Support Scheme (RSS) payments and other demobilization benefits, self-employment opportunities, and pensions.  For its part, the PF funded 4,415 projects for 26,175 beneficiaries -- 22,757 of them DSs -- in the agriculture, industry and crafts, construction, forestry and the environment, fishing, trade and services, and public works sectors.  PF projects were in the following categories:  income generating activities/microenterprise, service contracts, training, institutional strengthening, labor-intensive activities, community development, permanent employment/on the job training, and returnee support. Secondary benefits of the IRS/PF include capacity building for 10 participating Ministry of Labor employees and conflict resolution team members, and mapping of over 10,000 opportunities for both PF and non-PF employment.  The IRS/PF also provided support to other reintegration programs in Mozambique, especially those of the United Nations. Overall conclusions are as follows.  (1) The IRS helped link beneficiaries with other programs.  For most activities, the access rate reported by the interviewees increased if the respondent contacted the IRS seeking information.  However, the IRS appears to have had little effect on the DSs' perception of their own reintegration, and survey results show that a slight decrease in the median perception for reintegration exists for those receiving IRS services.  IRS might have created expectations for benefits or programs which it could not or was not meant to deliver.  (2) The PF had a positive impact on beneficiaries' perspectives regarding their own welfare and reintegration, their communities, the value of reintegration programming, and the social benefits of peace.  PF beneficiaries feel more optimistic about their future than other DSs.  In addition, the PF has benefitted DSs economically and increased their economic stability.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","3/1/1997 12:00:00 AM","","War recovery|Military|Population resettlement|Economic reconstruction|Information and referral services|Grants|Small scale enterprises|Occupational opportunities|Demobilization|Excombatants|Economic and social reintegration","Mozambique","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABP227.pdf","8,458 KB","001341 - Creative Associates International, Inc.

"Midterm evaluation of the Bulgaria component of the Democracy Network (DemNet) Program, aimed at strengthening civil society in Bulgaria by supporting the efforts of indigenous NGOs in four sectors: civil society/democratic practices, economic development, the environment, and social safety nets.  The project is being implemented by the Institute for Sustainable Communities (ISC).  The evaluation covers the first 20 months of the program (10/95-4/97). DemNet has completed one round of pilot grants.  In this round, which was launched 10/2/95 and open only to NGOs working in the civil society/democratic practices sector, 18 organizations received funding for institutional strengthening or project activities. Another 30 NGOs were awarded with DemNet training seminars.  A second round of grants was opened to NGOs working in the democratic practices and social safety net sectors.  In 1/97, 33 such NGOs were nominated to receive funding for institutional strengthening and project activities, and another 10 to participate in the DemNet training program. Despite the criticisms leveled against ISC (e.g., that it should have mobilized faster, worked more closely with NGO leadership, and developed a strategy to mobilize a network of organizations that support grassroots democratic participation), its Bulgaria staff and management deserve credit for what has been accomplished under difficult circumstances.  They have mobilized a Sofia-based team, assessed NGO sector needs, and structured a grants program and a training capacity targeted at the NGO community.  Overall, ISC/Bulgaria has made a difference by strengthening Bulgaria's inexperienced NGO sector to a modest degree, gaining valuable experience in the NGO sector in the process. At this point, ISC/Bulgaria and USAID need to significantly adjust their program approach in order to better prioritize the award of grants and thereby maximize the program's contribution to building a civil society in Bulgaria.  Focus should immediately be shifted to developing a network of locally based NGOs that can promote the resolution of community problems at the grassroots level, perhaps in municipalities where FLAG, the Local Government Initiative, Peace Corps and other USAID activities are already underway.  Priority should be placed on regions or municipalities where the NGOs are already involved in the DemNet Program and are committed to policy advocacy, community involvement, team work, and partnerships, and have the capacity to operate democratically and sustainably.  The election of NGOs to participate in the program should be done by the leaders of the municipality where they work, an approach which is used by the Partnership Foundation in its Sliven activity.  The approach lends itself to the team building, training, and consensus building on which ISC should be focusing in the DemNet Program; to do this, ISC would first need to strengthen its TA and monitoring capacities.  ISC should also consider contracting with other indigenous organizations to design democracy training activities, not because ISC lacks this capacity but because one of DemNet's goals is to institutionalize indigenous training capacity to strengthen civil society. Since 1989, citizen participation in the public policy decisionmaking process has increased dramatically over what was possible under the Communist regime.  The growth in the number of NGOs in the past 6-7 years does, in part, demonstrate the public's eagerness to continue to play a stronger role in the public policy arena.  The Democracy Strategic Objective (SO) 2.1 and the DemNet Program have been created to support this public will.  ISC/Bulgaria has made efforts at each stage of their progress in country to adjust activities in accordance with SO 2.1.  There is very close alignment between the ISC activity and SO 2.1, the approved Mission R-4, and the latest Six Month Work Plan prepared by ISC/Bulgaria.  Given ISC's experience on the ground in Bulgaria, their growing client base and understanding of the NGO terrain, and given a willingness to work jointly with NGO partners and USAID/Bulgaria on establishing the standards for future directions and performance, they would be a good choice to implement the changes in strategy and approach over the next several months.","Delivery order no. 7|Project title: Strengthening elections and political processes","Special Evaluation","Documents","AEP-5468-I-00-6012-00","","4/1/1997 12:00:00 AM","","Indigenous private voluntary organizations|Grants|Democracy|Institution building|Technical training|Civil society","Bulgaria","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABP229.pdf","4,882 KB","003970 - Management Systems International, Inc.

"PACR of a project (8/87-8/96) to increase the policy planning and implementation capacities of selected Government of Sri Lanka (GSL) agencies in areas important to the GSL's development strategy.  The project consisted of a policy studies/TA component and a participant training component. The policy studies/TA component financed 42 subprojects, 33 major policy studies, and 15 TA assignments. Under the participant training component, overseas training was provided to 190 GSL officials, of whom 3 received long-term training in monetary and credit policy and 7 received training for a period in excess of 12 months in the National Planning & National Incomes Analysis.  In addition, the project provided in-country training to 1,811 GSL personnel and on-the-job training to 936 others.  All trainees were drawn from agencies that were participating in policy formulation and implementation. By and large, the project achieved its objectives. The reforms that have been introduced in the GSL's monetary policy, budget management process, fiscal policy, industrial policy, along with the initiatives in privatization program, export promotion program, and capital market operations, can be linked to studies funded under the project.  The much needed consensus among the various agencies controlling irrigation systems on participatory management of irrigation systems by farmer organizations was also achieved as a result of activities funded under this project.  Also, the project funded the studies that identified the environment required for market-oriented interest rates in housing under a liberalized economy.  The participant training component has given the GSL the human resources needed to examine, introduce, and sustain policy and institutional reforms.  In light of the strong commitment by key officials in the various ministries assisted by the project, it is very likely that the major activities funded under the project will continue. The following lessons were learned.  (1) The process of designing the studies to be funded is important.  The studies having the greatest impact on policy reform are those that were undertaken after intensive design work by USAID and a core group of officials within a given GSL agency.  Housing sector studies and the Irrigation Management Policy Support Activity (IMPSA) studies are shining examples.  To ensure the implementation of study recommendations, a committed group of officials who are willing to articulate needs is an absolute must.  This kind of group must be identified at the design stage and mechanisms must be set in place to ensure that the consultants keep in close touch with the identified core group.  Further, the consultants should be required to meet with this group on a regular basis to spell out their findings and discuss future directions.  (2) Training should as far as possible be limited to areas identified by studies or to areas where TA is provided. The training that was linked to areas identified by studies had the greatest impact on policy reforms.  Given the high cost of overseas training, emphasis must be laid on the training of trainers.  (3) Follow-up with GSL agencies and the trainees, while difficult in light of the multiplicity of the studies undertaken under the project, is very important.  This follow-up must be carried out in an organized and timely basis, with the officer designated for the task required to report on the extent and content of the follow-up done in a given period.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","2/1/1997 12:00:00 AM","","Development policy|Policy analysis|Policy reform|Participants|Education for development|Government departments|Institution building|Personnel development","Sri Lanka","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABP246.pdf","2,270 KB","008606 - USAID.

"With the 1994 passage of the Popular Participation Law (PPL), propitious support for which has been provided by USAID's Democratic Decentralization and Citizen Participation project, Bolivia's bold experiment in democratic local governance (DLG) is off to a good start. For the first time in its history, the country has self-governing municipalities with popularly elected mayors, councils, and vigilance committees, and rural indigenous people are participating in local politics. This experiment raises several important issues.  Because the vigilance committees and their subunits, the community organizations, have close links with their constituents, they will, like those constituents, generally lack technical skills in planning and oversight. Further, because they are elected every 2 years, whatever expertise does accumulate will not necessarily last very long.  On the issue of inclusiveness, the PPL, by establishing so many small municipalities (311, with a median size of 8,400) and even smaller vigilance committees (representing about 3,000 people) and community organizations (representing about 450 people), ensures a political voice to any geographically concentrated group, including many formerly excluded indigenous strata and poorer urban areas. Another issue is governance and civil society.  Prior to the PPL, most local institutions were essentially governance structures, setting rules and resolving conflicts for their members, rather than civil bodies advocating for competing agendas.  This means that pluralistic politics is, for the most part, absent from the local scene.  Given the longstanding cultural bias for consensus over competition in matters of public governance, the development of civil society will be slow in coming; donor efforts could help accelerate it. A final issue concerns limits and reverses to decentralization. Bureaucratic decentralization has proven more difficult in some ways than its political counterpart.  For example, professionals such as teachers and physicians remain on the central government payroll even though their functions have been placed under local control, giving them divided loyalties.  There are also recognizable tendencies toward recentralization.  In particular, significant power has flowed to the department level and its head -- the presidentially appointed prefect -- in the form of resources for training, matching grants, and payrolls. Also, the council established to coordinate governmental activity throughout the department has no power to legislate or veto.  Lastly, administrative supervision for decentralization has been transferred to the Ministry of the Presidency, thus giving the president much more direct say in the process. Bolivia's experience with DLG inculcates lessons in three areas:  (1) Success factors.  Political will has been critical.  DLG initiatives work better when a pre-existing structure is incorporated into the new system.  Donor efforts planned in parallel with host country reforms in DLG can facilitate timely support. Local media can effectively promote civic education in DLG.  The benefits of decentralization under DLG can be equitable, though the pattern is not totally consistent. (2) Challenges.  Increases in participation seem easier for some marginal elements than for others, especially women.  A longstanding local governance structure does not necessarily imply a civil society infrastructure for DLG.  Fiscal autonomy can benefit some areas much more than others.  Real bureaucratic decentralization may be harder than its political equivalent.  Political decentralization can spawn counteractive centralizing tendencies.  (3) Puzzles.  What effect will parallel political structures -- mayors/councils, vigilance committees/community organizations, and single member districts -- have on democratic local governance?  Will political parties be constructive or destructive to DLG? How will traditional groups and institutions be incorporated into evolving DLG structures?

"Evaluates the Slovakia component of a project to solidify the long-term prospects for democracy in Central and Eastern Europe by strengthening indigenous public policy-oriented NGOs.  Interim evaluation covers the period 3/95-3/97.  The project is being implemented by the Foundation for a Civil Society. Implementation challenges have included clarifying the concept of ""public policy"" in a way that is pragmatically meaningful to Slovakia, whether to focus on core support or on projects, whether to offer support to a limited group of organizations or the NGO sector as a whole, whether to pursue a large grant policy to a few organizations or a small grant policy to many, the balance between Bratislava- and rural-based NGOs, the structure of the program cycle, and the operation of the Democracy Commission. Despite a weak donor base, a poor understanding of fundraising techniques, a lack of public advocacy skills, and a deficient legal and regulatory framework, Slovakia's NGO sector is generally dynamic and energetic, shows strong leadership and an impressive amount of associational activity, and has a growing sense of identity and an increasing appreciation of the potential role of the independent sector. Yet there are significant institutional deficiencies, including a thin executive structure, lack of middle management, limited analytical capacity, and dependence on foreign donors. With respect to specific organizational needs, Slovakian NGOs could benefit from a better understanding of the role and management of boards of directors, skills in financial modeling and strategy, and a stronger capacity to do strategic planning. Indigenous private sector support for the NGO sector is very limited and only beginning to emerge. However, there is no reason to conclude that habits of philanthropy are fundamentally at odds with Slovak culture and values.  The prospective level of future giving from local private sources will be a function of national economic growth and will reflect the learned capacity of the NGO sector to locate, cultivate, and access charitable support from corporations, individuals, and foundations.  While corporate giving can be important, long-run support is likely to come from individual donors. With regard to impact, the project's approach to the concept of public policy is appropriate given the condition of the NGO sector. Also, the project has led to a broadened understanding of the importance of advocacy and public policy, a deeper appreciation of the relevance of policy to program goals, and a shift in emphasis within the NGO sector toward an emphasis on public policy.  Individual grants demonstrate a link to systemic change, a positive impact on citizen participation, and show success in reaching into rural areas.  The subgrants appear to be well-timed, and the rigorous and professional selection process has had a very positive result. While there are pros and cons to a large grant strategy, it is critically important to provide management assistance.  A significant number of grantees have not formulated practical and realistic program plans and financial strategies to address the fall-off in funding once the project terminates.  Project gains are at risk unless considerable attention is devoted to helping recipients strengthen their organizational capacity and solidify their base of support. The key recommendation is that the project concentrate on institutional strengthening during balance of its life and work with a limited number of organizations that have already received a subgrants. Other recommendations are:  not to proceed with Round V; make existing subgrantees eligible for a follow-on grant; design an exit strategy and a program of organizational strengthening; place particular emphasis on the formulation of financial strategies; restructure and re-focus the training and TA program; terminate the voucher and mentor program; and consider a project extension if it can be demonstrated that a modest extension can improve subgrantee sustainability. An attachment to the report discusses several conceptual problems connected with the term ""sustainability"".

"Final evaluation of an onsite environmental sanitation program (7/95-7/97) implemented as part of a Housing Guaranty Project in two peri-urban communities in Montego Bay, Jamaica.  The Sanitation Support Unit (SSU) of the Construction Resource and Development Center (CRDC), a Jamaican NGO, was the implementing agency. CRDC/SSU developed technical and behavioral change strategies that significantly increased sanitary coverage and improved urban environmental conditions.  The technical strategy developed technologies that were both appropriate for site conditions and acceptable to individual lot holders, used private sector contractors for construction, and provided affordable solutions to environmental problems.  It is estimated that, by the end of the project, 620 families will be using new or improved sanitary facilities.  In addition, the project has reduced the flow or seepage of untreated wastewater through sinkholes into Montego Bay by an estimated 3,420 gallons per day. ""New"" untreated wastewater is also being prevented from entering the Bay; approximately 14,820 gallons of sewage per day are currently being disposed of in an environmentally acceptable manner. The behavioral change strategy, which complemented the technical strategy, was also successful.  A comparison of baseline and monitoring results showed substantial improvement in hygiene behaviors, especially in two of the behaviors considered most effective in preventing diarrheal diseases: handwashing and protection of drinking water.  In addition, behaviors were significantly changed not only by the presence of acceptable latrines, but also in usage of latrines by all family members over 5 years of age (a more valuable measure of hygiene).  With training in participatory methods, the program made effective use of carefully selected individuals to sensitize others in their community to environmental conditions and to facilitate their ability to make informed choices regarding sanitation and healthy behaviors.  Women have played an active role in the program as opinion leaders and promoters of positive health behaviors.  A key success of the program was providing community members the opportunity to secure loans to finance sanitary improvements that reduce environmental pollution and promote healthy living in their households and neighborhoods.  A considerable number of families assisted are headed by women. Finally, the CRDC's SSU office in Montego Bay has become financially self-sufficient and institutionally sustainable. In sum, the project was an excellent example of how an NGO can play a significant role in implementing a sanitation program.  The program itself demonstrated an effective model for providing basic urban environmental services to families living in poor peri-urban areas of Jamaica and could be replicated by CRDC in similar peri-urban areas throughout Jamaica if credit were to be made available to households for the construction of sanitary solutions.  Replication efforts should bear in mind the factors that made the project a success: involvement of the community in decisionmaking; creation of demand for better sanitation; teamwork between SSU's community officers and technical officers; effective monitoring; flexibility in implementation; integration of hardware and software approaches; provision of capital financing for hardware; charging of fees for services rendered; having SSU serve as facilitator rather than as implementor; and reception of CRDC/SSU of effective and consistent TA from international experts.","EHP activity no. 349-CC|Project title: Environmental health project (EHP)","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","HRN-5994-C-00-3036-00","","7/1/1997 12:00:00 AM","","Sewage systems|Public services|Sanitation engineering|Sanitation education|Human behavior|Behavior change|Hygiene|Environmental health|Indigenous private voluntary organizations|Rural urban fringe|Community participation","Jamaica","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABP318.pdf","398 KB","000333 - Camp Dresser and McKee, Inc.

"Evaluates the TA and training component of a project to develop the capacity of India's capital markets to mobilize and allocate capital (FIRE project). Interim evaluation covers the period 11/94-1/97.  The component is being implemented by Price Waterhouse. The FIRE project has been highly successful to date, and its impact on Indian financial institutional development is clear and impressive. Technical consultants have been highly qualified, experienced in the issues faced by emerging markets, sensitive to other cultures, and effective in achieving desired goals. Special achievements are noted below. (1) FIRE consultants have worked with the Indian securities regulatory agency, the Securities Exchange Board of India (SEBI), to develop regulations and codes for stock brokers, mutual funds, and merchant bankers.  FIRE consultants have assisted SEBI to develop courses, tests, and licensing procedures to qualify stock brokers for certification.  (2) Through FIRE's influence and TA, the concept of self-regulation is gaining acceptance by securities professionals and SEBI. Brokers, mutual fund managers, and merchant bankers have formed member associations.  (3) FIRE has worked with SEBI and the stock exchanges to develop surveillance and enforcement techniques.  In addition, the stock exchanges in Bombay and Delhi and the association for the mutual fund industry are committed to providing information to public investors on a consistent basis and in a form that will be useful to them.  (4)  FIRE has provided training, seminars, and workshops for key financial personnel, benefitting the organizations for which they work through improved performance at higher levels of sophistication. At the strategic objective level, there are indications that India's capital markets are becoming increasingly efficient in mobilizing capital as measured by increases in the number and value of shares traded or changes in the number of issuers and investors.  However, criteria of this kind do not serve as adequate measures of the effectiveness of an institution-building project such as this, and cannot be proven to be directly related to the activities of the project.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","4/1/1997 12:00:00 AM","","Capital markets|Financial institutions|Institution building|Certification","India","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABP334.pdf","4,159 KB","000241 - Louis Berger International, Inc.

"Final evaluation of a project to strengthen the capacity of NGOs and NGO networks to support AIDS prevention and control (the AIDS initiative) over the period 3/94-2/97.  The project was implemented by the National Council for International Health (NCIH). The NCIH/AIDS program has met nearly all objectives and has expanded and substantially improved the primary functions of an international PVO network for AIDS financed under previous grants.  NCIH/AIDS has been a visible and supportive component of the AIDS Technical Support Program (ATSP) and its members. AIDSLINK is a unique and well appreciated newsletter with satisfied readership both within and far beyond the AIDS community.  The NCIH network database is now much more complete and useful.  Expanded NCIH E-mail capacity allows for frequent use of the database, rapid responses to network queries for information, and a ""modern"" means to gather information from around the world for policy and decisionmaking purposes.  The annual workshop, seminars, and less formal meetings organized by NCIH/AIDS have focused on important topics of interest to network members but have also brought together communities and interest groups that do not normally work together.  Finally, NCIH/AIDS has aggressively represented its membership and promoted their views to policymakers and influential leaders in Washington and in international fora with demonstrably positive results. Results are more mixed in meeting the new program objective of strengthening NGO network capacity. NCIH provided timely assistance to fledgling NGO networks and developed positive and trusting relationships with sensitivity.  NCIH support was effective in preparing funding proposals and providing access to donors; co-sponsoring or facilitating conferences, workshops, and strategic planning meetings; and publicizing the very existence and work of these new networks and their programs. NCIH also provided effective leadership in forming temporary and sometimes permanent coalitions of networks to address common PVO and NGO issues and to gain access to international decisionmakers.  NCIH was less successful in providing or facilitating traditional ""capacity building"" support to these networks as envisaged in the grant proposal. Successful NCIH support has been more as ""extended network support"" than capacity building, in part because the former is what NCIH knows and does well as an association.  There has been little success in using PVOs to transfer capacity building skills to these regional networks. At this point it is difficult to know how sustainable these regional networks will be or what their roles will be in the future.  Their positive relationships with NCIH are somewhat undercut by a total project staff turnover within the last year.  And unfortunately, NCIH has been unsuccessful in its first attempt to become a financial intermediary between USAID and a regional network -- potentially an important step in solidifying USAID financial support for some network activities. NCIH/AIDS leadership and staff have been extremely energetic, innovative, and resourceful in carrying out a large number of key home office functions as well as in expanding relationships and program activities around the world.  Impressive accomplishments have been achieved amid heavy turnover and periodic vacancies in the small staff of three.  Recent board and executive leadership interest in attracting and retaining more experienced staff at NCIH is very welcome. NCIH's improved financial health would help to relieve tension between NCIH and project staff.  NCIH leadership should strive to agree upon organizational objectives that encompass both the traditional NCIH services to its broad international health network and special project or disease-specific objectives, such as AIDS and Women's Reproductive Health.  NCIH should explore opportunities for core staff to provide support to the AIDS program in areas such as electronic network operation and maintenance, fundraising, workshop logistics and planning, and newsletter production. USAID project management had been quite positive and supportive until recent staff turnover. However, USAID is probably as much at fault as NCIH in the extraordinary delay in finalizing the Asia Pacific Council of AIDS Service Organizations (APCASO) subgrant.

"Evaluates support provided under a cooperative agreement to the National Council for International Health (NCIH) for six annual conferences over the period 1994-1999.  This midterm evaluation covers the period 4/95-4/97. NCIH is confronted with management and financial challenges that threaten its well-being and cast doubt on its ability to consistently achieve conference objectives.  Membership levels have lagged, and revenues have fallen.  The situation may be described as serious, if not critical.  Vigorous leadership is required to set in motion the creative and dynamic steps needed to address these challenges.  The new Board leadership has begun this process, but success is by no means assured. The conferences have addressed important international health (IH) issues, and are generally well regarded and valued by attendees. However, attendance has varied, generally falling short of expectations, and a significant number of attendees are nonpaying, which raises conference costs. The conferences serve a range of USAID interests.  USAID should continue its support at current levels for the remainder of the life of the Agreement, subject to NCIH's development of viable approaches to resolving its outstanding problems.  Further, more modest support should be contingent upon NCIH's continued progress in resolving its problems and generate alternative sources of revenue. Given the lack of available data, it is not possible reliably to measure the contributions the conferences have made to public awareness of international health issues, or the influence they have had on important policy issues.  NCIH has made some contribution to greater awareness in the United States and Congress of international health issues, such as infectious diseases, and has contributed its voice to others seeking to influence foreign aid levels and other resource allocations.  NCIH should design and utilize instruments to provide some measure of the organization's impact, and develop strategies to achieve awareness and policy impact objectives.

"Final evaluation of a program (2/95-2/97) to train health care training, supervisory, and service delivery personnel in primary health care (PHC) skills and management as a means of facilitating implementation of the forthcoming Equity health project (6740320) in South Africa. The program has accomplished its objective and set the stage for strengthened and institutionalized PHC training programs within the provinces.  Training planning, under the auspices of the Bridging Working Group, joined individuals from diverse parts of the health sector, including teaching institutions, provincial and district government agencies, NGOs, and the private sector, and resulted in the development of a training curricula that has trained PHC personnel as trainers of trainers (TOTs), regional trainers, facilitators, mentors, preceptors, and frontline PHC providers.  By-products of this training are the creation of a province-wide training infrastructure essential for the implementation of distance-based learning (DBL), and a cadre of experts on training module development. However, the project was not without implementation problems.  These included inconsistent selection of TOTs and mentors, the fact that participants often had to provide there own transportation, the lack of a liaison person at the national level, and a lack of coordination of the training efforts between the Human Resource Development (HRD) and PHC Directorates in the Eastern Cape.  Further, the intensity and depth of the training did not allow adequate time for the TOTs to develop and practice their skills as teachers/trainers; further support and supervision is needed as they assume their role as trainers of others within their regions. In many districts, training policies and structures had not yet been established so that newly trained TOTs were not able to practice their new skills.  Finally, an accreditation policy for Bridging Training Activities has not yet been developed.  Relatedly, the TOTs have not been evaluated on their individual performance, a step necessary in the pursuit of accreditation. Key lessons learned as follows.  (1) The successful mechanism of the Bridging Working Group, which forged a strong alliance of individuals from diverse parts of the health sector, should be incorporated into the proposed District Health Training Committees.  (2) The training modules, composed of a mix of intensive participatory training in a classroom and on-site training in the clinic, was a valuable methodology that allowed instruction as well as hands on learning and problem solving.  (3) The DBL concept, consisting of self-study modules, clinical skill check lists, self-evaluations, and supportive material, was an excellent model that could be used throughout the provinces. Integration of this concept into the comprehensive PHC skills course helped alleviate problems with training capacity between regions and districts.  (4) The training courses were practical and community based, which demonstrated to participants the value of community participation.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","674-0318-C-00-6091-00","","5/1/1997 12:00:00 AM","","Primary health care|Human capacity development|Training personnel|Supervisors|Paramedical education|Health professional education","South Africa","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABP437.pdf","1,991 KB","","","008605 - USAID.

"Reviews, for the period 1992-97, the role of the U.S.-Asia Environmental Partnership (USAEP) in promoting environmentally sustainable development in high economic growth areas of Asia. Individual sections examine:  the continuing relevance of the organizing premises for the Partnership and the rationale for a continuing USAID engagement in Asia, and four specific aspects of USAEP operations:  its definition of the development problem; its geographical focus; the place it accords trade; and whether it is results-oriented. Stated summarily, the review concludes that the Partnership has correctly defined an important development issue -- the opportunity for a ""clean revolution"" in Asia.  It is operating in the right set of countries, although China and Vietnam should be included, with the right mix of U.S. interests and partners, to which the U.S. Department of State and the foreign policy establishment could be added.  However, to reach its goals, the Partnership must (1) adopt a pro-active and more extensive operational approach, focusing on energy and urbanization in addition to industrialization; (2) enrich its technology transfer activities to embrace process innovation, information dissemination, and international technology cooperation; and (3) dramatically increase the number of Asian partners.

"To what extent did U.S. food aid -- totaling $1.8 billion from 1954 through 1994 -- contribute to Indonesia's economic success in the last 30 years?  The answer to this question varies across three distinct time periods.  From 1954 through 1965, during President Sukarno's tenure, there is no evidence food aid helped improve Indonesia's economy. However, during the early Soeharto period (1966-73), food aid played a major role in supporting the reform efforts of the new president's economic team and substantially helped augment Indonesia's hard currency reserves.  Food aid again became marginal after 1974, when Indonesia's oil revenues increased. The benefits of economic growth have been widely shared in Indonesia, and the Soeharto government's growth strategy was central to this achievement.  Its highest priorities were to increase food production, maintain stable rice prices (at a level higher than world prices), and invest in rural infrastructure.  Initially, the beneficiaries were poor smallholders, largely rice producers; over time, the majority of low-income people benefitted. Indonesia under Soeharto refused to resort to deficit financing. That meant that local currency generated from Title I sales provided critical additional spending for development purposes. Had these funds not been available, the development budget would have been reduced by a like amount -- as much as one third in the early 1970s.  Much of that money was invested in activities with a high payoff (green revolution technology together with irrigation facilities and rural roads) that led to increased rice yields. The Title II food-for-work program was also successful.  It supported labor-intensive rural infrastructure development in the late 1960s and early 1970s.  These village-based activities encouraged public investment that favored poor people and poor areas.  As a result, Indonesia's peripheral regions felt they were participating in the country's overall development.  When oil revenues began pouring in during the mid-1970s, this model was transformed into the ""Inpres"" program, a government-supported cash-for-work program.  This major effort has been credited with creating rural prosperity by generating income and by improving infrastructure. In Indonesia, rice is critical to political stability.  In 1965, rice production in Java was no higher than before World War II, and per capita rice consumption had fallen 15% since 1960.  U.S. rice provided under P.L. 480 in the precarious post-Sukarno years was vital.  It helped close the cereals gap and maintain rice price stability.  On the down side, the direct impact of U.S. food aid on child malnutrition appears limited, except in the most severe cases. However, food aid may have helped indirectly improve nutritional status of children under 5 with mild to moderate malnutrition by encouraging mothers to attend integrated village health posts. Several lessons can be learned from the experience of U.S. food assistance in Indonesia.  (1) Food aid can make a significant contribution to sustainable development when provided in support of a sound macroeconomic environment.  (2) Local currency generated from the sale of food aid can contribute to sustainable development when the money is used to support a sound, development-oriented budget or when qualified NGOs use the money to fund high-priority development activities.  (3) When political stability in the short run depends on an adequate food supply at reasonable prices, food aid can provide the critical margin.  (4) Food aid can be an important vehicle for supporting growth strategies and public resource transfers that differentially benefit lower income groups.  (5) In the short term, food aid appeared to contribute indirectly to nutritional improvement by stimulating attendance at community health posts in poor communities. (6) Food aid is not always a reliable source of food; some food aid commodities, unknown in the recipient country, may be accepted only reluctantly.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1997 12:00:00 AM","","USAID|Food aid programs|Food for Peace Title I|Food for Peace Title II|Food for Work|Economic development|Political development|Economic reform|Economic impact|Social impact|Political aspects|Political stability","Indonesia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNABY236.pdf","342 KB","008058 - USAID.

"The P.L. 480 program in Bangladesh, the second largest in the Agency, has been the country's largest source of food aid since its independence from Pakistan, providing over $2.3 billion of food from 1972 through 1994, about 41% of the total amount of food that Bangladesh received in that period.  Of this amount, 71% was program food aid (mainly Title III); much of the rest was project food aid (Title II) that supported what grew to become one of the largest food-for-work (FFW) efforts in the world.  This report assesses the economic, political, and social effects of the program and identifies its beneficiaries. The multi-year Title III program has focused on promoting food security through policy reform. Specific reforms have included targeting the country's food distribution system more closely on the poor and providing production incentives to farmers by stabilizing food price fluctuations within a relatively narrow range. Of the Title II FFW programs, road construction has been the mainstay. The impact of this assistance has been substantial.  Since the mid-1980s, the feared food grain gap has diminished, thanks in part to the policy reforms supported by the program and first-class monitoring by USAID and the World Bank.  Equally importantly, food aid represented a significant resource for a country suffering severe shortages in virtually all resources. P.L. 480 was especially critical from independence in 1971 to 1987, when it equaled more than 10% of the country's export earnings. U.S. food aid also contributed to the sharp decline, from 92% in 1974 to 48% in 1992, in the incidence of poverty in Bangladesh.  The program has provided seasonal employment to landless laborers under a CARE-administered FFW program; developed much of the country's rural roads network, thereby increasing both agricultural and off-farm incomes as well as access to family planning and health services and primary schools; and financed agricultural research that contributed to major productivity gains in agriculture and a 47% reduction in real rice prices from 1975 to 1994.  Food aid has also improved food consumption, though it is difficult to demonstrate any significant impact on children's nutritional status.  Finally, the program has clearly benefitted the poor by supporting reforms that redirected  subsidized public food distribution to them, by implementing FFW efforts in relatively poor geographic regions, and by supplying a food commodity -- wheat -- which tends to be bought by the poor rather than by the rich. The Bangladesh experience offers several important lessons.  It demonstrates that food aid can provide the basis for policy dialogue on issues critical to achieving food security.  That is partly because it reduces the risk of undertaking politically sensitive changes in food policy.  It confirms that sound policy analysis is fundamental to successful policy reform.  It illustrates how food aid can be successfully targeted not only to reach the poor, but also to avoid reaching the rich.  It also shows how food aid and the local currency generated from the sale of food can be used to support public sector activities needed to boost food production, improve access to social services, and reduce poverty. Although food aid is a relatively inefficient vehicle for funding activities that require cash, this is a moot point when such aid is the only resource available.  Although in theory FFW projects can achieve short-term relief and long-term development simultaneously, this rarely occurs in practice.  Finally, although food aid can discourage domestic grain production, policy changes associated with food aid can enhance production -- more than offsetting the minimally depressing effects of the imports.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1997 12:00:00 AM","","Food aid programs|USAID|Social impact|Economic impact|Policy reform|Food policy|Food security|Employment|Food for Peace Title I|Food for Peace Title II|Food for Peace Title III|Conditionality|Economic reform|Food for work|Food aid monetization","Bangladesh","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNABY242.pdf","422 KB","008058 - USAID.

"Evaluates the Women's Studies Project (WSP), to support research on the impact on women of family planning (FP) programs and methods, and to incorporate women's perspectives into FP and related reproductive health programs.  The project is being implemented by Family Health International (FHI).  The evaluation covers the period 9/93-9/97 against a PACD of 9/98. In terms of technical accomplishments, the WSP is well on its ways to achieving its objectives. While not employed to its full potential, the WSP conceptual framework has increased understanding of the WSP and served as a tool for organizing research strategies and dissemination. The research program will likely contribute to the understanding of the impact of FP programs on women and in bringing women's perspectives to bear.  The quality of the data and analysis is high, research methodologies have been sound and often innovative, and research validity has been enhanced by the integration of qualitative and quantitative findings. The impact of the research may have been lessened, however, because research strategies at the country level have not been clarified.  In addition, the project expended some resources on secondary analyses that were not in accord with WSP objectives, which may have been counterproductive. Assessments of the TA provided researchers and others involved in the studies are highly positive. Considerable success has been made in working with women's organizations at the country level; WSP participants now focus more on gender issues.  However, the project design underestimated the importance and complexity of working with women's advocacy organizations, especially at the U.S. and international levels.  WSP will need to continue to reach out to these core constituencies and develop consensus on major issues.  Due to budget cuts, insufficient attention (only 10% of project resources) is being devoted to dissemination.  This is unfortunate, since lessons learned regarding the project's implementation are likely to have as great an impact as research results.  Also, the availability of WSP data sets and instruments would allow further dissemination of WSP products and longer-term impact. WSP suffers from several design problems. First, the project may be too complex in that it has multiple and disparate objectives -- such as obtaining credible research results vs. building research capacity, and assessing impact on women vs. integrating women's perspectives and empowering women -- without a clear, functional definition of their relative importance and relationship.  The project might have been more effective by limiting its objectives, particularly since it aims at innovation.  Second, there is no consensus on how innovative the project or the means to accomplish its purpose are supposed to be, or on what level of risk (e.g., of working with untried partner organizations) is to be taken in implementing the project.  These ambiguities, which have led to differing expectations of the project, might have been mitigated by greater consultation between USAID and organizations with interest and expertise in the subject area, and by transparency in the design and selection process.  Third, the failure to articulate the distinctions between impact on women and women's empowerment and between women and gender has caused various problems.  It is very difficult to incorporate these distinctions post hoc.  Finally, insufficient time and resources were allotted to deal with the complexities of the project. Overall, however, the WSP is functioning remarkably well, thanks to considerable flexibility, staff skill, and effective oversight and advisory mechanisms and management processes.  Communication, decisionmaking, and reporting processes also work well. The use of in-country advisory committees (IACs) has been particularly effective, and it has been found that local secretariats can also be an effective means of both oversight and capacity building.","POPTECH project [i.e. report] number 97-103-055|Project title: Population technical assistance (POPTECH)","Special Evaluation","Documents","CCP-3024-Q-00-3012-00","","9/1/1997 12:00:00 AM","","Family planning research|Women|Women in development|Impact assessment|Gender analysis|Development program planning","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABP615.pdf","153 KB","008485 - Basic Health Management International (BHM)|001131 - The Futures Group International, Inc.

"Final evaluation of a subproject, part of the Promoting Financial Investments and Transfers (PROFIT) project, to expand usage of modern contraceptives through the private sector in Romania. Specific objectives were to increase the knowledge and use of modern contraceptive methods among those between 15-24 years old, and increase the use of private pharmacies as a source of modern contraceptive methods. The evaluation covers the period 10/95-9/97. PROFIT contracted a Romanian research organization to study private pharmacists' management practices, their knowledge of and attitudes toward family planning, and their level of interest in receiving training and displaying promotional materials. Face-to-face interviews were conducted with a representative sample of 597 pharmacists who managed private pharmacies, and six focus groups with a total of 49 pharmacists were held.  Data from these sources served as a baseline to measure the success of the program and to design training and promotional activities with pharmacies.  PROFIT also used the quantitative data collected about the pharmacists as part of the 1994 USAID-sponsored assessment. PROFIT contracted a Romanian public relations firm to conduct an information, education, and communication (IEC) campaign targeted to Romania's urban youth.  The firm conducted formative research with target audience members to help design the campaign, which combined interpersonal and mass media communication channels.  PROFIT also developed and pretested a training curriculum and materials for pharmacists' training, the first session of which was conducted in Bucharest near the end of the year.  In addition, PROFIT developed a pharmacist's guide that included the major elements of the training curriculum for distribution to all private pharmacists in Romania, along with the marketing guide which pharmacists had requested.  The PROFIT Country Representative worked with the National Pharmacists' Association (NPA) as well as university departments of pharmacy throughout the country. Three main conclusions can be drawn from PROFIT's experience in Romania.  (1) The subproject's success was due in large part to the Country Representative's experience with USAID, knowledge of the private sector, and commitment to reproductive health issues.  (2) PROFIT's collaboration with the NPA and university departments of pharmacy gave credibility to the program and allowed it to utilize the existing nationwide organizational structure to facilitate implementation of its activities.  (3) There was a great demand for information and education about modern contraceptive methods among both pharmacists and young adults. The following lessons were learned.  (1) The use of staff with commercial experience can be very useful in commercial sector development projects.  (2) Working closely with respected professional organizations and individuals can provide credibility and resources for development activities.  (3) The training of trainers (TOT) model, involving the use of local trainers, can provide credibility and resources, and can help provide more opportunities for follow up.  (4) Collecting baseline and follow-up data related to training may be difficult if there is significant distrust of government or if appropriate record-keeping systems are not in place.  (5) Using in-country research organizations may involve providing extensive technical monitoring and assistance.  (6) It is important to communicate with doctors and to solicit their support for activities with other health professionals.","Project title: Promoting financial investments and transfers|(PROFIT)","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","DPE-3056-C-00-1040-00","","9/1/1997 12:00:00 AM","","Family planning promotion programs|IEC|Beneficiary targeting|Commercial retail sale of contraceptives|Health professional education|Pharmacists|Pharmacies|Youth","Romania","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABP640.pdf","73 KB","007893 - Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu International","","008234 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of a subproject (9/95-1/97), implemented under the Promoting Financial Investments and Transfers (PROFIT) Project, to increase the private provision of contraceptive services, as well as the demand for such services, in Zimbabwe. The subproject included initiatives to increase the role, respectively, of doctors, employers, nurse/midwives, and pharmacies in providing contraceptive services; to increase client demand for private services through the medical aid insurance sector, and then through consumers; and a dialogue between the public and private sectors on the availability to the private sector of appropriately priced commodities. A nationwide information, education, and communication (IEC) campaign was designed to motivate people who can afford to pay to seek services from private providers. Although this subproject is relatively new, some of the strengths of its approach are already evident.  Ensuring the availability and affordability of contraceptive commodities was identified as crucial to the success of the subproject; PROFIT identified the factors that prevent appropriately priced contraceptives from being readily available to private providers and developed a strategy to alleviate those obstacles.  Also, PROFIT has systematically involved beneficiaries of the subproject in its design, implementation, and evaluation. For example, the pharmacy initiative was developed in conjunction with the Retail Pharmacists' Association, and the work-based initiative was designed by a working group of occupational nurse/midwives responsible for health services offered by companies.  Similarly, a working group comprised of private doctors planned the training program for doctors, and focus group discussions were organized with nurse/midwives to identify the opportunities and obstacles for them to expand or establish private practices.  This participatory method has ensured that activities have met the needs of beneficiaries, who have eagerly received the project's services: the number of applicants for the various training workshops has far exceeded the available spaces, and the participants' evaluations of the workshops has repeatedly emphasized their relevance and convenience, as they are held on weekends to accommodate work schedules. Another element that has enhanced the effectiveness of the subproject has been the continuing dialogue between the public and private sectors. Besides the Coordinating Committee, PROFIT has organized other opportunities for continuing this dialogue, including a Commodities Workshop.

"Because of dwindling resources, development donors are finding it necessary to phase out support of population programs in those countries that have achieved a relatively high level of contraceptive prevalence. Because phasing out often means an end to donated contraceptives, donors need to be concerned with minimizing the negative impact of withdrawing support and ensuring a sustainable source of affordable contraceptives for the poor families they have served. USAID found itself in such a situation in Brazil. Because of declining USAID funding in general and Brazil's advance in contraceptive prevalence, in 1991 USAID resolved to phase out its population program in the country by 2000.  This paper describes how that phaseout was determined, how the Commodities Procurement Organization (CEPEO) -- the for-profit company that was selected to implement the phaseout strategy -- was created; and how CEPEO was implemented and operated. Finally, to assist others in phaseouts of international family planning programs, the paper outlines the essential lessons learned as USAID launched, implemented, and completed the phase-out process.

"Final evaluation of a subproject (6/93-5/97) of the Promoting Financial Investments and Transfers (PROFIT) Project to help UNIMED Maceio, a health maintenance organization (HMO) in Brazil, to establish a maternal and child health/family planning (MCH/FP) clinic at the Hospital of Sao Sebastiao (CSSS), located in Northeastern Brazil. In 6/93, PROFIT and UNIMED Maceio jointly purchased the CSSS.  By owning a hospital, UNIMED Maceio hoped to better control costs and reduce payments to third-party providers.  The savings were to be used to support MCH/FP activities.  If successful, the project would be a model for the other 195 chapters of the UNIMED HMO throughout Brazil. An 11/93 baseline survey of female members of the UNIMED HMO revealed a high contraceptive prevalence.  To have an impact, PROFIT recommended that the MCH/FP clinic be promoted to low-income women.  The clinic's opening was delayed for almost 2 years due to: UNIMED Maceio's resistance to include low-income women in the clinic's target market; the lowered priority of the clinic in the face of economic pressures; UNIMED Maceio physicians' fear of competition from the new clinic; and a lack of interest in FP on the part of newly elected UNIMED Maceio management. Since its opening in 9/95, the clinic has offered obstetrical and gynecological (OB/GYN) consultations, diagnostic services, FP services, and vaccinations.  As of 4/96, 216 clients had received OB/GYN consultations, and 148 clients had received FP services.  Compared with the general population in northeastern Brazil, the clinic's clients have fewer children and higher contraceptive use. Due to the subproject's implementation problems and the partner's unwillingness to operate the MCH/FP clinic in a way that would allow for any FP impact, PROFIT and USAID decided that PROFIT should divest its 49% share of CSSS.  On 2/7/97, UNIMED agreed to buy PROFIT out for $1.5 million, to be paid over 36 months. Several lessons were learned.  (1) Baseline market research should be done before any investment is made in order to determine the potential FP impact and feasibility of reaching the target market.  (2) A thorough understanding of the partner's power structure and the incentives and motivations of stakeholders will help identify barriers and obstacles to the achievement of the subproject's goals.  (3) A cooperative has some characteristics that can make it a riskier subproject partner, specifically:  regular changes in leadership through elections; the need for a majority vote for major decisions; and the fact that cooperative members, being owners, have more power than employees to influence top management.  (4) FP activities do not require large capital expenditures.  (5) Holding a minority equity position generally puts the investor at a disadvantage, and PROFIT has avoided joint ventures as a result of this experience.  (6) Negotiated contracts should include a shareholder agreement specifically delineating the project's goals and a detailed divestment process through which the investor can withdraw from the venture if the partner does not comply with the shareholder agreement. (7) A stable economy -- in particular, a favorable legal and regulatory environment, monetary stability, and an established business environment -- is decisive in ensuring the viability of commercial FP subprojects.

"Final evaluation of a subproject (7/94-7/97) of the Promoting Financial Investments and Transfers (PROFIT) project to establish a commercial company, the Contraceptive Procurement Organization (CEPEO), to supply high-quality, affordable contraceptives to the public and private sectors and to NGOs in view of the phase out of USAID population assistance to Brazil by the year 2000.  PROFIT implemented the subproject with assistance from SOMARC and Pathfinder International. CEPEO is a small company that sells IUDs and other contraceptives through public sector commodity bids and sales to NGOs and private doctors. IUDs represent over 80% of sales, followed by condoms, diaphragms, and spermicidal jelly.  CEPEO's principal market is the public sector, which represents 75% of sales.  Between 3/95 and 6/97, 129,508 IUDs were sold, generating 453,278 CYPs (couple years of protection). Implementation of CEPEO evolved through three phases:  design (5/92-12/93); pre-operational implementation (1/94-3/95); and subsidized operations (3/95-present).  Pre-operational implementation took a year longer than expected due to complex company and product registration procedures and difficulties in hiring a general manager.  CEPEO's product line was modified during this phase to focus on IUDs because pills and condoms were widely available through other commercial and donor sources. CEPEO accomplished its short-term goals, selling more IUDs per year to social sector clients than USAID was donating per year. CEPEO also maintained a lower price per IUD than its competitors. CEPEO is surpassing its revenue targets, and losses have been lower than projected; the company is expected to break even in 1997, on schedule with original projections. In accord with its long-term plans, CEPEO has also added four new products and doubled its higher-margin IUD sales to private physicians.  In 1997, as agreed with USAID, PROFIT managed the sale of CEPEO to local investors. Several lessons were learned about establishing a commercial supplier of contraceptives to address phase-out of donated contraceptives:  (1) Choice of a commercial supplier requires careful analysis of market niches, evidence that social sector organizations are willing and able to pay for contraceptive commodities, and a detailed financial analysis that demonstrates a potential for self-sustainability.  (2) Successfully implementing this strategy requires hiring staff with appropriate skills and experience, providing flexible funding to cover start-up costs and ongoing cash shortfalls, and providing close supervision and TA to guide and support the company through the start-up phase.  (3) Start-up of a commercial company in a developing country is time-consuming, a fact that must be factored into planning.","Project title: Promoting financial investments and transfers|(PROFIT)","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","DPE-3056-C-00-1040-00","","8/1/1997 12:00:00 AM","","Commercial retail sale of contraceptives|Private enterprises|Subsidies|Institution building","Brazil","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABP644.pdf","94 KB","007893 - Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu International","","008234 - USAID.

"Final evaluation (4/96-8/97) of the Community-Based Social Marketing (CBSM) program in Madras, Tamil Nadu, India.  The program, a subproject of the Promoting Financial Investments and Transfers (PROFIT) project, was designed to distribute exclusive brands of condoms and sanitary napkins through private entrepreneurs using a multilevel marketing approach, and was implemented by International Family Health (IFH) and Y.R. Gaitonde Center for AIDS Research and Education (YRG CARE). The CBSM program was launched with much publicity in late June 1997, after a 6-month delay due, in part, to the difficulty of retaining a project manager.  However, the momentum was derailed by a robbery attempt at CBSM facilities, resulting in the death of a security agent, and by the one-month delay in the delivery of 350,000 condoms by the London Rubber Company. Both events had a negative impact on staff morale and project credibility.  Nonetheless, the CBSM program has made significant progress.  In the program's first 2 months, 245 entrepreneurs were trained in family planning communications, and 78 joined the CBSM club.  Reports from these members show that some have recruited up to 5 new entrepreneurs.  There is overall reason for optimism based on the positive public response to the program. The subproject has achieved its most important immediate objective, which was to enable the implementation of an innovative contraceptive distribution program.  IFH has a commitment from another donor for funding of the CBSM operations, contingent on IFH securing funding for the development phase.  PROFIT's funding ensured that this program was implemented. Two lessons can be gleaned from the CBSM experience, thus far.  The first is that applying heavy pressure on implementing organizations does not necessarily hasten implementation, but may instead lead the implementing organization to be less candid about existing and potential problems and less likely to request additional resources or input to develop appropriate solutions.  In addition, relying on one key manager may be unwise because his or her departure will cause implementation delays.","Project title: Promoting financial investments and transfers|(PROFIT)","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","DPE-3056-C-00-1040-00","","9/1/1997 12:00:00 AM","","Community based delivery|Social marketing|Private sector|Privatization|Entrepreneurs|Contraceptive distribution|Entrepreneurship|Business formation","India","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABP645.pdf","60 KB","007893 - Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu International","","008234 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of a subproject (9/95-9/97) of the Promoting Financial Investments and Transfers (PROFIT) project to assist the State Innovations in Family Planning Services Agency (SIFPSA) of Uttar Pradesh, India, in developing employer-based family planning (FP) programs.  SIFPSA implements the Innovations in FP Services (IFPS) project. PROFIT focused its efforts in Kanpur, where its FP specialist is based, while assisting other employer-based programs upon request.  To some programs, PROFIT provided only implementation assistance, which included developing and conducting baseline surveys and establishing monitoring systems, and recruiting and training staff members and volunteers.  In other programs, PROFIT identified and initiated contact with potential partners, and worked closely with them to motivate their involvement in FP through program design, proposal preparation, and program implementation. PROFIT successfully met its objectives, playing an important part in developing and providing TA for five employer-based programs, and providing TA to three additional programs:  the Uttar Pradesh Industrial Estate Manufacturers Association (UPIEMA), Kanpur; the Super Tannery India Ltd. (STIL), Kanpur; Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI), Kanpur; GIANTS, Noida; Mawana Sugar Works (MSW), Meerut; PHD Family Welfare Foundation, Ghaziabad, Sahibabad, and Modinagar; and PHD Family Welfare Foundation and Rampur Chamber of Commerce, Rampur; and Workshop: Role of Private Sector Employers in Family Welfare Programs, Allahabad. That the programs have been operational for only 1-14 months and that neither SIFPSA nor the implementing organizations provide regular reports to PROFIT make it difficult to draw conclusions about the long-term outcomes of PROFIT's work.  Nonetheless, several lessons were learned:  (1) Employers need a long period of education, information, and motivation to make a decision to implement a FP family planning and integrated health program. To some degree, their hesitation can be overcome through persistent efforts, but patience is required.  (2) Working with associations, while a good way to reach small and medium-scale employers, can be complex, since associations generally rely on group decisionmaking and lack individual accountability.  (3) Employers are more willing to participate in smaller programs, which require a lower level of management and financial commitment.  (4) It is difficult to motivate employers to take on community-based outreach services, as these activities do not provide immediate benefits to them or their employees.  (5) It is important that employers communicate their support for FP to their employees.  (6) Targeting those companies that are already providing health and other social services to their employees may be more successful, because these companies already have demonstrated a commitment to the welfare of their employees.","Project title: Promoting financial investments and transfers|(PROFIT)","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","DPE-3056-C-00-1040-00","","9/1/1997 12:00:00 AM","","Family planning promotion programs|Employer based delivery|Technical assistance","India","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABP646.pdf","66 KB","007893 - Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu International","","008234 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of a subproject (4/95-8/97) of the Promoting Financial Investments and Transfers (PROFIT) Project to establish a $1 million Revolving Loan Fund to help Indonesian midwives expand their private practices.  The program worked closely with the Indonesian Midwives Association (IBI), Bank Rakyat Indonesia (BRI), the country's largest micro-lending institution, and the National Family Planning Coordination Board (BKKBN) in 50 districts in West, Central, and East Java, and in Jakarta and Bali. The subproject achieved its objectives: the Loan Fund has provided 538 loans to borrowers who have used the money to expand or establish private practices. The high repayment rate (just one borrower has defaulted) allows the funds to be re-lent to other midwives. Lending will be sustained after PROFIT departure in 9/97: due to continued strong demand for loans and a high level of enthusiasm from the partners, PROFIT and USAID granted its initial capital contribution to a local foundation, Yayasan Bhakti Kencana (YBK), which, along with BKKBN, and IBI, will jointly manage the fund.  BRI will continue to capitalize half of the loans.  It is still too early to determine the longer-term outcomes of the Loan Fund, but the borrowers are contributing to an increase in new contraceptive acceptors and a shift of clients from the public to the private sector.  The program's most unique achievement was its ability to establish a sustainable collaboration among three very different partners. Several lessons can be drawn from Fund's experience.  (1) A realistic timeframe and appropriate tools are required to measure results.  (2) It is important to have committed partners with a full range of skills and interests.  (3) A realistic assessment of each partner's capabilities, objectives, and overall organizational structure allows potential weaknesses to be addressed through appropriate subproject design.  (4) Support from a committed and influential partner can be a critical ingredient for success.  (5) A financial institution with experience in small-scale lending and extensive market coverage eases the process of loan processing and disbursement.  (6) Endorsement from a well-established and -regarded professional association lends credibility to the subproject.  (7) Communicating consistent information to all levels of partner organizations can prevent implementation problems.","Project title: Promoting financial investments and transfers|(PROFIT)","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","DPE-3056-C-00-1040-00","","9/1/1997 12:00:00 AM","","Capital assistance|Revolving fund|Nurse midwives|Private sector|Institution building|Loans|Commercial credit|Private health care|Family planning services|Partnerships","Indonesia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABP647.pdf","64 KB","007893 - Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu International","","008234 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of a subproject (7/95-7/97) of the Promoting Financial Investments and Transfers (PROFIT) Project to increase the availability of family planning (FP) services in the industrial area of Nairobi, Kenya.  Specifically, the subproject was to help AAR Health Services, a private company that already markets prepaid health services to employers in the area, to provide FP services through a system of outpatient and outreach clinics, and to integrate managed care principles into its operations. As regards the planned clinic system, a large outpatient clinic -- Odyssey Plaza Medical Center -- opened in 9/95. However, due to limitations in the real estate market, only one of the 3 planned outreach clinics was opened, and this, at Kariobangi, many months behind schedule.  This affected the FP outcome, since it was envisioned that the outreach clinics would be key providers of FP services.  A second outreach clinic in Kangemi is scheduled to open in the first quarter of 1998. Many of the subproject's other objectives were reached, however.  In 1/96, AAR began offering FP services to its members at no additional cost.  AAR staff were trained in managed care concepts, FP counseling and delivery, and IEC campaigns, and received TA in marketing AAR services.  AAR membership has increased over 68% -- from 9,600 to 16,130 members -- although the goal of increasing number of lower income members has not been met.  AAR has been able to generate record profits while maintaining stable premiums for its members.  The total number of FP clients has been low, however.  With the opening of additional outreach clinics and an intensive promotion effort planned for the next year, use of AAR's FP services should increase. Overall, however, AAR achieved an important goal of expanding health care services: the Odyssey Plaza Medical Center serves 20,000 members, and the Kariobangi outreach clinic provides minor curative and FP services, as well as maternal and child health services, including immunizations and vaccinations; it also treats sexually transmitted diseases and HIV/AIDS and provides health education. Three lessons were learned.  (1) Employers in the industrial area of Nairobi are increasingly willing to pay for high-quality health services for their employees.  (2) A private, well-managed, and entrepreneurial company has the ability to take risks, act quickly, and produce quick results.  (3) Even if a health care plan offers FP services, there must be specific incentives to ensure that it is financially advantageous to promote FP usage.

"Final evaluation of a subproject (3/95-12/96) to create a Loan Fund for Physicians in Greater Manila, Philippines to support the expansion of private practices in reproductive health.  The subproject, part of the Promoting Financial Investments and Transfers (PROFIT) project, was implemented through the Bankers' Association of the Philippines Credit Guaranty Corporation (BCGC), a local lending institution, in collaboration with the Philippine Medical Women's Association (PMWA) and the Philippine Academy of Family Physicians (PAFP). PROFIT discovered through baseline research that:  Government of Philippines expenditures on health care were low (2.5% of GNP) by developing country standards; there was little financing available to fund the expansion of private health services; and the cost of the limited financing available discouraged many private practitioners from borrowing.  Most Filipinos had poor access to health services, a situation exacerbated by the fact that significant numbers of trained doctors and nurses continued to emigrate in order to practice abroad. However, there was a high level of interest among physicians in additional training in basic, nonsurgical family planning (FP) and reproductive health, and in basic business skills.  In addition to the loans, the physician borrowers were provided with training in these areas.  The training was mandatory and was provided at no cost to the borrowers. The program encountered a number of obstacles, most of them related to religious objections to FP by the largely Catholic population.  As a result, the leaders of the participating associations were reluctant to promote the loan fund; the BCGC, the lending institution, kept a low profile for the subproject; and among targeted physicians there was a limited demand for the loans.  Because of these obstacles and a revised Mission strategic objective that de-emphasized expanding the capacities of private physicians, PROFIT halted implementation in July 1996.  The project was terminated in December 1996. PROFIT learned several lessons from this subproject.  (1) Working with medical associations is a good way to reach physicians, but it is not necessarily appropriate to involve them directly in the implementation of projects without financial compensation, particularly if they are staffed largely by volunteers.  (2) Traditional financial lending institutions are inherently risk-adverse.  Projects that require these institutions to take on additional financial risk to serve a social objective must address this inherent conflict directly with the financial institution or must identify an alternative mechanism for the project's financial management.  (3) Building upon the current structure and capacities of existing institutions can significantly speed the start-up of a project.  (4) Doctors are only willing to participate in training programs that they consider necessary, even if competency-based exams show a higher level of need for training.  (5) Private doctors are interested in and need business management training, particularly in financial management.  (6) Attracting young doctors to participate in a loan fund can be difficult.  Their level of interest in such a program and their potential concerns about participating should be fully explored before such a project is launched.  (7)  Training and financial support can help increase the number of high-quality private physicians that offer FP services.  However, increasing the supply of FP services does not necessarily result in increased demand for those services.  The success of any FP project, even a small pilot project, is critically affected by prevailing political, religious, and cultural attitudes toward the provision of FP services.

"Final evaluation of subproject (5/94-12/96), under the Promoting Financial Investments and Transfers (PROFIT) project, to establish a health insurance plan in the Philippines.  The subproject was implemented by PhilamCare, a local health maintenance organization (HMO), and targeted lower-income families, particularly those in the informal sector not covered by social security benefits.  The subproject also included family planning (FP) benefits, which existing health insurance plans in the Philippines did not. PROFIT assisted PhilamCare in designing a health insurance plan and provided funds to underwrite the risks associated with launching the plan on a pilot basis in the cities of Manila and Cebu.  PhilamCare managed the day-to-day operations of the plan and offered TA to the contracting hospitals in managed care principles and in providing FP services. Constraints to implementation during the first year included difficulties in identifying a hospital in Manila willing to participate in the plan, retaining a sales staff, and marketing to a new client base (the informal sector), and the fact that an unexpectedly high number of enrollees allowed their coverage to lapse, resulting in sales reaching only 1,403 members, far below projections. Day-to-day operations of the plan improved in the second year with the hiring of a full-time manager and the signing of agreements with new participating hospitals.  However, PhilamCare was still unable to meet its sales targets.  Therefore, in 12/96, with only 2,000 enrollees (vs. the targeted 4,000) and PROFIT'S inability to continue underwriting the plan, the PhilamCare Board decided to discontinue it.  However, PhilamCare is considering ways to re-launch a plan targeting lower-income families. This subproject confirmed the existence of a demand for health insurance among low-income individuals in the informal sector.  To succeed, future projects of this kind will need to control recruitment costs, target client groups rather than individuals, and reduce drop-outs.  Moreover, motivating consumers to use the FP benefits under a health plan requires education and an understanding of the reasons why some consumers use government facilities and how to motivate them to shift to designated private providers.

"Interim evaluation of a project to strengthen developing countries' capacities to improve environmental health, (the Environmental Health Project -- EHP).  The project is being implemented by Camp, Dresser & McKee (CDM).  Evaluation covers the period 4/94-8/97. The project, which for the past 2.5 years has been increasingly devoted to activities under the Global Bureau's Center for Population, Health and Nutrition, Office of Health and Nutrition's (G/PHN/HN) results framework, has made innovative contributions toward disease prevention, enhanced urban environmental quality, and improved municipal services in developing countries worldwide.  Principal accomplishments are as follows. In the area of diarrhea prevention, EHP's approach of community-based action and hygiene promotion, which complements the efforts of other preventive projects, such as breastfeeding and immunization initiatives, has been accepted in varying degrees in Zambia, Ecuador, Bolivia, Jamaica, and Haiti.  In Zambia and Bolivia, the activities are implemented in conjunction with child survival programs.  EHP has helped CARE to increase community participation in its water supply and sanitation activities, published a primary prevention cost-effectiveness study that has earned international attention, and collaborated with UNICEF in the publication of a sanitation programming handbook. Towards the goal of malaria prevention, EHP has, in Zambia, introduced a Geographic Information System (GIS) for risk mapping, gained policy support for community-based health planning and action, conducted chloroquine sensitivity testing that led to changes in treatment policy, and prepared guidelines for assessing the feasibility of insecticide-impregnated bednets.  In addition, the project helped plan Africa Integrated Malaria Initiative activities in Malawi and Kenya, implemented malaria activities in Bolivia, Peru, and Eritrea, and is expected to launch a malaria activity in Nigeria.  EHP is also providing TA to the Vector-Borne Disease Control Center (VBDC) in Nepal. In the area of environmental risk assessment, EHP has worked with urban planners in two regions in India; replication is expected.  Risk assessment has played a key role in the project's community-based work in Zambia, Ecuador, and Bolivia. Using its Applying Community Involvement in Managing Environmental Pollution (CIMEP) approach, EHP has increased community participation and collaboration in solving environmental health issues in urban Tunisia and rural Ecuador.  Plans are underway for a CIMEP activity in Benin.  Also, a community-based participatory approach was used in Slovakia, Haiti, and Jamaica, and in curriculum development in Romania. EHP has already confirmed or anticipates behavioral change in 11 countries as well as the Central American region as a result of its efforts.  Important progress has been made in developing behavioral indicators and tracking results in Tunisia and Ecuador. Through field collaboration with behavior change-focused projects, EHP has had a positive impact on child survival/health and peri-urban activities. The project has strengthened environmental and health institutions serving the urban poor, and assisted with sector decentralization and privatization, in part through tools such as computerized water management models, GIS, monitoring and evaluation, and public sector training in service delivery and community collaboration.  This work has taken place in 19 countries. Despite funding and contracting constraints, the project has developed a broad range of linkages and partnerships with multilateral institutions, donors, and community-based organizations, helping USAID and host-country clients with priority setting and planning. USAID missions and regional urban development offices (RUDOs) have been highly satisfied with the project's work in developing indicators, results packages, and evaluations for other programs and activities. Recommendations have influenced program and priority changes within portfolios.  EHP's work on indicators is found in a number of the project's field reports and other documents (e.g., on Haiti and Ecuador and in the CIMEP manual). EHP has established an Information and Communication Unit (ICU) that provides a comprehensive range of library and information services to EHP, USAID, and the wider environmental health community.  Finally, the project has provided a wide range of assistance to USAID missions and host governments outside of the G/PHN/HN results framework, including assistance to Egypt in the area of abatement of lead exposure, to Slovakian cities in addressing environmental health issues, and an emergency assessment of environmental risk factors contributing to a cholera outbreak in Gaza.","Project title: Environmental health project (EHP)","Special Evaluation","Documents","HRN-5994-C-00-3036-00","","10/1/1997 12:00:00 AM","","Environmental health|Environmental management|Institution building|Environmental quality|Development programs|Development projects|Disease prevention and control|Public services|Preventive health care|Cities and towns","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABP716.pdf","7,034 KB","003366 - TvT Associates|000981 - Pragma Corp.","","008291 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of a joint program/project to support grain marketing reform in Zimbabwe -- the Grain Marketing Reform Support Program (GMRSP) and the Grain Marketing Reform Research Project (GMRRP), implemented over the period 1992-97. Under Zimbabwe's Economic Structural Adjustment Program (ESAP), grain marketing was transformed from 1991 to 1997 from a highly centralized and protected system to a privately-oriented, unsubsidized, and decentralized system.  The change has been momentous -- private transport of maize is permitted anywhere in the country, the Grain Marketing Board's (GMB) share of domestic maize sales has fallen from 100% to 10%, and the vast majority of the maize marketed in rural Zimbabwe is no longer milled at large, central mills, but at small hammermills, virtually all of which have come into existence since 1990. GMRSP and GMRRP played a substantial role in these reforms, speeding their pace well beyond what had been expected, given the worst drought of the century in 1991/92, another severe drought in 1994/5, and excessive rainfall and crop damage in 1996/7. The major impact of USAID's support for grain marketing reform has been increased food availability in the rural areas and reduced prices for subsistence foods in both rural and urban areas.  The impact on household food security is less clear. Inadequate market information has emerged as a major constraint to further improvements in this area. There is need to totally sever the increasingly commercialized activities of the GMB from the residual public sector functions it is still called on to perform -- most notably the management of the Strategic Grain Reserve (SGR).  Whether or not the new decentralized system will be robust enough to provide the food needed without reversion to increased government controls will be demonstrated with the next severe drought and food production shortfalls. The success of USAID support is attributable to excellent pre-project preparation, an early decision to tackle a set of problems of national importance to Zimbabwe, an extremely well-designed program/project combination, and an exemplary willingness on the part of key Zimbabwean government officials to move toward market liberalization in the face of deep-seated concerns and overt criticisms. USAID decided not to release the fourth tranche and to deobligate funds committed for studies and monitoring because the Government of Zimbabwe (GOZ) did not meet the conditionality for release.  The circumstances surrounding this decision would make an extremely useful, if not classic, case study of conflicting objectives within the Agency: the flexibility and patience at the country program level to achieve an original set of objectives versus the bureaucratic culture at the USAID/Washington level, which, having made global changes in goals, objectives, and procedures, requires all ongoing programs to either conform or be phased out as soon as practicable. Among the more noteworthy lessons are the following.  (1) The use of nonproject assistance as the tool of choice was critically important to the success of the grain market reform effort.  (2) Significant policy reforms in food marketing need to be supported over the long-term, especially in a country as food-insecure as is Zimbabwe.  Not to stay the course for as long as is necessary to institutionalize successes invites subsequent backsliding, especially during times of stress on the food systems.  (3) Impact on rural households in a country with infrastructure as poor as Zimbabwe's takes a long time to be felt. Monitoring these impacts over the longest possible time period is essential.  Since most USAID projects are of relatively short duration, this monitoring needs to be institutionalized within the recipient country so that it can be sustained after the USAID assistance is completed.","Delivery order #802","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","LAG-4201-Q-00-3061-00","","9/1/1997 12:00:00 AM","","Privatization|Food marketing|Agricultural product marketing|Cereals|Policy reform|Agricultural policy|Economic impact|Policy analysis","Zimbabwe","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABP784.pdf","208 KB","006381 - Abt Associates, Inc.","","008628 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of a project (1992-9/97) to build the capacity of historically disadvantaged South African communities to deliver housing and related services (CUSSP project).  The project was implemented by Lance Bailey and Associates. The project was wide in scope, reaching communities and individuals in 8 of South Africa's 9 provinces with interventions that included technical advice on housing defects, negotiation and leadership training, development of upgrading strategies for informal settlements and hostels, and divestiture of state-owned accommodation units.  The project achieved many of its objectives and its interventions were welcomed and appreciated by the majority of beneficiaries.  Though the sustainability of several projects is evident, additional interventions are needed to ensure housing delivery for other communities.  Key findings are as follows. In the community-based organization (CBO) institution-building component, training in leadership, bargaining, advocacy, and negotiations skills empowered a number of communities in their relations with provincial and local government and private sector building contractors.  The mentoring program provided promising young black professionals greater insight into housing policy, finance, community mobilization, negotiation with stakeholders, organizational development, and project implementation.  Career opportunities in the development field have also been enhanced for CUSSP trainees, though some courses were insufficiently tailored to participants' levels of technical understanding or language.  On the debit side, the mentoring program sometimes lacked adequate support and follow-up from CUSSP staff, with mentees being left wholly in the hands of host organizations. Development Forums and Trusts to sustain development were successfully set up in a number of communities, and financial impact grants to facilitate housing delivery processes were provided in 28 communities.  However, the latter did not always have their intended impact due to poor coordination and inadequate monitoring and follow-up: half of the grants were only partially disbursed due to lack of timely formation of local development trusts, and four approved grants were not disbursed. A wide range of high-quality reports on the program were produced, including technical and community development guidelines and case studies.  However, not all the reports were accessible and user-friendly to community development practitioners.  Most were submitted in draft form, and suggestions by CUSSP staff to modify their content were usually not implemented.  Also, although a series of short policy documents on housing finance, urban land development, and other housing issues were produced, their dissemination has been poor, thus curtailing their benefit. While the prime contractor fulfilled, wholly or in part, many contract obligations, it also experienced problems in terms of cash flow and a small capital base.  Additionally, the terms of the contract and its delineation of the roles of the prime contractor and subcontractors resulted in tensions between them that negatively affected their relations with the regional offices and quantitative program outputs. Key lessons learned include the following. (1) Projects in community development and housing should not be too ambitious.  It is better to have a solid impact in a limited number of areas than to spread efforts too widely and thereby dilute impact.  (2) The verification of developmental issues and priorities at the grassroots level, along with proper liaison with NGOs and local government, is essential to the success of any community-based project.  (3) The regional structuring of a development program should be as simple and straightforward as possible.  Clear lines of obligation and responsibility should be established from the outset. (4) Project close-out should be done gradually and with adequate consultation with employees.  (5) Building community capacity to drive the housing process remains a priority.  (6) More local staff should be used at the senior levels of the project to facilitate networking on sustainability. Numerous other lessons in the areas of contracts, employment of staff, training vendors, mentoring, field worker training, the use of financial impact grants, NGO/community-based organization capacity building, development impact, and documentation are listed in conclusion.

"Final evaluation of a project (9/93-11/96), implemented by CARE, to introduce integrated pest management (IPM) practices to potato farmers in 117 Andean communities in Peru (MIPANDES project). In general, MIPANDES has been highly successful.  Most farmers have learned fairly well the life cycles of both Andean potato weevil and potato tuber moth and their relationships with the potato plant; how, when, and where to find each developmental stage (eggs, larvae, pupae, adults); and the relevance of all this to IPM techniques.  Adoption of several IPM practices is taking place in virtually all community fields, and to a lesser degree in individual plots, though continual reinforcement by extensionists is needed to ensure long-lasting results. There is also evidence of some spontaneous adoption of IPM practices in non-MIPANDES communities.  The more commonly adopted practices include: night collecting of adult weevils, earthing up, harvesting tubers on a piece of canvas or plastic, and use of live fences and of repellent plants and baculovirus on stored potatoes. However, the use of Beauveria is limited to demonstrations conducted by CARE extensionists, with a reported effectiveness of only about 10-40%.  In terms of economic benefit, farmer surveys indicated that MIPANDES increased the proportion of uninfested or lightly infested potatoes being harvested for both consumption and marketing, while significantly reducing pesticide input costs and pest damage. Training programs and materials have been of superior quality and attractiveness and have stimulated greater involvement by women and children in project activities and other community affairs.  A pesticide safety program has inculcated the ""eight golden rules"" of the Groupement International des Associations Nationales de Fabricants de Produits Agrochemiques (AGIFAP).  MIPANDES also developed a sound system for monitoring the way farmers deal with potato pest problems, although the 1994 base-line diagnosis contained many weaknesses (e.g., lack of information on socioeconomic and political factors of importance to Peruvian farmers and paucity of quantitative data on crop pest damage, pest control costs, and monetary losses due to pest damage) that limited its use as an evaluation tool. The buildings that will house the two planned Centros de Produccion de Agentes de Control Biologico (CEPABs) are expected to be completed by the end of 1996.  Training of future CEPAB operators has been completed, and production of biocontrol agents is expected to be underway during early 1997.  CARE intends to continue supporting these centers for an undetermined period.  CEPABs are high-risk microenterprises and their sustainability will require support in all relevant entrepreneurial, marketing, managerial, technical, and quality assurance areas, as well as assured inoculum. The contributions of the International Potato Center (CIP) have been essential to the success of MIPANDES.  The availability of its ready-for-transfer IPM technology made it possible for MIPANDES to readily fill a major crop protection gap in the project areas.  CIP also developed prototype training materials, which were later modified by CARE.  The opportunity to receive training at CIP was highly valued by CARE extensionists.  Conversely, MIPANDES has provided CIP the opportunity to be involved in IPM implementation throughout a vast Andean area. The report includes lessons learned in problem definition and IPM menu, adoption of IPM practices, training and extension methodology, and advantages and disadvantages of integrating MIPANDES with other CARE projects and of the CARE-CIP partnership.  Also covered are criteria for training extensionists in IPM, and the appropriateness of including pesticide safety training in an IPM program and the relative importance of biocontrol in a non-chemical IPM menu.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","527-0372-G-00-3299-00","","1/1/1997 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural production|Potatoes|Crop pests|Integrated pest management|Agricultural extension|Agricultural technology|Technology transfer|Farmer training","Peru|Andean region","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABP793.pdf","2,845 KB","007518 - CARE International","","008591 - USAID.

"Final impact evaluation of a Housing Guaranty (HG)/grant program (1993-4/97) to improve the coverage and efficiency of urban environmental services in Tunisia through increased participation of the private sector (PPES project). Although USAID's decision to end the program 2 years early and reduce HG funds makes evaluation complicated, results were generally positive, with a remarkable evolution in Tunisia in the acceptance and the use of the private sector in the provision of environmental services. Achievements under the four objectives of the ""Planning Action and Cooperation Timetable (PACT)"" were as follows: Under the first PACT objective, to increase private sector provision of environmental services, progress has been made in the area of solid waste collection and wastewater services, and pilot projects are underway in solid and liquid waste management services.  Progress in land development and landfills has been slower, with the most complex project being the El-Matar pilot project. Under the second PACT objective, to strengthen private sector finance of environmental services, progress has been made in reducing subsidies to the Office National de l'Assainissement (ONAS) for operational costs and increasing wastewater tariffs, a new fiscal code for local authorities has made user fees more transparent and authorized periodic increases in tax rates, and two new government funds -- Fonds de Depollution (FODEP), a grant fund, and Fonds de Credits Environnementaux (FOCRED), a subsidized revolving loan fund -- have been very helpful in encouraging the private finance of solid waste collection.  The program also assisted in preparing Tunisia's first Build, Operate, Transfer (BOT) project in wastewater treatment, which should significantly increase private sector finance.  Finally, the El-Matar land development project is based on a model of private financing of land development through cost recovery from beneficiaries.  However, much remains to be done under this objective -- 4 years is not long enough to develop the new financial instruments needed to increase private sector finance, efforts to increase private finance vary from sector to sector, and studies of the potential role of the private sector in financing urban environmental services and land development are only now being completed. In the third PACT objective, to improve the public sector capacity to manage enhanced private sector participation, progress has been made. Starting from a base of 0%, it appears likely that 10% of ONAS activities will be contracted with the private sector by 2001, a period of only 8 years.  However, ONAS may be reluctant to push the 10% barrier and may pursue pilot activities on a regional level to determine the feasibility of private sector finance outside of Tunis.  The structure for land management has not yet to been finalized, although creation of a solid waste department at Agence Nationale de Protection de l'Environnement (ANPE) is an important step.  The movement from private sector management contracts to private ownership will be difficult; the question of management structure must be resolved quickly, since it is a condition for going forward with the World Bank's Second Municipal Development Project.  Although the objective did not call for strengthening the private sector itself, the program, by including private sector representatives in some activities, resulted in the creation of new opportunities and companies.  Tunisian consulting firms were successfully used and thereby strengthened. The fourth PACT objective, aimed at sensitizing the general public to urban environmental issues through NGOs and micro-pilot projects, was not so successful; NGOs are relatively weak in Tunisia and are therefore not well suited to providing the kind of support that the government was seeking. This situation may be slowly improving. In terms of sustainability, under the first objective, only activities concerning the collection of solid waste and the operation and maintenance of urban wastewater networks are sustainable.  With regard to the other three objectives, efforts in community participation and greater private sector financial participation are not yet sustainable, and the strengthening of public sector institutions to manage the private sector varies depending upon which public sector institution and which function is being discussed.  The main issue, it should be noted, does not, for the most part, involve either private sector technical competence or public sector political will, but rather the creation of a proper institutional framework and policies that will permit the private sector to operate profitably and convince public sector organizations that they have something to gain from collaborating with the private sector.

"PACR of a program/project (1987-6/96) to implement a replicable model for the finance and management of slum upgrading programs in the Municipality of Tetouan in Morocco. The project was a success.  By the end of 1995, roads, drainage, street lighting, water, sewerage, and other improvements had been completed on about 174 hectares in the Dersa and Samsa neighborhoods, home to more than 11,000 low-income households.  Infrastructure was also completed on a nearby 60 hectares with 1,900 serviced sites for new homes, schools, and public services.  Profits on sales of the new sites are helping cross-subsidize improvements in the older areas.  Capital investments total less than $2,000 per household -- dramatically less than would have been required for new housing.  In addition, about 30% of the households (85% of whom are below median income) had secured title to their property, and more than 70% had invested in rehabilitation and repairs; 10% had added a rental unit and 5% had created a shop on the ground floor.  A 1992 evaluation found that the average household income had risen 20-40%. Each of the agencies involved in the program has gone on to play important roles in other urban development programs around the country; institutions like the Fonds d'Equipement Communal (FEC) and the Agence Nationale de Lutte Contre l'Habitat Insalubre (ANHI) have become key elements in the government's strategy to improve shelter and environmental conditions for low-income families in Morocco. Neighborhood upgrading efforts are now underway or planned in more than 30 cities around the country.  Many of the recommendations and management systems produced by the project were adopted or maintained, and all were important steps in developing the tools needed for long-term success. Lessons learned are as follows:  (1) Living conditions in large clandestine settlements, even on difficult sites, can be improved at significantly less cost and greater benefit to residents than construction of new housing.  Success required both political leadership and strong technical and management partners to back it up.  The Municipality of Tetouan provided that leadership in this program, but could not have completed the task without ANHI at its side.  (2) Clearing title and registering land that was mostly settled clandestinely always takes a long time and substantial pressure to overcome legal and administrative hurdles.  When that falls behind schedule, as it has in Tetouan, the neighborhood will be leery of investment and cost recovery will lag.  (3) The program illustrates the linkages between neighborhood development and environmental management. Unplanned growth and clandestine settlement in the Samsa and Dersa neighborhoods contributed to degradation in the area and sanitary conditions within the neighborhoods themselves.  The program substantially improved access, water, and sanitation, but connection to the city's sewerage system substantially raised the need for treatment to prevent further deterioration of the river and its coastal estuary.","RFS no. 31","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","PCE-1008-C-00-5001-00","","9/1/1997 12:00:00 AM","","Housing investment guaranty|Housing finance|Urban areas|Municipal level|Slum areas|Squatters|Public services|Public administration|Institution building|Pilot projects|Poverty","Morocco","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABP824.pdf","1,220 KB","007625 - International City/County Management Association (ICMA)","","008579 - USAID.

"There are few countries that, like Tunisia, have demonstrated in just 30 years that a developing country can meet its housing and urban development needs. USAID, within the context of a larger bilateral assistance program, contributed significantly to this achievement. This report documents this success story (1966-1997). The Tunisian-American relationship was based upon mutual respect, and the knowledge that the Regional Housing and Urban Development Office (RHUDO) was committed to remaining in Tunisia on a long-term basis; RHUDO was in the country 20 years, allowing it to gain an intimate understanding of Tunisian institutions and staff members, offer relevant TA, and increase the sustainability thereof. The long-term approach proved essential in Tunisia because changes came slowly and new policies needed nurturing. The use of pilot projects, studies, and workshops was also key to the success of the approach. Further, the long-term tripartite relationship between Tunisia, USAID, and the World Bank was unique in the world of development assistance; its replication would be a considerable victory for development assistance. While RHUDO sometimes felt that Tunisia could have accomplished even more it had not been so cautious, it remained in its proper role and continued to support the Tunisian efforts. This paid off; problems that had seemed insurmountable became, in the end, manageable. In sum, the relationship was an enviable one. Joint Tunisian-American programs contributed to many outstanding achievements. Tunisia made remarkable progress in meeting housing needs of more than one million Tunisians with the assistance of more than $165 million from USAID over a 30-year period. Tunisians are dramatically better housed today than before; the percentage of shanty housing dropped from over 25% to less than 3% in 20 years. The Tunisian private sector now provides virtually all houses, some 55,000 annually over the last 10 years. Low-income households in urban areas have significantly better living conditions than they did 20 years ago, thanks to upgrading efforts pioneered by USAID in Mellassine. Water, electricity, and sewer services are now widespread. Garbage collection is improving, thanks to USAID programs to encourage the participation of the private sector. Local authorities are stronger and participate more effectively in development efforts.","RFS no. 42","Special Evaluation","Documents","PCE-1008-C-00-5001-00","","8/1/1997 12:00:00 AM","","Housing|USAID|Development assistance|Urban development","Tunisia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNACB579.pdf","1,153 KB","007625 - International City/County Management Association (ICMA)","","008616 - USAID.

"From 1977 until 1997, USAID's Near East and North Africa (NENA) Regional Housing and Urban Development Office (RHUDO), based in Tunisia, managed an information exchange and training program involving all countries in the region.  This report describes the program and draws lessons learned, with emphasis on the period after 1992, when RHUDO synthesized a formal regional training strategy, to which it provided resources on a systematic basis. Program activities included regional policy seminars; formation of collaborative relationships with regional and international organizations, including the International Union of Local Authorities (IULA) and the United Nations Center for Human Settlements (UNCHS); training workshops involving more than one country; exchange visits within the region; and a widely distributed newsletter.  Probably the most significant and certainly a unique activity was the establishment of a regional NGO, called the Regional Advisory Council (RAC), as a vehicle for advancing enlightened urban policies.  Originally intended to serve RHUDO in an advisory capacity, the RAC has taken on an independent life and a new name, the NENA Urban Forum, and will continue after RHUDO's departure to act as an independent nongovernmental body concerned with defining a regional urban agenda. Overall, the RHUDO regional program was a success, made possible by a number of elements:  the strong sense of Arabic solidarity, as well as a common language and colonial experience; the sense that the program was locally inspired, with strong local input; RHUDO's devotion of considerable human but only modest financial resources to the program; the involvement of other multilateral and bilateral donors; and RHUDO's use of successes from its Tunisian program. The following lessons were learned.  (1) Establishing a successful regional program requires an understanding of the region and careful preparation and assessment.  The selection of participants and the choice of topics to be covered must reflect the results of this assessment, not merely the wishes of the donor.  (2) In matching countries in a regional information and training exchange program the key criterion is what the countries can learn from each other. Countries that are less similar in terms of language and culture should be combined with countries that are more similar from an institutional or policy vantage point.  (3) A successful program requires the sponsoring RHUDO or other entity to make regional activities a priority. It is far too easy to relegate these kinds of activities to the end of the line in terms of resource allocation.  (4) Using an ongoing program in one country as a base of operations and as a learning laboratory for regional exchanges and seminars is strongly recommended.  (5) The involvement of other donors lessens the financial burden on any one organization and helps lead other donors to understand and pursue the same policy goals. However, this collaboration needs to be closely monitored to ensure that goals are reached and that the policies being promoted are the ones USAID supports.  (6) Local involvement is crucial. The NENA model of a Regional Advisory Council was key to this involvement.  In the Near East, it appears to have had the added advantage of structuring a sustainable policy organization.

"Assesses efforts in Lebanon of the World Rehabilitation Fund (WRF) under the Displaced Children and Orphans Fund (DCOF) and the War Victims Fund Project. Assessment covers a period ending 2/97. WRF has skillfully targeted and managed DCOF resources; by also supporting NGOs and community-based organizations (CBOs) that are sectarian and with political affiliations, it has allowed itself room to maneuver.  This unique approach is beginning to yield results, although the butter is spread thin; while DCOF funding has reached a broad range of organizations and constituencies within the fractured Lebanese political and confessional culture, optimization of impact will require focusing on fewer projects. The NGO community continues to face many constraints. Despite its own good opinion of itself and the government s verbal tokens of appreciation, it is poorly served by the coordination agencies and other groups that purport to serve its interests.  As a result, the NGO community is fractured and weak and plays little or no role in social policy.  DCOF could exert some influence in this area, if it continues its partnership with the WRF.  In the government sector, social service delivery policies are made by a variety of ministries, resulting in waste and inefficiency.  Again, the WRF, through its participation in numerous committees, has the potential to wield its influence. Further, there is a plethora of anecdotal information but a paucity of hard data about the needs of vulnerable children in Lebanon.  At both the policymaking and operational levels, there is a widespread lack of capacity and willingness to address this problem. Also, no mechanisms are in place at a national or regional level to address the deinstitutionalization of children, and the WRF has not had a significant influence on the advancement of alternative models.  It is unrealistic to expect one U.S. NGO to achieve much more than putting the issue on the table, as the WRF has done. However, there is hope for further progress; USAID support for displaced children and orphans has been significantly increased for 1996 and the four special objectives within the three Agency goals offer the DCOF a promising framework for ongoing investment.  A continuing partnership between the DCOF and the WRF would offer opportunities to optimize the leverage effect of DCOF funds. Recommendations are that DCOF adopt a three-track approach in Lebanon (increase funding to projects that deliver rapid benefits to disadvantaged children, enhance capacity-strengthening for subgrantee service delivery agencies, and increase investment in support for national committees and advocacy groups); work through the WRF to influence change in policy on child care and welfare issues under USAID Special Objective 2 (increased effectiveness of selected democratic institutions); and pursue a much closer partnership between USAID-funded NGOs in order to optimize both impact and value for taxpayer dollars. Also, WRF should improve its reporting capacities in a manner that will be more satisfactory to donors in the long-term.

"Evaluates Province-Based War Trauma Team (PBWTT) Project, implemented by the Christian Children's Fund (CCF) to train adults providing child care to meet the psychosocial needs of war-traumatized children in Angola.  Midterm evaluation covers the period 9/95-4/97. The project provides convincing evidence that a set of simple, low-cost, culturally appropriate and community-based interventions exists that can be taught to childcare-givers who can then help children who have suffered war-related stresses to measurably improve. At its midpoint, the PBWTT is well on the way toward achieving its training targets in a gender-balanced manner.  The PBWTT has conducted 72 training seminars for 1,890 adults, half of them women.  The trainees, selected through consultation with local influentials, include teachers, community volunteers (parents and community leaders), social workers, church volunteers or child welfare activists, administrators, health workers, and traditional political leaders.  In all but one province, the PBWTT has effectively focused project resources on areas with the highest concentrations of war-affected children, as determined by situation analyses in each province. Adult trainees stated that the seminars had helped them to deal with their own trauma and war experiences, to understand that child behavior such as social isolation and aggression may be the result of war experiences, and to acquire specific tools and methods for intervening on behalf of children.  The trainees noted the following improvements in children, including their own: improved child-child and child-adult relationships; improved school attendance and behavior and cooperation in the classroom; less aggressive behavior and less evidence of war-related games and toys; diminished isolation behavior; greater participation among children in institutions; fewer problems with concentration; and decreased hypervigilance and improved perspective and hope. Because the project addresses a significant need and gives adults a means of working personally on behalf of peace, the PBWTT has spread rapidly at the grassroots level.  In addition, the prestige of the PBWTT skyrocketed through a joint effort with the Reintegration of Underage Soldiers (RUS), whereby the province-based teams of the PBWTT work with local catechistas (church volunteers) to demobilize and reintegrate underage soldiers; these tasks are widely regarded as critical for peace in Angola.  Indeed, CCF/Angola has played the lead role among all organizations in the country because it has provided key technical and logistical assistance in the demobilization and reintegration of 40% of the underage soldiers who have been demobilized to date.  Key problem areas include the magnitude of the workload on project staff, a lack of basic materials such as footballs, crayons, paper, and UNITA's resistance to CCF's promotion of pacifism, especially among the underage soldier population.

"Reviews efforts in Senegal of the BASICS program, a child survival program in Africa, for the period 8/94-7/97. BASICS has developed productive relations with key partners, including USAID, the National Service for Feeding and Applied Nutrition (SANAS), and the Management Science for Health project, and its regional advisors have played an important role in providing both technical and programmatic support to the program in Senegal. For its part, BASICS/Senegal, in addition to in-country activities, has participated in activities organized on a regional level, e.g., development of integrated management of childhood illness (IMCI), IEC (information, education, and communication strategy) development, and work in nutrition. SANAS's capacity to plan and implement key child survival interventions has been enhanced through collaboration with BASICS. BASICS/Senegal has provided formal training opportunities to staff from SANAS and BRAN (unidentified acronym) in such areas as management, planning, IEC, and nutrition. Capacity building has also taken place through collaboration on various studies, research topics, and other joint ventures such as the development of the PROFILES program and presentation. District action planning is another instance of positive collaboration in which the process followed and imparted to counterparts may be as important as the product itself. BASICS/Senegal and SANAS have also worked together effectively to develop key policy documents, primarily in the area of nutrition. Several important model approaches have been introduced in districts. Examples include the project's experience with the Preceding Birth Technique for measuring mortality among children aged 0-24 months and community nutrition and growth monitoring efforts in the Dioffior district. BASICS/Senegal proposes to follow a scaling up process with respect to the introduction of the MINPAK (a minimum package of nutrition-related activities aiming at improving the nutritional status of pregnant women and children) in a number of districts as well. Key constraints to program implementation include: (1) the inadequacy of key Ministry of Health (MOH) systems -- in particular supervision of routine activities, the health and management information system (HMIS), and the gathering of feedback; (2) the lack of oral rehydration solution (ORS) at service delivery points (though it is hoped that this situation will improve in the near future due to the recent introduction of ORS into the essential drug list and its incorporation into the Bamako Initiative pharmacies, along with a regional effort by BASICS, Population Services International, and Rhone-Poulenc-Rorer Pharmaceuticals to promote the marketing of ORS in the private sector); (3) expansion of the original BASICS/Senegal mandate to include increasing the capacity of Senegalese institutions to develop and manage child survival activities, developing a nutrition component, and introducing the Preceding Birth Technique, IMCI, and the MINPAK into Senegal; and (4) the absence of a plan for transferring program management responsibility to the MOH when the project ends in a year (the latter problem is especially acute since many of BASICS/SANAS activities are taking place as pilot activities in only a few districts in each of the four regions in which USAID-funded activities are focused). There is also a need to rationalize the yearly indicator reporting and develop a schedule of and means to collect the data needed by the Mission to prepare the annual R4. Finally, district action plans being submitted to USAID for funding are omitting certain types of necessary expenses (e.g., the recurrent costs of supervision) that are not expected to meet with USAID approval.

"Final evaluation of a matching grant provided to Esperanca (9/91-9/97) to improve health care administration, especially in the public sector, in Latin America and Africa.  The project involves South-South technology transfer and networking between Esperanca programs in Bolivia and Brazil, the rest of Spanish-speaking Latin America, and Portuguese-speaking African countries, such as Mozambique and Guinea-Bissau. The project has exceeded its quantitative goals for graduate training of public health officials and for NGO workshops, as well as for the number of training sessions held, and overall outputs.  What is more, the graduate program has evolved into the only Masters in Public Health (MPH) program for the public sector in Bolivia; it was also adapted for a specialized course in public health in Brazil.  In addition, the Masters in Administration of Public Health (MAPH) is currently underway. A series of 12 workshops was provided to NGOs in Bolivia and Brazil. Both of these countries have developed their capacities to provide workshops in technical areas requested by NGOs or other private or semi-government organizations, such as utilities.  Based on surveys and site visits, participants were highly satisfied with the project's offerings.  In fact, a number of impressive personal success stories have emerged, especially for women, who account for 50% of program participants. The graduate training in public health program is completely sustainable; counterpart institutions, Nur University for the Bolivian program and Fundacao Esperanca for the Brazilian program, have become effective training institutions, totally supported by tuition fees paid by students.  The NGO workshops, on the other hand, have not been as successful in achieving sustainability, as most NGOs are indigenous and hence lack the financial resources to sustain tuition charges. As a result, the Bolivian workshop program has slowed down considerably, whereas the Brazil program has responded by diversifying its client base to include groups such as the World Wildlife Fund and the state electrical utility agency.  While that country's program is now viable, it still needs to incorporate indigenous health NGOs into the program. The following lessons were learned:  (1) Given the extraordinary success of the South-South strategy of transferring health personnel skills, the North-South strategy for technology transfer no longer appears to be the most effective way to introduce change.  The South-South strategy has allowed the strengthening of local training institutions to provide high quality educational programs.  (2) Time after time, the Nur University participants have cited the moral leadership stressed in that program as the key to their personal and professional growth.  This approach includes ethical approaches and active listening to others in a consultative process and the development of the personal and human side of institutional relationships.  (3) It is beneficial to use a common evaluation methodology in projects such as this that involve more than one country located on different continents. (4) The project has been adept at using recommendations from both internal and external evaluations to improve its training programs, to the satisfaction of its participants.  (5) The project has stimulated development in other technical areas that extend far beyond health.  For example, much of the NGO workshop material developed in this project has been incorporated into a series of 16 training guides to improve the function of rural teachers in Bolivia.  (6) Shared vision, common objectives, and continuity of personnel are key ingredients for success. This project has shown all three elements over a 9-year period in all countries where it has worked, and this has contributed toward achieving project goals and objectives to an exceptionally high degree rarely found in USAID-funded projects.","Contents: v. 1.: Main report -- v. 2.: Annexes","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","7/1/1997 12:00:00 AM","","Human capacity development|Public sector|Professionals|Career development|Workshops|Indigenous private voluntary organizations|Graduate education|Health care administration","Bolivia|Brazil|Mozambique","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABP868.pdf","7,784 KB","007936 - Esperanca, Inc.","","007746 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of the Child Survival IX project (9/93-9/96), implemented by Adventist Development and Relief Agency (ADRA) in a remote and severely undeveloped area of Malawi's northern Nsanje district. The project has had a positive impact on the health of mothers and infants in the project area, as reported by community members and by Ministry of Health (MOH) and project staff.  It has catalyzed community organization for health improvement.  Though not all objectives were achieved, increased use of contraception, increased interest in child health, increased vegetable gardening, and general interest in sanitation are documented through project reports, a community survey, and field observations.  The incorporation of project Health Surveillance Assistants into the MOH began ahead of schedule, and ensures at least minimal sustainability for the project. The evaluation report contains a number of lessons learned, most important of which are related to the need for consistent planning for project closure from the onset, and the important role community structures, such as village headmen, Village Health Committees, traditional healers, and religious leaders, must play to achieve project success.  The participation of the Project Director on the evaluation team facilitates the use of the evaluation results in the final weeks of the project, and increases the likelihood that lessons learned will be transmitted to those trying to sustain health improvements in Nsanje district.

"Evaluates a project to promote the development of small and microenterprises (SMEs) in El Salvador, especially within National Reconstruction Plan (NRP)(i.e., ex-conflictive) zones through the provision of credit, TA, and training.  The implementing institution, PROPEMI (Small and Microenterprise Promotion Program), is a division of the Foundation for Economic and Social Development (FUSADES), a Salvadoran PVO. Impact evaluation covers the period 9/93-5/97. The project has become one of the most effective forms of assisting SMEs in NRP and other high-poverty zones in El Salvador.  A total of 1,507 loans were provided, helping assisted firms increase monthly incomes by 38% (vs. a goal of 30%), and generating 1.2 jobs per loan (vs. a goal of 1 job).  The loans have helped businesses, most of which were family-owned, to improve the value of their assets, increase their savings level, augment their business funds, and improve their living conditions in terms of food, housing, clothes, education, and amusement. Although the project targeted small-scale enterprises, 72% of the businesses that received loans were microenterprises.  Besides the loans, PROPEMI offered training (reaching almost 8,000 individuals) and provided loan assessments and loan administration services; both have received generally high marks and have generated income helpful to PROPEMI's sustainability. PROPEMI is a sustainable institution operatively as well as financially:  its capital profitability is acceptable; it has the capacity to absorb operating expenses; it employs quality personnel; its maintenance of a flexible 20-23% interest rate (which is in keeping with the range of rates of the financial system) has enabled it to maintain a loyal clientele; and it has an outstanding repayment rate -- as of 12/96, 83% of the funds disbursed had been recuperated.  It has also complied with many of the requisites for becoming a formal financial institution.  As for FUSADES, its image has been strengthened by PROPEMI's outreach to new communities, especially in NRP areas. Finally, the project has made a successful effort to reach women, with 40% of loans made to women entrepreneurs. The following lessons were learned:  (1) The operating and financial sustainability of SME promotion and development programs in the short term does not guarantee their sustainability in the long term.  (2) Management information systems are necessary to guarantee timely and transparent registries for administering financial programs efficiently. (3) To achieve the goals and purposes of assisting marginal sectors, identifying and characterizing target groups and providing people to work with them is essential.  (4) The success of microenterprise development programs does not depend on the gender serviced.  Both genders have the same participation and development.  (5) The financial success of a credit promotion and development program is directly related to the stability of its personnel as well as the integration of the credit component with training and TA.","Spanish ed.: PD-ABP-917|Contents: v.1.

"Final evaluation of the knowledge, practices, and service coverage of the Resources in Community Health Education Support (RICHES) II project in its target population -- the Moron and Abricots communes, Grand'Anse, Haiti.  The evaluation covers 1994 and 1996 surveys of 423 mothers with a child aged 0-24 months. The project was highly successful in terms of coverage, with 74% of the target population surveyed reporting having attended a RICHES rally post in the 3 months prior to the survey.  Generally, the survey revealed that the project performed satisfactorily when measured in terms of USAID performance indicators in the areas of infant and child nutrition, diarrhea management, acute respiratory infection recognition, vaccinations for children and women, prenatal care and preparation for child birth, family planning, malaria prevention, and AIDS prevention. Specific findings were as follows:  The prevalence of exclusive breastfeeding for children aged 0-4 months increased from 19% to 74%, and levels of mothers' knowledge and their practices in terms of child nutrition are satisfactory, with mothers introducing weaning foods later and feeding their young children a greater variety of foods, including more protein-rich foods.  According to Road-to-Health cards, the prevalence of vitamin A distribution is approximately 60%.  There is no change in knowledge of the frequency of meals given to young children between 1994 and 1995:  the majority of mothers stated that they should feed their children two or three times per day. Management of childhood diarrhea also improved, even though the prevalence of diarrhea in the index child in the last 2 weeks remained unchanged (40% in 1996).  All respondents reported using oral rehydration therapy.  More mothers in 1996 also continued or increased breastfeeding (97% in 1996 versus 83% in 1994) and giving foods (92% versus 72%) and liquids (93% versus 62%) to the sick child.  Knowledge of signs of acute respiratory infections and taking children with respiratory distress for treatment also improved.  However, the reported prevalence of children showing flu-like symptoms in the past 2 weeks remained high at 62% in 1996. Vaccination coverage improved a great deal but did not reach the expected 60% coverage level.  Only 26% of women received the second dose of tetanus toxoid and only 44% of children received a measles vaccination. Results were more mixed for pre-natal care and delivery preparation practices.  During their last pregnancy, more women in 1996 made a pre-natal visit to a health care provider (87% versus 62% in 1994). Knowledge of foods good to eat during pregnancy increased, but the idea of eating more during pregnancy was cited by only 51% of the respondents.  Also, knowledge of what to prepare for childbirth (assembling safe birth kits) was uneven. Respondents' knowledge levels of contraceptive methods is high, a large increase since 1994.  The contraceptive prevalence rate (CPR) is estimated at 22%, up from 6% in 1994.  The preferred method is the oral contraceptive pill at 10%.  Despite the project emphasis on sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and AIDS, the prevalence of condom use is only 5% but this is very good when compared to national rates for condom use. The means of malaria transmission and of prevention are poorly understood in all the study communities.  There is no change in knowledge level between the baseline and final study.  Sixty-nine percent of the respondents did not know how malaria was transmitted, and fully 75% did not know how to prevent the disease. Regarding knowledge of AIDS, and the ability to cite AIDS as a disease spread through sexual relations, respondents are well informed. In fact, nearly 99% of respondents affirmed their knowledge of AIDS, as opposed to 83% in 1994.  A vast majority of respondents cite sexual promiscuity as a main form of AIDS transmission.  Unfortunately, AIDS transmission through the use of dirty syringes was cited by only 15% of respondents.  The means of AIDS prevention most cited was fidelity (97%), followed by the use of condoms (94%).","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","FAO-0500-A-00-3023-00","","1/1/1997 12:00:00 AM","","KAP surveys|Child survival activities|Community based delivery|Health education|Attitude|Health surveys","Haiti","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABP998.pdf","983 KB","007518 - CARE International","","007746 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of a project (1990-12/97) to improve the capacity of the Action Committee for Basic Education (EDUCA), a nascent NGO, in improving primary education in the Dominican Republic (PIPE project). EDUCA, organized in 1990 by a group of businesspeople, is highly regarded as a non-partisan organization in a highly polarized country. The organization provides services to the education community, particularly in low-income areas, and its decision to focus on the public as well as the private sector has contributed significantly to its credibility.  EDUCA's Board of Directors is composed of a highly dedicated group of Dominicans, which continues to incorporate fresh talent, including young, up-and-coming businesspeople.  A group of highly respected educators and academics serve the Board in an advisory capacity. EDUCA has forged links between education institutions that might not have otherwise associated with one another, such as seven institutions that now work together to design teacher training programs.  A strategy of contracting with other institutions instead of developing its own capacity for service delivery has enabled EDUCA to avoid the pitfalls of having a large administrative structure, strengthen other institutional capabilities, and develop valuable allies that it can tap for other efforts. EDUCA has forged links between public and privates schools, possibly a first in the Dominican Republic.  It has also collaborated with the World Bank and the Interamerican Development Bank (IDB) in the implementation of their first educational loans, provided the IDB with TA for textbook development, and collaborated with IDB's expansion of the teacher training program.  In 1989/90, EDUCA mediated between the government and the teachers' union to bring a major teachers' strike to an end by persuading the government to raise teachers' salaries. Support from the PIPE project enabled EDUCA to show that textbooks of high quality can be produced in a short period of time, and to provide a training program that has received universal acclaim.  Training provided under PIPE focused on implementing the 10-Year Plan and the pending Educational Reform Law and focused on both school directors and teachers. School directors trained by EDUCA are implementing new management procedures, have become promoters of the Educational Reform Law, and have even established a 500-member alumni association, which is likely to become a significant voice in ensuring implementation of the Reform Law.  Teachers trained by EDUCA have shown significant increases in knowledge and comprehension of the training and now use a more participatory instructional approach.  In short, EDUCA has succeeded in putting education on the Dominican national agenda. Yet, EDUCA faces a number of challenges. Members of EDUCA's board have diverging views on what its mission should be, EDUCA is not operating strategically, and its funding from USAID will be terminated at the end of 1997. However, unlike most non-profit organizations in the country, EDUCA's Board of Directors has cultivated the ability to obtain resources, both through monetary and in-kind contributions.  Also, while EDUCA is expected by many to play a key role in pulling together individuals from various walks of society, EDUCA staff are divided on whether and how to carry out this renewed advocacy role.  While EDUCA has reached out to low-income areas, it is still seen as a somewhat elitist organization.  Finally, some PIPE activities (e.g., achievement testing, management information systems) were less successful and need to be rethought. The evaluation includes general lessons learned for donors and for grantee/implementing organizations.","Delivery order #801|Related document: PN-ACD-380","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","OUT-HNE-I-801-94-00016-00|HNE-I-00-94-00016-00","","12/1/1997 12:00:00 AM","","Educational development|Primary education|Development organizations|Institutional aspects|Indigenous private voluntary organizations","Dominican Republic","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABQ048.pdf","4,027 KB","001341 - Creative Associates International, Inc.

"Assesses the impact of some $500 million in U.S. food aid provided over the past 38 years to the Sahelian nations of Burkina Faso, Cape Verde, Chad, The Gambia, Guinea-Bissau, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, and Senegal. Results have been mixed.  Programs that sought long-term outcomes have had difficulty generating measurable results.  Some, such as maternal and child health (MCH) programs, have largely failed to achieve their principal objectives (e.g., nutritional impact on young children). Others, such as school feeding programs, have generated positive and measurable results but present challenges in sustainability.  Still others, such as those dealing with policy reform and food for work (FFW), have succeeded in many cases, but the full effects are difficult to measure because of problems of attribution and potentially negative side effects. Specific findings and lessons learned are noted below. (1) Program food aid is a double-edged sword.  Recipient governments can use it to facilitate growth-inducing reforms, or they can use it to finance statist policies, support overvalued currencies, and postpone change.  In the early 1980s, USAID's efforts were often confounded by this problem, but by the mid-1980s, when conditionalities became directed at market liberalization, food markets had become more efficient. Because many of the policy reform successes in the Sahel were achieved in coordination with other donors, it is inappropriate to attribute the changes solely to USAID. (2) Monetization of program food aid has resulted in significant budget support for recipient governments.  Local currency generations have been invested in a wide variety of activities.  Some have yielded positive returns (such as tree planting to stabilize dunes), others, negative returns (financing state marketing agencies), and still others, ambiguous returns (strengthening an agricultural marketing board). Ambiguities have also arisen about the ownership and fungibility of counterpart funds, often resulting in disputes on how to program the money, account for it, and report on its uses. (3) Overall, FFW has a good record as a tool for targeting food to the poor during severe droughts in the Sahel.  Its record as a tool for longer term development, however, is mixed and poorly documented.  In some cases, FFW has served to build useful public works, but in others it has created low-quality infrastructure of limited value.  In some cases, it has facilitated community development projects, but in others it has weakened the spirit of self-help necessary for genuine community initiative.  To succeed, however, FFW must be well managed and used for carefully designed projects. Moreover, donors must always be vigilant for potential behavior-distorting effects of FFW and take steps to minimize them, particularly in community development projects. (4) MCH programs, most of them managed by Catholic Relief Services, have a long but generally weak record in the Sahel.  Evaluators have consistently failed to find a positive nutritional impact from these programs; this could be due either to the actual lack of nutritional impact or to methodological problems. Failure to show measurable results led to the closure of most MCH programs in the Sahel by the late 1980s. The MCH experience did show, however, that children under 2 are generally more likely to benefit nutritionally, and in a measurable way, from targeted feeding than are older children.  It also showed that MCH education programs (as distinct from nutrition improvement programs) generally improved mothers' knowledge and practices about health and nutrition. (5) U.S. food aid supported only two school feeding programs in the Sahel, and information is available only on the larger one, carried out in Burkina Faso for over 30 years.  Evaluators found evidence that this program had a positive impact on children's nutrition, attendance, and academic achievement.  School feeding programs can have measurable, positive effects. But they can go on for perhaps too long a time if implementors neglect to develop an exit strategy or to define a finish line before starting them.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1997 12:00:00 AM","","Food aid programs|Impact assessment|Economic policy|Policy reform|Local currency|Maternal child feeding programs|School feeding programs|Food for work|Project sustainability|Food aid monetization","Sahel|Burkina Faso|Cape Verde|Chad|Gambia|Guinea-Bissau|Mali|Mauritania|Niger|Senegal","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNABY244.pdf","1,764 KB","006727 - Development Alternatives, Inc.

"Final evaluation of the Decentralization and Traditional Authority (D/TA) component (8/94-8/97) of USAID's Democratic Development Project. The component, implemented by the African American Institute (AAI), aimed at helping the Mozambican Ministry of State Administration (MAE) undertake research to determine the role of traditional authority in relation to local government structures in the context of the government's democratization and decentralization program. One national and eight province-level work and discussion groups (CTDs) brought over 1,000 traditional authorities, government officials, politicians, religious leaders, and business people together to discuss the role of traditional authorities in local government.  The CTDs brought the debate on traditional authority to the attention of the media and the society at large, and resulted in a mass of information that was utilized to produce educational materials and to draft legislation formally recognizing the role of traditional authorities in the construction of democracy in local government.  This draft legislation reflected the D/TA project's initial attitude -- that traditional authorities could be a panacea for all of the country's ills.  However, as the project progressed and as the peace held, the project researchers and the government itself become more realistic; the Council of Ministers temporarily postponed the legislation in favor of more informal collaboration between traditional institutions and government officials.  Far from being seen as a failure of the project, this should be considered a victory.  In the early 1990s, it may have been necessary to overstate the case for the return of traditional authority in order to counteract attitudes of the post-independence FRELIMO government and to bring the issue into public debate.  The revised tactic of informal collaboration has had profound effects on rural society, where traditional authorities are once more trying court cases, and cooperating with government officials in health campaigns, tax collection, and census taking. Also, traditional authorities are once more fulfilling their religious obligations for the well-being of their communities.","Contract number is listed as 656-A-00-4029-00","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","8/1/1997 12:00:00 AM","","Democratization|Decentralization|Public administration|Government reform|Political science research|Traditional societies|Political leadership|Governance|Societies in transition|Local level","Mozambique","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABQ066.pdf","527 KB","","","008580 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of a pilot program (8/94-8/97) to provide small grants, training, and TA to Mozambican NGOs.  The African-American Institute (AAI) implemented the program as part of the Mozambique Democratic Initiatives Project. Through 42 grants the program provided 32 national groups with training in strategic program planning, organizational and project development, and financial and administrative capacity-building.  The program proved useful not only for fledgling organizations, but also for more venerable and established national NGOs, which sometimes refined and modified some of their own operating procedures as a result of the AAI program.  AAI's markedly hands-on approach to program implementation was reinforced by the NGO Informative Bulletin, which spotlighted individual grantees, bringing their programs to the attention of other prospective donors and partners, and included interviews with selected donors on their program objectives and priorities.  Developed and revised by consultations with NGOs was the NGO Management Manual, which should be considered an innovative document that defines the nature and characteristics of an NGO, and provides recommendations on the administrative and strategic planning skills needed for an NGO to be responsive to its constituency and goals. In sum, the program contributed significantly to the ongoing national effort to inform, educate, and develop a potentially important constituency within Mozambique.  Community-based groups, local associations, and other national NGOs that participated in the program developed important horizontal institutional links, seeing themselves and their groups as members of an institutional community with similar interests and needs.  The evolutionary development towards a real and functioning civil society constituency of NGOs -- some representatives of which are considering political candidacy in the upcoming local elections -- is a major accomplishment of the AAI program.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","10/1/1997 12:00:00 AM","","Democratization|Indigenous private voluntary organizations|Civil society|Institution building|Pilot projects","Mozambique","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABQ067.pdf","2,189 KB","","","008580 - USAID.

"Evaluates the Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) program to promote public/private partnerships for infrastructure in the Philippines. Interim evaluation covers the period 1994-6/1997. The BOT program, the BOT Center (BOTC), and the BOT process have been reasonably successful in stimulating private investment in infrastructure projects.  Since 1990, 47 projects have been completed, implemented, or awarded to private companies under the BOT program; 14 are currently within the bidding process; and 26 are being prepared for competitive bidding or for negotiation as unsolicited proposals.  Most of the 47 completed projects are in the electric power sector, while all except two of the 26 projects that are being negotiated or prepared for bidding are in non-power sectors (expressways, water, solid waste, public markets, slaughterhouse, office building, and bus terminal). The BOT Center, established in 1994 to promote and coordinate the BOT program, has been effective.  Among its achievements are training for Implementing Agencies (IAs) and Local Government Units (LGUs) to manage BOT projects, and advice and assistance to develop and execute bids and evaluate bid responses from private investors.  The BOT Center has taken some promotional steps, such as organizing and participating in road shows abroad, to attract U.S. and other foreign investors.  The Center has also filled an important gap by acting as a useful information resource for private companies on government contacts and agencies involved in the approval process. The program has encountered some difficulties.  Local politics have at times obstructed a BOT project and that there has been a lack of consistency in the BOT process in some of these cases.  Also, insufficient time to prepare bids, vagueness of some bid terms, or poor construction of bids have been mentioned as constraints for U.S. and other foreign parent companies involved in budgeting and management approval for important investments by their subsidiaries abroad. Also, BOTC's promotional role has not been as aggressive as that of investment promotion agencies in many other developing countries.  This could be due to other agencies such as the Board of Investments (BOI) having the prime responsibility for attracting foreign investment in general; lack of BOTC experience in publicity, public relations, and foreign promotion; and inadequate funding.","Project title: Support for economic growth and institutional reform|(SEGIR)","Special Evaluation","Documents","AEP-4212-I-00-6027-00","","8/1/1997 12:00:00 AM","","Partnerships|Public sector|Private sector|Joint ventures|Economic infrastructure|Information centers|Business support services","Philippines","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABQ077.pdf","4,656 KB","000673 - International Science and Technology Institute, Inc.

"Evaluates project to strengthen the capability of Eritrea's public health system to deliver basic health and family planning services, and increase demand for, access to, and the quality of an integrated package of these services, especially by women and children.  Interim evaluation covers the period 9/94-12/97. During the first 2 years (Phase I), the project focused on building capacity at the zonal and central levels to enable the health system to more effectively use and absorb assistance to be provided during Phase II.  For the most part, Phase I objectives were realistic, given the project's time frame and its regional focus.  The contracts, delivery orders, scopes of work, results to date, and 1998 work plans from the cooperating agencies are supportive of the overall mandate of the project.  The TA provided by USAID and the Cooperating Agencies to the Ministry of Health (MOH) has been relevant to and supportive of project goals and objectives. Some Phase I activities, such as the integrated management of childhood illness (IMCI), were begun early.  Others, such as those relating to health financing, are still in very early stages of development, and the health management information systems and logistics activities have yet to be completed.  Several activities have been completed successfully.  A cadre of personnel has received training in strategic planning, management information systems, primary health care, family planning/reproductive health, and information, education, and communications.  This has resulted in an enhanced capacity of the MOH to deliver essential health and family planning services in the focus zones.  There is clear evidence that the MOH's capacity to produce action plans at the central and zonal levels has been increased. There are very few indicators of impact, due to the lack of related health statistics.  However, the 1995 Demographic and Health Survey established some important baseline measurements.  It is anticipated that the follow-on DHS could provide relevant and appropriate progress on impact. A major recommendation is to extend the project from 1/99 to 12/01.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","AEP-0085-I-00-6018-00","","12/1/1997 12:00:00 AM","","Public health care|Health delivery|Family planning services|Government departments|Institution building|Human capacity development","Eritrea","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABQ088.pdf","1,817 KB","003970 - Management Systems International, Inc.

"Documents achievements of and lessons learned from the AIDS Control and Prevention (AIDSCAP) Project, implemented from 8/91 to 12/97. Through 584 projects and activities in 45 countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America and the Caribbean, AIDSCAP trained more than 180,000 people in HIV/AIDS prevention skills and helped produce and disseminate 5.8 million videos, dramas, television and radio programs, advertisements, and printed materials reaching almost 19 million people. More than 254 million condoms were distributed or sold. Evaluations of programs in 19 countries suggest that these efforts had an impact on HIV knowledge and behavior.  In Cameroon, for example, the proportion of male students who reported having sex with more than one partner dropped from 53% to 36% in 3 years.  In Nepal, 62% of sex workers in the AIDSCAP intervention area reported using condoms with their most recent client in 1996 -- up from 35% in 1994 -- while reported condom use decreased among sex workers in non-target areas.  In Jamaica, the majority of the population now reports some kind of behavior change to avoid HIV infection, and the percentage of 12- to 14-year old boys reporting sexual experience fell from 59% to 41%. Behavior change communication (BCC) was at the heart of all AIDSCAP interventions.  Through TA, training, and a series of handbooks, the project promoted a shift from the old information, education, and communication (IEC) model to a more systematic approach that gives people the knowledge, skills, encouragement, and support they need for HIV risk reduction.  BCC efforts used the results of epidemiological and social science research to design interventions that called on the talents of artists, writers, actors, producers, counselors, and community members. AIDSCAP was one of the first organizations to adopt STD prevention and treatment as a primary HIV/AIDS prevention strategy.  The key accomplishment in this area was increasing the use of syndromic case management, an approach that has improved access to effective STD services for tens of thousands of people. The project also developed a methodology for conducting rapid ethnographic studies to improve communication between health care providers and their clients and tested several innovative approaches to expanding access to STD treatment. Although millions of free condoms were distributed, social marketing (SM) was the project's main strategy for increasing condom use.  Using commercial distribution systems and marketing techniques, AIDSCAP and its partners sold more than 222 million condoms in 8 countries.  AIDSCAP also revised the traditional SM model, developing innovative distribution strategies and opening thousands of nontraditional sales outlets to provide reliable, affordable condoms to those most at risk of HIV infection.  At the policy level, AIDSCAP strengthened local capacity to inform and influence policy, and used analytic tools to influence the HIV/AIDS policies of governments, businesses, and religious organizations in Kenya, Tanzania, Senegal, Indonesia, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua. Behavioral research laid the scientific foundation for effective HIV/AIDS prevention interventions and built the capacity of more than 150 social scientists and 100 institutions to conduct such research. The scale of the research ranged from small, program-related studies of behavior among specific populations to a large efficacy trial of voluntary HIV counseling and testing in 3 countries.  Research studies and pilot efforts produced recommendations and models for addressing emerging issues such as the role of structural and environmental activities in HIV risk reduction, prevention options for women in stable relationships, and linkages between HIV prevention and care. AIDSCAP refined existing methods of HIV/AIDS evaluation and tested innovative methods.  Detailed evaluation plans were designed for 19 country programs at the outset, and their implementation yielded important information and lessons for evaluators worldwide.  Tools to overcome some of the limitations of assessing progress in HIV/AIDS prevention were also developed.  In Bangkok, for example, AIDSCAP pioneered a survey methodology to monitor trends in risk behavior among different target groups; this technique has already been adapted in eight countries. An AIDSCAP Women's Initiative played an important role in raising awareness among policymakers and program managers about women's vulnerability to HIV infection and the need for more gender-sensitive prevention efforts.  AIDSCAP used gender analysis and training to help project staff and implementing partners meet the needs of both men and women.  It also worked with international and local women's organizations to empower women to protect themselves from HIV infection. AIDSCAP-sponsored research offered valuable insights into barriers to sexual communication, the role of peer support in sustaining use of the female condom, and ways to encourage dialogue between men and women. Management systems linking AIDSCAP headquarters, regional and country offices, and host country partners created the infrastructure needed for successful implementation of technical strategies.  Besides creating systems for planning, monitoring, financial management, and reporting for the world's largest international HIV/AIDS program, AIDSCAP built the capacity of more than 500 organizations to design, implement, and evaluate their own prevention projects.  Special initiatives were created to involve more local community-based organizations and U.S. PVOs in HIV/AIDS prevention, create indigenous NGOs to help sustain interventions, and develop models for integrating prevention into AIDS care and management programs. Since AIDSCAP's mandate was to build capacity in prevention, its experience in HIV/AIDS care and management was limited to a few pilot projects.  In Tanzania, AIDSCAP integrated prevention and care into community-based programs in nine regions.  Results suggest that programs are more effective when they address both prevention and care, but few studies have examined this linkage.  An AIDSCAP study conducted in Tanzania -- one of the first to assess whether providing support for people with HIV/AIDS can encourage them to adopt prevention measures -- offers important guidance for policymakers and program managers. AIDSCAP was also one of the first organizations to address the heightened risk of HIV infection among mobile populations.  Early interventions with truck drivers and their partners along major highways in Africa were expanded to reach sailors, migrant workers, military troops, and refugees. AIDSCAP's success in carrying out some of the world's earliest cross-border prevention projects in Asian border towns and port cities has inspired other donors to support and expand such efforts.  And the first large-scale, early HIV/AIDS intervention in a refugee camp -- an AIDSCAP-sponsored demonstration project in Rwandan refugee camps in Tanzania -- has served as a model for reaching vulnerable refugee populations in other parts of the world. The bulk of the report details key lessons and specific recommendations for strengthening HIV/AIDS efforts in these areas, as well as challenges to be met by the next generation of HIV/AIDS programs.

"Evaluates the MotherCare II project, designed to improve maternal and neonatal health care in developing countries.  Mid-term evaluation covers the period 9/93-10/96. MotherCare II is providing long-term assistance in seven  countries and has provided short-term TA to more than 15 other countries.  The project's high quality work has helped establish it as a respected and productive leader of institutions in the international development community working in reproductive health (RH), particularly women's health and neonatal health. Specifically, MotherCare II has:  (1) analyzed the rich experience of MotherCare I and disseminated its findings and recommendations to the international RH community; (2) broadened the focus of RH care to cover the continuum of women's health needs from before pregnancy, through pregnancy and delivery, to include neonatal care; (3) taken the lead in developing and applying several diagnostic tools to inform program design and implementation; (4) identified research needed to advance state-of-the-art RH technology and supported studies to determine the effectiveness of interventions; and (5) introduced numerous innovative efforts to improve the quality of RH service delivery at the local level. Demonstrable results of these efforts include studies on the reliability of self-reporting of obstetric complications; discussions with Muslim religious leaders in Indonesia aimed at establishing religious policies promoting RH objectives; and the adoption of RH norms and standards in Bolivia and in South Kalimantan, Indonesia.  In addition, a Russian state has adopted a policy promoting early exclusive breastfeeding and ""rooming in""; Safe Motherhood has been established as the theme of the 1996 Bolivia meeting of First Ladies of the Western Hemisphere.  The project has also established formal avenues of coordination and collaboration with the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank for the continued development of diagnostic tools, practice norms and standards, training curricula, and policy reform guidelines. In addition to numerous project-specific recommendations, the evaluation identifies a number of broader issues of concern to USAID programming.  (1) To increase Mission access to MotherCare, USAID should explore ways of alleviating procedural barriers in transferring Mission funds to the project.  (2) USAID should modify the MotherCare project and/or design a follow-on project to ensure that the PHN Center's Strategic Objective 2 -- increased use of safe pregnancy, women's nutrition, family planning, and other key RH interventions -- receives the level of support a ""flagship"" project can provide.  (3) Engaging national governments as partners, conducting and analyzing formative research, and applying research findings to collaborative intervention planning are all key elements of implementation.  USAID should help Mission officers appreciate the essential nature of each of these steps in the development process.  (4) ""Going to scale"" for MotherCare required qualitative, not merely quantitative changes.  USAID should consider extending the normal length of large applied research projects to 7-10 years. (5) USAID should also:  promote regular in-service training of local contractor professionals; use inservice training to upgrade rather than impart basic skills; and continue efforts to disseminate lessons learned, such as MotherCare's experience working directly with the newly empowered municipalities in the Bolivian model of decentralized government. Two comments from local RH professionals in the field characterize the overall conclusion of the evaluation team:  ""In RH, MotherCare means quality,"" and ""MotherCare must be protected because there is still so much to learn about RH.""","","Special Evaluation","Documents","CCP-3024-Q-00-3012-00","","2/1/1997 12:00:00 AM","","Maternal child health care|Infant health care|Reproductive health|Professional standards","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABQ114.pdf","106 KB","008485 - Basic Health Management International (BHM)","","008234 - USAID.

"Evaluates the Integrated Food for Development (IFFD) project, designed to upgrade the rural road network and promote disaster preparedness in Bangladesh.  Mid-term evaluation covers the period 1994- 12/97.  The project is being implemented by CARE and the Local Government Engineering Department (LGED). The project target for rehabilitated roads was decreased from over 13,040 kilometers to 11,000 so that the project could ensure that already completed roads would remain passable.  About 8,000 kilometers have been accomplished to date in over 1,400 roads.  At all sites visited, CARE and LGED staffs demonstrated an impressive understanding of -- and resolved -- the major environmental issues connected with the rural road network. On average, the results of road improvements have been positive, with passenger volume on the sample roads increasing by 35% and freight volume by 71%. However, the average masks positive results in some areas (e.g., increases in overall rickshaw traffic in four suboffices) and discouraging results in others (e.g., reduced overall truck traffic in all suboffices, even though some alignments are showing healthy increases). As a result of the road improvements, new shops have appeared on a number of alignments or in pre- existing markets, some farmers have shifted from one to three crops per year, and smaller farms have been able to set up a small shop along the alignment or rent/buy a rickshaw/van to enter the transport business.  Baseline studies by Helen Keller International (HKI) have shown positive outcome of the IFFD roads -- when well selected, constructed, and maintained -- in general and on food security (food access and food availability) specifically. Flood-proofing pilot activities, which took longer to initiate than planned, have included 431 (vs. the target of 501) homestead ground raisings, completion of a flood shelter, and the raising of tube wells to improve drinking water.  Other activities have targeted latrines, evacuation boats, road rehabilitation, tree plantations, home gardening, flood preparedness, health education, erosion and mound protection, and village planning. On the down side, the project has made insufficient use of economic and food security criteria in selecting the thanas in which to operate and the specific roads chosen within a thana; also, a significant percentage of IFFD roads do not remain passable after rehabilitation, reflecting the types of soils and the levels of rainfall in some areas, quality of construction, and the project's lack of a repair and maintenance budget.  Efforts during the remaining 2 years should focus on these areas. It is also recommended that the project: improve data collection and use; stop taking land without compensation; pay contractors for work completed in a more timely fashion; and expand the geographic information system activity to include the entire land area of Bangladesh as well as hydrologic and flood plain data.  Most importantly, the project should begin now to design a local-level maintenance program that could be a part of a follow-on program. Finally, continuing the rural infrastructure program, including a significant road component, can make a strong contribution to economic development and rural food security in Bangladesh.  USAID should authorize a follow-on Title II program for such a program.","Delivery order no. 801","Special Evaluation","Documents","AEP-0085-I-00-6020-00|OUT-AEP-I-801-96-00020-00|AEP-I-00-96-00020-00","","12/1/1997 12:00:00 AM","","Rural development|Roads|Road maintenance|Road transportation|Economic growth|Disaster preparedness","Bangladesh","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABQ128.pdf","5,734 KB","003366 - TvT Associates","","008511 - USAID.

"Evaluates the Environment Protection and Economic Development (EPED) Project, designed to lay the groundwork for long-term protection of Murchison Falls National Park (MFNP) and the Bugungu and Karuma Wildlife Reserves in Uganda.  Interim evaluation covers the period 7/96-8/97. The project is part of the Action Program for the Environment (APE) program. The project has been very successful in strengthening the capacity of Masindi District for effective planning and in the relocation of encroacher communities from the Karuma Wildlife Reserve.  Concerning district environmental and natural resources management planning, achievements at the village level were in excess of expectations, because the project director was able to leverage funds from the district and from another project.  Subcounty plans were not achieved due to lack of technical capacity at that level.  A Masindi District sustainable development plan has been drafted.  The district's resource planning efforts are serving as a model for the decentralization of environmental planning, impact assessment, and data collection for the National Environment Management Authority (NEMA). EPED has fully met the targets for the 20-month level of the monitoring and evaluation (M&E) framework and has set the stage for effective integration of the host community and the relocated population.  Measures for monitoring biodiversity in the reclaimed area have been put in place and baseline data have been collected.  The relocation of 125 families has successfully vacated an estimated 500 hectares of land in the Karuma Wildlife Reserve; this is a necessary, but not sufficient, element to ensure protected area integrity.  EPED has no provisions for ensuring monitoring and management of the vacated area by the Uganda Wildlife Authority (UWA), and currently has no resources to handle the remaining, existing encroachers (approximately 400 families) in the Karuma Reserve, not to mention Bugungu. The limited success in enabling buffer zone communities to sustain economic development can be attributed to the limited participation and effectiveness of the designated partner, the Masindi Seed and Grain Growers Association (MSGGA), though this problem is likely to be overcome now that new partners have been identified. In terms of sustainability, prospects are relatively good for making effective use of the planning structures and systems now being set up for district-, subcounty-, and village- level planning.  However, sustainability of these systems is not likely to be achieved in the 18 months remaining in the project. Even if EPED resources for this component had been considerably more generous, the capacity of the district and other partners to absorb these resources in a such a short time would have been in doubt.  It is too early to tell whether economic initiatives and empowerment will be sustainable.  Securing the integrity of the protected areas will take longer than the project life, and further input, and possibly a second phase of the project, is still required. A lesson learned is that, despite limited resources, and in contrast to past experience in Uganda, it is possible to relocate people out of protected areas in a humane manner. Relocation under EPED offers a model for similar situations where available, unclaimed lands exist in the vicinity, and can be modified for areas where land would have to be purchased. Although the EPED budget did not provide for the considerable attention that needs to be paid to the timing, logistics, emergency support, and other forms of social, economic, and psychological assistance, the project director was sure that these needs were met to the extent feasible.  Thus, this relocation experience repeats lessons learned elsewhere.

"Final evaluation of a project (10/95-9/97) implemented by World Relief (WR) to improve incomes and food security in targeted areas of Chicualacuala, Guija, Mabalane, Chigubo, and Massangena in Gaza Province, Mozambique.  The project included activities in four major areas: agricultural extension; livestock improvement and multiplication; crop diversification and improvement; and maintenance of the wells and pumps previously established by WR with USAID support. Although tight control over expenditures and WR's failure to match certain parts of the program prevented WR from fulfilling all of the grant's provisions, the project has achieved most of the expected outcomes set in the current grant amendment and made a significant contribution to the food security and economy of many rural households within the targeted area. The group extension model adopted, as well as the education and services provided, proved very effective.  The extension training and services have led to a significant overall improvement and growth of the small livestock population and, to a lesser degree, to improvements in local crop husbandry practices.  However, WR has also continued to provide free distribution of cereal and vegetable seeds, which tends to conflict with the more developmental (cost-recovery) approach promoted by the grant program. Only one of the project's interventions -- the introduction and/or redistribution of root crops, cassava, and sweet potato -- can be considered sustainable.  This achievement is considered to have had the single most important impact on sustainable food security of WR's initiatives in Northern Gaza.  Unfortunately, the veterinary service, specifically, poultry vaccination, and the well maintenance program, the two services on which much of the region's human and animal welfare now depend, are currently not locally sustainable.  The conclusion is that WR should attempt to maintain these two services for a year given the current failure to identify any alternative structures capable undertaking these roles.  If left unattended, many of the current achievements in both human and livestock health will be put at risk. WR's primary objective must be the development of local linkages and the identification of local counterparts to sustain the projects.

"Evaluates Phase I (1994-97) of a project to develop the Centre for African Family Studies (CAFS) as a sustainable African institution capable of transferring modern family planning and reproductive health technologies to programs in the public and private sectors.  Phase I focused on developing internal management and technology transfer systems and on institutional capacity building. CAFS has not achieved all of the required and desired indicators in the five targeted intervention areas (internal management, personnel management, financial management, technology transfer, and marketing). However, CAFS has made good progress and has achieved a sufficient level of performance to warrant a 1-year extension of Phase I.  During this period, CAFS should attain all required indicators and be poised to enter into the performance-based funding mechanism envisioned for Phase II. (Recommendations for achieving the desired level of performance in each of the five intervention areas are provided.) From the standpoint of income generation, training is CAFS' strongest product, followed by TA.  The success of training rests primarily on the competencies of individual trainers.  CAFS needs to focus attention more on developing sound products that respond to clearly identified market needs.  The determination of which products are ultimately 'best' will depend on a quality product, successful marketing, and available funding. TA has strong potential, as evidenced by a dramatic rise in its contribution to income generation over the past 4 months.  At present, conducting TA actually costs CAFS money.  TA opportunities must therefore be selected with discretion.  To address this situation, CAFS should also examine its ability to market TA in a package with training in order to make it profitable. Research services and products are weak in the Nairobi office and non-existent in the Lome office.  If CAFS continues to offer research as one of their services, it should focus on training-related research.","Task order 800","Special Evaluation","Documents","AEP-0085-I-00-6019-00","","12/1/1997 12:00:00 AM","","Private organizations|Family planning services|Institution building|Economic self sufficiency","Africa south of Sahara","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABQ254.pdf","3,898 KB","000356 - Checchi and Co.

"Evaluates project to expand the provision of family planning and maternal/child health (FP/MCH) services through NGOs, implement a national-level HIV/AIDS awareness and prevention program, and promote related policy dialogue.  Interim evaluation covers the period 6/93-11/97. Although the project's highly optimistic assumptions (e.g., regarding host government cooperation, Dominican economic development, and international funding) have been met only in part, the project has in general accomplished its objectives and reached proposed goals for service delivery, contraceptive distribution, information, education, and communication (IEC) strategy design and respective material development, and the training of participating NGO personnel.  The project and USAID/DR have also promoted health policy dialogue by providing training, facilitating and fostering contacts and coordination between NGOs and government institutions, and by promoting the exchange of information among NGOs and between NGOs and the Dominican government regarding both technical and administrative aspects and policy. Project impact on fulfillment of demographic and reproductive health (RH) goals is significant, although quantitative measurement is not possible.  Contraceptive use by women in union increased from 56% in 1991 to 64% in 1996, and knowledge among both men and women of the existence of FP methods is now almost universal (99%).  During the same period, however, the Total Fertility Rate (TFR) stagnated, decreasing only from 3.3 to 3.2, while the proportion of adolescents aged 15-19 who initiated procreation increased from 18% to 23%.  The reduction in TFR occurred in rural zones, where it decreased from 4.4 to 4.0 children, while remaining stable in urban zones at 2.8 children.  The mix of FP methods has evolved positively, especially with the increased use of all modern temporary methods. Overall, project activities have had a positive impact on RH, the most outstanding being the development of IEC strategies and materials for the promotion of RH and FP methods and the coordination activities carried out by the Interinstitutional Council and other committees. Other activities that have affected RH are the coordination and funding of the 1996 Demographic and Health Survey and the training in the use of this information.  Activities carried out in more densely populated areas and centers (e.g., free zones and marginal neighborhoods in principal cities) and the TA provided are having a positive impact.  It is likely that activities with lesser impact have been those implemented in remote, low-density, and low-income areas, although these are clearly the areas most in need.  The project, in fact, faces two conflicting policies: coverage of marginal areas vs. self-sufficiency.  This dilemma, which raises a problem for the NGOs, must be defined by USAID in a way that promotes both goals. The following lessons have been learned: (1) A very extensive project covering numerous areas and entities over a long period of time is difficult to manage, and requires full periodic revisions for the integration and coordination of its actions.  The project being evaluated is of this kind and would have benefitted from a full rather than merely partial revision. (2) Indicators and goals must be attainable and motivational, and should be revised if significant amendments to the project are made, or if project assumptions or country conditions change. Goals and indicators must be attributable to the project.  If possible, qualitative aspects should be included.  (3) The amount of time and effort spent in learning scientific and democratic processes for the development of IEC materials should be taken into account to make the processes more efficient.  (4) TA should be ongoing. New situations and changes require continuous technical support.  (5) Once experience is gained and maturity is increased, the agencies and the project should respond to this new stage, thus avoiding stagnation. (6) The project has made interventions in a wide range of populations. The resulting network should be used not only for FP, but also for other activities such as STD/HIV/AIDS prevention, the conducting of censuses, surveys, etc.","Project title: Population technical assistance (POPTECH)","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","11/1/1997 12:00:00 AM","","Family planning promotion programs|Family planning services|Disease prevention and control|Reproductive health|HIV/AIDS|Indigenous private voluntary organizations|Health policy|Policy dialogue","Dominican Republic","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABQ322.pdf","2,733 KB","","","008537 - USAID.

"Evaluates the civic awareness component of a project to promote participatory democracy in Peru (PARDEM project).  The civic awareness component, which is being implemented by the Group of Analysis for Development (GRADE), a Peruvian NGO, aims to enhance citizens' knowledge of their rights and responsibilities and of the workings of democratic institutions. Interim evaluation covers the period 1995-96. Due to the Government of Peru's unwillingness for institutional reform (which only surfaced after the project was designed), efforts to date have focused on civil society and grassroots initiatives. Specifically, GRADE has awarded 34 subgrants; organized more than 120 events, workshops, seminars, conferences and meetings; supported continuing radio programs on 24 stations across the country; supported 27 studies on civic awareness issues; and published close to 50,000 copies of books, bulletins, guides, and fascicles.  In the research subcomponent, first year studies had little impact on civic awareness activities; the situation improved during the second year. The subgrant program is the principal activity and targets NGO initiatives -- especially ongoing efforts of respected NGOs -- with the greatest potential for advancing the project purpose.  Funded projects have reached close to 70,000 direct beneficiaries, including members of the political elite, news media, labor unions, grassroots organizations, teachers and students, and the general public.  While 80% of these have only received information or sensitization to democratic issues, more than 12,000 have been actively involved in training and educational programs having a direct bearing on their daily occupations and lives. Major results have been obtained within the educational sector through programs to generate democratic coexistence within schools and effect curriculum changes in the system.  In qualitative terms, the subgrant program has successfully explored and implemented different means for introducing civic awareness and education to diverse audiences, in the process strengthening the capacity of the NGO community to address democratic governance. After a slow start, GRADE has been an efficient implementor and has made major progress in monitoring both the efficient use of program resources and outcome performance.  Its 1997 work plan, which is the most consistent and coherent of Phase I activities, concentrates resources in two lines of action -- civic education and democratic leadership -- that have proven to be most effective in promoting civic awareness, given country setting and available resources. In sum, the project addresses a major problem in Peru's development process and should be continued, though a new project design is needed to accommodate USAID country strategic objectives and the changes in country setting.","Spanish ed.: PD-ABW-839","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","9/1/1997 12:00:00 AM","","Democratization|Civic education|Public awareness|Indigenous private voluntary organizations|Grants|IEC","Peru","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABQ397.pdf","4,501 KB","","","008591 - USAID.

"Since 1954, the United States has provided $325 million in food aid to Honduras.  Of this amount, 40% has been provided under Title I (government-to-government concessional aid, most of it provided during the 1980s), 42% percent has been provided under Title II (project-specific aid), and 18% under Title III (food for development). Although it has accounted for only 16% of U.S. economic aid to Honduras (except for the period since 1994, when it accounted for half), food aid has helped achieve the overriding U.S. foreign policy goal of promoting stability in Honduras and isolating Nicaragua, its southern neighbor. On the other hand, this assistance contributed little to Honduras's long-term development.  Successive Honduran governments used the aid to postpone economic reform during the 1980s, notably putting off currency devaluation and thereby raising the ultimate cost of the economic adjustment made after 1990.  The Title II programs, including school feeding, maternal and child health, and food-for-work, were probably more effective, although there is little documentation on which to base this judgment; the effects of school feeding programs in particular have been questioned.  The maternal and child health and food-for-work programs have probably contributed modestly to the substantial improvement in basic social indicators in Honduras over the past 40 years.  Infant mortality, for example, has fallen dramatically, from 157/1000 in 1950 to 42/1000 in 1993.  This improvement has been associated with improved access to health services, increased availability of water and sewerage in rural areas, and modest economic growth. Although the development contribution of food aid before 1990 is decidedly mixed, its value since then has been substantial.  This increased effectiveness is due to several factors:  (1) The shift from Title I to Title III has increased the Mission's ability to program local currency in those areas and for those purposes for which food aid is an effective instrument.  (2) Food aid has been closely integrated with the rest of the assistance portfolio and has not been treated as a spigot for transferring additional resources to the country.  (3) The major provider of Title II food aid, CARE, has shown adaptability, great concern for effectiveness, and willingness to experiment to increase the development impact of food aid.  (4) The Mission has done careful and serious research into the effectiveness of alternative food aid approaches.  In addition, the research has sensitized the Honduran government to such approaches and has created a positive climate for better utilization of food aid. The following lessons have been learned: (1) Food aid programs can permit governments to postpone needed economic policy adjustments, thereby delaying the implementation of policies that lead to sustainable development.  (2) U.S. food aid can help achieve political stability in the short term by ensuring supplies and reducing food prices.  In the Honduran environment, this came at the expense of longer-term development success.  (3) Local currency generated from the sale of food aid can contribute to sustainable development when these resources are used to support sound, development-oriented policies and programs or are used by qualified NGOs to fund high-priority development activities. (4) Measuring program performance is important to program success. Where suppositions or hypotheses are not tested against actual outcomes, programs can continue for many years without achieving significant results.  (5) While the effect of food aid on nutrition cannot be isolated from other factors, the nutritional effectiveness of food aid has surely increased as better approaches and better targeting toward the at-risk population has occurred.  (6) Food aid programs can strengthen local governments and local NGOs. The latter can make important contributions to grass-roots development, participatory development processes, and local empowerment.  (7) Food aid need not be an inferior resource if the USAID Mission makes it an integral part of its development program, and if monetization permits sufficient flexibility for good program management.  (8) Food aid can be an important vehicle for supporting growth strategies and public resource transfers that differentially benefit lower income groups.

"Final evaluation of a project (1991-97), implemented by the International Center for Research on Women (ICRW), to support a small grants research program on factors placing women at risk of HIV/AIDS in developing countries. The project was a success.  Phase I provided grants to research teams from local NGOs or universities which used primarily qualitative research methods to examine the context and content of women's sexuality, sexual relations, and knowledge of HIV and AIDS in 13 developing countries.  ICRW staff synthesized research findings and used them to develop policy recommendations for USAID.  Results clearly showed the need to consider gender issues in HIV/AIDS prevention programming.  Phase II focused on training, materials development, interventions with target populations, and evaluation of the intervention process; efforts proved more demanding than the data collection stages, since research teams needed a great deal of assistance in interpreting the formative research findings. The use of multiple grants was well suited to Phase I objectives, allowing research to be conducted in a large number of sites and in quite different contexts.  The small scale of the research designs and the use of qualitative methods was highly appropriate for examining sensitive issues about which very little was known.  The participatory and community-based approach contributed enormously to the development of relevant and effective interventions. The small grants mechanism worked well in generating new knowledge about research methods and the context of exposure to HIV infection for low-income women.  The similarity across sites was striking.  Women were able and willing in small groups to discuss their own experiences with sexual relations and their fears about exposure to sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and HIV.  The process of peer group education had very positive effects on the self-image and self-confidence of participants. ICRW has clearly demonstrated that qualitative research can be used productively to better understand the context of women's vulnerability to HIV infection and to develop interventions appropriate to their situation. Besides confirming a number of often reported findings (especially about the lack of communication between men and women), project research documented that:  young women and men are not well-informed about reproductive health; women believe they have relatively little power to determine how and when they have sex with their male partners; and both women and men seem to accept a double standard regarding faithfulness to one partner.  In regard to the mother-daughter relationship, it was often found that a mother could not initiate conversations about sexual relations with her daughter without implying recognition of the daughter's sexual maturity, an admission that seemed difficult for many mothers.  Young girls who sought to discuss sexual matters with their mothers risked being labeled as ""loose"". Several aspects of the project are replicable:  (1) The strategy of beginning with a broadly defined understanding of the relevant issues with a general (rather than differentiated) population proved very productive.  (2) Giving small applied research grants to NGOs with a proven track record both built NGO capacity and improved NGO links to service populations.  (3) Using qualitative research methods (e.g., group discussions, though not necessarily focus groups) to explore sensitive issues and develop participatory interventions proved effective in influencing communities to examine difficult subjects. Planning interventions without knowledge of local concepts is not likely to produce change.  (4) Rapid analysis and diffusion of research results and of the effects of intervention should be encouraged.","Project title: Health technical services (HTS)","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","HRN-5974-C-00-3001-00|HRN-C-00-93-00001-00","","10/1/1997 12:00:00 AM","","Health research|Disease research|Anthropology research|Disadvantaged groups|Women|HIV/AIDS|Human sexual behavior|Sex roles|Gender analysis|Interpersonal relations|Interpersonal communication|Research methodology|Risk|At-risk groups","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABQ520.pdf","2,333 KB","003366 - TvT Associates|000981 - Pragma Corp.","","008291 - USAID.

"Since its establishment in 1995, USAID's Regional Center for Southern Africa (RCSA) has accumulated considerable experience in simultaneously running a regionwide program, providing REDSO-like services to bilateral missions and managing (residual) bilateral programs from a regional hub. Key lessons from this experience are detailed below. (1) Institutions involved in RCSA-type work should clarify why they are ""operating regionally.""  In other words, they should decide if they are pursuing management objectives (e.g., to save money or other resources by consolidating administration of bilateral programs) or programmatic ones (e.g., to permit engagement on regionwide issues). The two objectives necessitate two very different structural, budgetary, and staffing patterns. (2) Set realistic benchmarks and goals. Designing and managing regional work is more complex than bilateral work, and imposes greater management demands. In addition, both longstanding and reengineered Agency procedures often assume a bilateral context, and must be manipulated to meet the needs of a regional program.  As a result, it simply takes longer to set up and achieve results from a regional operation than it does from a bilateral one. (3) Do not count on operating expense (OE) savings.  While a regional program may have greater impact and possess some programmatic efficiencies, it will probably not yield significant OE savings per dollar of assistance delivered (the ""efficiency measure"" used by Agency management analysts to guide staffing and OE budget levels).  Regional operations require more information and staff time for the coordination of multiple partners and stakeholders, and regional institutions generally have lower capacities. (4) Clarify relationships up front. Regional programs are conducted in the same geographical space as bilateral programs.  Both regional and bilateral missions find the coordination of these two types of programs burdensome, the latter more so than the former. Good will does not suffice to overcome these burdens. Rather, responsibilities and resources must be explicitly allocated (e.g., OE for travel to regional meetings, staff to assist in reporting results with regional impact) to permit missions to carry out these additional tasks without undue cost to their own programs. (5) Develop a regional strategy.  In cases where it has been decided to conduct a regional program, a regional strategic plan should be developed to which both bilateral and regional office strategic plans are subordinate.  This should help to revise the perception of regional programs as anomalies in the world of development programming.

"Final evaluation of the Women in Politics (WIP) program (9/93-11/96), designed to enhance women's political participation in the Asia-Pacific region.  The program was implemented by The Asia Foundation (TAF). With a relatively modest investment, WIP's outputs have been numerous and effective.  This is attributed to a sound and locally sensitive design process, and is evident from the number of workshops participants, radio and TV shows, publications, and research findings, as well as from signs of institutional strengthening.  The high quality of programs and materials was confirmed through interviews.  A creative combination of regional and national initiatives has led to the establishment of new organizations that foster the political involvement not only of individual women but of organizations as well.  For the few projects that did not get off the ground or were slow-moving or unsatisfactory, TAF seems to have made adjustments. Several valuable lessons were learned.  On the broadest level, the WIP program has been flexible in responding to the variety of democratic openings in the region, and timely in focusing on involving women in local government; the response to WIP was high, and other donors are now showing a great interest in this area.  Also, TAF might consider adding 10% (a relatively small sum) to projects for follow-up activities to enhance outcomes and elicit better information on results. Unfortunately, some of USAID's procedures hindered effective programming; the most significant of these was the annual contracting arrangement with no assurance of continuity of funding, which forced the program to engage in short-term planning and resulted in late arrival of funds and rushed implementation. Several steps could be taken to enhance program impact.  In countries where the legislature is overwhelmed by the executive branch, focus should be placed on improving women's bureaucratic skills as well as on training the civil service in gender awareness.  Mass media messages might reach a wider audience if they were promoted ahead of time and included a wider variety of programs offered at better times slots and repeatedly, and through the distribution of videos.  Existing educational materials on advocacy, legal rights, awareness training, and voter education should be adapted to address the issues and processes faced by women who are now active in politics.  Program impact could also be improved by:  strengthening the connection of regional workshops with national initiatives (here use of the Internet is essential); working with different types of organizations to achieve different purposes; focusing programs on building women's political competence (and not merely their political awareness); micro-managing research activities; and finding cost-effective ways to dramatically enhance the numbers of beneficiaries.  Also, a solution must be found to the complex problem of attributing results in a program with multiple donors. Violence against women emerged as the most important issue facing women.  Other concerns include stereotyping, poverty, limited job opportunities, and lack of education and vocational skills.","Cited in the 1997 Agency Performance Report: bibliography of|chapter 'Evaluation findings and lessons'|Related document: PD-ABN-044","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","2/1/1997 12:00:00 AM","","Women|Women in development|Political participation|Educational media|Mass media|Institution building","Asia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABQ618.pdf","2,886 KB","000278 - The Asia Foundation (TAF)","","008271 - USAID.

"Evaluates a grant provided under the War Victims Fund to the Consortium/LAO DPR -- comprising Save the Children/US, World Education, and World Learning Inc. -- to assist the war-torn Xieng Khouang Province in northeastern Laos in providing emergency medical care and awareness education in the face of the dangers posed by unexploded ordnance (UXO). Interim evaluation covers the period 9/95-7/97. Substantial progress has been made in developing the ability of local health facilities and district hospitals to provide emergency medical/surgical care and related services for victims of UXO and other traumatic injuries in Xieng Khouang province.  If these achievements are to be sustained, the Xieng Khouang provincial health service will need to develop an administrative structure that can continue the project's work of planning, implementing, and evaluating such activities.  The health service will need training to enhance its administrative and technical capacity to perform these tasks. The project has also made considerable progress in developing and implementing a primary school curriculum that teaches children the dangers of unexploded ordnance and how to prevent UXO accidents. Before the program can be integrated into the education system its effectiveness will need to be proven through the completion of the field testing that is already in progress.  The program should promote the use of participatory educational techniques at the provincial training of trainer and classroom levels.  The program's impact should be monitored through pre- and post- testing in targeted schools and through a simple checklist for district technicians.

"Final evaluation of a project (1991-97) to promote conservation and sustainable development in Peru's Pacaya Samiria National Reserve (PSNR).  The project was implemented by The Nature Conservancy (TNC) and the Peruvian Foundation for the Conservation of Nature (PRONATURALEZA). Despite the short implementation period and other problems, the project, on balance, was a success, with significant achievements. There is evidence of a change not only in attitude but also in the management and utilization of the PSNR.  Different development agents and the local population seem to have gained a better understanding of the PSNR's importance and of the need to develop adequate resource management experiences and instruments.  Also, local institutions are capable of responding to the project's current ""low intensity"" stage, and the community groups (CECODES), though fewer, will continue to support development activities and to assist guard posts and park rangers at least until December of this year.  While it is difficult to ensure that the project will have an impact on the recovery of strategic species such as taricaya turtles and black alligators due to the lack of baseline information and continuous monitoring, efforts to promote awareness of the importance of these species and to disseminate recovery and management techniques have led other institutions and the people in general to do the same.  The general opinion among local institutions is that the project has helped improve the management of the PSNR by providing direct area administration assistance, and has conducted significant research on natural resource management and local economic development. On the down side, the project's uncertain financial situation makes it clear that no adequate plans or provisions have been made for its imminent conclusion.  Also, since both PRONATURALEZA and TNC are more experienced in conservation than in community development, socioeconomic efforts were not as successful as was the management of the PSNR resources. Specifically, income-generating activities were not properly weighted within the context of a market economy nor in terms of technological opportunities and proposals.  Neither was sufficient care taken in developing and evaluating participatory methodologies to guarantee local involvement in activity design/implementation, decisionmaking, and management.  Additionally, efforts to implement planning and project monitoring activities never materialized.  Priority was placed on programming.  Finally, the logframe prepared halfway through the project is overly ambitious and the indicators respond neither to the scenario analysis, the implementation time, nor project resources. Numerous lessons were learned:  (1) The project's most obvious achievements were not the activities in which the greatest efforts and funds were invested, but those in which the working methodology was correctly implemented and in which local people were involved, e.g., the management of turtles, palm trees, and community fishing.  (2) When designing a project, it is important to analyze the implementation periods for expected impacts, not merely activities and goals.  (3) Planning instruments should be simple and dynamic in order to guarantee adaptation to new scenarios.  (4) Implementing activities with local people requires a flexible and realistic strategy, specifying at the very least:  the approximate number of dwellers directly or indirectly involved and the approximate number of people influenced by the project's activities; the location of towns or communities that can be used as demonstration centers for these activities; and periodic participatory evaluation techniques for quickly identifying local opinion regarding the progress of the activities.  (5) The fact that technicians and local population live together, as occurs in the CECODES, is no guarantee that their relations will be fruitful. Sometimes it is necessary to preserve a distance between the two in order to avoid internal pressures or to prevent technicians from becoming motivated by personal commitments rather than technical criteria.","Spanish ed.: PD-ABR-052|SO4 - Improved environmental management in targeted sectors","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","12/1/1997 12:00:00 AM","","Natural resource management|Natural resource conservation|Natural resource utilization|Protected environmental areas|Community participation|Income generation|Private voluntary organizations|Indigenous private voluntary organizations","Peru","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABR051.pdf","3,113 KB","002994 - PRONATURALEZA","","008591 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of a project (9/94-12/97) to promote democratic elections in Peru.  The International Foundation for Electoral Assistance (IFES) was the implementing agency. IFES improved operations of the National Electoral Tribunal (Jurado) in carrying out the 1995 general election, though problems remained in areas such as training poll workers. After the 1995 elections, IFES worked with the Jurado, the National Office of Electoral Processes (ONPE), and the National Registry of Electoral and Civil Identity (IDENTIDAD) to build up the institutional capacity of the newly defined electoral system. The municipal elections of 1995/96 were carried out with a reasonable degree of organization, despite jurisdictional disputes.  Lessons learned from the 1995 elections were taken into account in such areas as the development of training materials. However, a crisis mentality still prevailed and the testing of messages that makes for good educational material were still not incorporated into design efforts.  IFES's attempts to help all three new organizations develop an organizational culture adequate to their responsibilities have had mixed success.  The Jurado has not instituted the organizational changes needed to fulfill its new roles successfully. ONPE has begun to talk of the need for strategic planning; has simplified its organizational structure, reducing levels of hierarchy and the number of permanent staff; and begun to incorporate the concept, if not the effective practice, of testing its training materials. IDENTIDAD is concerned with its capacity to deal with the public, with public acceptance and understanding of the changes proposed, with the political dimensions of its role (as witness the recent controversy over enrolling parties), and with its internal capacity to meet its management requirements.  A further critical concern is financing.  All three entities receive far less from the Government of Peru than what they consider required to carry out their tasks.  The proposed solutions suggest what may amount to a de facto poll tax -- which would impeded voting by those who already have limited access, namely, the poor, above all the rural poor, who constitute a significant portion of the country's population. In the civil society component, IFES supported a variety of NGOs in such areas as transparency in polling processes, dialogue on the election issues, citizen participation in general and in rural areas, and the role of the press in the electoral process.  The bulk of the more than $500,000 for this component went to a single organization (Transparencia) -- with impressive results.  Transparencia carried out important functions as a poll watching agency for the national and municipal elections, establishing a reputation for objectivity across the political spectrum.  Its multimedia center is an important source of data regarding elections.  Another NGO group, SER/CEAPAZ, undertook an important effort to increase voter awareness in rural areas.  However, these efforts are not likely to be sustained under present circumstances.  Transparencia is in an extremely precarious financial situation, and SER must support its existence by other activities. Other NGOs are either too weak to continue or are directed elsewhere. While support for the NGOs was not intended to promote sustainability, it would certainly have been an advantage, and perhaps a necessity, for future democratic development if civil society organizations with reputations for honesty, objectivity, and the capacity to perform were present within the electoral process. Finally, aside from developing a book and other materials and calling attention to the issues through some well-publicized fora, the policy dialogue component achieved no concrete result. Needs for the future are to:  promote greater access of economically disadvantaged citizens, above all in rural areas, to the electoral process; enhance the civic culture of citizens as voters; enhance the capacity of citizens, as administrators of the electoral process, to limit the loss of votes by nullification; and promote a policy dialogue that enhances the likelihood of a more comprehensible process for selecting members of Congress by bringing the individual voter closer to his or representative.

"Evaluates project (9/90-3/95) to provide policy analysis, planning, and implementation assistance in support of economic reform in Peru (PAPI project). Final evaluation covers the period 9/90-5/97 against a PACD of 6/97 or, more likely, 12/97. The project has contributed appreciably to the design and implementation of policy reform, not only enabling Government of Peru (GOP) entities to address needs difficult to deal with under other funding vehicles, but also offering a flexible and quick-response mechanism for responding to these needs. On the other hand, project activities, while technically sound, have not been sufficiently integrated into the policy priorities either of the USAID Mission or the GOP; no clear strategic framework or specific criteria guide the selection of activities to be funded. In fact, the management of project funds as a semiannual ""sweepstakes"" or competition has severely impaired the ability to use project support in a programmatic fashion (e.g., by combining research, training, consensus-building, and dissemination). The result has been a fairly large number of (mostly) useful activities lacking a coherent thrust that would optimize policy impact; attainment of end of project (EOPS) targets, as outlined in amendment no. 5 to the ProAg, has been uneven. Also, even after the attempts at streamlining under amendment no. 5, the project structure is complex and confusing for the executing agencies. Poor communication between members of the PAPI team has reduced the project's efficacy and resulted in poor morale. USAID contributed to the confusion by issuing a project implementation letter that significantly realigned responsibilities, but did not modify the TA contract accordingly. As a result, for almost 2 years, two distinct project entities -- the Technical Unit and the institutional contractor -- could claim a USAID mandate for taking the lead on technical issues. Lessons learned are as follows: (1) A project providing a flexible, quick-response mechanism to allow government agencies to address emerging policy reform issues is a valuable element of development assistance. Properly used, such a project can advance USAID/Peru's strategic objectives (SOs) by focusing on cross-cutting themes and areas of common priorities. (2) This type of project places a premium on strategic management procedures in order to ensure a common understanding of priorities and procedures among all participants. Since policy priorities change over time, especially in a period of rapid transition, such a project needs a built-in capability to review specific objectives and areas of concentration. Without this capability, objectives once appropriate may no longer apply, allowing for a softening of the project focus and the possible inclusion of activities that do not reflect current policy priorities. (3) To realize the policy dialogue potential of a project like this, USAID/Peru must maintain direct control over the structure that gives the project substantive direction. A ""hands-off"" approach entails the risk of spending resources on activities that relate only marginally to the Mission strategy. Relying primarily on USAID-funded counterparts for strategic leadership complicates matters, because that group is neither fully part of the GOP structure nor subject to USAID oversight. The project management structure that has emerged under PAPI has proven ineffective for promoting USAID/Peru-GOP policy dialogue. (4) If a ""ronda"" system is used in this type of project (that is, if activities are selected from requests after solicitation), proactive outreach is required to encourage submissions that reflect policy priorities and to make certain that potential applicants clearly understand these priorities and related selection criteria. Also needed is a mechanism to allow for more programmatic support (follow-up or the combination of research, training, consensus-building, and dissemination). (5) Technical and administrative guidance, as well as monitoring, should be simple and straightforward so as to reduce costs and confusion and facilitate better internal communications and closer Mission monitoring. (6) In the Peruvian context, funding public and private sector activities under one ProAg while separating the entities supervising the activities can create friction and hamper rather than promote constructive policy dialogue, though less so if both technical direction and administration are more closely controlled by USAID/Peru itself.","Title in header: Evaluation of the PAPI project|SO2 - Increased incomes of the poor|Spanish executive summary: PD-ABW-844","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","5/1/1997 12:00:00 AM","","Economic policy|Policy analysis|Economic reform|Development planning|Implementation|Technical assistance|Development project design|Development project management|Contract management|Policy dialogue|Strategic planning|Strategic objectives|USAID","Peru","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABR060.pdf","2,544 KB","006381 - Abt Associates, Inc.","","008591 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of the health component (4/94-9/96) of Save the Children Federation's (SCF) Community-based Health and Rural Development (CBHRD) Project, implemented in 26 communities in Xai-Xai and Bilene Districts, southern Gaza Province, Mozambique. The water, education, and agriculture components were evaluated separately in 10/97. The CBHRD health component focused on:  (1) training community health workers; (2) rehabilitating and constructing health posts, maternities, and health staff housing; and (3) strengthening linkages between 26 rural communities and the formal health system.  Objectives and projected outputs in all three areas were achieved and, in many cases, exceeded.  SCF census data show that over 104,000 beneficiaries were served by this project.  However, access to new facilities was impeded by lack of qualified staff; also, weaknesses were noted in communications between SCF and Government of Mozambique (GOM) and Ministry of Health (MOH) colleagues. Community perceptions of the impact of the CBHRD project were consistently positive and knowledge levels about beneficial health practices appeared to be high.  A rough comparison with non-SCF villages showed knowledge and practices regarding diarrhea management and sexually transmitted disease (STD)/HIV prevention to be of significantly lower quality than in SCF impact areas. Sustainability of CBHRD interventions will rely not only on community motivation levels, but on the re-allocation of GOM contributions to the health sector and a review of MOH training, supervision, and service delivery priorities. Additionally, communities must be held to more rigorous standards of participation for volunteer community health providers and promoters. Key recommendations for future health programming include the following:  (1) Encourage the District Health Directorate (DDS) to schedule regular refresher and supplementary training events for community health workers; all training events should include a training of trainers (TOT) component.  (2) Document all GOM commitments to provide new or rehabilitated facilities with properly qualified staff. (3) Explore alternative pharmaceutical supply mechanisms.  (4) Require target communities to submit plans for participating in development activities as well as for compensating volunteer health promoters and providers.  (5) Promote donor dialogue with GOM regarding necessary increases in health spending.

"Evaluates the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project (BDFFP) undertaken by the Smithsonian Institution's (SI) National Museum of Natural History as part of USAID's Global Climate Change Program (GCC) in Brazil.  The BDFFP aims at studying the effect of the size of forest fragments on biological diversity.  Interim evaluation covers the period 9/93- 9/96. Although the original experiment with forest fragments has been overtaken by events, the SI program is now adapting to the new circumstances and is proceeding well. Specific findings are as follows: (1) With regard to partnerships, SI is aware of its relative isolation in the past and is taking steps to establish closer links with the National Institute of Amazon Research (INPA) and other institutions. The undertaking is complex and requires skills beyond those of pure scientists who know little about local realities, but the project is on the right track.  (2) The project has been more oriented toward the scientific community in Brazil than to local or regional needs, but it has great potential to contribute to local institutional capacity to implement sustainable development in tropical forest areas and is moving in that direction.  (3) As in the case of partnerships and capacity-building, effective use of existing mechanisms has been a problem in the past but the project management is learning how to overcome the obstacles. The general lesson that can be drawn from the SI experience is that a project can change in very significant ways as it moves from conception to implementation to maturity, and that making it appropriate and sustainable depends to a very large extent on adaptation to local needs. Such adaptation can be learned the hard way or it can be stimulated by the program. The GCC Program is contributing to adaptation of the SI project and can contribute even more.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","512-0784-O-00-5924-01","","8/1/1997 12:00:00 AM","","Global warming|Natural resource conservation|Biological diversity|Tropical rain forests|Environmental research|Institutional linkages|Partnerships|Scientific cooperation|Local level|Human capacity development|Climate change","Brazil","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABR353.pdf","40 KB","005806 - Instituto Sociedade, Populacao e Natureza","","008517 - USAID.

"Evaluates activities of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) under the environmental impact assessment (EIA) component of USAID's Global Climate Change Program (GCC) in Brazil.  EPA activities focused on delivering training courses, developing guidelines for EIAs related to economic activities associated with forest clearing and mining, and providing TA to conduct a pilot EIA.  Interim evaluation covers the period 8/91- 9/96. In 8/93, in cooperation with the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), the Environmental Law Institute (ELI), the State University of new York (SUNY), and the U.S. Forestry Service, EPA delivered an intensive 3-week ""train the trainers"" course in the United States for 17 Brazilian environmental professionals on the EIA process.  Two follow-up EIA courses were conducted in Brazil for a total of 50 participants from governmental, non- governmental, and academic institutions, with six of the Brazilian trainees acting as trainers, assisted by EPA and the other GCC grantees.  The fact that over 200 applications were received for these courses indicates the importance attributed to the subject and the need for this kind of training in the Amazon region.  Several of the individuals trained in these courses were instrumental in conducting public hearings for a proposed kaolin mine in the State of Para.  As a result of these hearings, mining plans were modified and state-level legislation was proposed to create a check-off fund from mineral revenues to be applied to local environmental projects. The sequence of training activities appears to have gone well and has strengthened awareness of the importance of the topic and enhanced the multiplier effect of the training.  All trainees gave both the content and the methodology of the training good ratings, though some participants expected that the training would focus on specific tools and techniques for conducting EIAs, rather than on the overall EIA process.  This indicates a strong demand for a course on specific tools for EIA, in addition to the one on the EIA process. Project activities that still need to be completed include: identification and support of a local organization to serve as repository for course materials and EIA information; pilot delivery of the EIA tools course; a workshop on the use and development of EIA review guidelines for at least one economic sector in the Amazon; and a final report on project activities. Two lessons were learned.  (1) To be successful, the EPA component of the GCC Program must:  (a) create partnerships that build capacity and expertise for resolving Brazilian environmental problems; (b) help build local institutional capacity and participation of governmental bodies and civil society in environmental management, in particular in the EIA process; and (c) make more effective use of existing mechanisms (e.g., the Memorandum of Understanding with IBAMA, the Brazilian environmental institute, to increase EPA's impact and presence in Brazil.  (2) The collaboration on EIA training has gone particularly well, with important results in increased awareness and understanding of the assessment process, but EPA's long-term experience in this area could be used more effectively with a larger in-country presence.  The opportunities that exist within EPA's International Program should be better disseminated and the agency should strengthen its contacts in Brazil.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","512-0784-O-00-5924-01","","8/1/1997 12:00:00 AM","","Global warming|Environmental impact|Impact assessment|Technical training|Participants|Pilot projects|Mining industry|Land clearing|Forests|Partnerships|Training personnel|Climate change","Brazil","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABR354.pdf","23 KB","005806 - Instituto Sociedade, Populacao e Natureza","","008517 - USAID.

"Evaluates activities of the Woods Hole Research Center under USAID's Global Climate Change Program (GCC) in Brazil.  Activities focused on developing natural resource management tools for an emerging network of forest-margin farm communities and on expanding and strengthening a network of Amazonia-based scientists trained in ecology and interested in intervening in public affairs.  Interim evaluation covers the period 9/93-9/96. Project activities have been carried out primarily in the states of Para and Acre via research-based workshops, courses, and publications; formal university training; and participation in current regional debates regarding the utilization of Amazonian natural resources.  The activities include agricultural intensification and land-use planning along the Capim River; predicting forest-fire risk; preventing accidental forest fires; beginning development of a functioning extractive reserve; inventorying resources in the Rio Gelado Settlement Project; improving the planning of industrial mining in Para; and training in forest utilization, forest recovery, and biotic impoverishment. Overall results are as follows: The Center has made considerable progress in shifting from a highly independent unit responsible only to headquarters to an institution with diverse local commitments. Reconciliation of the various vertical and horizontal partnerships, an imperative for achieving broader impact and sustainability, will still take some work. To make more effective use of existing mechanisms, the Center must become more involved with government agencies of various kinds.  Even in the Amazon, the Brazilian government has financial, human, and physical resources that are infinitely greater than those involved in international cooperation. Outside resources should be used to catalyze changes that influence more appropriate allocation of national resources. More effective use of existing mechanisms should also involve NGOs or networks that operate above the community level; the latter is not sufficient for achieving impact in a region the size of the Amazon. Finally, work with a variety of governmental and non-governmental organizations is time-consuming and therefore has direct and indirect costs.  Especially as the project moves to full operation, USAID should not hesitate to allow for such transaction costs. The general lesson learned is that science and community action can be combined.  The challenge at this point is to achieve results that have broader impact beyond the immediate community or organization with which the scientists work.

"Final evaluation of a maternal health/child survival (MH/CS) project implemented 10/93-9/97 by Africare in two rural local government areas (LGAs), Guyuk and Fufore, in Adamawa State, Nigeria. Assessment of project accomplishments has suffered from the inadequacy of the survey instrument in generating the necessary data. In terms of survey estimates, the Fufore area consistently recorded lower achievement rates than Guyuk, probably because project activities commenced a year later in Fufore.  Achievement in providing water and sanitary facilities was very low, with only 15.2% of deserving villages being provided with water and sanitary facilities.  The survey's key CS indicators show that in Guyuk there were considerable increase in prenatal visits (60.3-81.3%), oral rehydration therapy/solution utilization for diarrhea (33.9-57.O%), immunization coverage (14.0-44.9%), and exclusive breastfeeding (86.0-92.2%) than in Fufore, where the corresponding rates were 56.4-59.8%, 39.5- 47.4%, 15.2-32.3%, and 84.1-83.3%.  Guyuk, however, recorded poorer performance than Fufore in contraceptive usage, literacy, and management of diarrhea. Generally, the two LGAs showed little or no changes in most indicators between baseline and final evaluation rates. AFRICARE has laid a solid foundation for the delivery of MH/CS services in the context of primary health care in four districts, two each in Guyuk and Fufore, in the form of staff development, community mobilization for support, and the creation of a demand for the services. However, the infrastructure and resources needed to operationalize, sustain, and replicate this effort are yet to be put in place, tried, and developed. Sustainability has suffered from inadequate post- training follow-up. Nonetheless, house numbering and home-based records are already in place in all houses in the project area. A good number of village health workers and traditional birth attendants have been trained, and a new cadre of community birth attendants has been introduced.  Village and district development committees have been mobilized to co-manage MH/CS activities. Demand for immunization, prenatal care, and water and sanitation services has increased, though largely as a result of direct project input. Several lessons were learned:  (1) The listing and timing of activities in the Detailed Implementation Plan (DIP) should be based on a path analysis that orders the relationship between the grouping, ordering, and sequencing of activities to the achievement of the overall project goal.  A path analysis will also determine whether the implementation plan is feasible. (2) A contract spelling out the expected contributions of all collaborating parties at the various stages of implementation should be signed by all the collaborators as part of the planning process.  (3) A centralized coordination/steering committee should be institutionalized for projects expected to collaborate with institutional partners.  (4) The job descriptions and services of all project staff should be regulated, supervised, and coordinated to ensure high levels of productivity, efficiency, and commitment.  (5) Projects should be provided with increased technical support input and oversight, e.g., to prepare an action/work plan after the DIP technical review, assess project progress between evaluations, and, when constraints prove insurmountable, request a redesign of components.  (6) Project strategies should be designed not to ""help"" but to ""develop"" communities.  If the aim is to increase demand for permanent services, the community's capacity for such demand should be the project's first focus.  (7) Time should be devoted at the beginning to orient staff and set tone and structure; acquaint staff with organizational policies, project objectives, and job descriptions; and develop staff skills in community-oriented primary care, participatory approaches for community diagnosis and program implementation, team development, project planning, and evaluation.  (8) Discouraging incentive allowances for participating in workshop/training to salaried project staff will help screen staff for interest and commitment to service. A sustainability plan is presented in conclusion.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","FAO-0500-A-00-3024-00","","9/1/1997 12:00:00 AM","","Child survival activities|Maternal health care|Health care coverage|Performance measurement|Project sustainability|Demand","Nigeria","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABR690.pdf","337 KB","000235 - Africare, Inc.","","007746 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of a child survival (CS) project implemented 8/93-7/97 by Esperanca in the Chaco area of Bolivia. The project achieved the vast majority of its objectives and ranks in the superior category of CS projects.  Significant advances have been made in:  the use of services for diarrheal disease control and pneumonia; mothers' knowledge of dehydration and the signs of pneumonia; the percentage of children registered in the growth monitoring program and weighed in the past 6 months; exclusive breastfeeding for 6 months and early lactation just after birth.  Also, the provision of two doses of Vitamin A to children aged 12-24 months has improved, and rates of malnutrition and inadequate growth have declined dramatically; this is unusual for CS projects without a supplemental feeding program.  There have been marked increases in the number of women receiving two or more pre-natal visits and in delivering with the help of trained birth attendants.  On the down side, more work needs to be done regarding immunization coverage.  The new project area in Entre Rios has shown a dropoff between the first and third doses of DPT and polio, as well as in the completion of the full series of childhood immunizations by age 24 months.  However, much of this apparently low coverage appears to be due to loss of the immunization card.  The high percentage of indigenous Amer-Indian people in this zone who do not speak Spanish and who are not familiar with the use of the card means that impact surveys based on the existence of the card will show artificially low coverage rates. The project's impressive achievements stem from several factors:  the use of social investigation and social marketing techniques; completion of the project's training and supervisory objectives for all levels of health care workers; the involvement of trained traditional healers, traditional birth attendants, and a small army of village-level health volunteer promoters that has expanded coverage to areas without health posts; better organization of services at health centers and posts; continuity of project staff; major investments by the Government of Bolivia in constructing and equipping health facilities where none existed before; enactment of the Law for Popular Participation, which has put fiscal resources in the hands of local community governments; and the commitment of local communities and of the National Health Service to the project.  Sustainability at the 80-90% level has occurred in the older project zones where services have been active for 9-10 years.  However, in the new project zone of Entre Rios where service has only been active for 4 years, sustainability is only at the 50-- 60% level, even though excellent gains have been made in service coverage. The experience gained early on in this project has contributed to improved coverage in the new zone, but sustainability in an entirely new area takes many more years than originally envisioned.  Esperanca is now expanding into Camargo, a highland indigenous area with Aymara and Quechuan-speaking Indians that has a quite different social and cultural setting than the lowland Indian population of the Chaco.  As for Entre Rios, an additional 2-3 years of TA would improve sustainability in this project zone. Lessons learned are as follows:  (1) The social investigation and social marketing techniques using qualitative assessments are as essential to program success as is technical capacity building.  It is as important to understand cultural perceptions of health and to design educational and mass media approaches to address them as it is to train health workers in technical services.  (2) Administrative organization of the health services at all levels is a key ingredient to success, especially at the point-of-service level.  Major gains were made only in the last stage of the project, when supervisory visits were able to focus on detailed administrative organization at the health post and center levels.  This is increasingly important as the focus shifts from CS to integrated management of the sick child.  (3) Critical elements of success include effective supervision; joint planning, implementation, and evaluation of program activities between project staff, Ministry of Health personnel, and community counterparts (including NGOs wherever possible); the use of mass media; and feedback of information to the communities.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","FAO-0500-A-00-3019-00","","7/1/1997 12:00:00 AM","","Child survival activities|Maternal child health care|Immunizations|Disease prevention and control|Diarrhea|Respiratory diseases|Growth monitoring|Breastfeeding|Infant nutrition|Dietary supplements|Vitamin A|Prenatal care|Child delivery|Paramedical education|IEC|Project sustainability|Pneumonia|Needs assessments","Bolivia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABR707.pdf","815 KB","007936 - Esperanca, Inc.","","007746 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of a child survival (CS) project implemented 10/94-9/97 by PLAN International Austro in the provinces of Cafiar and Azuay in the Ecuadorian Andes.  The evaluation is based in part on a 9/97 knowledge, practice, and coverage (KPC) survey. The project's education efforts increased knowledge indicators in the areas of nutritional improvement and growth monitoring, control of diarrheal diseases, and pneumonia control.  Feeding practices have improved, with significant progress in early and exclusive breastfeeding over the life of the project.  Growth monitoring frequency has more than doubled since the project began, from 21.7% to 52.7% among children O-23 months of age.  Use of oral rehydration solution (ORS) packets has increased 30%, and goals were exceeded regarding mothers' knowledge of the danger signs of severe diarrhea.  Knowledge levels of the danger signs of pneumonia have also increased significantly among mothers, and 80.8% take their children directly to a health services facility during a suspected pneumonia episode, up from 44.8%.  One of the project's most important achievements was the development of a strong and dedicated health team.  The recommendations of the midterm evaluation were followed very closely, resulting in the successful expansion of all four project interventions from 20 to 130 communities. The main constraints have been as follows:  (1) There has been little progress regarding immunizations:  most vaccine levels have remained statistically static, and none of the original implementation objectives has been met.  The percentage of mothers immunized with at least two doses of tetanus toxoid vaccine is particularly low, 9.0% vs. a goal of 40%.  (2) The project had difficulty tracking and analyzing the results of its interventions.  The health information system, while greatly improved, is still not adequately utilized, e.g., in following vaccination trends and in undertaking long-planned, long-needed, and long-postponed anthropometric investigations.   (3) Utilization of community health workers (CHWs) for both diarrhea cases (17.1%) and pneumonia control (12.3%) is very low, indicating possible problems with the people in whom a great deal of time and effort has been invested. The project's main constraints stemmed from an overly ambitious project design, which called for the implementation of four CS interventions in 147 dispersed rural communities, and for a new health team with little or no previous experience in managing CS projects. PLAN's association with a number of key counterparts -- the Ministry of Health (MOH), Rural Social Security (RSS), the University of Cuenca (UC), and the communities themselves -- guarantees a good degree of continuity.  Project training has enhanced the technical skills and management expertise among all of the players concerned, and sustainability will be strengthened through the transfer of a number of project activities to the MOH and the UC, e.g., CHW supervision and educational message development concerning the key interventions.  The main mechanism for cost recovery has been the sale of essential medicines and provision of first aid by the CHWs at the community health post.  However, this system could be made to function better as an incentive for the CHWs.  One possibility is the RSS's interest in promoting community pharmacies, which would include more training for CHWs and allow them to earn more money. PLAN Austro staff will continue to provide educational and technical services to the MOH and beneficiary communities, and to support the cadre of CHWs. Also, a reproductive health component will be added over the course of the coming year.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","FAO-0500-A-00-4044-00","","9/1/1997 12:00:00 AM","","Child survival activities|Maternal child health care|Health education|Mothers|Nutrition improvement|Growth monitoring|Disease prevention and control|Diarrhea|Respiratory diseases|Infant nutrition|Breastfeeding|Oral rehydration therapy|Disease detection|Personnel|Pneumonia","Ecuador","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABR727.pdf","489 KB","009752 - Plan International Austro","","007746 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of the Eduque a la Nina Pilot Project (1995-97), designed to determine cost-effective strategies for promoting indigenous girls' attendance and completion of primary school in Guatemala. The project tested combinations of interventions in 36 communities in six departments of the country (Alta Verapaz, Chimaltenango, Quiche, San Marcos, Huehuetenango, and Suchitepequez) where the gap between girls' and boys' primary school enrollment is greatest.  Four intervention packages (combinations of educational actions) were tested:  (1) small scholarships of Q25 (or about $4.00) per month (this was consistent with Guatemalan and international research that suggests that small economic incentives motivate families to send their daughters to school); (2) community outreach workers (Mayan women) assigned to help organize parents' committees and provide academic tutoring and moral support to the girls; (3) parent committees, which (a) selected the scholarship recipients and monitor the activities of the program in the community and (b) actively participated in school activities under ""package two""; and (4) educational materials for students and teachers, including a teachers' manual, two posters, a flipchart program, four reading books, and a collection of children's literature and music focused on the education of girls (written in Spanish and the four major Mayan languages). Conclusions at the program level were as follows: (1) The scholarship package is the most effective of the Eduque incentives for keeping girls in school and competing in the primary grades.  (2) The greatest impact of the scholarship package was on girls in the first three grades, especially first grade, where for rural schools as a whole over 40% of girls drop out.  (3) The scholarship program is the most cost-effective of the incentives packages and appears to have the potential to lower cost sufficiently to pay for itself in terms of greater efficiency.  (4) The materials package has some potential for keeping girls in school but is unlikely to motivate them to complete primary school.  (5) Outreach in the form of occasional visits by outreach personnel to work with parent committees on the importance of keeping girls in school is not an effective incentive. Conclusions at the classroom level were as follows: (1) The Eduque packages have not affected girls' classroom participation patterns.  (2) Female teachers are an incentive for the active participation of girls in the classroom.","Project title: Basic education strengthening (BEST)","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","520-0374-C-00-0530-00","","2/1/1997 12:00:00 AM","","Access to education|Primary education|Indigenous populations|Girls|Development strategies|Cost benefit analysis|Incentives|Scholarships|Educational extension programs|Women|Teachers|Community participation|Educational materials|Student performance|School graduates|Local groups|School attendance|Enrollment|School dropouts|Parents","Guatemala","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABX299.pdf","78 KB","000223 - Academy for Educational Development, Inc.
