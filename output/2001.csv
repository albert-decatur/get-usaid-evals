"Final evaluation of a project (8/90-6/98) to enhance the operational effectiveness of the National Legislative Assembly (NLA) of El Salvador. The project met its intended goals, helping the NLA evolve from a rubber stamp congress to an independent deliberative body during a period of profound political change. Project seminars and workshops, opportunities to observe foreign legislatures in action, information resources, and additional professional staff have increased deputies' knowledge of their responsibilities and improved both the law and legislative process and the legislature's relationship with the executive and judicial branches.  As a result, the NLA's deliberations have become more thoughtful and its relations with other branches of government more substantive.  Infrastructure improvements, such as building additional offices, enabled many members to work more efficiently and meet with constituents for the first time.  A project-inspired public awareness campaign sparked growing citizen interest in the NLA and increased contacts between citizens and their representatives. Lessons learned are as follows:  (1) Legislative strengthening efforts must incorporate a country's political, social, and economic situation, and be flexible when circumstances arise that are neither predictable nor easily controlled.  This project could not have been as successful as it was without the 1992 Peace Accords, which made it possible for all factions to participate in Salvadoran politics, and the subsequent 1994 elections, which seated representatives of all major political groups in the national legislature for the first time. (2) Initial and ongoing support from legislative leaders, political parties, and key staff is essential.  In this project, a technical committee of deputies representing all major factions was critical to gaining acceptance from the NLA and ensuring the fullest and fairest possible use of project assistance.  In contrast, the ambivalence of leaders from the country's dominant party toward the project was its biggest hurdle.  (3) The project also supported other major areas, including infrastructure improvements and constituency services. Much of the project's success can be traced to its responsiveness to the priorities identified by the legislators themselves. (4) Project activities should promote ownership so that once USAID assistance ends, the legislature assumes responsibility for outcomes. (5) Project assistance should benefit as many legislators as possible. Providing office space, for example, enabled all deputies to carry out their legislative functions more efficiently and helped those parties participating for the first time feel like equal partners.  (6) Legislatures that have functioned with or been dominated by one party will likely have undemocratic internal rules and operating procedures. Modernizing or reforming these vestiges of the past is critical, although the project's record on this score was mixed.  The project was unable to overcome the resistance of the ruling party's members to internal rules reforms because they perceived the reforms as threats to their power.  (7) An effective democratic legislature seeks and uses input from individuals and interests beyond the institution itself, such as civil society and the media.  In El Salvador, these outside forces have traditionally played minor roles, giving the NLA little impetus to be more accountable and transparent.  To build public confidence in the legislature as a democratic institution, groups representing all parts of the political spectrum should know how to initiate contacts with legislators.  For their part, legislators should learn how to respond to and incorporate the input from this interaction into their decision-making processes. (8) The degree to which the legislature operates democratically serves as an example for similar developments in other areas.  (9) Confronting beliefs that undermine an effective, democratic legislature is critical to the success of a legislative strengthening project. While the NLA has begun to appreciate new concepts such as constituent relations, Salvadoran political thinking does not yet fully embrace compiling complete and transparent records of proceedings as a useful tool for accomplishing legislative goals and building public confidence in the institution.  Citizen participation in the legislative decisionmaking processes should be the focus of future assistance to the NLA.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/2001 12:00:00 AM","","Democratization|Political systems in transition|Political institutions|Legislature|Institution building|Study tours|Technical assistance|Information dissemination|Political development|Constraints|Political stances|Civil society|Political participation","El Salvador","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABT184.pdf","908 KB","008540 - USAID.

"Assesses the Community and Humanitarian Assistance Program (CHAP) program in the Western New Independent States (NIS) countries of Ukraine and Moldova (1995-2001).  The program is being managed by Counterpart International (CI). CHAP is rendering solid and sustained assistance to social service institutions, communities, and families in need, and is expertly managed and implemented.  CI's ability to precisely track a heavy and diverse volume of donated commodities and to ensure compliance with formidable and ever-changing rules and regulations by host government entities well serves the interests of the U.S. Government in the region. Additionally, CI has built impressive collaborative ties with a series of distribution partners and recipient organizations that directly build local capacity in the delivery of humanitarian assistance. The development of a highly effective operational database, and the recruitment, training, and promotion of a motivated and responsible local staff reflect particularly well upon the priority CI placed on management expertise and business acumen in the direction of the program over the past 6 years. That said, it is important to keep in perspective the limitations of a commodity import program to address the long-term structural reforms required to alleviate the suffering of the most needy people in society. CHAP now contributes valuable assistance to such people, but needs sharper and more strategic focus to enhance its sustainable impact. Thus the report calls for expanded engagement by CHAP with NGOs as commodity recipients and distributors and less of a concentration on supporting state-affiliated social service entities. Separately, the report indicates a need for CHAP to directly address local NGO capacity building. In summary, strategic refocusing of CHAP is necessary if the initiative is to remain part of USAID's portfolio in the Western NIS and if it is to deliver its maximum potential contribution to the Mission's overall goals and objectives in the region.  The team strongly asserts, however, that the value of and need for CHAP is such that the effort required to achieve greater strategic focus is clearly warranted. CHAP should be funded for an additional 3 years, though with an exit plan for CI so as to facilitate the indigenization of program management.  Responding to the humanitarian needs of the citizenry of nations as potentially prosperous as those in the Western NIS has to be seen primarily as a local responsibility.","Task order no. 800|Evaluation indefinite quantity contract (Evaluation IQC)","Special Evaluation","Documents","AEP-I-00-00-00023-00","","4/1/2001 12:00:00 AM","","Humanitarian assistance|Commodity import programs|Institution building|Project sustainability|Strategic planning|Indigenous private voluntary organizations|Human capacity development|Indigenization","New Independent States|Ukraine|Moldova","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABT467.pdf","3,703 KB","000436 - Development Associates, Inc.","","010257 - USAID.

"Evaluates Phase IV of The Johns Hopkins University Population Communication Services (PCS) project (1995-2001), designed to develop communication programs for USAID population and family planning (FP) projects worldwide. Key findings regarding the project's strategic approach and methodology are as follows:  (1) PCS maintains an international leadership role in health communication.  (2) While focusing on individual behavior change, PCS has increasingly acknowledged the need for a broader social and cultural context.  PCS should continue this effort.  (3) PCS has successfully developed and used its Steps to Behavior Change (SBC) conceptual framework and other tools to respond effectively to audience needs, tools such as the P Process (used for program design and oversight) and GATHER, the latter in response to the call of the PCS III evaluation to improve the project's approach to interpersonal communication and counseling (IPC/C). PCS's intentions regarding the development and use of tools in the area of community mobilization are not clear. (4) While PCS has made commendable efforts to establish a cause-effect relationship between communication interventions and individual behavior change, its evaluation methods cannot reliably separate out and account for the effects of other messages present in the media environment. Performance against current project objectives has been as follows: (1) The contraceptive prevalence rate (CPR) is higher in countries where major PCS programs are being or have been implemented, and it appears that the coverage, quality, and effectiveness of population programs in several countries are closely related to PCS efforts in those countries. (2) PCS programs for young adults seem to have contributed to increased contraceptive use among this population group.  (3) PCS has successfully applied its communication tools and methodologies to the field of reproductive health (RH).  (4) To institutionalize FP/RH information, education and communication (IEC) programs, PCS has effectively transferred skills in materials development, training, research, and the development of communication campaigns.  These capacity-building efforts have reached NGOs, government entities, advertising/media agencies, and journalists.  (5) PCS collaborates effectively with host country institutions, but collaboration with U.S.-based cooperating agencies has not improved markedly since the previous evaluation. During this phase of the project, PCS, largely at Mission request, has engaged in several new thematic areas, with child survival and HIV/AIDS being the largest in scale.  PCS is increasingly developing strategic approaches to these new areas and has successfully applied its strategic communication approach, tools, and methodologies to them.  PCS has also substantially expanded its focus to include community activities, mostly on an outreach basis, and is increasingly experimenting with more participatory approaches. Other findings are as follows:  (1) A significant number of PCS IV initiatives incorporate a gender focus, most of them aimed at increasing spousal communication and men's approval for FP.  Gender has not, however, been effectively institutionalized as a cross-cutting issue in PCS's work.  (2) USAID/Washington needs to ensure more continuity in PCS management staff.  The project has had five USAID cognizant technical officers or USAID technical advisors over the past 5 years.   (4) PCS has leveraged over $10 million in non USAID funds for project activities. In sum, PCS IV has met both the planned and unforeseen objectives of the cooperative agreement.  The evaluation team believes, moreover, that PCS's 18 years of stewardship of the project has contributed not only to lasting, beneficial changes in health-related behaviors around the world, but also to significant advances in the science and practice of development communication.  Besides recommendations to refine an otherwise successful project, the evaluation proposes several that would require substantive change either in the cooperative agreement or in PCS's strategic approach:  (1) expand the project's focus beyond individual behavior change and increase emphasis on factors related to social change; (2) expand the project's advocacy role to affect decisionmakers and the policy and regulatory environment; (3) establish realistic, verifiable objectives, and expect credible evidence of performance; and (4) intensify the development of communication skills in host countries, for example, in national and regional institutions.","POPTECH assignment no. 2000-004|Project title: Population technical assistance (POPTECH)|Project title: Population communication services II","Special Evaluation","Documents","HRN-C-00-00-00007-00","","2/1/2001 12:00:00 AM","","Population programs|Family planning promotion programs|IEC|Behavior change|Cultural environment|Communication processes|Advocacy|Population policy|Policy reform|Reproductive health|Human capacity development|Technology transfer|Beneficiary targeting|Youth|Contraceptive prevalence|Child survival activities|HIV/AIDS|Community participation|Gender analysis|Contract management|USAID|Fundraising","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABT382.pdf","574 KB","007877 - LTG Associates, Inc.|003366 - TvT Associates","","009355 - USAID.

"Evaluates the Institutional Strengthening and Grant Making (ISGM) program, a key activity in the U.S. Greater Horn of Africa Initiative (GHAI).  ISGM provides assistance to local African NGOs working regionally in the areas of food security and conflict prevention, mitigation, and response in 9 of the 10 GHAI countries as well as in the non-presence countries of that area. Mid-term evaluation covers the period 9/98-4/01.  ISGM is being implemented by PACT in partnership with MWENGO, an African NGO. ISGM is achieving many positive results in applying broader GHAI goals, supporting the strategic objectives (SOs) and intermediate results (IRs) of REDSO/ESA, and accomplishing specific contract performance indicators.  After a somewhat slow and difficult start, both PACT and MWENGO have accelerated the pace of their work, benefitting more than 300 African NGOs so far in the form of institution-building grants (15) and numerous, smaller forms of support to build the capacities of these local organizations.  When interviewing a number of the NGO grant recipients, the evaluation team was impressed not only with the commitment of these groups to their regional food security and peace building work, but also with the practical improvements (e.g., strategic planning, financial management, networking, website creation) provided to them by the PACT/MWENGO team.  The target of sustainability of at least 10 African NGOs is now within reach.  Of particular note is the active involvement and leadership of women in many of these local NGOs.  The role of an African Advisory Council in the decisionmaking process for grant- making is another innovative and progressive characteristic of ISGM.  Finally, African stakeholders are virtually universal in complimenting the U.S. Government and USAID, especially because ISGM is helping strictly African NGOs in their institutional strengthening.  ISGM involves Africans directly in designing and implementing activities and Africans participate in approving the grants. Major conclusions and recommendations are as follows:  (1) REDSO/ESA should definitely continue supporting ISGM and give it high priority in the allocation of budgetary resources.  (2) To achieve even greater impact and efficiency, ISGM should be more closely aligned with the work of all of the SO teams (including one not now covered) in REDSO and of other USAID operating units in the GHAI region.  (3) REDSO should proceed as soon as possible with the next round of competitive procurements for grant-making, although serious consideration should be given to targeting NGOs working with specific SO teams or Missions and in non-presence countries.  (4) REDSO should continue the active involvement of the African Advisory Council and even consider some expansion of its role.  (5) Both PACT and MWENGO are performing very well, and their partnership should be not only sustained, but enhanced. (6) Because there is a clear but as yet unquantified benefit for women, ISGM and REDSO should make every effort to develop gender data and analysis further as this NGO activity continues. (7) As REDSO's role evolves towards more actual regional project management in addition to support services, USAID needs to adjust and update some of its management and administrative procedures in order to take due account of these regional project needs.  Finally, USAID should start planning now for the post-ISGM period in the form of a successor to this NGO program involving greater African management of operations and ownership of the development agenda.","Task order no. 802|Evaluation indefinite quantity contract (Evaluation IQC)","Special Evaluation","Documents","AEP-I-00-00-00023-00","","4/1/2001 12:00:00 AM","","Indigenous private voluntary organizations|Institution building|Grants|Food security|Conflict resolution|Political reconciliation|Private voluntary organizations|Decision making|Strategic objectives|Stakeholder participation","Horn of Africa|South Africa","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABT389.pdf","9,328 KB","000436 - Development Associates, Inc.","","000026 - USAID.

"Evaluates the bean/cowpea collaborative research support program (CRSP) over the period 1997-2001. The most striking and most lasting accomplishment of the bean/cowpea CRSP over the past 5 years is the increase in host countries' institutional capacity to conduct research and transfer technology to bean and cowpea producers, marketers, and consumers.  This product of years of investment in human capital development by the bean/cowpea CRSP is obvious from visits to program sites, where most of the scientists hold CRSP-supported advanced degrees.  Most of the collaborating host country institutions are staffed with scientists who are on a par with their U.S. counterparts despite sometimes inadequate physical facilities. Another significant accomplishment is the increased stock of scientific knowledge that has been built up over the years about bean and cowpea breeding, culture, storage, marketing, and consumer satisfaction.  Further, a global network of scientists has been established that adds value to the scientific advancements.  The bean/cowpea CRSP can justly point with pride to numerous areas in which the global stock of knowledge has been increased and technology has been developed with support from the CRSP.  In the view of the evaluation panel, the bean/cowpea CRSP is as important or even or more important than the two international agricultural research centers with a mandate in bean and cowpea research, CIAT and IITA, in terms of scientific advances and human capacity. The Latin America and Caribbean (LAC) project is the strongest in terms of scientific capacity, as indicated by publications and the number of scientists who participate in the network.  This is not wholly surprising, since the LAC region had a stronger base from which to build, enjoyed a close proximity to U.S. institutions, and had a better infrastructure than did the project's African counterparts.  The West Africa project, although facing obstacles such as an environment favorable to insect pests and diseases, has developed a strong research program and a viable cowpea production and marketing sector. This remarkable success story can be explained in large part by the long-term commitment and persistence of U.S. and host country scientists.  The East Africa project, faced with even more formidable challenges, has not yet reached the maturity of the other two regional projects, but appears positioned to make significant progress during the next phase, having a small cadre of well-trained and highly qualified host country scientists who are dedicated to the objectives of the CRSP, as well as the support of dedicated scientists from collaborating U.S. institutions.  The global network of bean/cowpea CRSP scientists is a result of nearly a quarter century of investment by U.S. universities, host countries, and USAID.  It is surely a remarkable success story of what can be accomplished by sustained efforts over a long period of time. Despite these successes, the bean/cowpea CRSP faces difficult challenges as it moves into the next phase.  It will have to deal successfully with a number of ""second generation"" problems, including how much to invest in the newer tools of biotechnology, how to achieve the proper balance among disciplines and approaches, how to fully utilize the more advanced host countries in meeting global objectives, and how to complete the shift from bilateral projects to a regional approach. Michigan State University (MSU) has managed the program well, and deserves special commendation for successfully adjusting to a major transition caused by the retirement of key project personnel. Administrative problem areas include the need to reduce the administrative and reporting burden on subgrant institutions, the lack of a uniform and equitable policy on advance of funds to host countries, and the overly technical nature of the 5-year progress report.  It is also recommended that MSU expand and improve the bean/cowpea CRSP website, act decisively in dealing with occasional performance problems, explore the possibility of training through distance education, and be more aggressive in pursuing Mission buy-ins.","Project title: Bean and cowpea collaborative research support|program (Bean/Cowpea CRSP)","Special Evaluation","Documents","DAN-G-SS-86-00008-00|DAN-1310-G-SS-6008-00","","3/1/2001 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural research|Agricultural technology|Technology transfer|Research collaboration|Beans|Cowpeas|Host country cooperation|Human capacity development|Institution building|Scientists|Networks|Scientific cooperation|Universities and colleges|Management aspects|Scientific publications","Latin America|Caribbean|West Africa|East Africa","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABT414.pdf","264 KB","000775 - Michigan State University","","010191 - USAID.

"Evaluates USAID-funded democratization efforts of the National Democratic Institute (NDI) in Kyrgyzstan over the period 1997-3/01. The country's political environment is deteriorating rapidly due to the Government of Kyrgyzstan's (GOK) backsliding on democratic reforms, the repression of political activists challenging the present GOK, the suppression of media outlets reporting on controversial political issues, and the entrenchment of existing political elites.  A citizen movement for democratic change has been empowered during the last year, but its ability to seriously challenge the GOK remains quite limited. Given this difficult political environment, NDI has performed commendably.  In particular, NDI has gradually come to play an important role in Kyrgyzstan as one of the international organizations most aggressively acting to keep the country's political space from further closing.  NDI's most significant accomplishments to date have been in its support of the Coalition for Democracy and Civil Society.  Through its assistance to this local NGO, NDI has helped support a citizen movement for democratic reform that is at present one of the strongest obstacles in the country to the GOK's apparent intention to close off all avenues to political pluralism and citizen participation. In addition, NDI has helped parliamentarians establish themselves as a partial balance to executive power and has played a role in generating public political discussion, particularly through its support for the public affairs television show Nashe Vremya (Our Time). NDI has also tried to help various political parties promote competing political viewpoints, but the results of this assistance have been limited by the political environment, as is demonstrated by the GOK's disqualification of several political parties from the 2000 elections.  NDI efforts to promote women's participation in the political process have shown few results. On the management side, NDI has frequently been untimely in its workplan and quarterly report submissions, and its aggressive approach has at times blinded it to the contribution of other international organizations that, while not as aggressive as NDI in challenging the GOK, also play an important role in the long-term development of democracy in the country.  Finally, NDI's positive contributions are tempered by a poor partnership with USAID that results in wasted energy and a limited view of the long-term goals of USAID's strategy.  In its comments on the draft report, NDI acknowledged these problems and stated it would work to resolve them. Given the political trends in the country, NDI's program is now at a watershed point.  By all accounts, democratization in Kyrgyzstan must now be viewed as a long-term endeavor.  NDI must carefully consider its short-term goals in this long-term perspective.  While this situation does not require extensive change in the recipients of NDI's assistance, it may require alteration in the emphasis and content of this assistance.  At present, extensive assistance to political parties would be mostly futile.  NDI's work with political parties over the last 2 years has had little impact, and at present only political parties that at least implicitly support the GOK can operate actively. Continued support to parliamentarians and civic groups must also be viewed in a long-term perspective.  NDI should focus less on immediate, but unattainable goals, and more on strengthening groups and individuals devoted to change so that the latter may work to keep the political space from further closing and play a pivotal role when that space eventually opens up.  To assist in this longer-term goal, NDI must also develop a better partnership with USAID and other USAID implementing partners.

"This study evaluates USAID's experience with evaluation since 1995, when Agency policy changed from requiring every project to be evaluated to recommending that evaluations only be done in response to management need.  Key findings are noted below. Considerable evaluation work is being used in decisionmaking and program planning.  Some 60% of respondents to the study questionnaire reported that evaluation has been critical to their understanding of activity performance. Fieldwork presented many other examples of the use of evaluation in mission decisions and debates.  However, USAID is doing markedly fewer evaluations, and only a small percentage of those completed is being submitted to Washington.  Of most concern is the very limited number of in-depth program evaluations.  The monitoring/evaluation balance has swung too much toward performance monitoring.  Evaluation differs from performance monitoring and has been ignored too long. Most current field evaluations focus on activity performance, especially by implementing partners, whereas strategic objective (SO)/R4 monitoring systems assess progress at the strategic level.  There is a disconnect between the two that cannot be closed by more performance monitoring.  SO leaders, in the main, have not been planning for strategic evaluations at the SO level. USAID managers, particularly busy team leaders, skim reports and react to the most pressing actions needed.  But only the most committed managers find time to do evaluations at all -- one USAID manager stated that he spent 90% of his time on things that are required and that evaluation had a hard time making it to the top of the 10% list -- and most evaluations do not circulate beyond the partner and the strategic objective (SO) team.  Professionals in the field need more support if they are to develop effective programs. The dominant use of the ""fly-in"" method for USAID evaluations is having a serious effect on the quality of the evaluations.  In this approach, a team comes for 4 to 6 weeks and interviews the mission, the activity staff, and ""representatives"" of the local people.  There is not enough time to obtain a representative sample.  The team frequently tells the USAID manager pretty much what he or she already knows. Insufficient knowledge and understanding of evaluation planning and methods have led to this approach, which is not worth the time and money being spent on it.  Fairly minimal advice and guidance from evaluation experts prior to the evaluation could lead to significant improvement. Refining evaluation questions and identifying suitable and timely methods are the key.  By the time an evaluation team arrives, it is too late to affect the methods in any significant way. Professional commitment is the primary incentive for evaluation.  In general, professional staff do not see any Agency-wide incentive to advance learning through evaluations. Also, too many evaluations are linked with success stories. Continuing this practice will call into question the objectivity and independence of evaluation findings and conclusions. The biggest structural change in USAID's work is the increasing reliance on non-career staff, few of whom have any long-term stake in Agency learning.  Much of the current evaluation work is being done by partner organizations.  They are learning from the experience; USAID is not.  Privatizing monitoring and evaluation undercuts the flow of information as organizations recognize information as an element of competitive advantage.  Moreover, contracting and granting rules create serious barriers to learning from experience and applying lessons learned. The key recommendation is that senior Agency managers make learning about what works and what doesn't of primary importance. Only with visibility and high-level support will evaluation, along with performance monitoring, be a means by which ""truth speaks to power."" More importantly, USAID needs to find a way to ""use truth to empower.""

"Evaluates the Integrated English Language Program (IELP-II), designed to increase the number of qualified English teachers in Egypt.  Interim evaluation covers the period 10/97- 4/01. Overall, IELP-II has achieved a high level of accomplishment and employs an impressive management method that serves as a model to others.  Promising practices that deserve mention include having agencies identify the changes they want to make in their local areas through a Request for Application (RFA) process, and bringing partners together through collaboration and production of a final product (in this case a handbook) to be used by various agencies.  The projects have been impressive in their ability to bring together a cadre of ""early adopters"" of new technologies, train them, and provide them with opportunities to showcase what they have done and in turn train others. Sustainability is largely constrained by the intransigence of established hierarchies, lack of experience in strategic planning, and a general reluctance on the part of established agencies to try new ideas. Given these obstacles, IELP-II will be able to effect significant change in some areas (e.g., transfer of training models to Ministry of Education [MOE]-funded teacher training institutions), but perhaps not in others (testing reform, building strong collaborations among universities).  Building widespread collaborations between pre- and inservice training institutions has proven difficult; Egypt is far from having a seamless system of teacher training.  The establishment of a lab school that brings together universities and local governorates is an idea worth pursuing, particularly since such a site would provide training opportunities for a wide range of teachers, not just those teaching English as a Foreign Language (EFL). Including technology-based learning and teaching in such a site might make the model even more appealing and might attract additional funders. Building provider capacity to sell services to industry has also proven challenging.  Since employers apparently still fail to see the value of these services, project efforts to build public-private partnerships in this area may have been premature.  It is recommended that the project allow English for Special Purposes/English for Occupational Purposes (ESP/EOP) providers to build local capacity (through the RFA process), while IELP-II serves as an Egypt-wide clearinghouse (accessible through the Internet to the entire world) for information, resources, tools, provider lists, and the exchange of ideas. The generally low levels of English proficiency of classroom teachers in Egypt was very surprising.  Since a teacher's proficiency in the language to be taught is the cornerstone of the communicative approach, there is need for a new model of teacher training that combines the acquisition of English communication skills (focused largely on speaking and listening) with experience in new methodologies that build these skills.  Also surprising was the lack of enthusiasm shown by some teachers regarding participation in US-based training (technology training in Oregon was a notable exception).  Experienced teachers sometimes found the training not challenging enough, while those less experienced did not always see the connection between the approaches emphasized in the U.S. programs and the realities of their own classrooms in Egypt.  If teachers at various levels of experience and English proficiency are to fully benefit from the opportunities that U.S.-based training can provide, the content and focus of this kind of training may have to be reconsidered and in some cases redesigned. Taking greater advantage of the EFL methodology training offered in-country by American University in Cairo (AUC) should also be considered. In sum, IELP-II has been successful in almost all respects.  It is on target in meeting its objectives and has met or surpassed all milestones to date.  It has also laid the groundwork for a system that can be sustained if there is the necessary call to action at the MOE and other agencies. Continued funding for years 5 and 6 is highly recommended.

"Evaluates project to prevent and treat HIV/AIDS and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in the Dominican Republic (AccionSIDA). Midterm evaluation covers the period 1998-5/01. AccionSIDA and other USAID-supported projects have helped increase access to HIV/AIDS/STI prevention services, with some improvement of HIV/AIDS-related surveillance and reporting systems.  A pilot project to promote STI pre-packaged therapy has also shown some success. Additional successes include the creation of an NGO/AIDS coalition and of the Dominican Republic Network of Persons Living with HIV/AIDS (REDOVIH+).  NGO intervention projects targeted to at-risk populations have reduced high-risk sexual behavior; some of these projects have been identified as ""best practices"" and are replicable elsewhere in the country.  Other successful interventions include projects that feature extensive involvement of beneficiary populations, such as men who have sex with men (MSM), youth, and commercial sex workers (CSWs). Recent national AIDS prevention and control strategies have demonstrably reduced the number of sexual partners and increased condom use in the general population.  The Dominican Government has been less successful in increasing access to primary health care and incorporating HIV/AIDS/STI care into the public health system.  Despite the Mission's proactive support for the National AIDS Commission/National Coordination for the Control of Sexually Transmitted Infections and AIDS (CONASIDA/DIGECITSS), situational constraints caused by changes in government and a corresponding redefinition of roles and responsibilities have delayed implementation of public health reform. In addition, some of the country's most vulnerable populations are in need of greater prevention and care services, e.g., MSM sub-populations (young MSM, male CSWs, transvestites), migrant workers, and prisoners. Although the stigma of HIV/AIDS has somewhat diminished, a high level of discrimination remains, and many health professionals at major public hospitals and clinics continue to resist caring for AIDS patients.  In addition, physicians continue to request HIV tests from candidates for surgery without the latter's knowledge and to refuse assistance if the result is positive.  Businesses use HIV tests in hiring and firing decisions without obtaining the employee's consent or offering pre- or post-test counseling. TV and radio spots often focus on condom use, but information, education, and communication (IEC)/mass media prevention messages also stress partner reduction/fidelity, abstinence/postponement of sexual debut, and dissemination of information on STI treatment/prevention. This strategy of combined messages has made an impact on HIV infection, but discrimination, stigma, and associated ignorance and misinformation about HIV/AIDS have not been adequately addressed. Mass media campaigns have not targeted MSM (young MSM in particular), migrant workers, and prisoners. Condom availability in Dominican Republic is limited by the purchasing capability of the population, thus severely restricting access among groups who are most vulnerable to HIV infection (i.e., youth and poor women).  Persons living with HIV/AIDS also have limited access to condoms, thereby increasing their chance of transmitting HIV to uninfected partners. STI diagnosis and treatment services are generally available in the major cities targeted by AccionSIDA. Nevertheless, STI services are more commonly found in clinical units segregated from other health care units, reflecting high levels of stigma associated with STI treatment. Relatedly, it is expected that CSWs seek STI services at different hours than the population at large. Capacity building through short-term TA and study tours has improved DIGECITTS staff skills in STI management and program implementation. Specific capacity-building activities have included development of a national strategic plan for AIDS prevention and care, development of 12 provincial strategic plans, and NGO management workshops. AccionSIDA has revised its evaluation plan and related prevention and process indicators, and results evaluation studies are planned for 2002. However, no project situational analysis has been carried out.  More specifically, no information is available about target populations or the social and cultural context related to STI and HIV transmission.","AccionSIDA project (Dominican Republic HIV/AIDS/STD prevention|project)|Project title: Synergy project (SynergyAIDS)|Document also included as annex in final contractor report|(PD-ABY-080)","Special Evaluation","Documents","HRN-C-00-99-00005-00","","5/1/2001 12:00:00 AM","","Disease prevention and control|HIV/AIDS|Sexually transmitted diseases|Condoms|Pilot projects|IEC|Beneficiary targeting|Disadvantaged groups|Access to services|Domestic government programs|Human capacity development|Public health care|Discrimination|Mass media|Development project monitoring|At-risk groups","Dominican Republic","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABT715.pdf","171 KB","003366 - TvT Associates","","008291 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of programs (1993-2001) of the Initiative for Social Action and Renewal (ISAR) to bolster the capabilities of local NGOs to promote environmental and related democratizing improvements in Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. Under the original program, Seeds of Democracy (5/93-1997), ISAR gave grants to over 300 NGOs for environmental activities.  During the same period, ISAR also implemented a cooperative grants program for Central Asian and U.S. environmental NGOs,  which supported three projects of up to $25,000.  Following the Seeds of Democracy program, ISAR implemented an Expert Exchange program, which fostered cooperation among NGOS from Central Asia and other parts of the former Soviet Union.  The overall purpose of both the Seeds and Expert Exchange programs was to improve citizen capacity to improve the environment.  Overall, ISAR has made a substantial contribution to civil society development, local environmental improvements, and citizen awareness of environmental issues. Through the Seeds of Democracy program, ISAR supported the creation of a core group of sustainable NGOs in each of the three states where the evaluation was conducted. The Caspian Environmental Partnership Initiative (CEPI) was successful in connecting Kazakh and Turkmen environmental NGOs with one another and with organizations in Russia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia. These connections have led to a better understanding and greater knowledge base on the part of individual NGOs and have increased the momentum among NGOs in the region to solve both local and transnational issues. The Atyrau Resource Center (ARC) in Kazakhstan has been a resounding success and is now ready to expand its services geographically and consider growing into an NGO incubator or member-run organization over the next 3-4 years.  Creation of ARC gave a visible boost to the development of environmental NGOs and their capabilities in the region and provided access to urgently needed environmental information. The impact of the Remote Grants program (Peripheria Program) on regional organizations has been similar to the impact of the Seeds of Democracy program on organizations in capital cities.  ISAR successfully supported: the creation and spreading of environmental NGOs in all Central Asian Republics (CAR), both in capitals and on regional and local levels, as well as an increase in NGO networking; the development of selected experienced NGOs in each CAR that would become sustainable in the next few years; increased outreach of environmental media and information dissemination, environmental education, and public awareness efforts; reserved government recognition of environmental NGO activities and implementation of selected projects, as well as the attraction of financial substitutes for state funding; and local environmentally beneficial projects focusing on community cleanup, waste minimization and recycling, tree planting and biodiversity preservation, sustainable new agricultural practices, clean water supply, energy conservation, eco-tourism, and environmental education. Overall, ISAR's programs have contributed to an increase in the number of registered and nonregistered NGOs, as well as the geographic diversification of the environmental movement comprising a core group of approximately 40 strong NGOs and some 200 smaller organizations and initiative groups. ISAR programming has also contributed to:  an increased engagement of NGOs in advocacy and environmental decisionmaking; the development of replicable models for supporting the growth of viable NGOs and community organizations; and the achievement of visible but modest environmental improvements. ISAR has been adept at navigating the difficult political and regulatory landscapes and cultures in which it operates, and its approach of providing extremely small amounts of money, not funding salaries, and of treating NGOs like partners has led to a higher survival rate among funded groups than among those funded by similar grant-makers.","Evaluation indefinite quantity contract (Evaluation IQC)","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","AEP-I-00-00-00022-00","","7/1/2001 12:00:00 AM","","Indigenous private voluntary organizations|Environmental management|Institution building|Human capacity development|Democratization|Civil society|Grants|Information centers|Institutional linkages|Advocacy|Experts|Project replication","Central Asia|Kazakhstan|Turkmenistan|Uzbekistan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABT727.pdf","863 KB","009054 - DevTech Systems, Inc.|011982 - Checchi/Louis Berger Joint Venture","","008870 - USAID.

"During the 1990s, USAID supported three urban and industrial pollution programs in India.  Trade in Environmental Services and Technologies (TEST, 1992-97) was designed to develop U.S.-India business linkages that would increase trade opportunities for American companies, as well as to improve environmental conditions in India.  The ongoing Clean Technology Initiative (CTI) has similar aims as does TEST, but focuses on helping Indian industry become more competitive in international markets through environmental initiatives.  CTI has also introduced the concept of greening the supply chain, whereby manufacturers require their suppliers to employ environmentally sound practices in the production of components.  A third project, Financial Institutions Reform and Expansion (FIRE), also ongoing, touches specifically on urban (as distinct from industrial) pollution. FIRE supports the development of environmental infrastructure, such as sanitation, water supply, and solid waste management.  The present report assesses the results of the three projects. Findings include the following:  (1) TEST engendered 14 U.S.-India business deals valued at $35 million.  Of this amount, the project financed 26%; the Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India (ICICI), the project's collaborating partner, financed the rest.  (2) In 1991, American suppliers were exporting $6 million of environmental equipment to India annually, 4% of the total $135 million market.  In 2000, these companies were exporting $150 million of such equipment. How much of this increase is attributable to TEST cannot be determined.  (3) It is impossible to quantify overall changes in net air and water quality resulting from the imported technologies.  However, data provided by one of the U.S.-Indian joint ventures shows a decline of 6,300 tons in particulate emissions per day in 1999 at 13 companies in 4 industries.  (4) It can be assumed that urban pollution measures promoted by FIRE -- such as potable water and trash pickup -- are bound to have improved human health.  But hard data are unavailable. Lessons learned are as follows:  (1) Changing the mindset of key business and government leaders with respect to environmental management takes considerable time, but is essential if pollution control technologies, environmental management systems, and urban development are to be widely adopted.  (2) Companies will not invest in pollution control technologies or environmental management systems unless they perceive it to be in their business interest.  (3) Companies are more likely to acquire pollution control technologies if environmental standards and regulations are strictly enforced. Companies invest in pollution control technologies and environmental management systems primarily to avoid being shut down or fined for noncompliance with environmental regulations. Unfortunately, enforcement in India generally remains lax because political will and public pressure are weak.  (4) Both supply- side and demand-side barriers hamper U.S.-India trade in environmental services and technologies.  On the supply side, American companies often have legitimate concerns about the time, effort, and risk involved in tapping the Indian market for environmental services and technologies.  On the demand side, Indian companies are reluctant to buy (and Indian financial institutions reluctant to lend funds for the purchase of) U.S. pollution technologies that have not been demonstrated to be suitable for local conditions.  Moreover, American pollution technologies are typically too expensive to find widespread acceptance in the Indian market. (5) Lack of financing is typically not a constraint for large Indian firms that want to procure pollution reduction technology, but it does often hinder individual small and medium- size firms and municipalities. (6) A key to replicating technology transfer projects is careful targeting with an eye to sharing and spreading successful results.  TEST used the ""retail"" approach to introduce pollution control technologies in India. Specific industries were not targeted; instead, any company of any size from any industrial sector located in any part of the country was eligible to apply for a loan from ICICI.  By contrast, CTI is using the ""wholesale"" approach, strategically targeting companies.  (7) Baseline data are needed to assess program impact.  However, baseline data were typically not gathered under the TEST, CTI, or FIRE projects before project implementation.  Relevant India data were also not available.","Full report: PN-ADJ-999|Editorial and production services provided by Conwal, Inc.","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","8/1/2001 12:00:00 AM","","Pollution control|Urban pollution|Industrial facilities|Environmental technologies|Environmental management|Business enterprises|Joint ventures|Trade promotion|Economic competition|Equipment|Impact assessment|Information needs|Financial incentives|Law enforcement|Constraints|Behavior change|Financing|Technology transfer|Environmental infrastructure","India","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNACG629.pdf","190 KB","008058 - USAID.

"Updates report (PN-ACE-626) on lessons learned from USAID experience about environmental policy dialogue.  A total of 20 lessons regarding the policy process, policy dialogue, problem diagnosis, policy design, and policy implementation are presented and discussed. (1) Commitment of key decisionmakers is required throughout the policy process and is critical in moving the process from one stage to the next.  (2) Policy change is a continuing, step-by-step process that cannot be short-circuited or rushed, and involves attention to continued consensus building through dialogue and communications, combined with analysis tailored to emergent issues.  (3) Timing is everything:  seize targets of opportunity.  (4) The policy process is necessarily multidisciplinary and must also recognize cross-sectoral and gender linkages.  (5) Involve all key stakeholders and find a policy ""champion"".  (6) Policy dialogue must adapt approaches and tools to the wide variety of political, economic, and cultural settings.  (7) Donor coordination is crucial for consistent and effective policies to emerge from policy dialogue.  (8) Policy dialogue requires flexibility and thrives on open and creative interaction among counterparts. (9) Problem diagnosis, a key link in the policy process, depends on solid analysis and a credible analytical process.  (10) Donor organizations' partners are not always receptive to ""policy"" assistance. (11) Early involvement of implementors and stakeholders can improve policy design and build consensus for implementation.  (12) Environmental policy design should be linked to economic development and to the solving of specific problems.  (13) Donors should analyze the incentive structures of policy instruments.  (14) Effective design must anticipate implementation barriers. (15) It may not be possible to implement the policy as designed. (16) Donors should encourage partners to develop implementation strategies.  (17) The benefits of policy implementation should be marketed in terms of local impacts. (18) Implementation must be reinforced by commitments to sustain financial support.  (19) Implementation is more successful when done by those closest to the problem.  (20) Donors may need to help build stakeholder capacity to communicate new requirements and use new policies to advantage.","Earlier draft ed.: PN-ACK-466|EPIQ (environmental policy and institutional strengthening|indefinite quantity contract)|Task order no. 17|Later edition: PN-ACS-522","Special Evaluation","Documents","PCE-I-00-96-00002-00","","4/1/2001 12:00:00 AM","","Environmental policy|Policy analysis|Policy making|Policy dialogue|Problem identification|Development cooperation|Human capacity development|Development program implementation|Development strategies|Political leadership|Donor coordination|Host country cooperation|Incentives|Constraints|Economic benefit|Public awareness","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNACM295.pdf","1,258 KB","006958 - International Resources Group (IRG)|001798 - Winrock International|000553 - Harvard University.

"Evaluates the impact of the Youth Reintegration Training and Education for Peace (YRTEP) program in Sierra Leone (2000-2001), designed to provide ex-combatant and other war- affected youth with non-formal education (NFE) activities in reintegration, livelihood skills development, remedial education, and basic literacy and numeracy skills.  Management Systems International (MSI) implemented the project. The YRTEP program accomplished what it set out to do and did so extraordinarily well.  The program has made a significant difference in the lives of the participants, who have done things they would otherwise not have done and gained information they would otherwise not had the opportunity to acquire. They have learned to read and write and to work with numbers in ways they can use in their day-to-day lives.  Their physical health has benefitted from the information they have been exposed to and they are better able to manage health concerns.  They have learned about democracy and good governance and are prepared to participate more fully in the electoral process and in the governance of their communities.  They have learned a variety of ways to manage stress and conflict and have become more self-reliant and better able to generate income. They have learned the importance of the environment and how it affects their well-being.  They have learned much about farming practices that, were it not for the war, would have been learned from their families.  And, perhaps most importantly, they have rediscovered who they are and what they are capable of doing and becoming.  They have glimpsed what is ""normal"" and come to recognize the possibilities for life in a time of peace.  In summary, YRTEP has significantly advanced the work of peace and reconciliation. Originally seen as program to bridge the gap between war and peace until such time as Sierra Leone would be able to ""get back to normal,"" YRTEP has been much more than that and should be continued until all ex-combatants and war-affected youth are resettled peacefully in their communities.  There is an important role for the program in terms of building self- reliance, confidence and competence.  The literacy/numeracy approach used in the program has had outstanding success and will be useful for the foreseeable future as the most viable alternative to achieving literacy and numeracy for the adults and youth unable to access or enter the formal education system. A significant by-product of the program is the personal and professional growth that has taken place among the large group of Sierra Leonean master trainers and learning facilitators who received intensive training and experience through this program.  As a result of their role in their communities and the overall positive manner in which they are regarded by YRTEP participants, they have in many cases become genuine leaders and a voice of reason and stability in an unstable environment, and are looked to as valuable resources both within and outside of their direct participation in the program.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","AOT-C-00-00-00091-00","","8/1/2001 12:00:00 AM","","War recovery|Economic and social reintegration|Excombatants|Youth|War victims|Political reconciliation|Nonformal education|Political participation|Stress management|Self management|Vocational training|Literacy instruction|Arithmetic instruction|Environmental education|Health education|Conflict resolution|Training personnel","Sierra Leone","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABT950.pdf","96 KB","003970 - Management Systems International, Inc.

"This study examines the relationship evolving between democracy and governance (DG) and other USAID goals, in particular why and how the Agency links DG principles and approaches to other sectors in pursuing development objectives. The study is based in part on an examination of mission programs in the Dominican Republic, Guinea, Madagascar, Mali, the Philippines, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. The study finds that DG linkages with other sectors can enhance democratic development and achievement of sectoral objectives. Such linkages also support the Agency's sustainable development mission, capturing DG's unique ability to serve as both a means and an end. However, the Agency's operating environment and institutional culture are barriers to the very collaboration on which such activities depend. While the experience of the missions studied demonstrates that these obstacles can be overcome, DG linkages cannot achieve their full potential without a change in Agency attitudes, behavior, and institutional structure. The main conclusion is that DG linkages need to become part of the Agency's institutional culture and operating environment.  One way to accomplish this would be to encourage strategic objective team leaders to consider the potential relevance of DG linkages in any activity in their areas of responsibility.  The Agency must also reduce barriers to DG linkages by creating incentives for collaboration.  Two possibilities in this regard are to incorporate cross-sectoral linkages into strategic plans and to make collaboration part of employees' annual work objectives.  Most urgently needed is a revision of reporting and review procedures to ensure that USAID captures and gets credit for its cross-sectoral accomplishments. A step in that direction would be to include narrative text in annual mission reports spelling out cross-sectoral results. In addition, leadership commitment to cross-sectoral activities and staff initiative to carry them out are critical. To the extent that the Agency can promote such attitudes and behavior, either by having knowledgeable mission directors share experiences or by encouraging staff to think more broadly about their work, cross-sectoral linkages will increase.  Finally, the study notes that missions have the tools, such as cooperative funding agreements and joint site visits, to facilitate DG linkages.","Evaluation highlights: PN-ACN-179","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","6/1/2001 12:00:00 AM","","USAID|Development program planning|Strategic planning|Democracy|Governance|Economic sectors|Constraints|Institutional aspects|Procedural development|Behavior change|Reporting systems|Performance measurement|Top level managers|Political leadership|Development sectors","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNACG633.pdf","838 KB","008058 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of the AIDS Prevention and Education Project (ASEP), designed to combat HIV/AIDS and sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) in the Philippines. Evaluation covers the period 7/92-5/01.  ASEP implementation is led by the World Health Organization/Western Pacific Regional Office (WHO/WPRO) and the Program for Appropriate Technology in Health (PATH) and focuses on eight major cities of the country. Overall, ASEP has been highly successful and has accomplished a great deal at a relatively low cost.  The continued slow pace of the HIV/AIDS epidemic is due in part program accomplishments, of which three are major:  (1) In 1993, ASEP established the country's first HIV/AIDS sentinel surveillance, a system that now covers 10 cities.  Surveillance data show that prevalence continues to remain at very low levels even among high-risk groups (<1%).  However, high-risk behaviors among sex workers, male clients, men who have sex with men, and injecting drug users create the potential for a rapid increase in HIV/AIDS infections. The risk of a rapid acceleration remains quite real, requiring continued assistance for HIV/AIDS prevention. (2) ASEP has demonstrated that local NGOs, very few of whom were involved in HIV/AIDS work at project inception, can develop effective education programs targeted on difficult to access high-risk groups.  At the same time, PATH's work with NGOs in the eight ASEP focus cities shows that it takes about 4 years for an NGO to become effective at supporting STD/HIV/AIDS prevention work.  The NGO must recruit, train, supervise, and retain workers who are willing and able to undertake difficult and potentially dangerous work.  They must also establish credibility and rapport with clients before education messages are accepted and believed.  Reaching individuals for one-on-one discussions about HIV/AIDS prevention requires workers to do where their clients work -- red-light districts, sex establishment, bars, streets frequented by freelancers, etc. This work is further complicated by the frequent occurrence of police raids in these areas and by the fact that certain high- risk groups -- particularly injecting drug users (IDUs) and men who have sex with men (MSM) -- avoid contact because they do not wish to be known. (3) ASEP has shown that local government units (LGUs) can be actively engaged in supporting and conducting STD/HIV/AIDS prevention programs, particularly surveillance. Thanks to the work of PATH and its NGO partners, ASEP LGUs have progressed from no awareness and no response to actions previously not even contemplated.  ASEP has helped develop local government institutional mechanisms that are essential for implementing and sustaining programs against the spread of STDs and HIV/AIDS.  ASEP partners are now working with barangay officials and council members to use existing laws and ordinances to thwart sexual exploitation of children and to gain access to available funds for programs that discourage sex work by minors. In fact, although there is a wide range of stakeholders from national to local levels as a result of ASEP, the strongest capacity for future support for HIV/AIDS prevention is in ASEP- assisted cities. Possible elements for a ""second generation"" HIV/AIDS program include: performance-based incentive grants for LGU STD/HIV/AIDS prevention; applied research for developing STD/HIV/AIDS prevention programs that reach unserved/under-served high risk groups; targeted programs for MSM and IDUs; and applied research for promotion of additional behavioral change associated with STD/HIV/AIDS infection.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","5/1/2001 12:00:00 AM","","Disease prevention and control|HIV/AIDS|Sexually transmitted diseases|Epidemiology|Risk aversion|Drug abuse|Human sexual behavior|Indigenous private voluntary organizations|IEC|Behavior change|Local groups|Municipal level|Children|Project sustainability|Morbidity","Philippines","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABU119.pdf","1,310 KB","008592 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of a matching grant (10/98-9/01) to Mennonite Economic Development Associates (MEDA) to build capacity in MEDA headquarters and in two of its microfinance programs in Mozambique and Haiti. Objectives have largely been achieved.  Capacity- building plans at MEDA headquarters included components to increase MEDA's ability to provide financial resources to its local partners, refine methodologies and transfer proven techniques to its programs through TA, and develop and deliver training modules.  These plans were achieved almost completely, a remarkable feat in a rapidly changing environment.  The Sarona Global Investment Fund has tested and revised its structure to deal more effectively with investors, but does not expect to be sustainable until 2002.  Through its TA and training, MEDA has developed and delivered the planned tools, although the community banking methodology remains in Creole.  In terms of its own sustainability, MEDA has achieved a 114% increase in its fundraising, but has not reduced its dependence on donor funding to the extent desired.  However, it has achieved a financial surplus each year.  At an industry level, MEDA continues to be an active and reputable participant, and its consulting arm makes its newly developed tools available through training opportunities. MEDA's Mozambique partner is MEDA Mozambique, a registered foreign NGO.  This program, which uses solidarity group and individual lending methodologies, received a loan for its microfinance program from the Sarona Global Investment Fund. Initial, unanticipated staffing problems included minor frauds and lack of capacity.  However, the program is now poised to scale up, with a solid staff, improved methods and procedures, and a detailed business plan.  It is currently hampered by rapid devaluation of the local currency and erosion of its capital fund. Without workable short- and long-term action plans, the program will eventually be unable to pay the annual interest on its capital fund loan to Sarona in hard currency.  MEDA has proposed continued support for MEDA Mozambique in its follow-up matching grant proposal. MEDA's Haiti partner is MEDA Haiti, a registered Haitian NGO.  In the matching grant area, MEDA Haiti successfully operates a microfinance program using community-banking methodology adapted to the rural Haitian context.  The operation financed by the grant is one of three community banking programs that MEDA Haiti manages, and has been combined with literacy training.  Short-term plans involve a steep growth curve, developing community bank numbers, and consolidating the three community bank programs into a for-profit, sustainable subsidiary.  Longer-term plans include merging the subsidiary with other like-minded rural community bank operations.  The staff and management now have the capacity to fulfill the long- term objectives.   Until the project achieves sustainability or finds other financing, MEDA will continue to finance the community banks' operation in the project area.  In addition to the small amount of money obtained through Sarona for loan capital, MEDA Haiti maintains a line of credit and a fund transfer arrangement with Fonkoze, its literacy partner.  The unique nature of MEDA's community bank methodology has caused problems in finding a management information system (MIS) program adequate to handle periodic balloon payments of principal while accepting monthly interest payments.  This problem will be remedied within the next 12 months.

"Final external evaluation of a program to improve the delivery of social services in Albania.  No time frame is indicated.  Mercy Corps International served as the prime implementing agency. Program objectives were pursued by providing targeted support to local and international partner NGOs for projects to:  (1) improve the infrastructure and resources of health and education facilities; (2) strengthen community involvement and capacity through participation and leadership development; and (3) improve knowledge and practices. Success was achieved in all three areas.  Infrastructure was significantly improved by rehabilitation activities, and additional resources are now available at all targeted sites. Significantly, improvements to physical infrastructure allow education and health staff to begin focusing on other issues, such as service provision and quality of services.  Community involvement was stimulated in all projects, although the extent and types of involvement varied between NGO partners.  The effects of training cannot be fully evaluated at this time, although those interviewed indicated that they found training, especially in refreshing knowledge and skills, useful.  Most indicated that they use or plan to use the skills learned and continue to use training materials for reference purposes.  Also, local NGOs received intensive TA and reflected clear improvements in organizational capacity and ability to efficiently and transparently manage donor funds.  Both local and international partner projects achieved visible results. The concluding section of the report examines overall trends and continuing needs and constraints and provides observations about differences in rural versus urban settings for similar projects, as well as about local NGO experiences versus those of international partners.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","182-A-00-00-00104-00","","9/1/2001 12:00:00 AM","","Societies in transition|Institution building|Social services|Health delivery|Educational delivery|Private voluntary organizations|Indigenous private voluntary organizations|Community based delivery|Community participation|Leadership training|Human capacity development|Health facilities|Educational facilities|Rural areas|Urban areas","Albania","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABU251.pdf","243 KB","007926 - Mercy Corps International","","008506 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of an Office of Transition Initiatives' (OTI) project (1998-2001) to transition USAID's humanitarian relief efforts in Kosovo to long-term development, with specific emphasis on initiating, reestablishing, or expanding democratic political processes.  The evaluation used a framework model that affords greater objectivity than anecdotal evidence in evaluating project impact. To achieve the project goal, OTI chose to maximize the number of Kosovars involved in and recognizing the value of participation in decisionmaking and the future development of democracy in Kosovo.  Over the course of the project, over $15 million in transition assistance was programmed, approximately 80% of it devoted to developing political processes at the community level.  The project's greatest impact was achieved in this area.  Communities now have locally elected governance structures, grassroots organizations articulating needs to elected officials, accountability and transparency becoming more important issues, and issues of diversity in representation being addressed.  OTI also contributed significantly to the development of the media sector in Kosovo and achieved similar levels of impact with just under 15% of program funds. Despite significant periods of time in which activities were severely curtailed and even halted for reasons of security, OTI was successful in fulfilling its mandate of providing transition assistance and in handing over its program to the USAID Mission.  This success was due in large part to an excellent understanding by OTI and Mission staffs of the role of transition assistance in USAID's overarching program objectives. Finally, and most importantly, there is a need for OTI to bring a greater degree of structure to transition programming, in order to more objectively determine achievement of results.

"Evaluates project to strengthen economic think tanks (SETT) in Russia.  Interim evaluation covers the period 1999- 11/01.  The project is being implemented by the Moscow Public Science Foundation (MPSF) with TA from the University of Maryland's Center for Institutional Reform and the Private Sector (IRIS). SETT has achieved a variety of positive results.  It has established systems for competitive grants, including the issuance of Requests for Proposals and a three-tiered evaluation system.  However, the overall quality of proposals has been somewhat disappointing.  A significant number failed to demonstrate familiarity with the pertinent international literature, or to clearly articulate the policy issue to be addressed, or to adequately lay out plans (or include budgets) to disseminate results beyond academic and professional circles, or to advocate for recommended policy changes.  In all, SETT has awarded 58 grants totaling $1.1 million, including 19 institutional development grants (IDPs), intended to produce policy recommendations and to strengthen Russian think tanks; 21 research grants to individuals or groups for economic policy analysis and recommendations; 14 small quick response grants to individuals focused on topics chosen by the MPSF; and large quick response grants to established analytical groups to carry out analyses on topics of high priority to the Russian Federation. Geographic distribution has been good, with 41% of the grants and 24% of the resources going to secondary cities. The ""think tanks"" aided by this program are very small and fragile. By U.S. norms, they are something of a cross between a grant-funded think tank and a contracted consulting firm, and their work agenda is a mixture of their own ideas and priorities and those of clients.  The quality of the research/analytical work is mixed, with institutions generally performing somewhat better than individuals.  Grantees have disseminated their research findings through a variety of traditional methods, and many have met with government officials. Dissemination activities have generally not been designed to promote or advocate policy changes.  Few grantees see their roles as advocating for policy change.  The IDPs have strengthened small policy analysis groups, enhancing their skills, reputations, and visibility; a number of grantees have won additional grants or contracts after completing their SETT work. Finally, the program's reports provide a picture of operations and financial activity, but little substantive information on results. Continued efforts to build Russian think tanks are warranted.  With the lack of a philanthropic tradition in Russia, few Russian think tanks/consulting groups are likely to evolve into U.S.-type think tanks in the foreseeable future.  Most of those that participated in this program will require considerable TA in methodology, institutional development, and dissemination and advocacy to become strong, viable institutions. Nevertheless, these groups exhibit a significant degree of independence and are growing in technical capacity and should play an increasingly important role in providing quality analysis and policy advice.  If they take on a greater advocacy role, their impact will increase not only in shaping and improving economic policy but also in strengthening political pluralism. Lessons learned are as follows:  (1) It is possible and desirable to pursue both institutional development and policy advice objectives simultaneously.  Some strategies are more effective than others, however.  (2) The combination of a Russian lead entity coupled with an American firm or think tank seems to be an effective management arrangement.  (3) SETT has tried to do too much with the level of resources provided.  By spreading resources across 58 grants, the level of financial and technical inputs has often been inadequate to produce, disseminate, and advocate high quality analysis and recommendations or to move those institutions toward sustainability.   (4) Policy change is more likely when key government officials are poised to accept the analysis and recommendations and grantees are able to produce high quality work (as in the case of the Large Quick Response grants).  (5) Grants to individuals are difficult to manage and are less likely than grants to institutions to produce high quality analysis and recommendations and to lead to the development of a viable think tank industry.","Evaluation support services indefinite quantity contract|(Evaluation IQC)","Special Evaluation","Documents","AEP-I-00-00-00024-00","","11/1/2001 12:00:00 AM","","Institution building|Research organizations|Economic policy|Economic analysis|Policy analysis|Advocacy|Consultants|Project sustainability|Grants|Development strategies","Russia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABU512.pdf","262 KB","003970 - Management Systems International, Inc.

"Evaluates the Partners for Health and Child survival Program (PHCSP), designed to improve the health and nutritional status of children and women in the Philippines by strengthening local management capacity. Interim evaluation covers the period 9/99-11/01.  The Pearl S. Buck Foundation is the implementing agency. The basic groundwork for the project has been established and activities have commenced in capacity building, community mobilization, and testing of innovations.  Critical intervention models such as Hearth, Mother Support Groups (MSG), Weighing Posts (WP), and the Basic Child Learning Package (BCLP) have been tested.  Necessary training has been conducted.  The project deserves commendation for building on existing structures and taking a deliberate policy not to replicate or add new structures and protocols that can result in overloading the local health system.  The more innovative interventions such as Hearth Nutrition Model and WPs have attempted to adjust to the local context and paid attention to local requirements and limitations. Overall, training activities have established service delivery competencies in all three intervention areas: nutrition and breastfeeding; maternal care, and child spacing. The project has achieved notable progress in establishing weighing posts in a majority of the project barangays.  Health action planning has been conducted, encouraging the ownership of activities among the community. Examination of 2001 knowledge, practices, coverage (KPC) survey results show that breastfeeding and nutrition indicators compare well with midterm targets set by the detailed implementation plan (DIP).  Maternal care indicators did not fare as well, but child spacing indicators generally show positive results compared with their midterm targets. Using Ministry of Health Field Health Surveillance Information System (FHSIS) data, the number of new family planning acceptors for all methods have significantly increased in project areas. On the down side, there is a need to strengthen the project's monitoring and evaluation component, documentation is inadequate, and there is a lack of operations research studies, as well as a poor analysis of these studies.  There has been no coordinated exit strategy, although the Advisory Board is in place to assist with this. In terms of capability-building, with the participation of local officials and service providers in the training program, there was a discernible increase in the sense of ownership in project activities. In the area of service delivery, health providers, particularly midwives and barangay health workers (BHWs), were trained in counseling on breastfeeding, nutrition, and family planning.  For facility upgrading, health centers were provided with additional equipment.  As a capacity-building as well as a sustainability strategy, the multi-sectoral advisory board that had been set up to oversee the implementation of the projects has formally linked the barangays to a potential pool of local consultants, many of whom are capable of providing TA to the project. The project's capacity-building strategies strengthen the prospect for sustainability, as managerial and technical skills have been emphasized in many of the early training workshops. Equipping health centers and service providers with information, education, and communication (IEC) and medical equipment also help ensures the facilities' readiness to provide necessary health services.  Financial sustainability is a more difficult issue.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","FAO-A-00-99-00040-00","","11/1/2001 12:00:00 AM","","Child survival activities|Child nutrition|Infant nutrition|Maternal nutrition|Family planning|Human capacity development|Local groups|Community participation|Private voluntary organizations|Paramedical education|Indigenous private voluntary organizations|Project sustainability|Community based delivery|Growth monitoring|Economic self sufficiency","Philippines","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABU607.pdf","417 KB","010295 - Pearl S.

"Final evaluation of a project to support the growth and strengthening of NGO resource centers, and through them the burgeoning regional NGOs, in eight major cities in the Russian Far East (RFE).  Evaluation covers the period 5/98-11/01 against a PACD of 4/02.  The Institute for Social Action and Renewal (ISAR) is the implementing agency. Findings regarding the project's various components are as follows: The main component, the small grants program, was very well planned and publicized.  Many beginning organizations received good advice on how to bid, and all concerned viewed the process as equitable.  Over $500,000 in grants ranging from $500 to $5,000 have been made to 187 of 685 applicants who bid in eight competitive rounds. Training of consultants was generally well done. Training of trainers did not work out as well.  The bi-monthly magazine for NGOs was well received, though many felt it could be better done for a wider audience. The database for NGO organizations and resources was a clear weak spot. It is little used and is not kept up to date.  Included in the evaluation are descriptions of each of the five resource centers (RCs) and the diverse contexts in which they work.  A heartening trend toward greater reliance on local resources is noted.  The evaluation analyzes the relations of each RC with its client NGOs; describes their links with government, business, and the media; and offers examples of the varying impacts the small grants program have had on each.  Three of the five cities exhibit strong and well- focused management and activities; there is room in Vladivostok and in Khabarovsk for improvement.  In the former, the ISAR-RFE office has carried out its management role unevenly; it is recommended that RC activities in the province become a separate function. General recommendations stress the need for better planned training for the RC network and for giving the magazine a wider role and audience.  Future USAID efforts should center on three activities:  the provision of services to local communities; stronger development of the RC network; and promotion of civil society concepts among the wider public in the RFE.

"Final evaluation of a project (1996-2001) implemented by the Partnership for Educational Revitalization in the Americas (PREAL) to build public and private support for educational reform in Latin America.  The evaluation is based on country studies of Chile, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Peru. Though with considerable variation, PREAL achieved in all four study countries the three intermediate results stipulated by USAID:  (1) building public and private sector support for educational reform; (2) strengthening public and private sector organizations working for educational improvement; and (3) identifying and disseminating best education policies and practices.  Much of PREAL's success is attributable to the role of key individuals.  The Inter-American Dialogue (IAD) has monitored inputs and outputs appropriately, but needs to monitor outcomes (e.g., policy change) more closely. The complexity of the problem area that PREAL addresses, the broad scope of its agenda and mission, and the resources available to the program raise concerns about the risk that PREAL may exceed its capacity to manage and address effectively its current program plan.  Under present funding and structure, neither PREAL nor the activities it supports are financially sustainable. Although research shows no official change in educational policy directly attributable to PREAL's activities in any of the four countries during the period of the cooperative agreement, there is evidence that PREAL has influenced the adoption, modification, and implementation of educational procedures and practices in PREAL-serviced countries. Because an important part of PREAL's operations is managed from its regional office in Chile, the Chile country report includes general findings relevant to PREAL as a whole: (1) There is unanimous consensus that PREAL, since its origin, has made an important and relevant contribution to helping to identify education reform priorities.  (2) PREAL publications and events are perceived to be highly effective and of high technical quality.  (3) Where access is available, the PREAL internet site and those maintained by some of the associated centers are important and useful information tools.  (4) PREAL's approach has been appropriate to its current objectives under the existing conditions for education reform in the region.  (5) There is a minority -- but important -- perception that PREAL needs to further clarify its role in relation to both its donor partners and its sponsoring and partner institutions.  (6) The success of PREAL is a source of both risks and opportunities.  PREAL's success is likely to pressure the program to expand its scope and be even more responsive to external demands despite its limited resources.  At the same time, PREAL's reputation to date represents a window of opportunity to continue influencing education reform processes in the region. PREAL needs to take stock of the achievements to date and further strengthen its strategic planning process. PREAL now needs to channel its comparative advantages -- excellent networks of senior people, good research and distribution, and the ability to create a vision -- to be even more effective in translating policy reform into educational practice.  Finally, PREAL, or the IAD, should not proceed alone in deliberating over future directions and relationships with USAID.  There are great potential advantages in the USAID-PREAL collaboration to systematically seek advice from experts and institutions in the region as a means of enhancing their respective potential of impact. USAID has found in PREAL a solid, performing partner for its regional interests. Senior personnel from both organizations should work together to develop new strategies in order to optimize each partner's resources and achieve the desired results.  Future planning should include a discussion of the whole issue of a regional approach to policy reform, as well as to issues of national or sub-regional focus. Questions pertinent to these issues are detailed.","Project title: Partnership for educational reform in the Americas|(PERA)|Project title: Basic education and policy support (BEPS)|Task order no. 4|Improved human resource policies","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","HNE-I-00-00-00038-00","","5/1/2001 12:00:00 AM","","Educational reform|Regional level|National level|Educational policy|Policy reform|Advocacy|Consensus building|Public sector|Private sector|Networks|Development planning|Case studies","Latin America|Chile|Honduras|Nicaragua|Peru","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABU827.pdf","356 KB","001341 - Creative Associates International, Inc.

"Evaluates project to expand advocacy for girls' education in Uttar Pradesh, India.  Interim evaluation covers the period 1/98-6/01. Development Alternatives, Inc. (DAI) (primary) and the Academy for Educational Development (AED) are the implementing agencies. The bulk of project work has been undertaken since September 1999, and, while there are notable achievements, especially during the last 6 months, the results and quality are short of those intended in the project workplan.  The most notable activities and outputs to date are: (1) the well- publicized establishment of the Better Education Through Innovation (BETI) Foundation as a Trust; (2) a study of private sector schools; (3) classroom-based participatory rapid appraisal/participatory learning appraisal (PRA/PLA) gender training for Bahraich District Primary Education Program (DIET) teachers; (4) the BETI website: and (5) participation in framing Uttar Pradesh's education policy.  There are also some promising joint ventures between BETI and such partners as CARE and Catholic Relief Services (an early childhood development effort), the Janshala project (community mobilization in two urban wards of Lucknow), and AED/W and CISCO (the piloting of a gender module on information technology). However, much more is needed in terms of the quality and timeliness of deliverables.  Serious implementation delays have occurred.  There are complaints that the project is heavily dependent on external TA and that the cumbersome approval arrangements prevent quick responses.  A lack of agreement on BETI's functions and priorities and inadequate understanding of the prerequisites for setting up a girls' education coordination center stem from the project implementation team's limited organizational development expertise.  Unclear roles and responsibilities for key project staff in leadership, management, and decisionmaking have led to poor managerial efficiency and effectiveness. There are also concerns about the organizational capabilities of the center, with much of the decisionmaking power centralized at the top; the inadequate level of in-house technical expertise; poor utilization of participatory processes limiting professional and stakeholder inputs; and inadequate programmatic linkages with partners in the field. BETI's current set-up was seen as a major impediment.  While BETI exists as an independent entity on paper, its structures and operations are in reality not distinct from the AED office and its personnel.  Nor does BETI command a separate budget or dispose of an appropriate corporate strategic plan and effective organizational structure and management systems.  Thus, despite unanimous agreement on the need for a girls' education coordination center and high regard for the current director of the DAI/AED/Lucknow office, BETI is perceived as having a limited ability to fulfill its program goals and objectives. The general view is that for BETI to become a center of excellence and an effective clearinghouse and catalyst for policy, research, advocacy, training, and alliance-building, the center should follow certain key guidelines of democratic governance and quality assurance: (1) BETI should have strong, independent technical and managerial leadership as distinct from the DAI/AED/Lucknow office.  (2) The Chair of BETI's Board of Trustees should not also be the BETI's Executive Director.  (3) BETI's management style should follow democratic principles, encouraging broad-based participation and transparency in decisionmaking.  (4) BETI should develop a technically strong in- house capability and staff with a proven record in innovative work on girls' education in India and elsewhere.  (5) BETI should set clear objectives, and pursue a strategic plan if it is to meet its overall goals.  (6) BETI's sustainability is contingent upon its capacity to elicit its own funding independent from the AED contract, as well as on its possession of appropriate institutional and organizational structures and systems, strategic business planning processes, and strong in-house program leadership to define priorities and mobilize commitment and support to achieve them. The remaining few months of the project should be utilized to initiate the process of separating BETI from DAI/AED/Lucknow.","Project title: women in development technical assistance (WIDTECH)|Expanding advocacy for girls' education in Uttar Pradesh, India|Document lists contract as FAO-0100-Q-06-600600","Special Evaluation","Documents","HNE-I-00-00-00278-00","","6/1/2001 12:00:00 AM","","Access to education|Girls|Advocacy|Institution building|Educational policy|Educational centers|Coordinating|Change agents","India","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABW002.pdf","814 KB","","","","English","application/pdf","Interim evaluation","","Agarwal-Harding, Seema|Dayaram","Girls' education","20 Jun 2001","","","","Evaluation of the USAID-funded girls' education activity","","PD-ABW-002","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MjY1MTUx","India","9300100"
"Evaluates phase I of the Morocco Education for Girls (MEG) project, aimed at increasing attainment of basic education among girls in selected rural provinces in Morocco. Interim evaluation cover the period 1997-2001.   MEG, which is scheduled for completion in September 2004, continues the work of three predecessor projects, which are also evaluated in the report:  Training for Development (TFD), 1996-1999; Girls' Education Activity (GEA), 1997-2001; Computer-Assisted Teacher Training (CATT-Pilot), 1999-2001. The current evaluation has confirmed the existence of products, processes, and methods developed over the last 4 years that deserve extension beyond the pilot schools of the project.  These elements have contributed significantly to the enrollment and retention of girls in the project zones.   The most important challenge facing MEG lies in the prospects for replicating its accomplishments and in the degree to which the Ministry of National Education (MNE) will take ownership of the tools produced -- tools that are likely to help the MNE operationalize the educational reforms contained in the National Charter for Education and Training. Despite getting off to a slow start, the MEG project has now reached cruising speed and has put into place numerous pedagogical, community mobilization, and management innovations.  The three MEG components -- improving teaching skills, increasing community support to its schools, and strengthening provincial educational management -- constitute a single approach centered on improving the school environment.  That this improvement has increased enrollment levels in general and those of girls in particular is confirmed by the data collected by the provincial education administrations.  The innovations, processes, and products emerging from the MEG experience constitute a whole that deserves the title of MEG model.  It behooves the MNE to examine closely their possible replication, whether as a package or separately. It is recommended that, for phase 2, the MEG project adopt a strategy of limited extension of its most important activities within the eight provinces where it is currently operating. This limited expansion will constitute a test of the replicability of the most successful elements of the MEG model: five training modules and training for teachers, school directors, inspectors, and teachers in the teacher training institutes (CFIs); and activities linked to the creation, strengthening, and management.

"Mission close-out report on activities (9/97-9/01) in support of strategic objective (SO) 2 -- to promote family planning (FP) in Ecuador.  FP activities were carried out by two NGOs -- Asociacion Pro Bienestar de la Familia Ecuatoriana (APROFE) and Centro Medico de Orientacion y Planificacion Familiar (CEMOPLAF).  Health activities under SO 2 -- including financing for Centro de Estudios de Poblacion Y Desarrollo Social (CEPAR)   ended 9/00 as planned. USAID support has helped APROFE and CEMOPLAF grow from being small regional organizations to national importance with 21 clinics each.  Key overall results were as follows:  (1) Consolidation of FP NGOs hard hit by financial constraints was increased in 1999-2000 (through an additional $1.1 million for contraceptives and logistics technical support in FY 2001). These local NGOs managed to make a significant recovery in late FY 2000 and early FY 2001 and still attracted a growing clientele to their private clinics.  Cost recovery targets were met despite these severe challenges, with an average of over 90% for APROFE and CEMOPLAF.  (2) Thanks to the special emphasis given to institutional strengthening, both NGOs have solid administration and empowered management staff in preparation for USAID phase- out.  (3) Contraceptive prevalence rate (CPR), the primary measure of SO results, increased significantly, from 56.8 in 1994 to 66.3 in 1999.  Also, the total fertility rate declined from 3.6 in 1994 to 3.3 in 1999 (a modest but significant decline). Some 61% of FP users now obtain contraceptive services from private sources, and 36.6% of contraceptive use is for female sterilization, of which the Ministry of Health (MOH) provides over 60%. (4) CEPAR, with TA from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), carried out, in both 1994 and 1999, the nation's most widely representative and respected demographic and reproductive health survey, ENDEMAIN, the largest survey of its kind in Latin America.  (5) National Reproductive Health Services Guidelines were prepared and disseminated, with JHPIEGO taking the lead in coordinating the many participant institutions.  (6) A quality index of seven factors was applied and accomplished by 42 APROFE and CEMOPLAF clinics.  These factors are: stockouts of any method/brand; at least three modern methods available; private exam space in facility; staff trained in methods available in counseling and on side effects; state-of-the-art national guidelines available onsite; facility staffed and open at least 5 hours per day; and staff trained on handling/disposal of medical wastes.  (7) Cost recovery levels of both assisted NGOs continued to increase even during the economic crisis of the late 1990s and 2000.  The amounts deposited in the sustainability fund show the great efforts made by local partners to recover costs while maintaining their social mission to serve the poor and lower middle class. Specific achievements by each NGO are noted in the report. Lessons learned are as follows:  (1) Because Ecuador experiences rapid political, economic, and social changes, project success should be measured beyond target figures and should include indicators such as transparency in management and solid leadership.  (2) Long-term actions are required to prepare local partners for self-sustainability, with attention to long-term institutional strengths and weaknesses.  (3) TA should be focused in institutional strengthening, as most of the local NGOs begin as family organizations, where nepotism is a daily practice and businesslike management practices uncommon.  (4) Project indicators should include measures for institutional strengthening.  (5) Although FP coverage increased for both NGO partners, the poorest populations are generally still far away from the services.  The number of participating partners should be increased in order to expand the access of services. (6) Local NGO partners were urged to achieve self-sustainability; this forced them to increase the prices of health and FP services and practically abandon many of the original target population -- the poor and the marginalized, especially women.  (7) The accomplishment of project indicators does not reflect an entire institution's performance. It could be a performance of a group of employees but not a result of a well-managed organization. Indicators not included in the Mission Performance Monitoring Plan should be tracked in order to evaluate other efforts of the institution.  (8) Despite reports received by the Mission, it is particularly important to work closely with the NGOs to identify their strengths and weaknesses and to address assistance accordingly.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/2001 12:00:00 AM","","Family planning promotion programs|Reproductive health|Strategic objectives|Indigenous private voluntary organizations|Financial resources|Cost recovery|Contraceptive prevalence|Family planning clinics|Health care administration|Procedural development|Economic conditions|Demographic surveys|Economic self sufficiency|Institution building|Fertility decline|Sterilization (birth control)","Ecuador","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABW129.pdf","29 KB","008538 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to establish rehabilitation centers for people disabled by war in Cambodia.  Interim evaluation covers the period 1996-10/01.  Veterans International/Cambodia (VI/C) is the implementing agency. VI/C's USAID-funded rehabilitation efforts are providing highly successful and valuable interventions for people with disabilities.  The grant support has enabled people with amputations, spinal cord injuries, cerebral palsy, polio, and a number of other pathologies to receive high-quality rehabilitation and prosthetic and orthotic services. Numerous patients have had significantly positive functional and social outcomes, with particularly good outcomes for patients with amputations and clubfeet, and good outcomes for those with polio and spinal cord injury.  The quality of rehabilitation services for patients with cerebral palsy or for those who have suffered a stroke could be improved. Rehabilitation services are accessible to individuals with disabilities in three areas at the centers based in Phnom Penh, Kratie, and Prey Veng.  An additional unit in the far North (Preah Vihear) is now self-supporting.  The coordination of NGO rehabilitation services in Cambodia through the Disabilities Action Council (DAC) with a variety of subcommittees has been very effective in minimizing overlap among services and ensuring communication between NGOs.  The physiotherapists and prosthetics and orthotics (P&O) personnel have mid-level professional standards with diploma entry-level education.  The professionals have good technical skills for developing country standards, but lack the flexibility required in situations that involve complex patients or when adequate medical/surgical diagnostics have not been completed.  The lack of clinical decisionmaking skills, lack of solid theoretical foundations, and minimal exposure to a variety of treatment alternatives result in difficulties with efficiency, prioritization and progression of patient treatment.  The professionals employed by VI/C have the potential to be Cambodian leaders, but will need further professional mentoring and continuing education opportunities to develop their skills. The community follow-up services are intended to provide accessible support for patients after they have received rehabilitation or delivery of devices.  The methods in which these services are delivered are not ensuring the objective of enhancing the functional goals of patients. The entire focus of the community follow-up services, communication of goals, personnel delivering services, and assessment of efficacy needs to be revisited. The medical and surgical support services at the two rural facilities of Prey Veng and Kratie are insufficient to support the needs of the rehabilitation facilities.  Developing these services locally would greatly enhance the efficacy of services at these units.

"Evaluates the assistance to Russian orphans (ARO) program.  Mid-term evaluation covers the period 9/99-9/01.  The program is being implemented by a consortium composed of Holt International and Mercy Corps International. To fully accomplish program objectives, the present grant should be extended for at least 3 years and efforts should be made to strengthen the management of the present sub-grantees, especially those with good working model projects, as well as to document and promote the ARO model projects more widely.  This implies that ARO shift some its grant-making activities, and use more of its resources to consolidate and promote the lessons learned to date, especially in areas where good models of child abandonment prevention and social adaptation have been created. More effort should be made to establish NGO support centers in the regions where they are weak or not available at all.  ARO East has made few efforts in this area, and ARO West has made a start in this direction in Novgorod where the Early Intervention Center approach has already spread to Boroviche. The NGO support centers should be equipped with trainers with the capability to assist NGOs in the areas of fundraising, community involvement in ARO projects, promotion of ARO models in state institutions, and advocacy skills. The evaluation team is cautiously optimistic about the ARO program's capacity to make changes in the way Russian orphanages and boarding schools are managed.  Models, such as the two cases in Moscow where traditional state institutions are converting to child development organizations, give rise to hope. However, such conversions may be much more difficult in other oblasts.  While many state officials, as well as staff of Russian orphanages, seem enthusiastic about making changes, particularly with respect to child abandonment, in general they seem to lack the authority to make the needed changes on the proper scale. Continuing efforts need to be made with governmental officials who possess such authority. NGOs give quality care to children in the age range 2-5, and help parents in ARO NGO-managed programs to work with their learning-handicapped children, thus helping parents to make decisions to keep, rather than to abandon their disabled children.  ARO has also supported a number of pilot projects related to social welfare reform. Some useful ideas for changes in child social welfare policy and practice have developed into seeds of change for Russian child care institutions.  However, to create social welfare reform, a ""critical mass"" of NGO, community, university, and government commitment will be necessary.  At present, the strongest agents of change appear to be the NGO sector and municipal governments. For social welfare reform to occur, NGOs and staff of child welfare institutions must be trained to find the most effective points of intervention in the life of the parents and child for preventing child abandonment and creating support for the social adaptation of children entering adolescence and adulthood.  It is recommended that in a priority region, each NGO should provide a service that addresses one of the key intervention points in the child and parents' life.  Their demonstrations to government and institutions of when and how to intervene in the lives of child and their parents should be a primary responsibility of the ARO NGOs. Finally, the ARO program has made a commendable effort to conceptualize and define its objectives and programs. If the next plan is approved, there appears to be significant potential for further measurable benefits.

"Final evaluation of Phase I of the Zimbabwe American Development Foundation (ZADF) project, aimed at improving civil society organizations' (CSOs) representation of citizen's interests at the national level.  Phase I is being implemented by Private Agencies Collaborating Together (PACT).  The evaluation covers the period 9/98-3/02, against a PACD of 9/02. Phase I of the ZADF/PACT program has strengthened the capacity of targeted CSOs to advocate with Parliament, as measured against the advocacy index.  PACT developed a sound grants management system that not only efficiently awards subgrants, but also contributes to subgrantee capacity building and institutional strengthening. Similarly, PACT's management of the advocacy index process, which was designed and introduced by USAID, has been excellent, resulting in subgrantee use of the advocacy index as a multi-purpose tools.  The workshops, training, and TA provided by PACT were also given high marks by the subgrantees.  While there were some serious complaints that early workshops did not adequately building advocacy skills, PACT continues to address these issues and subsequent workshops have been more effective than earlier ones. The evaluation contains several recommendations that can be easily implemented during the last year of PACT's cooperative agreement to improve performance, including increased focus on networking, increased emphasis on reaching the subgrantee decisionmakers, and greater use of one-on-one TA rather than workshops and group training sessions.  The evaluation confirms the need for USAID to proceed with implementation of Phase II of the ZADF program.  Both capacity building and advocacy are long-term activities that require additional support if interventions to date are to be sustainable, and the political and economic crisis in Zimbabwe dramatically illustrates the urgent need for civil society to be able to make its voice heard in a constructive manner. Phase II should continue to focus on increasing participation and understanding of the advocacy process, rather than on changing specific legislation.  Also, USAID should continue to work with Phase I CSOs in order to deepen their ability to advocate with Parliament.  At the same time, criteria are needed for determining when an organization should be phased out of the ZADF program and replaced with new ones.  During Phase II, ZADF should adopt a more holistic approach to working with the CSOs. There is a strong need for general organizational development assistance to ensure that advocacy becomes institutionalized within the subgrantees' organizations.","Updated March 4, 2002|Evaluated project title: Zimbabwe American Development Foundation (ZADF)","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","613-O-00-02-00001-00","","11/1/2001 12:00:00 AM","","Political development|Civil society|Local groups|Institution building|Human capacity development|Political participation|Advocacy|Legal reform|Legislature|Private voluntary organizations|Indigenous private voluntary organizations|Grants","Zimbabwe","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABW220.pdf","162 KB","008628 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of phase II of a project to rehabilitate the Morulem irrigation scheme (MIS) in Kenya's Kerio river basin (1997-2001).  World Vision (WV) was the implementing agency. The project's main objective -- to increase household food production to 80% of annual grain requirements -- has been met and exceeded. Average household grain production during the past year supplied 138% of the household's grain needs.  Tenure security has been enhanced by issuing identity cards and land allotments registered in the name of individual farmers.  During Phase II, 1,528 farmers (300 more than originally planned) were given access to at least 0.5 acres each. The main reasons for the consistent yield increases during the project were the consistent training in improved agricultural practices and the high adoption rates thereof by farmers.  Thanks to encouragement by WV, farmers have also started to a plant a greater variety of crops, and the percentage of farmers who sold cash crops increased significantly since the 1999 mid-term survey.  The agroforestry initiative has been particularly successful.  A total of 26,394 tree seedlings and 16,829 fruit trees (mainly paw-paw) were planted during Phase II. Two woodlots, comprising 4 acres in total, were also established in the areas where the excess irrigation water drains. Significant progress has also been made in the areas of nutrition (vegetable and fruit consumption), the provision and use of water from safe sources, and health and sanitation.  The project also helped create at least 938 jobs (full and part-time), with the direct beneficiaries of these jobs estimated at 5,630. One of the project's strengths was the continuous and meaningful participation of the farmers during all stages of planning and implementation.  The project's flexible, learning- based approach toward project planning, made possible by the flexibility of Title II resources, contributed significantly to project success.  On the down side, lack of a baseline survey hampered monitoring and evaluation of the project.  Other success factors included WV's acceptance of the traditional land allocation process, resulting in a high degree of compliance with scheme by-laws. The project's most significant impacts are as follows:  (1) The irrigation scheme has diversified (and will continue to diversify) the local economy by creating jobs for both scheme and non-scheme members. This is happening in an area where there are no other job creators besides the government, a few local shop owners, and the missions. (2) Most scheme farmers are able to produce enough grain to feed their family throughout the year.  Surpluses are sold on the local market, making grain more readily available to non-scheme members than before. (3) Scheme members have security of tenure with the possibility of title deeds in future. This may set the precedent for farmers who are members of other similar schemes.  (4) Vegetables and fruits are being sold on the local market in an area where they have never been available before. (5) The large numbers of multiple-use trees planted provide fruit and by- products that farmers can use and sell locally, providing them with an income and making products such as paw-paw and neem available in the area for the first time. Many of the tree species planted, especially the nitrogen-fixing varieties, improve soil fertility in the area.  (6) Trees are also for sale to non-scheme members and their benefits are available to the community at large.  A private tree nursery was started as a result of scheme activities.  The owner of the nursery also benefitted from the technical skills taught to scheme members. (7) Large numbers of community motivators and farmers have been trained in technical, management, and leadership skills that benefit both farmers and the community at large. The project is sustainable institutionally, environmentally, infrastructurally, and financially.  Lessons and recommendations are detailed regarding irrigation infrastructure; the relation of extension agents to the Morulem Water Users Association (MWUA); soil fertility; agroforestry practices; animal traction; marketing and income generation; monitoring and evaluation of health, nutrition, and sanitation; and the privatization of hand pumps.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","8/1/2001 12:00:00 AM","","Water supply structures|Agricultural water management|Irrigated farming|Food production|Cereal crops|Land tenure|Crop yield|Agricultural technology|Agricultural extension|Technology adoption|Agroforestry|Nutrition improvement|Water supply|Health care|Sanitation|Employment|Income generation|Farm income|Water user associations|Animal traction|Marketing|Development project monitoring|Hand pumps|Project sustainability|Private voluntary organizations","Kenya","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABW259.pdf","1,157 KB","010256 - World Vision International, Kenya","","008565 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of a matching grant (MG) to Food for the Hungry International (FHI) to start a microfinance program in East Africa (4/95-3/01). The MG established two leading microfinance institutions (MFIs) -- Faulu Uganda and Faulu Kenya -- that are on the path to becoming commercial profit-making companies reaching the working poor with microfinance services.  However, they still require 2- 3 more years to achieve their commercial and self-sustaining objectives. Assuming that all goes well, their capacity to deliver services to ever greater numbers of the poor will be established.  In terms of service delivery, then, the MG, through its provision of seed capital for the two MFIs, is a success.  (USAID and FHI agreed not to move forward in Ethiopia because of a weak enabling environment).  The success of the two Faulu field programs largely rests on strong staff that followed microfinance best practices and established necessary MFI systems to manage for results. On the other hand, it is not clear whether the two successes can be replicated in other countries.  What little microfinance development capacity exists in FHI will be fully utilized over the next few years supporting the two existing programs.  FHI should examine its experiences and capabilities to see what might be successful strategies for further microfinance development after Faulu Kenya and Uganda. FHI's separate office for microfinance has not worked well in terms of expanding microfinance programs within FHI.  There has been no expansion of the Faulu network since 1995 when the Uganda program was started.  Faulu has not had any measurable impact on FHI country programs, which remain without MFI activities.  Outside of the two Faulus themselves, FHI field staffs have little capacity to develop and manage MF programs. While FHI has attracted substantial donor assistance, including three additional grants from USAID, all funds have been used to strengthen and expand the existing programs.  The time, effort, and money required to develop and support Faulu Kenya and Uganda (and initiate Ethiopia) has been great.  The task is larger than FHI leadership envisaged at the start of the MG.  That 6 years has passed since the last Faulu was started suggests that little can be expected in the future.  This reinforces the question about what capacity has been built at FHI through the MG. During the course of the MG, the original concept of an FHI regional bank failed.  What eventually emerged was a traditional structure of autonomous country programs supported by a unit in headquarters and all linked in a network council.  A lesson learned is that an MG that seeks to develop capacity of a PVO in a technical field new to the organization greatly increases the risk of failure if field implementation also tries to be innovative and on the cutting edge of the technical field.  In hindsight, if FHI had set about establishing Faulu as a series of independent MFIs supported by a small headquarters office, much time and money would have been saved.  The plan for a regional bank was innovative in many aspects, but it could only have been truly tested with a deep and rich knowledge of MF practices and field experiences.","Task order no. 2|Evaluation support services indefinite quantity contract|(Evaluation IQC)","Special Evaluation","Documents","AEP-I-00-00-00024-00","","12/1/2001 12:00:00 AM","","Development finance institutions|Microenterprises|Institution building|Matching funds|Private voluntary organizations|Management development|Project replication|Microfinance","East Africa|Uganda|Kenya|Ethiopia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABX325.pdf","317 KB","003970 - Management Systems International, Inc.
