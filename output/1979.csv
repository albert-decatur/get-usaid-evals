"Evaluates P.L. 480 Title II food distribution program in India. Evaluation covers FY 79 and is based on interviews with personnel from AID/W, USAID/I, and the four PVO's which are implementing the program and on visits to l40 program sites in nine Indian states. A total of $106 million worth of food was distributed during the year and benefitted 16 million people.  The PVO's project implementation has been excellent; however, a lack of prior definition of goals and purposes has led to upper-level interference in PVO performance.  The Maternal/Child Health (MCH) program is ineffective because of ration sharing, substitution, use of inappropriate foods, and poor targeting. However, the food is a potential incentive for receiving other health benefits if the latter are available.  The Food for Work (FFW) program varies widely in its results, being successful if food is used as an incentive for community cooperation but ineffective if food is granted without requiring a contribution of labor or resources.  The School Feeding (SF) program, which aimed more at increasing enrollment than improving nutrition, is on target. It is recommended that priorities among the MCH, FFW, and SF be eliminated for greater flexibility in food allocation; upper-level managers refrain from altering lower-level decisions, while requiring a minimum of reporting; PVO's be encouraged to develop alternative programming methods for Title II commodities; data collection efforts be separated into on-going program monitoring and periodic evaluation of purpose and goal achievement with geographically stratified random samplings of programs in each major category; and that mutual respect be fostered between PVO's and USAID/I. More specific recommendations are, inter alia, to: increase efforts to reach children under three with low-bulk, high-nutrition food; improve environmental sanitation; involve communities in planning and selection of beneficiaries; determine food needs and resources in advance of each subproject; provide special training for those responsible for the Mid-Day Meals program and include vitamin supplements in the program; and aid current client schools while promoting, depending on local participation, new schools in less advanced areas.","Evaluation period: Jul 1978-Jun 1979","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/SOD/PDC-C-0082","","6/1/1979 12:00:00 AM","","Food for work|Food for Peace|Food aid programs|School feeding programs|Child feeding programs|child nutrition|Maternal child health care|Private voluntary organizations|Community participation","India","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAI843.pdf","15,682 KB","000385 - Community Systems Foundation","","000086 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to provide credit and technical assistance (TA) to small- and medium-sized industrial enterprises in Colombia.  Final evaluation covers the period 10/01/75-12/15/78 and is based on interviews with implementing agency and A.I.D. personnel. While the project, implemented by the Colombian Government-owned Corporacion Financiera Popular (CFP), achieved its purpose, the TA program was markedly less successful than the credit component. The expected amounts of confidence, community, professional, and production marketing credit were lent, but the exact distribution among the four credit lines varied somewhat from targets. Regionally, Bogota accounted for 25% of all credit, while Cartagena received only 2%; the overall distribution of loans reflected the pattern of Colombia's industrial development.  Analysis of loan portfolio information shows that the 9.4% default rate was normal; community credit to cooperatives was the most difficult to recoup; Cartagena had the highest default rate (48.8%); and that the high default rate for confidence credit (9.3%) was closely related to borrowers' lack of adequate collateral.  In the future, the administrative and technical ability of small entrepreneurs should be judged and TA supplied before loans are made.  Contributing to the default rate were fluctuating prices, occasionally weak CFP financial analyses and borrower administrative abilities, insufficient or weak collateral, and lack of continuous credit follow-up by the CFP. Under the TA program, the CFP conducted 207 training and motivation short courses, seminars, and training sessions for 3,441 managers; provided consultant services to 499 firms and accounting assistance to 463 firms; distributed 6,000 pamphlets monthly; and answered 512 requests for technical information.  The TA program was hindered, however, by a 6-month start-up delay, high turnover of personnel, a lack of post-seminar follow-up, the absence of a long-range TA plan, and the CFP's use of funds for salaries rather than TA activities. The evaluation concludes that the TA needs of small entrepreneurs were so great that dispersing the TA effort produced little impact; TA should have been made available to industrialists outside the loan program; and CFP loan supervision should have been complemented by TA.","Loan no. 514-W-074|Evaluation period: Oct 1975-Dec 1978","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","11/1/1979 12:00:00 AM","","Small scale enterprises|Credit","Colombia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAG951.pdf","793 KB","008530 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to encourage integrated diversified rural development in Costa Rica.  Final evaluation covers the period 7/76-12/79; no methodology is stated. The project has defined a strategy for local development and created a basic structure for continued development. Regarding production, crop diversification was promoted through the planting of permanent tree crops (fruit trees and achiote) and small scale vegetable production. To encourage reforestation, a promotional campaign was conducted and demonstration woodlots were planted.  Also, a local farmer organization, the Centro Agricole Cantonal de Hojancha (CACH), was created to negotiate right of use contracts with farmers to establish and manage woodlots on their land.  As a result, 53 woodlots totalling 26 ha were planted.  To improve cattle herd management, herd management and disease control training was offered and efforts were made to preserve dry season forage.  Two small businesses were also founded - a fruit and wood tree nursery and and a classification and distribution center for fruits and vegetables.  Almost all operations are now performed unassisted. From 1/78-1/79, 62 formal training sessions (intensive, extensive, and promotional) were held for 945 participants representing 300 farmers and students.  In its final year, the project sought to develop marketing strategies to increase small farmers' access to local, regional, and national markets.  Despite excessive turnover among participants and problems in setting up the marketing system and obtaining credit, the system is functioning and improving.  A milk marketing program did not materialize since it would require government support.  Finally, institutional support and coordination was continually promoted, with the CACH acting as the primary instrument for coordinating technical assistance to government agencies.  CACH has proven to be a fairly effective local planning and coordinating body. The project's impact on family income will not be measurable for 3-5 years, as many activities are long-term.  It is estimated that 6,050 man days of labor were generated, from 7/78-7/79 - equal to 22.9 full-time jobs.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","11/1/1979 12:00:00 AM","","Integrated rural development|Beneficiary count|Limited data","Costa Rica","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAG954.pdf","584 KB","008533 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to introduce modern sericulture technology to poor farmers in northeast Thailand.  Special evaluation covers the period 9/76-1/79 and is based on visits to 9 of 10 project villages by personnel from USAID/T and the Royal Thai Government (RTG). Although the project is behind schedule in disbursing funds, recruiting participants, and producing silk, the incomes of the poor have been increased (the average farmer produced 106 kg of cocoons during 5-12/78 to earn a THB475 profit); a sound foundation has been established; and the project should be able to meet its 1981 targets. By 9/78, 588 families were either producing silk, being trained, or establishing mulberry plots.  Although difficulties in producing hybrid silkworm hatching eggs and farmers' failure to follow recommended mulberry leaf production practices have been major constraints, technical knowledge of silkworm rearing has been well applied and many farmers are achieving yields of 20 kg of cocoons per box (approaching Japanese yields of 24 kg).  Although silkworm rearing houses have cost more than expected, they are of high quality and farmers do not consider them too expensive. Credit was being extended as fast as farmers could be recruited and trained; by 9/78, THB6,934,780 of a total THB13,315,000 had been loaned. Loan repayment is expected to be good as long as the Korat Center continues to pay farmers above-market prices. In addition, the innovative practice of allowing local bank managers some discretion in determining loan criteria has enabled several very poor yet industrious farmers to obtain credit. Extension workers, including many women, appear well-trained and enthusiastic, but the ratio of one agent per 20 families is high. Supervisors were knowledgeable and were effectively managing the project; the Project Coordinating Committee has been an effective mechanism for resolving problems among implementors.  Cooperatives have been unimportant to date and should continue to be deemphasized. The project has demonstrated potential for replicability on a broader scale; the RTG should undertake economic analyses soon so as to be prepared for replication immediately after project completion.","Evaluation period: 24 Jan-21 Feb 1979","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","2/1/1979 12:00:00 AM","","Sericulture","Thailand","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAI774.pdf","1,650 KB","002985 - Thailand.

"Evaluates project to test the cost-effectiveness of various family planning delivery systems in rural Thailand.  Special evaluation covers the period 1977-1979 and is based on interviews with key Royal Thai Government (RTG) and A.I.D. personnel, site visits, and document review. The project, implemented by the RTG's Community-Based Family Planning Services (CBFPS), has achieved most of its objectives -- although the the CBFPS will not be self-sufficient by late 1981 as planned -- and has shown that provision of family planning services reduces morbidity and mortality more than does provision of simple health care services. Based on a survey conducted by Mahidol University, the CBFPS selected 80 districts in which to test four models of contraceptive delivery-- low-priced pills and condoms were sold both with and without an initial 2 months free supply and with and without provision of household drugs and health orientation.  Four districts served as a control.  The CBFPS then trained 5,800 village distributors and 80 district supervisors in 29 provinces.  Past weaknesses in the recruitment, training, and supervision of village distributors were overcome. A total of 65,072 new pill acceptors were recruited; overall acceptance in the four experimental areas was 80% of target.  Results indicate that distribution of contraceptives alone is the most cost-effective approach (100% of target was achieved) and that the addition of household drugs does not promote contraception; however, once a delivery system is in place it is easy to include complementary basic health services.  Free distribution of contraceptives has a mixed impact.  While gaining a large number of acceptors, such a policy depletes limited national and local health care resources and leads consumers to assign little value to contraceptives. The RTG should consider charging for pills or phase in a new brand of low-priced pills, although instituting such a policy will be difficult.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/pha-C-1100","","2/1/1979 12:00:00 AM","","Contraceptive distribution|Family planning research","Thailand","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAJ055.pdf","900 KB","000262 - American Public Health Association","","","English","application/pdf","Indepth evaluation|Onsite evaluation","","Carlson, Bruce D.|Potts, Malcolm","","Feb 1979","","","","Community-based family planning services, family planning health and hygiene (FOHH) project","","PD-AAJ-055","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTUyOTIz","Thailand","4930283"
"Evaluates project to establish national cereals offices (NCO) within Sahelian governments to stabilize grain prices and markets. Evaluation covers the period 10/71-8/79 and is based on document review and interviews with project personnel and outside experts. Due to a project design that was too broad and an implementation plan that was too narrow, the project, now in its 8th year, has shown little progress since the initial 2-year pilot phase.  Key assumptions have proven unrealistic, e.g., that the area could be self-sufficient in grain in non-drought years and, more basically, that NCO's were adequate to solve the grain self-sufficiency problem. In addition, an insufficient range of technical assistance was scheduled.  Limited interest in the project on the part of Sahelian governments has prevented expansion of NCO's and thus of grain stabilization efforts region-wide; the only NCO's existing are the two originally created -- the Niger Government's Office des Produits Vivriers du Niger (OPVN) and the Upper Voltan Government's Office National des Cereales (OFNACER). Neither OPVN nor OFNACER, moreover, has succeeded in stabilizing grain prices and markets. The project was plagued with difficulties from the outset.  During Phase I (1971-75), personnel and equipment arrived late, delaying training and the construction of grain warehouses; the impact of the Sahelian drought disrupted commercial grain markets; NCO policies favored consumers at the expense of producers; and coordination between A.I.D., other donors, the Entente Fund, and OPVN or OFNACER was suboptimal.  The project remained in limbo from 1975 to 1977 pending a decision on Phase II, during implementation of which (1977-79) OFNACER received added authority over Voltan grain market stabilization activities and upgraded its financial and administrative abilities, while OPVN--although on a more sound footing--continued to be hamstrung by its organizational distance from decisionmakers in the Niger Government. It is therefore recommended that A.I.D. discontinue the project as a regional effort.  However, since the original project purpose remains inadequately tested, Sahelian governments should carefully consider alternative grain stabilization strategies.","References: p.70-74|Evaluation period: Oct 1971-Aug 1979","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","8/1/1979 12:00:00 AM","","Millet|Sorghum|Cereals|Agricultural product marketing|Cereal crops|Crop production|Food storage|Warehouses|Drought|Disaster relief|Markets|Economic surveys|Prices|Economic policy|Institution building|Price stabilization|Limited data plus","Sahel|Niger|Burkina Faso","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAI929.pdf","1,937 KB","000819 - Multinational Agribusiness Systems, Inc.","","002680 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to assist the Government of Tunisia (GOT) to expand family planning (FP) services.  Midterm evaluation covers the period 1978-9/79 and is based on interviews with staff of the Ministry of Public Health (MOPH), the GOT implementing agency -- the National Family Planning and Population Office (ONPFP), other GOT ministries and agencies, and medical faculties. The ONPFP has made major advances toward realizing project objectives. Achievements include:  (1) strengthened educational and administrative structures in all 18 provinces; (2) rural pilot projects testing innovative FP service delivery tactics; (3) a national training center, operational since 3/79; (4) expanded research and evaluation activities; (5) an expanded clinical program including voluntary sterilization; (6) maintenance of performance levels during a period of program expansion and penetration into less easily served rural areas; and (7) demonstration of the value of female FP rural outreach workers. The most successful activities have been the rural pilot projects and research and evaluation activities, both of which have generated a tremendous amount of valuable data.  On the other hand, information, education, and communication activities have shown little penetration into rural areas; technical assistance appears to have been underutilized; and training targets have not been met. Recommendations for consolidating recent achievements and improving rural FP service delivery are:  (1) review plans for project amendment no.2 to ensure that it reflects current status and needs in all assistance areas; (2) discuss with ONPFP plans for community-based distribution programs in Kairouan, Medenine, and Gabes and consider immediate implementation; (3) plan and implement a pilot information, education, and communication project in one province in 1980; (4) have key MOPH, ONPFP, and USAID/T staff make field studies of successful Asian FP programs; (5) appoint a full-time ONPFP coordinator for the Family Planning International Assistance subproject to expand FP/Maternal Child Health services in four provinces; and (6) provide a special budget to improve participant training.  Issues facing the GOT's FP program in the 1980's are addressed in a companion report (PD-AAJ-052).","","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/pha/c-1100","","10/1/1979 12:00:00 AM","","Rural areas|Beneficiary count","Tunisia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAJ061.pdf","1,708 KB","000262 - American Public Health Association","","000191 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to clarify the mechanism of action and side effects of prostaglandins.  Special evaluation covers the period 1971-79 and is based on site visits and interviews with project staff. This productive research program has advanced both clinical expertise and drug development and has resulted in more than 50 articles being published in reputable journals. Laboratory research has successfully elucidated the basic mechanisms underlying initiation and maintenance of uterine contractions and has described progesterone withdrawal as it relates to inducing early and normal term labor.  These mechanisms have increased medical understanding of prostaglandin-induced abortion but have not led to better compounds for clinical use, although screening is continuing. The use of progesterone synthesis inhibitors to regulate fertility has been limited to laboratory examination of the compound isoxazole and its abortion-inducing effects in rats.  Because of possible side effects, though, it is doubtful such progestorone synthesis inhibitors will be useful in human fertility control. Progress has been made in developing prostaglandin analogues with fewer side effects, suggesting that a self administrable prostaglandin for early abortion or early menstrual regulation may eventually be found. It is recommended that the laboratory and program be continued at the current level of support with possible salary increases for the in-house staff of Washington University.","Attached to PD-AAJ-129|Evaluation period: 1971-1979","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1979 12:00:00 AM","","Prostaglandins|abortion|Family planning research|Maternal child health care|Fertility|Demographic research|gynecology|Limited data plus","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAJ129A.pdf","288 KB","000262 - American Public Health Association","","","English","application/pdf","Onsite evaluation","","Behrman, Harold|Anderson, Gerald","","1979","","","","Side effects and mechanism of action of prostaglandins","","XD-AAJ-129-A","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTUzMTQ4","Population and Humanitarian Assistance","9320541"
"Evaluates project implemented by the U.S. Census Bureau (BUCEN) to develop and maintain a comprehensive demographic data base for use by USAID's.  Evaluation covers the period l978-l979 and is based on document review and interviews with project and other concerned personnel. BUCEN's data base is of high-quality, is easily accessible and regularly updated, and uses universal standards.  However, BUCEN does not apply the same criteria to all countries; favors census data over other, more reliable data (e.g., prevalence of contraceptive use); computes the data solely in terms of the UN's Age-Sex Accuracy Index; and adjusts data, often heavily and in a highly complex manner, to arrive at internal consistency. The results are mixed.  Data in the country profiles (CP) found in World Population 1977, for example, while generally consistent (despite anomalies) and free of serious error, are not easily comparable to data from other reputable sources; and key discrepancies exist between BUCEN and A.I.D. estimates of crude birth rates.  Other problems include the dubious value of BUCEN's use of long-term projections for short-term estimates and of its adjusted data on infant mortality reductions.  While BUCEN has generally fulfilled its contractual obligations, it has fallen behind in the production of CP's. Poor A.I.D./BUCEN working relations seem to lie behind A.I.D.'s complaint that BUCEN neglects A.I.D.'s needs in favor of other requests. Future issues of World Population should include crude birth and death rates and population estimates for the year issued and a year or two beyond.  The CP's should be modified to: (1) reflect the country's size and importance and include data on large cities; (2) include a summary analysis of demographic levels and trends, placing the country in its regional context, relating the data to changes in socioeconomic development and the availability of family planning and other services; (3) reduce adjustments and make data presentation more flexible; (4) use simpler extrapolations for short-term projections; (5) reduce publication time; (6) employ one or two reviewers to assure a more thorough professional review; (7) reduce delays in data processing through more staff trips to specific countries; and (8) devote more time to urban growth, manpower problems, and methodological innovations.","Evaluation period: 1978-1979","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/pha-C-1100","","7/1/1979 12:00:00 AM","","Population censuses|demography|Demographic research|Population and demography|Information storage and retrieval systems|Research centers|Public data","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAI740.pdf","840 KB","000262 - American Public Health Association","","000077 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to increase women's productivity in Upper Volta (UV) through greater access to credit.  Special evaluation covers the period 10/77-2/79; no methodology is stated. Limited progress has been made toward creating the planned credit information system, revolving loan fund, and training materials. Although project activities have begun in the Eastern, Koudougou, and Bougouriba Organization for Rural Development (ORD) areas, activities in the Black Volta ORD were suspended due to an overlap with a planned UV Government project. Initial project implementation has focused on setting up a research, monitoring, and evaluative credit information system consisting of studies on loan procedures (including forms) and practices. Subsequently, domestic economy agents, after a 1-week course on the purpose and use of these forms, conducted village household surveys. Although the data have been tabulated, they are of questionable validity, and as a result, a report has not been written. Committees to administer a revolving loan fund targeted to women-oriented projects and featuring in-kind loans at 8% interest (a more realistic rate than the 5.5% charged in many male-dominated programs) have been established, procedures and forms have been simplified, and extensionists have acquainted ORD area leaders with the fund's potential. Training has so far occurred only in conjunction with the other activities, but simple training aids and audiovisual materials are being developed to use in courses for extension agents who, in turn, will use them with village women (e.g., in millet and maize grinding). Project designers underestimated the need for an adequate lead time to finalize the loan and information systems.  They simultaneously overestimated: the abilities of the implementing agent, the Rural Domestic Economic Unit (RDEU); the linkages between the ORD's and the RDEU; and the skill level of extension and domestic economy agents. The designers also precluded the active participation of male village agents in implementing the project. Nonetheless, the project is believed to have stimulated other development activities and has served as a model for two other projects.","Evaluation period: Oct 1977-Feb 1979","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","2/1/1979 12:00:00 AM","","Institution building|Women in development|Credit|Management training|Economic research|Revolving fund|Household surveys|Villages|Change agents|Educational materials|Rural areas|Finance|Information networking|Limited data","Burkina Faso","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAH995.pdf","396 KB","","","","English","application/pdf","Limited data","","Barnes, Carolyn","Women in development","14 Feb 1979","","","","Strengthening women's roles in development project","","PD-AAH-995","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTUzMzY5","Burkina Faso","6860211"
"Evaluates project to promote range management and livestock production in Kenya.  Special evluation covers the period 11/72-9/79 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with Government of Kenya (GOK) officials and donor personnel. Due to faulty design and poor implementation, the project's goals are not being achieved.  Although difficult to assess, pastoralists' real income does not appear to have risen; settling pastoralists on smaller, surveyed pieces of land is counterproductive.  Livestock quality has increased but has favored -- as have the few marketing improvements -- few and often wealthy ranchers.  It is unlikely that the anticipated increase in market offtake from 7-8% to 11-12% by 1984 will occur. Moreover, insufficient time and administrative/logistical support were programmed; key assumptions proved faulty (e.g., that droughts would have little effect and that production would respond to changes in demand); A.I.D. administration was uneven; and coordination bewteen A.I.D. and the GOK was poor. Regarding outputs, participant training is on track, but only 102 of 229 planned reservoirs, one of 37 boreholes, and 3,600 of 5,000 miles of track are in place.  Fifty of 60 planned group ranches, all 21 cooperative ranches, and an unknown number of commercial ranches have been established. AID-funded equipment is unsuited to the Kenyan ecosystem and is being poorly maintained. Rather than finance investments from profits, newly-created group ranches have gone into debt at the urging of AID- and GOK-funded credit organizations. Finally, no land use study was conducted and the GOK did not address recommendations made in the meat processing study. In sum, the report's 39 recommendations indicate that A.I.D. assistance should continue if:  (1) the project aims for gradual change over a longer time frame; (2) it is recognized that pastoralists have a superior knowledge of their ecosystem and how to survive in it; (3) greater concern is given to minor improvements in the subsistence system; and (4) less emphasis is placed on commercial marketing and extensive credit.","Attached to PD-AAJ-282|Bibliography: p. 172-179","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/afr-C-1558","","9/1/1979 12:00:00 AM","","Range management|Agricultural management|Limited data","Kenya","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAJ282B.pdf","7,691 KB","006434 - Devres, Inc.","","008565 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to assist the Servicio National de Endemies Majeures (SNEM) to reduce the incidence of malaria in Haiti. Special evaluation covers the period 1978-5/79 and is based on document review and interviews with advisors and USAID/H and SNEM staff during site visits. Due to poor goal identification, lack of detailed action and budgeting plans, and the unknown feasibility of an eradication program, the project has not succeeded in reducing the incidence of malaria to targeted levels.  Fenitrothion was sprayed in 453 localities of the coastal plain covering 28,414 houses and a population of 102,000. Malathion was sprayed in 23 localities of the drier hill area covering 2,040 houses and a population of 6,833.  Thermal fogging was carried out in other areas. Larviciding with gasoil or temephos EC 50% was done in some mosquito breeding waters, while larvivorous fish were introduced as biological controls in other areas.  Eight of 29 environmental management projects have been completed, ranging from simple drainage to large-scale water management; one spin-off has been the retrieval of land and water for agricultural use.  In 1978, 167,093 radical treatments using chlorquine with primaquine were given to 42,606 malaria victims and to 118,487 household contacts.  The surveillance system has experienced difficulties at all administrative levels.  Lack of entomological and epidemiological baseline data leaves the impact of project activities uncertain. It is recommended that the use of the residual insecticides be arrested until their effectiveness is acertained by an epidemiologist in conjunction with an entymologist and a sanitarian and the most effective, least expensive insecticide is selected. Homogeneous eco-epidemiological strata should be identified throughout Haiti for field testing interventions.  Replacements for departing advisory staff should be recruited and materials procured.  SNEM staff should be trained to conduct anti-malarial programs, and responsibilities should be decentralized and coordinated.  Vector source reduction should be continued through campaigns of environmental management and biological control while the drug distribution program is modified. Finally, project funding strictures should be reconsidered.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/LAC-C-1328","","5/1/1979 12:00:00 AM","","Malaria|Drug therapy|Disease treatment|Beneficiary count","Haiti","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAJ660.pdf","11,447 KB","","","","English","application/pdf","Evaluation team|Indepth evaluation|Onsite evaluation","","Farwell, Albert E.","Malaria","20 May 1979","","","","Haiti malaria program; report of evaluation team, 5/20/79","","PD-AAJ-660","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTUzNzA3","Haiti","5210086"
"Evaluates project to establish a rural center for health research, teaching, and service delivery at Danfa, Ghana.  Final evaluation covers the period 1970-79 and is based on document review and interviews with key project personnel. The health center was established. Satellite clinics were set up in three nearby villlages and staffed once a week by health center workers, supplemented by traditional birth attendants (TBA's), village health workers (VHW's) and health education assistants. While priority was given to maternal/child health care and curative services, preventive programs were also implemented.  Mass immunization failed to reach the targeted 80% of eligible children but did demonstrate that multiple antigen innoculations are more effective than a single antigen schedule. A malaria chemoprophylaxis program was more successful with schoolchildren than with preschoolers, who had to be brought to the center for medication. In addition, health and nutrition education was provided; food supplements were distributed; and family planning services were extended through training of health workers, resulting in decreased birth and fertility rates.  Epidemiological studies were performed; one study led to increased emphasis on polio immunization in the target area and later throughout Ghana. Environmental sanitation was not noticeably improved in the target area. U.S. training in health planning was provided to 19 Ghanians and short-term clinical training was provided to 50 medical students; 90 TBA's, 20 VHW's, and 200 health research assistants were also trained. TBA and VHW training manuals were produced. Linkages among various governmental, research, and training institutions were developed and village development committees, which proved vital to health program acceptance, were promoted.  The project's research component was not a success, however. Delays in summative evaluations of such research efforts as village health, family planning, and health practices surveys greatly limited policy formulation, service delivery, and the project's overall credibility. A total of 66 recommendations are made in regard to service delivery, family planning, health education, evaluative research, cost assessment, training, TBA's, VHW's, and interagency linkages.","Work order number 2","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","AID/SOD/PDC-C-0160","","9/1/1979 12:00:00 AM","","Clinics|Health care|Health delivery|Medical education","Ghana","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAJ670.pdf","16,821 KB","009024 - Dimpex Associates, Inc.","","","English","application/pdf","Indepth evaluation|Evaluation team|Pre evaluation data|Final EOPS","","","","Sep 1979","","","","Danfa rural health project evaluation; Ghana","","PD-AAJ-670","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTUzNzIw","Ghana","6410055"
"Evaluates project to develop an integrated system of agricultural production and marketing in the Philippines.  Special evaluation covers the period 9/77-2/79 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with project personnel. While somewhat behind schedule, progress has been good.  In the national policy thrust, 12 policy issues were identified in a 5/78 workshop, interagency committees were formed, and 10 analysts recruited for the Ministry of Agriculture - although the latter's long-term policy capacity still needs to be addressed. In the academic thrust, 10 of 49 targeted agricultural economists are receiving participant training; curricula, including one in food systems are being developed at Los Banos and Central Luzon Universities; and Los Banos is providing short-term training in agricultural business and marketing. Problems include shortfalls in the number of graduates at both schools, especially Luzon; overlapping of degree programs; and the failure to include training of extensionists in technological packages. Delays in providing long-term consultants have slowed the technological package thrust, but participant training is on target. Achievements include a baseline socioeconomic survey of 18 of 150 barrios; identification and testing of a number of market-oriented technological packages, including several pure crop, upland crops-rice, animal-rice, and special technological packages (although room must be left to develop subsistence oriented technological packages); and construction of a food processing center and feed mill. The extension/outreach (E/O) thrust lacks integration and progress has been slow.  Non-degree training is generally on schedule, but 23 of 31 M.S. slots remain unfilled.  Achievements include establishing regional profiles and a market assistance center, conducting a baseline survey on vegetable production and marketing, and short-term training of 28 extensionists.  The extension delivery system committee, now established, should facilitate project coordination, but its membership should include curriculum and technological package personnel.  Other needs are to recognize technological packages as a process rather than a finished product and to fuse technological package and E/O functions. While Kansas State University (KSU) management has generally been viable the project has suffered from inadequate planning.  There is a need for the KSU Project Manager to take an active programmatic role in the project and for a specific project coordinator. Forty-four recommendations to improve the project are made.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","3/1/1979 12:00:00 AM","","Integrated agricultural production|Agricultural product marketing|Beneficiary count","Philippines","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAJ787.pdf","2,167 KB","008592 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to promote the adoption of animal traction technology in Upper Volta.  Mid-term special evaluation covers the period 1978-79 and is based on field visits conducted by Voltaic project staff and a contractor team. The project has achieved most of its intermediate goals, with most difficulties due to design rather than implementation problems.  The credit fund, which was planned to be disbursed to farmers over a 2-year period, was designed as a 5-year credit package, thus creating a liquidity squeeze after 2 years.  Further, low interest rates threaten the fund's ultimate viability.  Monies obligated by the Government of Upper Volta (GOUV) will allow a third year of credit disbursement. Allocation of loan funds from the central credit office to the Regional Development Organizations (ORD's) is well organized, but lack of a formal allocation system within the ORD's themselves makes it uncertain whether the target population is being reached and whether credit is being used properly.  Also, an improved calendar to ensure timely access to credit is needed.  Major changes, necessary for implementing the project, have occurred in the budget allocations for credit administration. In the animal health extension component, the veterinary revolving fund has been little used, mainly due to problems in providing veterinary services, especially for draft animals, at the village level; one veterinarian should be assigned to each ORD to work exclusively with draft animals.  Efforts to collect data on the impact of AT in Upper Volta remain incomplete.  Training activities have generally been satisfactory, with training sessions held in each ORD for senior extension personnel who train village-level extensionists who in turn train farmers (2,500 to date).  In the mass media component, the use of radio seems particularly valuable. While hard data are lacking on the project's impact on farm production and income, the project has directly promoted local organizations and local participation in project decisions. Major contributions have helped in creating an agricultural credit bank (CNCA) and in providing small farmers access to credit.  The CNCA will assume responsibility for all rural credit activities in Upper Volta in about 2 years; GOUV and donor funding will be needed to sustain the credit program until then.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","12/1/1979 12:00:00 AM","","Animal husbandry|Livestock|Agricultural credit|Project change","Burkina Faso","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAJ791.pdf","932 KB","006727 - Development Alternatives, Inc.

"Evaluates project to settle a sparsely populated area in Bolivia's Oriente province.  Special evaluation covers the period 1/78-9/79 and is based on site visits, document review, and interviews with project, Government of Bolivia (GOB), and USAID/B officials.  Focus is on the San Julian settlement. While the project has experienced management problems and has fallen short of its economic targets, its most important and innovative component, an orientation program for new settlers, has been an unmitigated success. The 4-month program has evolved into a management device which provides colonists with essential resources while they establish economic independence, fosters socioeconomic integration, and promotes community solidarity.  It has reduced the time necessary for adjustment and is responsible for San Julian's relatively low abandonment rate of 20%. Management problems have stemmed from three major causes: confusion resulting from designating an eight-agency committee as the primary management mechanism; failure to hire a project advisor; and the GOB administrative system, which stresses control rather than action.  (The orientation program's success is due in part to its separation from the GOB system).  In addition, not enough effort was made to evaluate previous settlements' successes and failures.  A.I.D. was slow to approve contracts and workplans and badly strained relations by providing old and dilapidated excess property tractors for access trail construction. While the settlement has not met its economic production targets, it has produced an internal rate of return of 20%, a highly respectable figure considering that it represents only returns within project confines.  For example, of the $4,200 cost per beneficiary family in 1975, $2,400 was for road building, which benefits others beyond the settlement. To increase economic production, development capital is badly needed. The Banco de Agricula Bolivia has loaned colonists only 20% of allotted funds.  Moreover, land utilization has been low.  Providing settlers with 25 rather than 50 ha lots would increase farm efficiency and reduce costs.  Two other needs must be addressed:  construction of farm to market roads and bridges and research on integrated farming systems. It is concluded that the project is replicable.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","12/1/1979 12:00:00 AM","","Migration|Agricultural land settlement|Agricultural production","Bolivia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAJ815.pdf","530 KB","008515 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to provide a forum (i.e., seminars and workshops) in which U.S. and LDC agricultural economists can share their knowledge of rural and agricultural development problems.  Special evaluation covers the period 1977-79 and is based on a team review of project documents and a survey of A.I.D. personnel who attended project-sponsored conferences. The International Agricultural Economics Seminar's Research Training Network (RTN) project, implemented by the Agricultural Development Council, has successfully progressed toward achieving planned outputs and has adapted to meet changing needs and emphases.  Since 5/77, the project has sponsored 15 conferences in five countries involving 367 participants, and has distributed conference-related publications to 11,500 individuals and organizations.  However, to best serve LDC's (LDC participation in conferences has fallen from 32% to 16%), the project should continue to emphasize the entire spectrum of rural development research and education; continue to increase seminars directed toward LDC rural development issues; increase the number of LDC participants; increase the participation of A.I.D. personnel; and involve the Program Committee more closely in the selection of conference topics. The major shortcoming of the project has been its failure to adequately serve Latin America and Africa.  Therefore, the number of conferences in the two regions should be increased and the number held in the United States reduced.  The RTN staff should be expanded and located more in Africa and Latin America in order to establish linkages and identify subjects and likely participants for conferences. In order to strengthen publications and reduce lag time between a conference and publication of a conference paper (currently 11.5 months), RTN should: encourage authors to remain after conferences to prepare reports; initiate a new series of papers to be written by conference participants who are employees of LDC planning agencies or donor agencies, with both a program and policy focus; and distribute some conference papers in mimeograph form.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","6/1/1979 12:00:00 AM","","Rural development|Seminars|Information networking|Technical assistance|Beneficiary interviews|Limited data plus","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAJ967.pdf","1,055 KB","","","000064 - USAID.

"Evaluates P.L. 480, Title II Food For Work (FFW) program in Haiti. Special evaluation covers the period through 9/79 and is based on site visits to Fond des Negres, Kenscoff, La Gonave, and Terre Newe (detailed case studies included) and on interviews with government, project, and PVO personnel and with benificiaries and residents. Haiti's experience has shown that food aid is at best a stopgap measure. Rising food imports, more commercial than concessionary, have not prevented rising food prices. While farmers are growing more food, they are also becoming dependent on food aid. Peasants, as consumers, view FFW commodities as in-kind wages rather than incentives; they consume some and rationally but illegally sell the rest.  Although appearing somewhat more democratic than cash payment projects, FFW projects tend to lack sufficient technical support and administrative control, especially on the part of community councils. Both lend themselves to corruption, contribute to creation of a patronage system, and commonly suffer payment delays. It is thus concluded that:  (1) FFW projects should be of limited duration and geared to seasonal changes in grain prices and labor demand; (2) small projects are more efficient and less vulnerable to abuse; (3) delayed and irregular food disbursements foster corruption; (4) workers should have an intrinsic interest in the asset being developed; (5) contracted projects increase efficiency but have greater potential for abuse; (6) flexibility (e.g., distributing rations for home use versus cooked meals on the job) is important; (7) when used as investment, food might best be combined with other inputs (cash, goods, etc.), but PVO's should not expand beyond their ability to manage such inputs; (8) the price of P.L. 480 commodities sold in markets should be monitored; and (9) the problem of dependency will be solved only with the rise of peasant institutions that can balance the need for relief and economic self-sufficiency. Further research is needed on the market effects of P.L. 480 commodities in isolated sites, differences between development and relief projects, the background and potential of community councils and alternative bodies, and the input needs of peasant households.","Attached to PD-AAJ-988","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","10/1/1979 12:00:00 AM","","Food for work|Food aid programs|Private voluntary organizations|Beneficiary interviews","Haiti","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAJ988A.pdf","2,108 KB","008554 - USAID.

"In order to increase the impact of road projects on the rural poor, emphasis has gradually shifted from paved highways to rural roads and from capital-intensive to labor-intensive construction methods. The author of this paper analyzes the benefits of the labor-intensive approach and the options A.I.D. can pursue to encourage its use. Various research findings on the cost-effectiveness and employment-generating potential of labor-based construction are reported. Several reasons are given for the continued preference of host countries and contractors for capital-intensive designs despite these findings. One simple reason is that both donors and developing country governments are more accustomed to working with equipment than with labor management. In fact, donor requirements for financing tend to encourage adoption of the capital-intensive mode. However, rural road construction, which is increasingly frequent, is more conducive to the labor-based mode than are highway or paved road projects. Since most central government highway departments lack the capabilities needed to manage labor-intensive rural road projects and have maintained a high priority on arterial road construction, A.I.D. should resist pressure to invest in the latter, investigate possibilities for complementary rural road construction, and remove management of such projects from national highway departments. Site selection criteria are discussed and recommendations are made to facilitate the adoption of labor-based construction. By refraining from subsidizing equipment costs and by seeking more acceptable environments, A.I.D. will lessen the relative costs of such techniques. It is emphasized that decentralized management can increase the political appeal of such projects and improve the chronic problem of maintenance, particularly use of the ""no-maintenance model"" (paving roads before the volume of traffic warrants the investment). Finally, to improve A.I.D.'s rural road policy, it is recommended that a country's road system be examined in its entirety rather than project by project and that community-based construction, including participation in road financing, be encouraged. A 94-item bibliography (1966-78) is attached.","French ed.: PN-ABG-652","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1979 12:00:00 AM","","Development program evaluation|Roads|Rural areas|Road construction|Technology assessment|Development project management|Employment|Decentralization","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAG670.pdf","1,527 KB","000156 - USAID.

"Unlike health, education, or nutrition projects, rural electrification (RE) projects do not directly benefit the poor and have thus been de-emphasized in recent development assistance programs. RE projects can, however, promote integrated rural development significantly by encouraging productive and municipal, as well as traditional household, electricity usages. In this paper, a justification for increased attention to RE projects is made based on these additional usages and issues are identified for further exploration. The author notes that RE planners generally tend to seek replication of the successful Philippine RE project, which strongly favored household consumption. Various issues are examined for their impact on the rural poor. These include the choice of rate mechanisms (meter or flat); lowered rates for high-volume users; beneficiaries and cost-effectiveness of RE projects; preference of the consumer for wood in cooking; economic drawbacks to the use of electricity; and the superiority of independent over central station generation. The author concludes that an RE project is not justified on the basis of household consumption alone; most often the poorest members of the community cannot take advantage of the benefits offered by household electricity. They can benefit much more significantly from the increase in employment which accompanies RE use by producers and from the increase in public services resulting from RE's municipal use. A.I.D. should investigate means of encouraging employment generation in RE projects, e.g., by providing credit and technical assistance to small industries. A.I.D. should also identify public services which are electricity-dependent, such as clinics and schools, and link provision of RE projects with extension of these services. The author also recommends the creation of a central A.I.D. office to promote local (rather than international) suppliers for the equipment and labor demands of infrastructure projects and favors an AID-supported central fund to promote local cooperatives and autogeneration projects. A 94-item bibliography (1966-78) is attached.","French ed.: PN-ABG-651|Related document: PN-ABI-768","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","4/1/1979 12:00:00 AM","","Development program evaluation|Electrification|Rural areas|Development project management","Indonesia|Philippines","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAG671.pdf","1,674 KB","000156 - USAID.

"It is generally accepted by population experts that a decline in fertility rates depends upon the interrelationship between the supply of family planning (FP) programs, determined by a government's political commitment and its administrative capability, and the demand for FP services, determined by the acceptability and adoption of the small family norm. This paper analyzes the results of a review of the literature on the relation of demand and supply determinants to FP effectiveness; it also develops guidelines to determine the conditions under which a major FP action is appropriate. The literature review found that FP programs do make a difference in the rate of fertility decline; progress in development alone is not enough. Key variables such as adult literacy, education, life expectancy, infant mortality, and GNP per capita combine to create the social context within which FP programs are implemented. The existence of favorable levels of achievement in these areas does not, however, necessarily guarantee the success of FP programs, just as their absence does not guarantee failure. For example, Indonesia and the Philippines have achieved high levels of contraceptive use despite development conditions that should preclude a demand for FP services, while Venezuela and Mexico have progressed rapidly on the development scale but are unable to achieve real decline in fertility levels. A set of theoretical guidelines to achieve rapid fertility decline are presented for further study. First, a country's social setting should be examined to determine the appropriate role for the public sector. If the setting is favorable, and fertility is declining even in the absence of a major public effort, the role of the state can be limited to ensuring the availablity of FP services. If, on the other hand, decline in fertility is slow or nonexistent, the state needs to be more active. The paper's major conclusion is that political will and administrative capability alone cannot overcome basic sociocultural obstacles unless direct government action on reproductive behavior is an important feature of the program. Recommendations for specific countries conclude the paper.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1979 12:00:00 AM","","Family planning|Development program evaluation|Development project management|Fertility|Cultural environment|Socioeconomic status|Population policy","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAG672.pdf","660 KB","000156 - USAID.

THE SYSTEMIC METHOD INVOLVES THE INTRARUMENAL INJECTION OF THE ANTICOAGULANT INTO THE BLOODSTREAM OF THE BOVINE. WHEN THE BOVINE IS FED UPON BY VAMPIRE BATS, THE INGESTED ANTICOAGULANT CAUSES FATAL HEMORRHAGING IN THE BATS. THE ECONOMIC LOSS OF CATTLE TO BAT-TRANSMITTED PARALYTIC RABIES IN THE FIRST YEAR FOLLOWING CONTROL DECREASED FROM $31,388 (209 HEAD) TO ZERO IN THE 1,918 HERDS TREATED. THE ANNUAL LOSS IN PRODUCTION OF BEEF AND MILK DUE TO VAMPIRE BAT FEEDING AND HARRASSMENT WAS REDUCED BY $2,382,770 IN THE YEAR FOLLOWING CONTROL. THUS, THE TOTAL ANNUAL BENEFITS OF THE PROGRAM IN NICARAGUA ARE AN ESTIMATED $2,414,158. A COMPARISON OF THE BENEFITS AND COSTS RESULTS IN A BENEFIT-COST RATIO OF 18.61. THE ESTIMATED BENEFITS TO THE CATTLEOWNERS WERE DISTRIBUTED 0.3% TO SMALL HERDOWNERS ($280 PER HERD), 22.6% TO INTERMEDIATE HERDOWNERS ($3,782 PER HERD), AND 77.1% TO LARGE HERDOWNERS ($16,632 PER HERD). THE USE OF DIPHACINONE METHODS IN THE CONTROL PROGRAM HAD OVERALL POSITIVE IMPACT ON ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY. THE OVERALL IMPACT IS FAVORABLE, WITH NO NEGATIVE ASPECTS OTHER THAN THE INCOME DISTRIBUTION ASPECT AMONG SMALL PRODUCERS, AND A POTENTIAL HAZARD TO FOOD QUALITY SHOULD THE CHEMICAL BE MISAPPLIED.","EVALUATION OF DENVER WILDLIFE RESEARCH CENTER PROGRAM UNDER|PA/RA(ID)-01-67 RES.","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/TA-C-1484","","1/1/1979 12:00:00 AM","","Disease prevention and control|Livestock diseases|PEST CONTROL|Vampire bats|Cattle|Anticoagulants (rodenticides)|Beneficiary interviews|Limited data plus","Nicaragua","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAE016.pdf","1,966 KB","000909 - Oklahoma State University.

"Obstacles to improving the health and nutrition of the rural poor include not only a dearth of trained physicians and modern facilities, but also the economic, social, and cultural differences that often exist between the health professional and the rural patient. Because over 2.3 billion people worldwide continue to rely on traditional healers and midwives rather than utilize a system they neither understand nor trust, a sensible policy to improve rural health is to encourage and utilize the resources represented by indigenous health workers (IHW's). This paper examines the potential for incorporating IHW's into formal primary health care (PHC) systems to increase community acceptance and improve the utilization of PHC services. The author recommends a comprehensive evaluation of all past and present projects containing a traditional health component to assess the problems and benefits involved in working with IHW's. Several common objections to the use of IHW's and countervailing arguments are presented. The objections include the tendency to disparage low-cost PHC as ""second-class medicine""; donor fears that indigenous PHC is dangerous or of inferior quality; and the hypothesis that traditional medicine competes with modern medicine for patients. Since IHW's provide excellent services in drug distribution, birth attendance, and care of the mentally ill, their services in these areas should be encouraged. Where formal collaboration with IHW's is not possible, emphasis should be placed on understanding and building upon the concepts which underlie traditional practices, thereby making modern innovations more acceptable. The author recommends that A.I.D. follow the World Health Organization's lead in adopting the following policy changes: (1) encourage and support programs which train and utilize IHW's; and (2) focus attention on traditional practices in training professional health workers and in PHC project designs. Specific program guidelines and recommended sector studies conclude the report. Annexes on information needs, a 1977 World Health Assembly resolution, recommendations of a congress sponsored by the Pan American Health Organization, and a 100-item bibliography (1962-79) are attached.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1979 12:00:00 AM","","Health workers|Folk culture|Health care|Rural areas|Traditional health workers|DELIVERY SYSTEMS|Development program evaluation","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAG685.pdf","1,725 KB","000156 - USAID.

"In order to provide an adequate potable water supply for every individual in developing countries by 1990, greatly increased efforts have been slated by donor agencies during the International Drinking Water Decade (1980-90). To be effective, however, these increased efforts must improve on previous water projects, which have had a high failure rate. This paper examines problems associated with rural water supply programs and recommends changes in policy directions. The author briefly reviews the history of water assistance projects and the priority accorded them by donors and host countries and lists recent evaluations conducted by international and bilateral donors. The many maintenance-related problems which are most commonly responsible for failures in water supply projects are discussed. In general, the lack of spare parts and other supplies, coupled with insufficient national program support (often reinforced by donor emphasis on construction, rather than maintenance), leads to equipment breakdown or misuse, and not the technology itself. Lack of coordination among the myriad of donors and consultants leads to further confusion and inefficiency. Lastly, villagers are often unaware or misinformed about the benefits of potable water -- they tend to value taste or convenience over safety. Project planners often ignore the social/religious value placed on water by the community, which can lead to a lack of local motivation to maintain and use the new systems. To ensure the effectiveness of future programs, the author recommends that A.I.D.: (1) choose appropriate technology which is cost-effective and easily maintained; (2) increase donor collaboration; (3) improve the manpower, administration, and commitment of host governments to national water programs; and (4) increase community participation and education related to local water projects. The author especially recommends a shift in emphasis from the planning of individual projects to a national or sector approach in which institutional building activities as well as hardware are funded. A list of practical steps to achieving these policy shifts is presented. A 14-item bibliography (1975-78) and an appendix on problem dimensions are attached.","Spanish ed.: PN-ABG-602|French ed.: PN-ABG-653","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1979 12:00:00 AM","","Water supply|Rural areas|Water quality|Sanitation|Potable water|Sector policy|Appropriate technology|Development program evaluation","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAG691.pdf","935 KB","000156 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to provide grants and technical assistance to counterpart LDC universities for the development of indigenous small-scale industry extension services.  This end-of-project report covers the entire project life, 1/23/74 - 1/9/79, and is based on Georgia Institute of Technology (GIT) contractor records and on-site visits. The project was carried out with five different universities in Seoul, Korea; Tubarao, Brazil; Ile-Ife, Nigeria; Manila, Philippines; and Kumasi, Ghana.  Four of these efforts remain active today, but the Nigerian program was dropped in 1978.  The resulting counterpart extension services are capable of operating with minimal outside technical support and have proved their ability to implement programs of technical/management assistance to small scale industries.  More than 5,100 new jobs were reported generated in rural areas of the five LDC's and 16 staff members from the counterpart universities were trained at GIT in the areas of conducting appropriate research; transferring and managing technology; adapting existing technology; and designing, implementing, and managing industrial programs.  Some 29 appropriate technology devices or manufacturing processes have resulted from this project, some 515 technical/management assistance cases were serviced by the LDC counterparts, and more than 8,600 persons completed industrial training programs.  In addition, counterpart institutions have started their own data bases, and have published a great number of research papers, feasibility studies, monographs, and other data. The author made six recommendations concerning the replication of this demonstration project so as to maximize the development of LDC extension capabilities.  These included continuing the small industry grant mechnaism in other LDC's, assisting the establishment, and promoting the interchange of personnel and programs among LDC industrial research institutes. This end-of-project report is appended to the final progress report for the fifth project year.","FINAL REPORT FOR YEAR 5 AND END OF PROJECT REPORT","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/TA-C-1062","","1/1/1979 12:00:00 AM","","EMPLOYMENT|Small scale enterprises|Technology transfer|Universities and colleges|Extension services","Korea R|Brazil|Nigeria|Philippines|Ghana","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAG723.pdf","4,242 KB","000513 - Georgia Institute of Technology.

"The Georgia Institute of Technology, in collaboration with the Central American Research Institute for Industry (ICAITI) performed a final evalution of the AID-developed hand-operated water pump. This paper summarizes their findings on the performance and acceptability of the AID product and other comparable pumps (Dempster, ""Marumby,"" Japanese ""Lucky"" pump, and a Canadian pump), based on 61 field tests in Costa Rica and Nicaragua. Field test data, cost comparisons, observations, conclusions, and recommendations are included. Various design and manufacture problems were found with the AID pump during field tests in both countries. Casting and component defects, breakage, and excessive friction complicated the pump's field performance. Despite these problems, results indicate that the AID pump can be manufactured with a high degree of quality at cost competitive prices, given adequate quality control and manufacturing facilities (foundries, pattern makers, machine shops, skilled machinists, raw materials). Rural village acceptance of the pump has been good at test sites. General observations stemming from the evaluation include: (1) Proper local governmental infrastructure must exist for an effective rural water system program. (2) Careful pump testing must be done before expansion to large scale operational programs. (3) The advantages and benefits of a local pump manufacturing capability should not be underestimated, in light of its contribution to employment generation, transportation savings, design flexibility, lower purchasing costs, and reduced foreign exchange requirements.  Engineering designs for both shallow and deep well varieties of the AID pump, and for component parts of the pump, are included.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","AID/TA-C-1354","","1/1/1979 12:00:00 AM","","Hand pumps|Field work|Technology adoption|EVALUATION|Cost benefit analysis|APPROPRIATE TECHNOLOGY|TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER|MANUFACTURING","Costa Rica|Nicaragua","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAG911.pdf","9,668 KB","000513 - Georgia Institute of Technology.

"To be successful, development projects not only must be technically sound but also must take account of developing countries' values and indigenous strategies. This paper analyzes the sociological and ecological assumptions which underlie A.I.D. interventions in the West African livestock sector. Against a background portrait of the African herdsman, A.I.D. sector interventions in the region (infrastructure improvements, replication of western commercial production systems, and organizational innovations) are identified and critically reviewed in terms of the problems of desertification and mixed farming, range tenure, pastoral offtake, mobility, herd management, and the role of women. The author faults A.I.D. projects for ignoring the social and ecological realities governing African pastoral life. He stresses the fact that pastoralist behavior is a logical outgrowth of past involvement with the Sahel environment. Development efforts which impinge on mobility or threaten the herd's ability to support a large number of persons will be resisted. ""Top-down"" approaches that ignore the highly individualistic nature of West African herdsmen are likely to meet with failure. In line with the work of other anthropologists and social scientists, the author notes the following functional relationships between herdsmen and herding conditions which should be safeguarded in livestock interventions: (1) Due to the variability of semiarid grazing conditions, mobility is often necessary for survival. (2) Pastoralists recognize claims existing on land and water use and their movement is constrained by those claims. (3) Pastoralists seek to increase and maintain the size of their herds because of the many and different benefits deriving therefrom. (4) Despite the desire to increase herd size, there are managerial constraints on the number of animals maintainable under the direct control of a single herding unit. Expansion beyond that point leads to diminishing returns, reflected in an increase in disease, predation, theft, runaways, and watering costs.

"The AID-financed family planning program in Indonesia is one of the world's most successful, prompting the question of how to replicate that success in other family planning assistance programs. This report uses data collected from field visits and interviews to evaluate A.I.D.'s assistance to the Indonesian program and identify the underlying reasons for its success. The report describes the program's service network, its consumers, demographic impact, and A.I.D. inputs. A sociocultural study of the country shows that high population growth, administrative support, and community acceptance are the three factors whose convergence most favored the project's success. The history and description of the program, particularly the types and extent of service, are given. A.I.D.'s support is described in terms of leadership, commodities, organization, resources, local-cost programming method, and interagency linkage. Major strengths of the program are: (1) a high level of national political support; (2) strong Mission commitment to the goal of the project and to Indonesia's national family planning program; (3) provision of grant rather than loan assistance; (4) responsiveness of the local cost programming process to local needs; (5) effective decentralization; (6) strong support from the Mission director and a competent, tenured staff; (7) close collaboration between Mission staff and local counterparts; (8) rapid adaptations based on field experiments; (9) a management rather than demographic orientation to the data system; (10) effectiveness of participant training; (11) integration, emphasizing process over structure, of health and nutrition services into family planning (not the reverse); (12) use of non-material incentives for acceptors; and (13) abundance of oral contraceptive supplies. Future problems faced by the A.I.D. program are imminent staff turnover; failure to extend services to urban areas and the outer islands; management, data, and logistical problems of expanding services into health and nutrition; and relations with the reorganized country planning board. Four appendices tabulating data on the program and an organizational chart of the Mission are included.","French ed.: PN-ABH-317, Spanish ed.: PN-ABH-318","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1979 12:00:00 AM","","Family planning|Family planning education|Contraceptive agents and devices|Development program evaluation|Population density|Government policy","Indonesia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAH425.pdf","1,750 KB","000036 - USAID.

"Ninety percent of Kenya's people depend on maize as their staple food. This report examines the impact of A.I.D.'s support to maize breeding projects in Kenya, which aimed to make regular improvements in hybrid maize through development of a breeding methodology and to create an institutional capacity in East Africa for maize research. The evaluation is particularly concerned with the spread of improved hybrid technology and its impact on economic growth, equity, and government policy. Most of the breeding program for high potential areas was a success -- yields improved by 25% under research station conditions and, by 1972, the new maize seed had increased yields by one million tons. The private sector was crucial in the rapid diffusion of hybrid maize specifically adapted to the different regional climates. The new seed was of greatest value to those farmers with sufficient land, labor, and capital to fully utilize the innovation, but it also allowed numerous smallholders to improve their food security. The projects' successes, however, were limited by their concurrent failures. The majority of the poor did not participate in achieving the high yields made possible by the improved technology. Research to improve maize protein quality and to develop varieties in low rainfall areas was not successful; neither were efforts to create a regional maize research capacity. The Government of Kenya failed to adjust pricing and marketing systems to problems of abundance and did not insure availability of critical inputs, e.g., fertilizer and credit. Even more importantly, the planned development of an indigenous, ongoing maize research capacity, including training aspects, did not occur. It was learned that the simplicity and viability of the hybrid seed contributed most to its success; equity cannot be expected to arise from technological improvements; and the long-term continuity of foreign experts, which ensured the breeding program's success, did not allow institutionalization of the research capability. An 118-item bibliography (1963-79) is appended.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","12/1/1979 12:00:00 AM","","MAIZE|HYBRIDIZATION|SEED PRODUCTION|AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH|Reference materials|SEEDS|PLANT BREEDING|Small farms|Farmers|Government policy","Kenya","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAH723.pdf","1,778 KB","000156 - USAID.

"Can labor-intensive (pick and shovel) construction of market access roads in the mountainous regions of Colombia result in significant improvements in the welfare of local campesinos? This document assesses the impact of one such effort -- A.I.D.'s Small Farmer Market Access Project. Some 900 km of all-weather, unpaved access roads were planned to link isolated mountain communities with the nearest market road in order to stimulate agricultural production and trade and to open these communities to agricultural extension, health, and educational services. Construction was directed by the host government agency Caminos Vecinales, but as most of the work was performed by the intended beneficiaries, 60-65% of road construction costs were paid as wages to local campesinos. Substantial underestimates of the cost of construction will cause the final total of 59 roads averaging 8 km in length to fall well short of the projected total. Impacts of road construction and road use are discussed in detail. Marginal farmers, the landless, and the unemployed provided the main labor source, using the income gained to make improvements on house and farm, for fertilizer and improved seed, and for purchase of consumer goods. The resulting switch from animal to motorized transportation sharply reduced transport costs, leading to increased agricultural production without changes in policy or agricultural extension services. Wages in the areas near the roads have also increased, as the landless now have alternative employment opportunities. The anticipated increase in government services such as health and education has yet to take place, however. The evaluators raised long-term questions concerning the inadequacy of maintenance funds, the need to guard against erosion and siltation of rivers, and the lack of political support for replication of the project. In conclusion, the project was found to offer a replicable model for labor-intensive construction of rural roads under specific conditions. Attached to the report are various annexes regarding evaluation methodology, development strategies, alternative construction methods, and environmental considerations.","Spanish version: PN-AAV-581","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1979 12:00:00 AM","","Road construction|TRANSPORTATION|MAINTENANCE|Rural areas|FARM TO MARKET ROADS|ROADS|Small farms|Farmers|AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION|Environmental aspects|Access to services","Colombia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAH768.pdf","1,747 KB","000156 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to institutionalize nutrition planning and coordination in the Government of Lesotho (GOL) by creating a Food and Nutrition Council (FNCO).  Special evaluation, attached to a PES (PD-AAJ-522), covers the period 6/76-2/80 and is based on document review and interviews with participants and observers during site visits. Despite many problems, including GOL delays in staffing FNCO, this modest but useful project is on track.  An information and study center exists, the next nutrition planning conference is imminent, training occurs in all contacts between expatriates and nationals, and meetings with other GOL agencies are frequent.  Nonetheless, much work is needed to institutionalize nutrition planning in the GOL and FNCO still lacks the political influence needed to affect major nutritional issues. Project management has suffered from antagonisms between A.I.D. and the contractor, due in part to poor communications, e.g., unclear A.I.D mandates on the one hand, and late/incomplete contractor reports on the other.  The recent change in project director has improved matters sufficiently to warrant an extension of the project if accompanied by close A.I.D. monitoring.  Contractor relations with FNCO counterparts are forthright and dynamic and serve the project well.  Training targets have not been met, since only two nationals are currently on FNCO's staff.  Some formal training sessions by the contractor would help FNCO deal with other GOL agencies, and USAID/L should make special efforts to train people from outside FNCO. An added source of contention has been a nutrition survey conducted by the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) in 1976 without full GOL support or cooperation.  Although the data will be a good baseline resource, they have been rejected by GOL due to misunderstandings of the survey's intent and value. Future needs are for FNCO to relate global strategies to specific interventions, e.g., targeting interventions to malnourished groups and areas and improving community nutrition planning. Continued USAID/L support beyond 1980 will be needed.  At the same time, USAID/L can do as much by having FNCVO review other AID-supported activities and by channeling funds through FNCO as it can by direct support of the Office. A total of 25 recommendations are included.","Evaluation of operational program grant AFR-G-120 to Planning|Assistance, Inc.

"Evaluates project to provide family planning (FP) information, education, and communication (IEC) materials to LDC's. Special evaluation covers the period 10/76-3/79 and is based on review of project documents and IEC materials; interviews with A.I.D., project, and LDC personnel; and visits to Brazil, Mexico, Peru, Tunisia, Kenya, Indonesia, and Thailand. Although the project has had some positive effects, the contractor - George Washington University (GWU) - has failed to meet basic objectives, largely because GWU defined project objectives in terms of material output rather than audience effects.  In addition, GWU was constrained by budget cuts, short-term funding, and authorization delays.  While GWU distributed prototype IEC materials to 60 LDC's, production of materials was heavily skewed toward 16mm sound films, only one of several media intended to be included.  The films were of high quality and often met with enthusiastic response, but they focused on elite policymaking audiences to the neglect of contraception acceptors and village-level and other FP workers. The project had negligible effects on LDC and Mission FP policies and programs.  Materials were provided to LDC's without supporting explanation or technical assistance.  Field teams were not deployed as planned, materials were rarely adapted for specific audiences, and dissemination of materials to mass media was virtually non-existent. Moreover, GWU failed to systematically assess country needs, inform Mission and LDC officials of the project's objectives or field services, and to keep records on distribution of project materials or in-country users. It is concluded that the prototype materials are superfluous to LDC's priority problems, populations, and communications system and should be replaced by locally produced, culture-specific materials directed toward village-level workers, FP staff, and contraceptive users/animators. A.I.D. should provide a range of IEC-related services adapted to each LDC's FP program and should support IEC research, reporting, training, and management. Social marketing should be considered as only one of many alternative strategies.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/pha/c-1203","","4/1/1979 12:00:00 AM","","Family planning promotion programs|Educational materials|Family planning education","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAM224.pdf","11,788 KB","000262 - American Public Health Association","","000077 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to establish, as part of the Comprehensive Resource Inventory System (CRIES), a System to Inventory and Evaluate Agricultural Resources (SIEDRA) in the Dominican Republic.  Special evaluation covers the period 11/78-5/79 and is based on interviews with project and Government of the Dominican Republic (GODR) officials and document review. SIEDRA has established institutional viability as a department within the Sub-Secretariat of National Resources, is internalizing CRIES concepts, methods, and goals, and has established direct communication with the Secretariat of Agriculture and with nongovernmental policymaking entities, although major operational linkages with the latter are still lacking.  SIEDRA has made substantial progress on three of the four project targets.  It has established an accurate and consistent data management and evaluation system for national crop data collection by sector agencies and has helped form a National Soils Commission, which adopted U.S. soil and taxonomy survey methods and produced an integrated soils classification data set (resource planning units) for interagency use in evaluating agricultural potential.  Data in other areas, however (e.g., land and water resources, production levels and costs, and technology options), while the best available, need further work.  SIEDRA has also made substantial progress in selected natural resource analyses issues due to staff competencies in these areas; the staff is relatively weak, however, in the economic and system analytical capabilities needed for policy analysis.  These staff considerations, along with the existing assignment of responsibilities among GODR agencies, makes the target of making SEIDRA an integral part of sector planning currently infeasible. Recommendations are, inter alia, that A.I.D.:  support SIEDRA for another 2 years; finance training of SIEDRA personnel in agricultural economics (with emphasis on policy analysis), macro and micro level natural resource management, and, for planning purposes, data collection and interpretation techniques; and assign SIEDRA primary responsibility for developing the natural resources management loan. Project experience suggests that the CRIES is adaptable to LDC's as long as host country and consultant leadership is strong.","References: p.38-39|Companion project evaluation summary: PD-AAZ-445","Special Evaluation","Documents","PA/AG/TAB-236-14-76","","6/1/1979 12:00:00 AM","","Agriculture|Information services|Statistical data|Institution building|CRIES|Technical assistance","Dominican Republic","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAM270.pdf","666 KB","000064 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to develop and extend integrated technologies for increasing food grain production on small hill farms in Nepal. Mid-term evaluation covers the period l976-79 and is based on site visits, discussions with project personnel, and document review. The project is on track, with progress noted in the Cropping Systems Research Program (CSRP); the National Rice Improvement Program (NRIP); and the National Maize and Wheat Development Programs (NMDP, NWDP). CSRP achievements include five cropping system research sites established in Nepal's four development regions; land use classified and existing farming systems described in the five sites; improved rice, maize, and wheat varieties tested; research/extension links improved; and a survey begun on the role of livestock in farming systems. NRIP achievements include four varieties (ranging in maturity from 110-140 days) released; two varieties field tested for upland rainfed conditions; blast screening expanded to include new progenies; production of new crosses expedited due to inter-program linkage; new facilities, including a seed processing storage/unit under construction; expanded breeding/testing programs for temperate zone rice; improved varieties due to minikit distribution; and farmer field trials established.  NMDP research in maize research stations and in farmers' fields improved appreciably, and workshops were held to integrate the components of the agricultural production system. NWDP studies made progress in investigating new varieties and selecting segregated wheat populations. Constraints to implementation include high staff turnover and discouraging research results on minor crops (CSRP), lack of needed manpower to assure project completion (CSRP, NRIP, and NWDP), negative effects of fertility, moisture, and diseases, and the inavailability of high quality seed (NMDP), a need for more equipment (NRIP), and a lack of experimental farms and stations for wheat breeding (NWDP). A total of 16 recommmendations are made.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","11/1/1979 12:00:00 AM","","Cereals|Farming systems research|Plant genetics|Varietal research|Maize|Wheat|Rice","Nepal","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAM315.pdf","1,324 KB","008583 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to establish capabilities to plan and deliver on-farm water management (OFWM) services in Pakistan.  Special evaluation covers the period 1976-9/79 and is based on site visits and interviews with project personnel, Government of Pakistan officials, and farmers. Despite a slow start-up and numerous other difficulties, the project shows excellent potential.  Progress has been made toward developing viable Pakistani institutions to provide OFWM services and toward promoting key components, mainly watercourse improvements (WCI's).  Of the 227 WCI's (of 1,530 planned), 202 are in Punjab, 16 in Sind, 9 in NWPF, and none in Baluchistan.  Technologies introduced include watercourse lining, earthen improved channels, concrete round gates, and silt traps.  Farmers have responded well to WCI's, but have not cooperated on WCI maintenance; organization of water users associations has been weak.  Farmer interest in precision land leveling (PLL), on the other hand, has been low; only 24,860 acres (431,830 targeted) have been improved.  Implementation of PLL and WCI has been constrained by farm size criteria that reject a large percentage of those needing assistance, particularly tenant farmers, and cause difficulties in reaching non-contiguous watercourses. Research has been somewhat neglected due to emphasis on implementing WCI and PLL.  Considerable research has been done on WCI and PLL labor-, time-, and water-saving impacts, but production impacts have not been quantified (although evidence suggests substantial benefits). The research has informed project operations to a degree, but linkages are generally weak.  Extension activities have been minimal, with some effort having been made in Punjab and Sind.  All provinces except Baluchistan have established formal OFWM training programs; Punjab has an extension training program as well.  An outstanding trapezoidal template was developed in Punjab as a training tool and guide for watercourse channel construction.  Training has also been provided by the University of Agriculture at Faisalabad. Numerous recommendations, the most important being to reduce emphasis on PLL, address problems in the areas mentioned above.  Recommendations are also made regarding financial and personnel matters, particularly disbursement delays due to use of the Fixed Amount Reimbursement mechanism.","Evaluation period: 16 Sep-13 Oct 1979","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","10/1/1979 12:00:00 AM","","Water management|Pilot projects|Surface irrigation|Canals|Land improvement|Beneficiary interviews","Pakistan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAM305.pdf","4,301 KB","008588 - USAID.

"Evaluated project performance from 8/76 to 5/78 in Guyana. Purposes of project were to assist the Govt of Guyana (GOG) to increase GDP growth rate to 7%, increase rice farmer income, increase rice export earnings by l%, and enable the rice industry to compete effectively in the world market. Evaluation methodology not defined. Although the project was beset by technical and construction delays, and inflation lowered expected returns, all the socio-economic objectives of the project were exceeded.  The rice component of GDP expanded at an annual rate nearly double the rate of the total GDP due to:  increased paddy and rice production, developments and use of improved rice varieties, the associated increase in the value of the Guyana Rice Board (GRB) rice purchases, and holding down the operating costs of the drying/storage centers.  Increased rice production has enabled GOG to expand rice exports which have increased at an annual rate of 18.8%.  The establishment of 6 paddy drying/storage centers, a needed rice storage facility in Georgetown, and a pure-line seed storage unit and rice research station now in operation, have benefited GOG's export trade since they provide greater rice storage capacities and prevent rice deterioration. The development of a seed program has promoted the increased production of approved varieties and played a key role in improving Guyana's rice industry, thereby increasing importance of double cropping.  Farmers increased their yield of approved varieties from a few thousand bags in 1970 to over 4 million in 1977.  These new varieties have increased annual labor payrolls and off-farm employment by a million Guyana dollars.  The formation of the GRB from two separate GOG rice organizations has coorindated GOG's rice program through more effective administration. The only project objective not fully realized was to develop GRB's capacity to effectively compete in the world market.","Attached to PD-AAA-019|Loan no. 540-L-008|Evaluation period: 1 Aug 1976-30 May 1978","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/LA-C-1259","","1/1/1979 12:00:00 AM","","Export promotion|FARM INCOME|Food marketing|Cereals|Agricultural equipment|Food storage|Agricultural research|Storage facilities|Agribusiness|RICE|Limited data","Guyana","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAA019C1.pdf","1,352 KB","000356 - Checchi and Co.

"EVALUATES PROJECT MANAGEMENT COMPETENCE OF THE PATHFINDER FUND (PF) AS OF OCTOBER 1978 BASED ON EVALUATION TEAM MEETINGS WITH MEMBERS AND REVIEW OF PF SUPPORTED PROJECTS. PF WORLD- WIDE PROGRAMS DURING THE PERIOD 1976-78 HAVE BEEN ADMINISTERED EFFECTIVELY AND HAVE MET ASSIGNED OBJECTIVES IN SPITE OF THE HIGH TURNOVER OF TOP PERSONNEL DURING THE PERIOD 1973-78. AS A RESULT OF THE ""NEW PATHS COMMITTEE REPORT"" OF 1975, A POLICY DIVISION ND WOMEN'S PROGRAM DIVISION WERE ADDED TO  THE PROGRAM OF FERTILITY SERVICES. THE DEFINITION OF ROLES BETWEEN THESE NEW DIVISIONS IS UNCLEAR, BUT THE QUALITY OF THE DIVISIONS IS GOOD. IN THE AREA OF PROJECT DEVELOPMENT, THE PF APPROACH OF ALLOWING RECIPIENTS TO PARTICIPATE IN PROJECT DESIGN IS FEASIBLE. EVALUATORS RECOMMEND THAT PF REVIEW WITH AID ITS GOALS REGARDING WOMEN'S PROGRAMS, THAT IT UPDATE ITS KNOWLEDGE OF FAMILY PLANNING STRATEGIES, AND THAT IT GAIN THE CAPABILITY TO DEVELOP LONGER-TERM PROJECTS. PROJECT REVIEW ACTIVITIES ARE LARGELY QUANTITATIVE; QUALITATIVE, ON-SITE EVALUATORS ARE SPORADIC AND VARIABLE BOTH IN CONTENT AN D INTENSITY. THE RECOMMENDATION IS THAT PF UPGRADE BOTH ITS BOSTON AND FIELD OFFICES TO DO QUALITATIVE EVALUATION AND THAT IT INSTITUTIONALIZE SUCH WORK, WHILE TAKING CARE TO AVOID INJECTING EXCESSIVE DATA COLLECTIONS AND ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES THAT MAY INTERFERE WITH SERVICE DELIVERY. THE SKILLS OF REGIONAL AND COUNTRY REPRESENTATIVES VARY WIDELY ALTHOUGH ALL HAVE SPECIAL SKILLS IN ONE OR ANOTHER AREA. MOST PF PROJECTS ARE INNOVATIVE AND WELL DELIVERED.

"EVALUATES ASIAN PROJECT ACTIVITIES OF THE PATHFINDER FUND (PF) AS OF 2/27/79 BASED ON FIELD VISITS. PF SUPPORTED PROJECTS IN BANGLADESH ARE THOUGHT OUT AND EFFECTIVELY ADMINISTERED, AND ENHANCE POPULATION AND FAMILY PLANNING EFFORTS. IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT AID SHOULD SUPPORT ASIAN PROJECTS FOR TWO TO FOUR MORE YEARS, AND PF AND THE GOVERNMENT OF BANGLADESH SHOULD DEVELOP ALTERNATIVE SOURCES OF FINANCIAL SUPPORT. PF SHOULD ALSO TRY TO WORK WITH PVO'S ACTIVE IN POPULATION AND FAMILY PLANNING, ESPECIALLY IN NON-RURAL COMMUNITIES OUTSIDE DACCA, AND CONTINUE TO DEVELOP PROJECTS WITH RELEVANT ELEMENTS OF THE PRIVATE SECTOR, E.G., RAILWAY WORKERS. ALSO, WOMEN SHOULD BE GIVEN ROLES IN PVO FAMILY PLANNING PROGRAMS. THE FAMILY PLANNING PROGRAM IN INDONESIA IS RIGOROUS, AND PF'S EMPHASIS ON SUPPORT FOR SPECIALIZED SERVICE PROGRAMS, SUCH AS THE TRAINING OF PHYSICIANS IN STERILIZATION TECHNIQUES, IS THE CORRECT ONE. THE STERILIZATION CENTERS PLAY A KEY ROLE IN TRAINING AND ARE BELLWETHERS FOR OTHER ELEMENTS OF THE STERILIZATION SERVICE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM. IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT PF EFFORTS TO WORK WITH RELIGIOUS GROUPS SUCH AS MOHAMMADIYAH AND THAT THE ROLE PLAYED BY RELIGIOUS LEADERS IN THE DECISION-MAKING PROCESS IN THE VILLAGES SHOULD BE SUPPORTED. IT IS HOPED THAT PF WILL BE ABLE TO ASISST THE ZPG GROOP TO DEVELOP A LONG-TERM SOURCE OF IN-COUNTRY SUPPORT. THIS MAY REQUIRE THAT PF PROVIDE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO SELECTED ZPG PROJECTS OVER THE NEXT TWO OR THREE YEARS. PF PROJECTS IN THAILAND ARE MOVING THAT COUNTRY CLOSER TO HAVING A BODY OF NON-PROFESSIONALS ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN FAMILY PLANNING SERVICE DELIVERY. PF HAS LEFT A LEGACY OF CONTINUING INTEREST IN BROADENING THE TECHNICAL SKILLS OF PARAMEDICAL PERSONNEL.

EVALUATION, DONE BY SCF, IS BASED ON REVIEW OF PROJ DOCUMENTS, INTERVIEWS WITH PROJ GROUPS, OBSERVATION OF VILLAGE PROJS. PROJ IMPLEMENTATION HAS BEEN REAL BUT SLOW DUE TO LACK OF QUALIFIED IN-COUNTRY STAFF & FATALISTIC ATTITUDES OF VILLAGERS. VILLAGE OF BAFELE DID NOT PARTICIPATE DUE TO LACK OF HANDOUTS & WILL BE RECANVASSED IN 1979. MAJOR SCF PROBLEM HAS BEEN LACK OF STAFF.

ADMINISTRATIVE NETWORK FOR PROJ IMPLEMENTATION IS IN PLACE, WITH FIELD OFFICE & CENTRAL SUPPORTING OFFICE ESTABLISHED & STAFFED, AND EFFECTIVE CONTACT HAS BEEN MADE WITH NATIONAL & INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT GROUPS. INSTITUTIONALIZATION, HOWEVER, HAS JUST BEGUN & EXPATRIATE STAFF WILL BE NEEDED UNTIL 1986. TRAINING OF VILLAGE LEADERS HAS ALSO BEEN SLOW. TWENTY ONE OF TARGETED 24 VILL COMMITTEES HAVE BEEN FORMED & HAVE INITIATED 28 OF 40 TARGETED SELF-HELP PROJS, BUT LOSS OF BASELINE DATA SURVEY MAKES ADEQUATE EVALUATION IMPOSSIBLE.

"EVALUATES AFRICA AND MIDDLE EAST PROJECT ACTIVITIES OF THE PATHFINDER FUND (PF) AS OF 2/27/79 BASED ON FIELD VISITS. IN EGYPT, PF IS DEVELOPING A CADRE OF MEDICAL PRACTITIONERS QUALIFIED TO PROVIDE STERILIZATION SERVICES. THIS WILL BE THE BASE FOR BROADENING THE AVAILABILITY OF SUCH SERVICES. THE DEVELOPMENT OF WELL EQUIPPED, STAFFED, AND OPERATED CLINICS FOR PROVISION OF STERILIZATION SERVICES IS EXPECTED TO LEAD TOBROADER ACCEPTANCE OF STERILIZATION. IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT PF CONTINUE ITS ROLE OF PROVIDING LOW PROFILE SUPPORT TO TRAINING AND PROVISION OF SERVICES THROUGH CLINICS. IN KENYA, PF ACTIVITIES HAVE BEEN WELL CONCEIVED AND HAVE FILLED A NEED. HOWEVER, THERE IS A NEED FOR DEVELOPMENT OF ADDITIONAL STERILIZATION SERVICE POINTS. CONTRACEPTIVE AVAILABILITY COULD BE BETTER, AND THE MOTIVATIONAL PROJECT PROPOSED IN THE MAENDELEO PROJECT WOULD MAKE RURAL WOMEN MORE AWARE OF POSSIBLE SERVICES. A SERIOUS TEENAGE PREGNANCY PROBLEM HAS NOT BEEN ADDRESSED. IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT PF SHOULD REVIEW THE OVERALL KENYAN POPULATION/FAMILY PLANNING SITUATION TO LAY OUT A PRIORITY PLAN. THAT WILL HELP PF TO UTILIZE ITS RESOURCES MOST EFFECTIVELY. ALTHOUGH PF HAS BEEN ACTIVE IN SENEGAL SINCE 1973, THERE IS LITTLE TO SHOW FOR THE EFFORT. THE CLINIQUELA CROIX BLUE IS OPERATING, BUT IT/SCARCELY CAN BE SAID TO BE PROVIDING FAMILY PLANNING SERVICES TO THE ORIGINALLY INTENDED TARGET POPULATION.

EVALUATION WAS CONDUCTED BY AN OUTSIDE EXPERT AT THE REQUEST OF THE FACULTY DEAN AND WAS BASED ON FACULTY INTERVIEWS, REVIEW OF ANNUAL REPORTS, AND VISITS TO RESEARCH SITES AND FACILITIES. SOILS AND IRRIGATION DEPARTMENT IS TO BE COMMENDED FOR THE PERTINENCE OF ITS PROGRAM TO CURRENT PROBLEMS; THE QUALITY OF ITS WORK, ESPECIALLY IN SOIL FERTILITY AND CHARACTERIZATION, SOIL MOISTURE CONSERVATION, AND IRRIGATION; AND FOR ITS ADHERENCE TO PROJECT PROPOSAL POLICY. THE PLANT PROTECTION AND PRODUCTION PROGRAM IS ALSO TO BE COMMENDED FOR THE PERTINENCE OF ITS PROGRAM AND FOR ITS TEAM APPROACH. SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE IN WHEAT AND BARLEY RESEARCH. HORTICULTURAL RESEARCH IS JUST BEGINNING. THOUGH SOMEWHAT HAMPERED BY A LACK OF FACILITIES, IT IS PROGRESSING WELL. VALUABLE VEGETABLE CROP RESEARCH IS BEING CARRIED OUT IN COOPERATION WITH IRRIGATION RESEARCH, AND GOOD WORK IS BEING DONE IN FARM MACHINERY, ENTOMOLOGY, AND VARIOUS PEST PROBLEMS. PLANNING IS UNDERWAY FOR RESEARCH IN PESTICIDE RESISTANCE. DUE TO STAFF LIMITATIONS, THE ANIMAL PRODUCTION AND PROTECTION DEPARTMENT HAS CARRIED OUT ONLY LIMITED (BUT GOOD) RESEARCH IN ANIMAL PRODUCTION, NUTRITION, AND FOOD SCIENCE. THE 2 MEMBERS OF THE AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS AND EXTENSION DEPARTMENT HAVE ALSO DONE GOOD WORK IN VEGETABLE PRODUCTION; OWNER-TENANT RELATIONS UNDER NEW TECHNOLOGY; COST AND RETURN OF NEW TECHNIQUES; DAIRY PRODUCTION; MECHANIZED AGRICULTURE, AND THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF NEW TECHNOLOGY FOR WHEAT PRODUCTION. THE PRINCIPAL DEFICIENCY IN THE SYSTEM AS A WHOLE HAS BEEN IN REPORTING. REPORTS OFTEN LACK A CLEAR RELATION TO THE WORK BEING DONE OR ARE TOO UNWIELDY FOR USE BY PROJECT ADMINISTRATORS.

"CONSULTANT REPORTS ON HIS TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE ACTIVITIES DURING THE PERIOD 10/07/76 - 8/06/79 IN A PROJECT TO IMPROVE RURAL HEALTH IN MONTERO,BOLIVIA. THE CONSULTANT WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE RESEARCH AND EVALUATION ASPECTS OF THE PROJECT. DURING THIS PERIOD, 13 MAJOR STUDIES WERE DESIGNED AND INITIATED BY THE CONSULTANT. AS A RESULT OF THESE ACTIVITIES,APPROXIMATELY 95 PEOPLE RECEIVED TRAINING AND SUPERVISED PRACTICE IN ONE OR MORE ASPECTS OF THE RESEARCH ACTIVITIES. HOWEVER,MUCH REMAINED UNFINISHED. THE LACK OF A CLEAR AND COMPREHENSIVE DEFINITION OF INFORMATION NEEDS AND THE INABILITY TO FIND A SUITABLE COUNTERPART ADVERSELY AFFECTED THE PROGRAM. IN ALL, THE ADVISOR PREPARED AND DISTRIBUTED 26 REPORTS AND DOCUMENTS INCLUDING BASIC WORKING DOCUMENTS AND FINAL REPORTS FOR THREE SPECIFIC STUDIES -- ""PREVALENCE OF MALNUTRITION IN PRESCHOOL CHILDREN IN 39 COMMUNITIES IN THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF SANTA CRUZ"" (7/77),""ANALYSIS OF COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION"" (9/78),AND ""PERSONNEL UTILIZATION AND ATTITUDES -- AN EVALUATIVE ANALYSIS OF THE SYSTEM"" (7/79). A WIDE VARIETY OF INFORMATION WAS COLLECTED ON 72 RURAL COMMUNITIES BY AUXILIARY NURSES,RURAL TEACHERS,AND MEMBERS OF THE DISTRICT OUTREACH TEAM. OTHER ACTIVITIES INCLUDED MAPPING OF COMMUNITIES AND THE METRO AREA,A CENSUS OF POPULATION AND HOUSING,A RURAL HEALTH HOUSEHOLD SURVEY,A LONGITUDINAL MORBIDITY STUDY,A NUTRITIONAL SURVEY OF PRESCHOOL CHILDREN,AND STUDIES OF REGIONAL INSTITUTIONS. THE AUTHOR CONCLUDES THAT ONLY A PORTION OF THE ORIGINALLY PLANNED RESEARCH ACTIVITIES MERITED PRIORITY. FORTUNATELY IN PRACTICE,BROAD FLEXIBILITY WAS PERMITTED IN CONCEPTUALIZING AND MODIFYING THE ORIGINAL RESEARCH PROGRAM--BUT AT CONSIDERABLE COST IN TERMS OF TIME AND ENERGY. THE AUTHOR'S PRIMARY RECOMMENDATION IS THAT ONE OF THE FIRST ACTIVITIES IN EXTENDING RURAL HEALTH SERVICES ON A NATIONAL SCALE SHOULD BE THE DESIGN OF A COMPREHENSIVE EVALUATION SYSTEM.","Evaluation period: 7 Oct 1976-6 Aug 1979","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","AID-511-120T","","8/1/1979 12:00:00 AM","","Evaluation methodology|Health care planning|Information storage and retrieval systems|Pilot projects|Operations research|Health research|Data collection|Statistical data|Data analysis|Technical assistance|Health care administration|Rural areas|Health care|Health delivery","Bolivia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAF148B1.pdf","5,381 KB","008515 - USAID.

"EVALUATES PROJECT TO PROMOTE RURAL DEVELOPMENT IN THREE DISTRICTS OF NIGER'S DEPARTMENT OF NIAMEY. THE FOUR-MAN EVALUATION TEAM CONDUCTED INTERVIEWS WITH BENEFICIARIES AND LOCAL ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICIALS IN THE THREE PARTICIPATING DISTRICTS. IN ADDITION, MEETINGS WERE HELD IN THE CAPITAL WITH OFFICIALS FROM RELEVANT GOVERNMENT AGENCIES. PROJECT CONSISTED OF 10 PROGRAMS, EACH IMPLEMENTED BY A DIFFERENT GOVERNMENT AGENCY. THESE INCLUDED: PLUVIAL AGRICULTURE (SERVICE AGRICOLE), CREDIT AND COOPERATIVE (UNCC), SOIL CONSERVATION/FORESTRY (EAUX ET FORET), LIVESTOCK (SERVICE DE L'ELEVAGE), LITERACY (SERVICE DE L'ALPHABETISATION), RADIO-CLUB (ASSOCIATION NATIONALE DES RADIO-CLUBS, SMALL IRRIGATION (GENIE RURAL), STUDIES PROGRAM (PROJECT MANAGEMENT UNIT), PROJECT MANAGEMENT UNIT (COTEDEP/PROJECT PERSONNEL), COMPREHENSIVE AREA PLANNING (PROJECT MANAGEMENT UNIT). IN SLIGHTLY OVER ONE YEAR OF IMPLEMENTATION, OVER ONE-HALF OF THE TARGETTED OBJECTIVES WERE ACHIEVED. THE EVALUATION TEAM REACHED 4 GENERAL CONCLUSIONS ABOUT THE PROJECT: (1) A NUMBER OF THE PROJECT COMPONENTS DID NOT UNDERGO ADEQUATE TECHNICAL AND ECONOMIC TESTING; (2) MANY OF THE COMPONENTS SEEMED TO REPRESENT A ""SHOPPING LIST"" OF GOVERNMENT AGENCY DEMANDS RATHER THAN ACTIVITIES ESSENTIAL TO RURAL DEVELOPMENT; (3) COORDINATING THE ACTIVITIES AMONG THE MANY PARTICIPATING GOVERNMENT AGENCIES PRESENTED DIFFICULTIES; AND (4) THE ACTIVITIES WERE EXTENDED OVER TOO WIDE A GEOGRAPHIC AREA FOR THE NUMBER OF STAFF AVAILABLE. TO REMEDY THESE PROBLEMS THE EVALUATION TEAM SUGGESTS THAT PROJECT ACTIVITIES BE FOCUSED ON IMPROVING AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION IN SPECIFIC, RESTRICTED ZONES. IN ADDITION. TO BETTER TEST THE SOUNDNESS OF THESE INTERVENTIONS, THE PROJECT'S DATA COLLECTION CAPABILITIES SHOULD BE IMPROVED. THIS EVALUATION REPORT ALSO PROVIDES MORE DETAILED DISCUSSION OF SPECIFIC PROJECT PROBLEMS (AGRICULTURAL PACKAGES, INPUTS, TRAINING PROGRAMS, CREDIT SYSTEMS, COOPERATIVES, GRINDING MILL INSTALLATION, TREE PLANTING, SOIL CONSERVATION, CHICKEN RAISING, AND GOAT AND CATTLE FATTENING) AND OFFERS RECOMMENDTIONS.","Evaluation period: May 1978-May 1979|Bibcode changed from 32 to 22, 2008-05-19","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","5/1/1979 12:00:00 AM","","Rural development|Livestock|Integrated rural development|Agricultural extension|Water conservation|Fattening|Demonstration|Farms|Soil conservation|Cottage industries|Animal husbandry|Agricultural cooperatives|Marketing|Cooperatives|Irrigated farming|Agricultural credit|Millet|Agricultural production|COWPEAS|POULTRY|Flour|Food processing facilities","Niger","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAP509.pdf","565 KB","008585 - USAID.

THE LRC-BCES MODEL WAS DOCUMENTED IN THE SAN JOSE PAPER ENTITLED ""FROM VISIONS TO DEVELOPMENT."" THIS PAPER AND THE LRC-BCES CONCEPT WAS CONVEYED TO EDUCATORS FROM 6 LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES IN A WORKSHOP CONDUCTED IN JANUARY 1979. THE RESPONSES OF WORKSHOP PARTICIPANTS TO QUESTIONS CONCERNING THE LRC-BCES MODEL CONSTITUTE THE PRESENT EVALUATION. THE COUNTRY TEAMS UNANIMOUSLY BELIEVE THAT THE MODEL IS RELEVANT AND APPLICABLE TO THE EDUCATIONAL AND DEVELOPMENT PROBLEMS OF THEIR RESPECTIVE COUNTRIES. THE MODEL PRESENTS AN EFFECTIVE METHODOLOGY FOR TRANSLATING THE DEVELOPMENT GOALS OR ""VISIONS"" OF A COUNTRY INTO AN ACTION PROGRAM ADAPTED TO LOCAL COMMUNITY REALITIES. EACH COUNTRY TEAM BRIEFLY DESCRIBES THE DEVELOPMENT VISIONS OF THEIR COUNTRY, THE REALITIES OF THE RURAL POOR COMMUNITY, AND CURRENT PROGRAMS UNDERWAY TO ASSIST IN COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT. PARTICIPANTS THEN EXPLAIN HOW DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF THE LRC-BCES MODEL COULD BE ADAPTED TO IMPROVE EXISTING PROGRAMS AND ADDRESS DEVELOPMENT PROBLEMS.

"EVALUATES PROJECT TO INCREASE BEEF PRODUCTION THROUGH IMPROVED RANGE MANAGEMENT IN THE MAASAI REGION OF MALI AS OF 6/79. DEVELOPMENT ALTERNATIVES, INC PROVIDED 6 MAN-WEEKS OF TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO THE EVALUATION, WHICH WAS UNDERTAKEN IN MAY 1979. USAID HAS PROVIDED US $5 MILLION TO THE PROJECT, RESULTING IN A WIDE VARIETY OF OUTPUTS INCLUDING DEEP AND SHALLOW WELLS, DAMS, CATTLE DIPS, A RURAL TRAINING CENTER, PARTICIPANT TRAINING, VETERINARY SERVICES, STOCK IMPROVEMENT PROGRAMS, AND RANGE MANAGEMENT PLANS. THE NEAR EAST FOUNDATION HAS PROVIDED PROJECT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. LESSONS LEARNED DURING THIS PROJECT WERE NUMEROUS AND INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING: (1) CHIEFS OF PARTY SHOULD HAVE PLANNING/MANAGEMENT/ADMINISTRATIVE CAPABILITIES AS WELL AS TECHNICAL EXPERTISE: (2) AUTHORITY SHOULD BE CONCENTRATED WITHIN THE PROJECT AREA WITH THE CHEIF OF PARTY AND HIS COUNTERPART AS CENTRAL ACTORS; (3) OVERALL A FLEXIBLE IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH MUST BE TAKEN, ESPECIALLY IN A 10-YEAR PROJECT; (4) A LIAISON OFFICE SHOULD BE ESTABLISHED IN THE PORT CITY TO FREE THE CHIEF OF PARTY FROM EXCESSIVE CONCENTRATION ON PROCUREMENTS; (5) PARTICIPANT TRAINING SHOULD BE AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE PROJECT ACTIVITIES; AND (6) RIGID MAINTENANCE AND INVENTORY OF VEHICLES ARE CRITICAL TO PROJECT SUCCESS. EVALUATORS ALSO NOTE THAT AN EXTENDED START-UP PERIOD IS NEEDED TO FOCUS ON LANGUAGE PROFICIENCY, KNOWLEDGE OF THE LOCALITY, AND DEVELOPMENT OF REPORTING PROCEDURES.

"EVALUATES FROM 2/1/76 TO 6/1/79 MULTI-DONOR CENTRAL AFRICAN EMPIRE (CAE) SEED MULTIPLICATION PROJECT. PROJECT PURPOSE IS TO ESTABLISH AND INSTITUTIONALIZE A SEED PRODUCTION AND MULTIPLICATION CAPACITY AT THE GRIMARI AGRICULTURAL CENTER. EVALUATION, PREPARED BY AN OUTSIDE TEAM, IS BASED ON PROJECT DOCUMENTS, INFORMATION PROVIDED BY PROJECT AND GOCAE PERSONNEL, AND PERSONAL OBSERVATION. THE STATION AND FACILITIES AT GRIMARI ARE ALMOST COMPLETE. RICE SEED PRODUCTION (30 TONS) WAS ON TARGET IN 1978, BUT PEANUT SEED PRODUCTION (10 TONS) WAS ONLY 25% OFF TARGET. LATTER WILL BE INCREASED TO 20 TONS THIS YEAR. TRAINING OF CAE PERSONNEL IN SEED PRODUCTION PRACTICES HAS BEEN UNSTRUCTURED AND OF NEGLIGIBLE IMPACT. AID'S FARM MACHINERY SPECIALIST HAS BEEN ON SITE ONLY SINCE 5/78 DUE TO DIFFICULTY IN OBTAINING CAE OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE (O&M) PERSONNEL. HE HAS PERFORMED WELL, BUT IS OVEREXTENDED AND LACKS ADEQUATE TOOLS AND EQUIPMENT (NOW ON ORDER). HIS TRAINING OF O&M PERSONNEL HAS BEEN UNSTRUCTURED AND VERY LIMITED. SOME KEY PROJECT PAPER ASSUMPTIONS  -- GOCAE SUPPORT FR PROJECT, AND RECOGNIZED CONSTRANTS TO AGRICULTURAL PROUDUCTION -- ARE INVALID OR HIGHLY QUESTIONABLE. THESE DOUBTS AFFECT PROJECT GOAL AND PURPOSE. IF PHASE II OF THE PROJECT IS TO BE SUCCESSFUL, THERE WILL HAVE TO BE SUBSTANTIAL INCREASES IN MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION, AGRICULTURAL EXTENSION, AND IN EDUCATION OF FARMERS IN IMPROVED AGRONOMIC PRACTICES. IN ADDITION, GOCAE WILL HAVE TO PROVIDE SOLID SUPPORT TO THE PROJECT. UNDER PRESENT CONDITIONS, THE PROJECT HAS LITTLE CHANCE OF SUCCEEDING ON TIME AND EQUIPMENT AND THE CENTER ITSELF WILL MOST PROBABLY DETERIORATE AFTER EXPATRIATE PERSONNEL WITHDRAW. IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT: (1) AID'S TECHNICIANS REMAIN FOR A YEAR, RESTRICTING HIS ACTIVITIES TO DEVELOPING AN ADEQUATE O&M CAPABILITY, ESPECIALLY IN REGARD TO US MACHINERY, AND TO MONITORING, ASSESSING, AND ADVISING ON LOCAL USE OF MACHINERY; AND (2) AID DISCONTINUE FUNDING AFTER FY 79-80 UNLESS SUBSTANTIAL CHANGES ARE MADE IN THE CONCEPTION AND DESIGN OF PHASE II OF THE PROJECT.","Evaluation period: 1 Feb 1976-1 Jun 1979","Special Evaluation","Documents","AFR-C-1197","","6/1/1979 12:00:00 AM","","Participants|Agricultural extension|Storage facilities|Agricultural product marketing|Seed production|Agricultural policy|Agricultural planning|Technology transfer|Agricultural training|Agricultural technicians|Agricultural technology|Agricultural equipment|Agricultural development|Agricultural education|Agricultural production|Institution building|Beneficiary interviews|Project change","Central African Republic","","","000929 - Pacific Consultants","","","English","","Logframe change|Evaluation team|Indepth evaluation|Onsite evaluation","","STELLEY, RANDALL|LOCKHART, BENHAN","","1 Jun 1979","","","","CENTRAL AFRICAN EMPIRE SEED MULTIPLICATION PROJECT","","PD-AAC-123-C1","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc2Mzc2","Central African Republic","6760001"
"FINAL REPORT ON THE RICE PRODUCTION ACCELERATED IMPACT PROJECT (AIP) IN GUINEA-BISSAU (GB) EVALUATES PROJECT SUCCESS IN INCREASING RICE OUTPUT OF PEASANTS IN THE CONTUBOEL AND SAUCUNDA REGIONS BY USE OF SELECTED SEEDS, FERTILIZER, AND DRY-SEASON IRRIGATION. DATA USED IN THE EVALUATION PROCESS IS DERIVED FROM DISCUSSIONS WITH FARM FAMILY PARTICIPANTS, AGRI EXTENSION AGENTS, AND THE DIRECTOR OF GOGB'S DEPT OF RICE EXPERIMENTATION & PRODUCTION (DEPA). HYDROLOGISTS ALSO CONTRIBUTED TECH OPINIONS ON OVERALL IRRIGATION PROJECT (ATTACHED). THE RICE PRODUCTION AIP PROJECT HAS PROVEN SUCCESSFUL IN ENLISTING THE SUPPORT OF RURAL PEASANTS IN 2-SEASON INTENSIVE IRRIGATED RICE CULTIVATION. THE ORIGINAL TARGET OF ENROLLING 150 PEASANT FAMILIES IN RICE CULTIVATION PRACTICES HAS BEEN EASILY SURPASSED, AND PROJECT ACTIVITIES HAVE BROUGHT HIGHER PER HECTARE RICE YIELDS, HIGHER PER CAPITA CONSUMPTION, AND APPROX FOOD SELF-SUFFICIENCY TO PARTICIPANTS. IN 1978, 195 FAMILIES CULTIVATED 80 HECTARES (AVG 0.41 HA/FAMILY) IN THE DRY SEASON, AND 508 FAMILIEIS CULTIVATED 166 HECTARES IN THERAINY SEASON (AVG 0.33 HA/FAMILY). THE ENTHUSIASTIC RESPONSE FROM PARTICIPANTS STEMS FROM IMPRESSIVE RICE YIELDS OBTAINED IN THE DRY SEASON, ABSENCE OF INDEBTEDNESS, NON-COMPULSION, LOW RISKS, AND THE SMALL-SCALE ORGANIZATION OF PROJECT ACTIVITIES. THERE REMAIN 4 MAJOR PROBLEMS IN THE PROJECT WHICH MUST BE RESOLVED, PARTICULARLY IF PROJECT IS TO BE EXPANDED: (1)THE LACK OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR PROJECT COSTS BY PEASANT PRODUCERS; (2)THE ABSENCE OF REAL TECH & MANAGERIAL RESPONSIBILITY EXERCISED BY PRODUCERS' ASSOC; (3)THE FAILURE TO CONSIDER MEASURES WHICH COULD CAPITALIZE ON PROJECT'S ABILITY TO IMPROVE WOMEN'S ECONOMIC STATUS; (4)THE INADEQUATE SYSTEM FOR DOCUMENTING EVOLUTION OF PEASANT PERIMETERS. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE DESIGN OF PROJECT EXPANSION INCLUDE: (1)PREPARATION/MGMT OF PERIMETER TOPOGRAPHY; (2)ACTUAL & POTENTIAL MKT POSSIBILITIES FOR RICE, SORGHUM & MILLET PROD;(3)ARRANGEMENT FOR COST ACCTNG SYSTEM FOR PROJ.

DESPITE GENERALLY GOOD PERFORMANCE OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH INSTITUTE OF MICHIGAN (ERIM) -- THOUGH SUB-PROJECT MANAGEMENT DIFFERED WIDELY -- SMALL GRANTS PROGRAM HAD ONLY MIXED SUCCESS. SUB-PROJECT IN BOLIVIA FAILED TECHNICALLY, PARTIALLY DUE TO UNDERFUNDING AND AN INAPPROPRIATE CHOICE OF RECIPIENT AGENCY. SUB-PROJECT IN PERU WAS TECHNICALLY SUCCESSFUL AND GENERATED ENTHUSIASM. A SECOND GRANT IS PLANNED. A REGIONAL SEMINAR HELD IN PERU WAS ONLY PARTIALLY A SUCCESS, DUE TO POOR PLANNING. (THE INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM IN MANILA, HOWEVER, WAS A GREAT SUCCESS). SUB-PROJECT IN THAILAND WAS NOT GENERALLY SUCCESSFUL,  DUE IN PART TO THE FAILURE TO CORRELATE TIMES FOR GATHERING LANDSAT AND GROUND TRUTH DATA. THE RECIPINET AGENCY, HOWEVER, GAINED VALUABLE EXPERIENCE. SUB-PROJECT IN SRI LANKA WAS A SUCCESS AND THE TECHNICAL CAPABILITY OF THE RECIPENT AGENCY WAS ENHANCED. EVALUATIONS RECEIVED FROM PHILIPPINE PERSONNEL (THE COUNTRY WAS NOT VISITED) CONTRADICT, SEEMINGLY WITH REASON, AID ASSURANCES OF SUB-PROJECT SUCCESS IN THAT COUNTRY. SMALL GRANTS MECHANISM IS GENERALLY VALID, BUT IS BEST ADAPTED TO INTRODUCING NEW TECHNOLOGY. CONCOMITANT TRAINING SHOULD BE KEPT AT AN APPROPRIATE LEVEL AND SHOULD BE HELD IN THE HOST COUNTRY. TRAINING PROGRAMS HELD AT SOUTH DAKOTA STATE UNIVERSITY FOR NEPALESE PERSONNEL WERE A SUCCESS. FUTURE TRAINING FOR SUDANESE AND SENGALESE PERSONNEL IS PLANNED. PROJECT DESIGN IS BASICALLY SOUND, BUT COULD BE IMPROVED BY GREATER SPECIFICATION AT THE GOAL AND OUTPUTS LEVELS. CLOSER TIES BETWEEN CONTRACTOR, USAID'S, AND LDC AGENCIES, AS WELL AS INCREASED FUNDING FOR TRAVEL, ARE ALSO RECOMMENDED.

"EVALUATES LATIN AMERICAN PROJECT ACTIVITIES OF THE PATHFINDER FUND (PF) AS OF 2/27/79 BASED ON FIELD VISITS. THE RAPID INCREASE OF INTEREST IN AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR FAMILY PLANNING IN LATIN AMERICA HAS RESULTED IN THE NEED FOR MORE FREQUENT AND LONGER VISITS BY PF REPRESENTATIVES. THIS WILL BE FACILITATED BY THE PLANNED RECRUITMENT OF REPRESENTATIVES IN MEXICO, BRAZIL, AND PERU. THE LATIN AMERICA/NORTH OFFICE SEEMS TO BE WELL LOCATED FOR ITS RESPONSIBILITIES. THIS IS NOT TRUE OF THE LATIN AMERICA/SOUTH OFFICE BECAUSE THE OPPORTUNITIES ARE IN THE NORTH AND EAST. THIS IS NOT LIKELY TO CHANGE SINCE BOTH ARGENTINA AND CHILE ARE APPROACHING THE STATE OF FEELING COMPETENT TO HANDLE THEIR OWN POPULATION PROBLEMS. THE FOCUS IN LATIN AMERICA IS ON VOLUNTARY FAMILY PLANNING GROUPS, USING PROFESSORS OF OBSTETRICS, AND ON THE TRAINING OF PARA-MEDICAL WOMEN WORKERS AND PHYSICIANS IN LOW TECHNOLOGY STERILIZATION. PF MAY NEED MORE STAFF IN STERILIZATION, TRAINING, AND CONTRACEPTION IN GENERAL, ESPECIALLY AS NEW PROJECTS AND INITIATIVES DEVELOP. SEVERAL PROJECTS COULD BENEFIT FROM MORE CAREFUL ASSESSMENT AND EVALUATION; IT IS NOT CLEAR THAT PF REGIONAL OFFICES HAVE NECESSARY SKILLS TO PROVIDE THIS SERVICE. IF NOT, THEY MUST UTILIZE AVAILABLE STAFF SKILLS IN MEETING THIS NEED. IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT: 1)PF SHOULD CONTINUE ITS TRADITIONAL ROLE OF SUPPORTING INNOVATION, SHORT-TERM AND HIGH RISK PROJECTS WHERE THESE ARE STILL NEEDED, BUT ALSO SHOULD SUPPORT LARGER AND LONGER TERM PROJECTS.

"EVALUATES PROJECT TO PRODUCE A MANUAL ON ROAD NETWORK DEVELOPMENT PLANNING (RNDP) TECHNIQUES FOR INTERMEDIATE SIZE PHILIPPINE CITIES, USING TESTED FIELD TECHNIQUES; AND TO DEVISE A TRAINING PROGRAM FEATURING THE MANUAL. ALTHOUGH RNDP MANUAL WAS COMPLETED ON SCHEDULE, THE PILOT PROJECT STUDY (PPS) AT ANGELES CITY TO DETERMINE AND SOLVE ROAD TRANSPORTATION PROBLEMS WAS UNSUCCESSFUL. THE PPS LACKED ADEQUATELY TRAINED STAFF TO COMPLETE THE PPS IN THE ALLOTED 3 MONTHS TIME, DUE TO COMPLEX DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS PROCESSES. STAFF ALSO WERE UNABLE TO DEVELOP A TRAINING PROGRAM FOR GOVT OF PHILIPPINE (GOP) PERSONNEL. IT WAS DIFFICULT TO CONFORM TO ANY RESEARCH SCHEDULE DUE TO THE PROJECT'S INITIAL INVESTIGATORY NATURE AND INFLEXIBLE GOP PERSONNEL SCHEDULES. THE MAIN TRANSPORTATION DEVELOPMENT PROBLEM, HOWEVER, WAS CITY DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE PROJECT (CDAP) PERSONNEL'S INSUFFICIENT KNOWLEDGE OF THE FORCES SHAPING CITY DEVELOPMENT AND DICTATING THE TYPES AND LOCATION OF FUTURE LAND USES. DESPITE THE GENERAL LACK OF PROGRESS, EVALUATOR FEELS RNDP, PPS PARTICIPANTS HAVE RECEIVED SUFFICIENT TRAINING TO INDEPENDENTLY CONDUCT RNDP STUDIES ON A SMALLER SCALE THAN THE ANGELES CITY PPS. IN FUTURE RNDP STUDIES, HOWEVER, SUFFICIENT TIME SHOULD BE ALLOWED FOR PROJECT COMPLETION. ALSO, IF STUDY PROCEDURES WERE SIMPLIFIED CDAP STAFF COULD MORE EFFECTIVELY ANALYZE THE VOLUME AND CAPACITY OF ALL MAIN ROADS TO DETERMINE WHICH ROADS WERE OPERATING AT OR ABOVE CAPACITY BETWEEN 6-8 AM AND 4-6 PM. SINCE OTHER FACTORS THAN TRAFFIC FLOW, SUCH AS CONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES NEAR ROADS PREVENT WIDENING ROADWAYS, SUCH FACTORS SHOULD BE DETERMINED AND UNDERSTOOD BY GOP PERSONNEL. RNDP PLANNING PROCESS COULD BE SIMPLIFIED FOR ALL CITIES BY DEVELOPING TRAFFIC REGULATIONS IN RELATION TO LAND USE AND TO ADJACENT ROUTES. LAND USE STUDIES WOULD ALSO MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO PREDICT TRAFFIC VOLUMES IN RELATION TO LAND USE AND, WHERE NEEDED, TO DESIGN ROAD SECTIONS OF ADEQUATE CAPACITY TO HANDLE INCREASED TRAFFIC FLOW.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","AID/492-1429","","4/1/1979 12:00:00 AM","","Transportation planning|Transportation policy|Educational materials|Manuals and handbooks|Roads|Transportation system design","Philippines","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAD528G1.pdf","195 KB","008592 - USAID.

"EVALUATES THROUGH 3/79 ACADEMIC COMPONENT OF LOAN AND GRANT TO THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES (GOP) TO INCREASE SMALL FARMER PRODUCTIVITY AND MARKETING EFFICIENCY. COMPONENT PURPOSE IS TO DEVELOP A CADRE OF TRAINED PROFESSIONALS FOR PUBLIC AND PRIVATE AGRICULTURAL AGENCIES AND INSTITUTIONS. EVALUATION, PREPARED BY AN OUTSIDE TEAM AT GOP'S REQUEST, IS BASED ON PROJECT DOCUMENTS, INTERVIEWS WITH PERSSONNEL FROM CONCERNED INSTITUTIONS, AND REACTIONS OF PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION UNITS TO ORIGINAL EVALUATION DRAFT. OVERSEAS MA AND PHD TRAINING AND POST-DOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS FOR STAFFS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF THE PHILIPPINES AT LOS BANOS (UPLB) AND CENTRAL LUZON STATE UNIVERSITY (CLSU) ARE CONSIDERABLY BEHIND SCHEDULE. IT IS THEREFORE RECOMMENDED THAT GRADUATE TRAINING BE DONE IN-COUNTRY TO AVOID THE GOVERNMENT SERVICE REQUIREMENT AND TO REDUCE COSTS, WITH THE OPPORTUNITY FOR PHD CANDIDATES TO SPEND A YEAR ABROAD TO MINIMIZE INBREEDING; THAT THE TIME FOR MS AND PHD TRAINING BE EXTENDED TO 16 AND 36 MONTHS, RESPECTIVELY; AND THAT THE STIPEND FOR FELLOWSHIPS BE INCREASED OR THE PROGRAM AS A WHOLE BE REPLACED BY IN-COUNTRY, SHORT-TERM TRAINING COURSES INCORPORATING FOREIGN TRAINERS. SHORT TRAINING COURSES AT BOTH SCHOOLS ARE PROGRESSING WELL, BUT SHOULD BE STRENGTHENED BY GREATER INVOLVEMENT OF TARGET CLIENTELE IN PROGRAM DESIGN, BY POST-PLANNING EVALUATIONS, AND BY ASSURANCE OF CONTINUING GOP FINANCIAL SUPPORT.

"EVALUATES FROM 7/78 TO 9/79 LOAN TO THE GOVERNMENT OF COSTA RICE TO DEVELOP AN INTEGRATED AND MULTI-SECTORAL NATIONAL NUTRITION PROGRAM. EVALUATION IS BY AN OUTSIDE CONTRACTOR AND IS INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE TO MISSION DIRECTOR IN CONSIDERING LOAN EXTENSION. EXTENSION SHOULD DEPEND ON LIKELIHOOD OF INSTITUTIONALIZING LOAN ACCOMPLISHMENTS. USAID SHOULD ENCOURAGE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR IN THIS DIRECTION. TRAINING AND EDUCATION ACTIVITIES (INCLUDING THOSE IN MASS MEDIA EDUCATION) OF THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH (MOH) SHOULD BE TERMINATED 9/80, EXCEPT FOR TRAINING RELATED TO MOH'S POPULAR PARTICIPATION PROGRAM AND ANY LONG-TERM PARTICIPANT TRAINING ALREADY BEGUN. MOH'S RURAL WATER COMPONENT HAS BEEN DELAYED BY PROCUREMENT AND LOGISTICAL PROGRAMS. IT SHOULD BE TERMINATED 9/80, SINCE PROCUREMENT WILL BE COMPLETED AND UNFINISHED INSTALLATION WORK IS INDEPENDENT OF THE LOAN. RESEARCH ACTIVITIES OF GOCR AGENCIES HAVE MADE EXCELLENT PROGRESS AND SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN ANY LOAN EXTENSION. AGENCIES SHOULD BE HELPED TO FIND REPLACEMENT FUNDING IF LOAN IS TERMINATED. DESPITE GOOD PROGRESS, THE NUTRITION INFORMATION SYSTEM (SIN) REMAINS ISOLATED FROM OTHER GOCR AGENCIES; LOAN EXTENSION BEYOND 8/80 SHOULD BE CONDITIONED UPON THE EXISTENCE OF A NUTRITION PLANNING OFFICE IN ASIGNACIONES FAMILIARES THAT USES SIN FOR DATA GENERATION/ANALYSIS; AND ON GOCR COMMITMENT TO COORDINATE SIN WITH RELATED AGENCIES IN ORDER TO AVOID DUPLICATION OF WORK (E.G., PRE-SCHOOL FOOD SURVEYS). FURTHER TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE IN SIN SHOULD BE BASED ON ASSESSMENT OF SIN'S NEW ROLE OF PROVIDING STAFF SUPPORT TO GOCR AGENCIES. COMPUTER PURCHASE PLANS FOR SIN SHOULD BE INTEGRATED WITH THE NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM AND ANY RELATED LOAN AND SHOULD BE CONTINGENT UPON GOCR PLANS FOR POST-LOAN COMPUTER USE. IN GENERAL, LOAN HAS PROGRESSED WELL AND SHOULD BE EXTENDED TO 4/81 BY MISSION DIRECTOR'S AUTHORITY, WITH AMOUNTS FOR REMAINING COMPONENTS TO BE DETERMINED AFTER SUBMISSION OF REVISED PROPOSALS/IMPLEMENTATION PLANS.

"REPORTS ON PROJECT TO INSTITUTE EYE CARE SERVICES IN THE CENTRAL AND RIFT VALLEY PROVINCES OF KENYA DURING THE PERIOD 1/1/78 TO 12/31/78. THE EDUCATIONAL CAPABILITIES OF THE MOBILE EYE UNITS (MEU'S) WERE EXPANDED WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF A PRIMARY HEALTH CARE MANUAL AND AN IMPROVED VERSION OF A VISUAL ACUITY CHART WITH EYE CARE MESSAGES PRINTED ON IT. INTERNATIONAL EYE FOUNDATION (IEF) OPHTHALMOLOGISTS ARE SUPERVISING, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, 22 OF KENYA'S 27 MOBILE AND STATIC EYE UNITS. IEF HAS PROVIDED DIAGNOSTIC EQUIPMENT AND THERAPEUTIC AND EXPENDABLE DRUG SUPPLIES TO THE UNITS. A PREVENTIVE EYE CARE DISPLAY WAS DEVELOPED AND USED IN AGRICULTURAL SHOWS THROUGHOUT KENYA. PLANS ARE UNDERWAY FOR A MAJOR SYMPOSIUM IN NAIROBI FOR ALL CLINICAL OFFICERS TRAINED IN OPHTHALMICS. THE IEF RECEIVED APPROVAL FROM THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT TO SURVEY THE OCULAR AND NUTRITIONAL STATUS OF RURAL KENYANS. THUS FAR, SURVEYS HAVE BEEN CONDUCTED IN NYERI DISTRICT, CENTRAL PROVINCE AND KWALE DISTRICT, COAST PROVINCE. THE BRITISH JOURNAL OF OPHTHALMOLOGY IS EXPECTED TO PUBLISH THE RESULTS OF A PILOT SURVEY OF THE SAMBURU DISTRICT, RIFT VALLEY PROVINCES. ALSO, IT IS LIKELY THAT THE 5 SURVEYS CONDUCTED UNDER THIS GRANT WILL BE PUBLISHED BY THE BJO. DUE TO A POLITICAL DECISION BY THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH, KENYAN OPHTHALMOLOGISTS WILL NO LONGER RECEIVE TRAINING FROM THE IEF TEAM. A NEW EYE CARE MAGAZINE, ""MACHO YA KENYA"" (EYES OF KENYA), WILL BE DISTRIBUTED TO 20,000 RURAL SCHOOL CHILDREN. TWO SHOWS ON EYE CARE WERE BROADCAST, AND RADIO SPOTS ARE PLANNED.

"EVALUATES PROJECT TO IMPROVE THE EFFICIENCY OF WATER USE BY FARMERS IN THE INDUS WATERSHED, PAKISTAN. EVALUATION COVERS THE PERIOD 1968 TO 1979 AND IS BASED ON MEETINGS WITH PERSONNEL FROM COLORADO STATE UNIVERSITY (CSU), THE US CONTRACTOR, AND ONSITE VISITS. CSU WAS MANDATED TO PRODUCE INFORMATION (RESEARCH) AND EXPERTISE (TRAINED PERSONNEL) CONCERNING ON-FARM WATER MANAGEMENT IN ASIA. IMPORTANT RESEARCH AREAS INCLUDED WATERCOURSE AND FARM IRRIGATION LOSSES; SOCIO-ECONOMIC CONSTRAINTS TO WATERCOURSE DEVELOPMENT; WATER USER ASSOCIATION AND MODEL LAW ISSUES; THE RELATIONSHIPS AMONG CROPS, SOIL, WATER, SALINITY, AND FERTILITY; AND IMPROVED WATERCOURSE TECHNOLOGY. IN THE AREA OF TRAINING, PAKISTANI COLLABORATORS NOT ONLY PERFORMED THE RESEARCH PLANNED UNDER THE PROJECT, BUT ALSO IDENTIFIED PROBLEMS AND INITIATED PROBLEM-SOLVING RESEARCH. MANY HAVE SUBSEQUENTLY MOVED ON TO IMPORTANT POLICY-MAKING POSITIONS WITH THE GOVERNMENT. OVER 150 TECHNICAL REPORTS AND PUBLICATIONS AND A NUMBER OF ON-FARM WATER MANAGEMENT SEMINARS WERE ALSO FORTHCOMING. THE 1979 DECISION TO CURTAIL AID SUPPORT TO PAKISTAN EFFECTIVELY TERMINATED THE PROJECT JUST AS CSU WAS MOVING INTO THE EXTENSION PHASE. SEVERAL IMPORTANT LESSONS HAVE BEEN LEARNED, INCLUDING THE NEED FOR IN-COUNTRY HUMAN AND INSTITUTIONAL RESOURCES FOR RESEARCH; THE IMPORTANCE OF CENTRAL RESEARCH INITIATIVES TO RESOLVE GENERAL DEVELOPMENT CONSTRAINTS; THE ADVANTAGES OF MOVING INTO EXTENSION AND APPLICATION OF RESEARCH RESULTS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE; AND THE NEED TO CONDUCT RESEARCH UNDER FIELD CONDITIONS. IN SUMMARY, THE EVALUATORS FEEL THAT A MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH HAS BEEN MADE TOWARD IMPROVING THE EFFICIENCY AND EQUITY OF IRRIGATION WATER DISTRIBUTION UNDER LARGE CANAL SYSTEMS. IF THE POTENTIAL OF THIS ACCOMPLISHMENT IS TO BE REALIZED, EXCEPTIONAL COMMITMENT AND PERSISTANCE OF THE HOST COUNTRY AND ITS DONORS WILL BE NECESSARY. IN THIS VEIN, THE EVALUATORS RECOMMEND THAT USAID/INDIA SHOULD STRIVE TO COMPLETE THE WORK UNDERWAY ON THE ANALYSES AND DESIGN OF WATER USERS ASSOCIATIONS, AND THAT AID SHOULD RECONSIDER ITS DECISION TO ELIMINATE THE TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER SEMINAR PLANNED FOR PAKISTAN.","Evaluation period: 28 Mar 1968-31 Mar 1980","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/CSD-2126|AID/TA-C-1100|AID/TA-141","","9/1/1979 12:00:00 AM","","Indigenous education|Agricultural technology|Information dissemination|Irrigation|Agricultural research|Water supply structures|Management training|Water management","Pakistan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAF878A1.pdf","1,273 KB","","","","English","application/pdf","Evaluation team|Indepth evaluation|Onsite evaluation","","WALKER, JAMES L.|PETERSON, DEAN F.|COWARD, E.

"EVALUATES, FOR THE PERIOD 2/28/73 TO 6/30/79, LOAN TO THE CENTRAL AMERICAN BANK FOR ECONOMIC INTEGRATION (CABEI) TO SUPPORT CABEI FINANCING OF THE CENTRAL AMERICAN REGIONAL HIGHWAY SYSTEM EXPANSION. NO METHODOLOGY IS INDICATED FOR THIS LOAN COMPLETION REPORT. THE ORIGINAL TERMINAL DISBURSEMENT DATE HAD TO BE EXTENDED TWO YEARS TO 6/79 DUE TO THE LOW EXECUTION CAPACITY OF SOME GOVERNMENTS IN REGARD TO THE DESIGN OF PLANS AND BIDDING DOCUMENTS; DELAYS IN CONTRACTING CONSULTANTS; SLOW CENTRAL AMERICAN CONGRESSIONAL APPROVAL OF LOAN CONTRACTS; THE 1976 GUATEMALA EARTHQUAKE; AND BAD WEATHER. ENGINEERS FROM ROCAP AND CABEI MONITORED THE SUB-PROJECTS, PERIODICALLY INSPECTING CONSTRUCTION SITES TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH PLANS AND SPECIFICATIONS. SUB-BORROWERS, HOWEVER, WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR EXECUTING THE SUB-PROJECTS AND ALSO SELECTED CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTORS WITH THE APPROVAL OF ROCAP AND CABEI. CABEI PERFORMED WILL IN IMPLEMENTING LOAN AND OBSERVED ALL CONDITIONS AND COVENANTS. THE TOTAL PROGRAM COST WAS $39.5 MILLION, OF WHICH THE AID LOAN FINANCED $25 MILLION. FIVE HIGHWAYS, WITH A TOTAL LENGTH OF 273 KILOMETERS, WERE CONSTRUCTED IN HONDURAS (2), GUATEMALA, EL SALVADOR, NICARAGUA, AND COSTA RICA. IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LOAN AGREEMENT, THE ORIGINAL ILLUSTRATIVE LIST OF SIX PROJECTS SELECTED FOR LOAN FINANCING WAS REVISED THREE TIMES TO COPE WITH MORE URGENT HIGHWAY NEEDS. ALL PROJECTS OR SEGMENTS OF PROJECTS WERE RECOMMENDED ORIGINALLY IN THE CENTRAL AMERICAN TRANSPORTATION STUDY 1964-65, EXCEPT FOR GUATEMALA EARTHQUAKE RECONSTRUCTION. THE ONLY IMPLEMENTATION PROBLEM OCCURRED IN NICARAGUA, WHERE THE SUPERVISORY FIRM DID NOT ACCEPT PART OF THE WORK BECAUSE IT WAS NOT PERFORMED ACCORDING TO THE CONTRACTOR'S SPECIFICATIONS. WHEN THE ROAD WAS COMPLETED, THE DISPUTED PORTION REMAINED UNPAID AND LEGAL ACTION BETWEEN GON AND THE CONTRACTORS CONTINUES. THE PROJECT IS NOW COMPLETE.

"EVALUATES AID PORTION OF A MULTI-DONOR PROJECT TO INCREASE THE QUALITY AND QUANTITY OF LIVESTOCK PRODUCTION IN KENYA FROM PROJECT START IN 4/74 TO 8/79. EVALUATION INCLUDED A REVIEW OF PROJECT AND OTHER DOCUMENTS, INTERVIEWS WITH APPROPRIATE GOVERNMENT OF KENYA OFFICIALS, DISCUSSIONS WITH AID, IBRD, AND OTHER INTERNATIONAL FUNDING AGENCIES, AND VISITS TO PRJECT SITES. ALTHOUGH SOME PROJECT ACHIEVEMENTS WERE OUTSTANDING, THEY OFTEN FELL SHORT OF UNREALISTIC PROJECT GOALS. ESPECIALLY DISCONCERTING WERE THE TOO SHORT TIME-FRAME ALLOWED FOR GOALS TO BE REACHED AND THE ABSENCE OF CONTINGENCY PROVISIONS IN THE EVENT OF A DROUGHT. CONCERNING SPECIFIC OUTPUTS, THE TRAINING OF KENYANS IN RANGE/RANCH PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT, THE IMPROVEMENT OF KENYAN RANGE MANAGEMENT TRAINING INSTITUTIONS, AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF RANCHES ALL SEEMED TO BE GOING WELL. PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF GRAZING BLOCKS, BUT THIS HAS BEEN MARRED BY LACK OF MAINTENANCE. MANY OF THE CONSTRUCTED RESERVOIRS WERE RAPIDLY FILLING IN WITH SILT, AND ONLY ONE OF THE 37 BOREHOLES WAS OPERATING. THE PLANNED MEAT PROCESSING STUDY WAS COMPLETED IN 3/77, BUT FIVE OF THE SEVEN MAJOR RECOMMENDATIONS HAVE NOT YET BEEN ACTED UPON BY THE GOVERNMENT. THE CREDIT INSTITUTIONS ESTABLISHED TO ASSIST RANCH DEVELOPMENT WERE PRESSING RANCHES TO GET FURTHER INTO DEBT THAN WAS IN THEIR BEST INTERESTS. FINALLY, THE ESTABLISHMENT OF SERVICE AND MAINTENANCE FACILITIES FOR PROJECT EQUIPMENT HAS NOT BEEN ACHIEVED. AMONG THE UNPLANNED POSITIVE PROJECT CONSEQUENCES WERE THE SENSITIVIZATION OF TECHNICIANS, FINANCIERS, PLANNERS, AND INTERNATIONAL DONORS TO THE REALITIES OF A FRAGILE ENVIRONMENT AND THE REDUCTION OF FRICTION BETWEEN TRIBAL CLANS.

"Evaluates project to improve animal husbandry, animal health, and range management in Ranching Association Area's (RAA's) in Tanzania's Masai District.  Evaluation covers the period 1969-10/79 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with project personnel and beneficiaries. During the period 1969-76, of seven projected outputs, only improved water availability met with more than very limited success; even this component experienced problems with equipment failure, faulty construction, and lack of fuel.  Little progress was made in range management, animal health, or other livestock targets:  plans were left unimplemented, the mortality rate of imported bulls was high, repair needs left animal dips inoperable, and lack of adequate equipment left disease control centers nonfunctional.  Moreover, after a promising first year, the Government of Tanzania (GOT) lost interest in the RAA's and in related marketing and extension efforts, dooming these components to failure. During the period 1976-79 (following a major project revision), achievements were strongest in the areas of disease control and participant training.  Even here, however, animal dip breakdowns, lack of supplies, and the failure of the GOT to assign returned participants to the Masai project reduced potential benefits greatly.  Although sketchy range management plans have been drawn up, and one rural training center established, both of these efforts have been plagued by serious organizational problems and implementation failures.  Plans for registration of and adequate water coverage for 40 villages and for short livestock and range management courses have either been suspended or are being implemented only haphazardly.  Targeted outputs regarding development of baseline data  and 40 miles of market access roads were a failure.  Overall, additional watering points and control of tick-borne diesases have been the components most valued by the Masai and represent the project's greatest contribution to increased livestock production and improved range care. Some 50 recommendations were made, among them that future projects: be limited in scope; include Masai input during the planning stage; collect baseline data; define priority project activities; and develop an indigenous capacity to maintain equipment and facilities provided under this project.","Evaluation period: 1 Jan 1969-19 Oct 1979","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","AID/SOD/PDC-C-0187","","10/1/1979 12:00:00 AM","","Disease prevention and control|Animal diseases|Animal husbandry|Livestock|Range management|Agricultural management|Beneficiary interviews","Tanzania","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAG096A1.pdf","8,036 KB","006434 - Devres, Inc.","","","English","application/pdf","Evaluation team|Indepth evaluation|Onsite evaluation","","SWARZENSKI, WOLFGANG|TISDALE, EDWIN W.|et al.","Livestock","19 Oct 1979","","","","TERMINAL EVALUATION OF THE MASAI LIVESTOCK RANGE MANAGEMENT PROJECT","","PD-AAG-096-A1","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc2NjY4","Tanzania","6210093"
"EVALUATES PROJECT IN ZAIRE TO IMPROVE SMALL FARMER PRODUCTION AND INCOME THROUGH A REPLICABLE RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROCESS. EVALUATION, WHICH COVERS THE PERIOD FROM PROJECT INCEPTION IN 1976 TO MID 1979, WAS PERFORMED BY A CONTRACTED TEAM THROUGH INTERVIEWS WITH GOZ AND USAID PROJECT OFFICIALS AND SMALL FARMERS. PROJECT COMPONENTS, ESPECIALLY IN COMMUNICATIONS AND INFORMATION, ROAD REHABILITATION, AND MARKETING AND CREDIT, ARE NOT PERFORMING SUFFICIENTLY WELL TO ENSURE PROJECT SUCCESS. THE INTERMEDIATE TECHNOLOGY COMPONENT HAS BEEN THE MOST SUCCESSFUL, ESTABLISHING A WORKSHOP FOR FARM AND INTERMEDIATE TOOL PRODUCTION AND WIDE USAGE OF HAND MILLS. CROP TECHNOLOGIES ARE BEING INTRODUCED TO FARMERS (ALTHOUGH THE EXTENT OF THEIR USE CANNOT BE ASCERTAINED), AND 30 FARMER GROUPS, SKILL IN THE PRE-COOPERATIVE STAGE, AND 17 FARMER CENTERS HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED. THE RESEARCH STATION AT NGABA IS BEHIND SCHEDULE. FARMER TRAINING WILL DEPEND ON ITS AVAILABILITY. TWO OVERALL ISSUES OF MAJOR CONCERN ARE THE QUESTIONABILITY OF EXCLUSIVE EMPHASIS ON MAIZE PRODUCTION AND WHETHER PROJECT ALLIANCES WITH THE POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC ELITE ARE ALIENATING SMALL FARMERS. A NUMBER OF DIFFICULTIES HAVE IMPEDED PROGRESS SIGNIFICANTLY. PROCUREMENT OF US EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES HAS BEEN SLOW AND LOCAL MATERIALS UNAVAILABLE. POLITICAL, SOCIAL, AND ECONOMIC INSTABILITY AND LACK OF A COHERENT GOZ NATIONAL RURAL DEVELOPMENT POLICY ARE AMONG SERIOUS EXTERNAL CONSTRAINTS.

"EVALUATES PROJECT, KNOWN AS THE INTERNATIONAL RICE RESEARCH INSTITUTE (IRRI) MECHANIZATION CONSEQUENCES PROJECT, TO SURVEY THE EFFECTS OF FARM MECHANIZATION ON SMALL RICE FARMS IN THE PHILIPPINES, INDONESIA, THAILAND, AND PAKISTAN; AND TO STRENGTHEN IN-COUNTRY RESEARCH CAPABILITIES. EVALUATION COVERS THE PERIOD 9/77 TO 9/79 AND IS A DRAFT REPORT BASED ON PROJECT STAFF INTERVIEWS, AN IRRI ISSUES LIST, AND ONSITE VISITS. SATISFACTORY PROGRESS WAS MADE TOWARD THE ACHIEVEMENT OF PROJECT PURPOSES. THE SURVEY SAMPLE WAS SELECTED AND THE QUESTIONNAIRE WAS DEVISED. METHODOLOGIES FOR DATA ANALYSIS WERE DETERMINED. SURVEYS WERE INITIATED IN THREE OF THE FOUR COUNTRIES, BUT DUE TO A LATE START, THE SURVEYS ARE BARELY UNDERWAY. PROJECT DESIGN WAS QUESTIONNABLE BOTH IN TERMS OF THE RELIABILITY OF DRAWING CONCLUSIONS FROM NARROW DATA, AND THE PROJECT'S UNDERESTIMATED TIME FRAME. PROJECT MANAGEMENT WAS UNSATISFACTORY DUE TO FREQUENT PERSONNEL CHANGES, LACK OF PROJECT DOCUMENTATION, AND POOR COMMUNICATION BETWEEN USAID AND IRRI. AN ASSESSMENT OF THE COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM IS NEEDED AS WELL AS SEMI-ANNUAL CONTRACTOR'S PROGRESS REPORTS. SEVERAL FACTORS CAUSES CONTRACT CHANGES. PROJECT FUNDING APPROVAL WAS DELAYED FOR ONE YEAR, CAUSING A DELAY IN DATA COLLECTION SINCE THE SURVEY, TAKEN OVER A YEARLY CROP CYCLE, HAD TO BE ADJUSTED TO A SUCCEEDING CROP YEAR CYCLE. PAKISTAN WAS NOT SURVEYED AND IRRI WAS UNABLE TO INITIATE WORK DUE TO EVENTS BEYOND THEIR CONTROL. DROUGHT AND OTHER UNFORESEEN EVENTS CAUSED THE NEED FOR CONTRACT EXTENSION FOR INTERVIEWING AND DEVELOPING QUANTITATIVE ANALYTICAL MODELS. ORIGINALLY, TWO SURVEY SITES IN EACH COUNTRY WERE TO BE SAMPLED. HOWEVER, IN THE PHILIPPINES AND THAILAND, THE TEAMS DECIDED TO SURVEY ONE SITE TWICE, RATHER THAN CHANGE SITES. THE EVALUATION TEAM APPROVED THIS ACTION. ADDITIONAL RECOMMENDATIONS INCLUDE A REVISED TWO-YEAR EXTENSION CONTRACT WITH BUDGET CHANGES, AS WELL AS A MODIFICATION TO DELETE PAKISTAN, REALLOCATION OF ITS FUNDS FOR COST OVERRUNS IN THE REMAINING THREE COUNTRIES, AND INITIATION OF A SIMILAR PROJECT IN A FOURTH COUNTRY, SUCH AS BURMA.","Evaluation period: 1-6 Oct 1979","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1979 12:00:00 AM","","Samples|Surveys|Questionnaires|Indigenous education|Agricultural policy|Agricultural planning|Agricultural development|Development strategies|RICE|Agricultural research|Agricultural training|Mechanized farming|Small farms|Farmers|Rural development|Data collection|Data analysis|Institution building|Technical assistance|Beneficiary interviews|Project change|Limited data","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAG225C1.pdf","1,150 KB","008592 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to increase the capability of selected Caribbean Development Finance Corps. (DFC) which finance economic development projects.  This special evaluation covers the period through 2/79 and is based on a contracted evaluator's visits to selected DFC's and inspection of their records. The author concluded that the weakness of the DFC's as loan guarantors and administrators was clearly demonstrated.  Two factors were held responsible:  the host government's perception of the DFC's role; and the DFC's perception of their clients. Regarding the first factor, most governments lacked agricultural and industrial development plans and subsequently regarded the DFC's as being a substitute, not a supplement for such planning.  Also, since DFC's generally have access to foreign funding sources, host governments attempted to gain control of these institutions in order to have access to their resources.  This action was taken by some governments without first establishing clear policy objectives.  DFC's, in essence, became the political and personnel instruments of host government leaders.  Since the DFC's dealt with foreign funds, the absence of a local financial stake in DFC operations facilitated the misuse of funds by the governments.  The officials responsible for administrating the funds had no compulsion to apply rigorous lending criteria to the projects. The author recommends that distinct policies and operational guidelines should be drawn up by the host governments, and that the cooperation of the latter in enforcing these giudelines must be secured. Operationally, the DFC's should recognize first, that applicants with the greatest probabilities of success are those with previous success at the technological level anticipated in the new project; and second, that new projects should be developed slowly so that the technical process can be absorbed by the participants.  The author notes that the DFC's may need assistance for loan appraisals, preferably from governments and international lenders.","Evaluation period: Through 1 Feb 1979","Special Evaluation","Documents","C-BRG-538-78-004","","2/1/1979 12:00:00 AM","","CREDIT|Financial institutions|Industrial development banks|Regional development|Development finance|EMPLOYMENT|Labor surveys|Industrial credit|Industrial development|Land development","Eastern Caribbean","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAG015A1.pdf","5,917 KB","","","","English","application/pdf","Indepth evaluation|Onsite evaluation","","SKOWRONSKI, FRANK S.","","2 Feb 1979","","","","DFC EVALUATION IN SELECTED CARIBBEAN LDCS","","PD-AAG-015-A1","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc2Nzc1","Caribbean Regional","5380003"
"Evaluates project to assist the Government of Peru (GOP) in the development and reconstruction of areas damagedby a 5/31/70 earthquake and the floods of 2-3/72.  Evaluation covers the period from 6/8/72 to 4/1/79 and mentions no methodology. Project consisted of a loan to the Housing Bank of Peru (BVP), the primary implementing agency, to provide housing, utility services, and basic infrastructure to lower income families in the damaged areas.  The Organismo Regional para el Desarollo de la Zona Afectada (ORDEZA) implemented most of the earthquake area development, while the Ministry of Housing (MOH) directed the flood zone activities. Under this project, 13 self-help housing projects were constructed, providing shelter for 780 families.  The project's self-help technique was very successful. Three levels of housing acceptance emerged, based on beneficiary participation and reactions; 25% was highly acceptable, 38% moderately so, and 37% of low acceptance.  In Chimbote, 85,000 people will benefit from the constructed basic water, sewage, and electrical services, to be active in 6/79; an incomplete basic infrastructure delayed service operation. Electro-Peru successfully conducted major electrification projects in the Trujillo Pueblo Jovenes, establishing 22,816 connections; minor problems, however, extended the construction period by 18 months.  The MOH-constructed water and sewer services in the flood areas of Piura and Chiclayo, at a comparatively cheaper cost per connection, due to favorable site conditions, a lower water table, and better soil.  Other successes included the BVP's institutional growth in development financing and ORDEZA's increased ability to design and implement projects such as this one. Rivalries between participating GOP agencies caused substantial implementation problems.  ORDEZA, however, skillfully minimized such problems by continuing project construction regardless of any balking of other agencies.  Early problems in establishing project priorities and allocating funds slowed initial implementation.  Also, the unavailibity of water in Trujillo prevented construction of a water system there.","Evaluation period: 8 Jun 1972-1 Apr 1979","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","4/1/1979 12:00:00 AM","","Low cost housing|Earthquakes|Disaster relief|Floods|HOUSING|Refugee relief|Refugees|SEWAGE|Urban areas|Electrification|Limited data","Peru","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAH218C1.pdf","557 KB","008591 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to develop indigenous university-based extension services to serve small LDC industries. Evaluation covers the life of the project, 1/74-1/79, and is based on visits by the AID project manager and a private small industry expert to the Korean and Philippine subprojects and on a review of documents prepared by project universities, especially the final report of the Georgia Institute of Technology (GIT), ""Stimulating the Growth of Small-Scale Industry."" The funds provided by the AID counterpart grants to LDC universities were augmented by in-kind and monetary contributions by the respective host country agencies.  These joint resources provided for technical management assistance; appropriate technology; education and training; data collection, research, publications, and information exchange; organization linkages; and audiovisual documentation. The evaluators found that job opportunities were created through the project, although they rejected the document estimates, as these neither included indirect employment generated nor adequately accounted for factors external to the project which may have stimulated employment.  The progress reflected in most of the firms visited suggested that the assisted firms did improve their viability, but that the degree to which this can be attributed to project elements is uncertain.  Promotion of the extension service potentials among appropriate government agencies was found to be deficient in both countries visited.  Thirdly, although the project was apparently successful in introducing the counterpart universities to small firm extension functions, the level of funding did not allow the development of self-sufficient LDC extension capabilities.  Also, while some alternate methodologies for strengthening counterpart agencies were field tested, little analysis was provided in the program documents to adequately evaluate their success or failure. Finally, a long-term linkage is definitely necessary between counterpart institutions for the success of this type of program. This report is appended to the Project Evaluation Summary of 6/9/80 (PD-AAH-297-A1).","Evaluation period: 1 Jan 1974-1 Jan 1979","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1979 12:00:00 AM","","National level|Educational cooperation|Small scale enterprises|Universities and colleges|International cooperation|Educational networking|Extension services|Industry|Industrial development|Institution building|EMPLOYMENT|Technical assistance","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAH297C1.pdf","2,777 KB","000080 - USAID.

"Evaluates project implemented by the Community and Family Study Center (CFSC) of the University of Chicago to strengthen international population communication and training.  Evaluation, conducted at the University of Chicago by a special evaluation team, is based on review of project documents and interviews with CFSC staff and students, and covers the period 9/1/77 to 4/78. Major CFSC activities were two ""action programs"" in eight Latin American and two African countries, and short-term training workshops, including regional workshops in Kenya and Guatemala, and country workshops in Liberia, the Gambia, and Egypt.  CFSC also assisted communications departments of universities in Mexico, the Philippines, Bangladesh, and Egypt to develop competent faculties to teach family planning communication on a local or regional basis.  In addition, CFSC published family planning communication literature of various types, promoted close coordination among agencies engaged in population communication activities, and offered short-term and MA and PHD level academic programs. The main weakness of the program is the lack of a system of follow-on and evaluation.  To rectify this, it is recommended that CFSC monitor new activities for up to four years and develop procedures for gathering feedback from participants who have returned home.  A total of 31 other recommendations are made.  Included among these are that:  (1) concentrated attention be given to no more than four countries a year; (2) that French and Spanish-speaking technicians be added to CFSC staff in view of the workshops in Latin America and Africa envisioned in the five-year plan; (3) that the present AID policy of not encouraging study for PHD degrees be reviewed; (4) that CFSC determine the causes of the scant use made of project-generated information; (5) that training manuals written for the level of the target population be translated as the need arises; (6) that AID and CFSC confer on alternative ways of promoting advanced training of family planning information personnel; and (7) that qualified and experienced personnel be added to CRSC's full-time staff.","Evaluation period: 1 Sep 1977-30 Apr 1978","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","3/1/1979 12:00:00 AM","","Population programs|Seminars|Graduate education|Information storage and retrieval systems|Population and demography|Organizations|Information dissemination|Family planning occupations|Medical education|Participants","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAG257A1.pdf","2,200 KB","001527 - American Health Association","","","English","application/pdf","Evaluation team|Indepth evaluation|Onsite evaluation","","KAREFA-SMART, JOHN|BUCHANAN, ELIZABETH J.|EBERSTADT, NICHOLAS N.","","16 Mar 1979","","GRANT NO.

"Evaluates subproject to construct 105 kms of coffee roads in Haiti as part of a project to increase the productivity of small coffee farmers. This special evaluation, prepared by Group Seven Associates, covers the period 7/30/74 to 8/31/79 and is based on a review of project documents and reference works, interviews with project personnel, field trips, and a sample survey of locals involved in the project.  Government of Haiti (GOH) support has been far less than anticipated, but with no adverse results. Major departures from project design -- which seems to have been physically and institutionally inappropriate for Haiti -- were reversal of the planned roles for GOH engineers and the U.S. consultant (whose work was very effective), and the exceeding of road standards.  Haitian design standards generally exceed those of Kenya and Honduras for labor-intensive (LI) construction, the method used on all five project roads. Although only two kms of roads are completely finished, roads overall are 43% complete.  Notable construction features include placing a macadam cover of broken stone over a Telford base of 15 cm stones; applying a choker mixture to bind the macadam; and providing drainage facilities.  The cost to date has been $455,000, or 67% of the original budget.  Evaluators' projected costs for road completion, for which no further U.S. technical assistance is needed, are 3.3 times those projected by the U.S. consultant. The sample survey revealed that the project had positive socioeconomic effects. Evaluators present a research plan for collecting further such data for future road projects. Whether project responsibility should be shifted to the Department of Public Works depends on GOH commitment to road projects and to LI methods.  The latter commitment, plus the avilability of a sound rural development strategy and of adequate leadership and layout personnel, will also determine the use of LI methods in future projects in Haiti. Eighteen recommendations are presented, ten of them project-specific, the rest pertaining to LI methods in general.","Evaluation period: 30 Jul 1974-31 Aug 1979","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","AID-521-C-103-T","","11/1/1979 12:00:00 AM","","Labor intensive technology|Road construction|Roads|Transportation system design|Rural areas|Sociological surveys|Small farms|Farmers|COFFEE|Access roads|Beneficiary interviews|Project change","Haiti","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAG287A1.pdf","4,779 KB","000541 - Group Seven Associates, Inc.","","","English","application/pdf","Evaluation team|Indepth evaluation","","FIKS, ALFRED I.|DAVIDSON, E.

"Evaluates project to institutionalize a nutrition planning process in Chile. This special evaluation, prepared by the contractor, the New Transcentury Foundation, covers the period from 5/78 to 9/79 and focuses on the performance of the Government of Chile (GOC) implementing agency, the Chilean National Commission for Food and Nutrition (CONPAN). The aggressive tactics of its early leaders established CONPAN's importance, but alienated many GOC agencies.  These leaders were removed and a GOC decree of 10/78 reduced CONPAN's national-level power, while leaving major opportunities for CONPAN to exercise influence at decentralized levels.  Its new leaders have adopted a more conciliatory approach to GOC agencies and a more realistic approach to nutrition planning. The 1979 implementation plan proposed to develop CONPAN's information and analysis capacity, as recommended in the last evaluation, by creating within CONPAN an analysis unit (still undeveloped after four years) and integrating it with CONPAN's existing information unit.  The plan also proposes a model regional nutrition planning project. Despite substantial staff changes, CONPAN has survived institutionally.  Its survival in the future, probably as a group of experts providing information and analysis to GOC agencies, will depend on whether CONPAN can:  (1) acquire a permanent staff dedicated to the basic tasks of analysis and planning (in contrast to past diversions into ""projects""); (2) link its information and analysis units with GOC policy needs (instead of trying to analyze everything); (3) develop a methodology for the regional project, including training of participating GOC agencies; and (4) integrate projects within institutional goals. In order to further CONPAN's survival in line with the above, thirteen recommendations are made to USAID, including an immediate further extension of the loan's terminal disbursement date (already extended to 10/80) by at least a year. Evaluation is prefaced by a PES factsheet (PD-AAF-911-B1) which states that, due to other constraints, the loan will not be extended as recommended.","Loan no. 513-T-066|Evaluation period: 1 MAY 1978-30 SEP 1979|Bibcode changed from 32 to 22, 2008-05-19","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","9/1/1979 12:00:00 AM","","Nutrition improvement|Health policy|Sector planning|Institution building|Nutritional analysis|Nutrition research|Management information systems|Project change|Limited data","Chile","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAF911F1.pdf","629 KB","000885 - New TransCentury Foundation","","","English","application/pdf","Pre evaluation data|Onsite evaluation","","PINES, JAMES M.","","1 Sep 1979","","","","NUTRITION PLANNING IN CHILE - THIRD ANNUAL EVALUATION OF CHILE NUTRITION DEVELOPMENT LOAN 513-T-066","","PD-AAF-911-F1","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc2ODc3","Chile","5130281"
"Evaluates project implemented by the International Project Association for Voluntary Sterilization (IPAVS) to advance the acceptance of voluntary sterilization as a basic component of family planning and health service programs throughout the developing world. Evaluation covers the period 9/12/75-9/30/79, and included discussions with the IPAVS staff, country visits, and examination of records and reports. Evaluation team concluded that IPAVS has successfully met the objective of increasing the acceptance of voluntary sterilization.  In the future, however, program emphasis should be shifted from demonstration type projects to more widespread provision of voluntary steriliztion services (VS) -- especially to the hard-to-reach rural poor.  This objective will require:  (1) more emphasis on simple technologies, such as minilaparotomy and vasectomy as contrasted with high technology laparoscopic procedures; (2) utilization of auxiliary and paramedical health workers in a team approach; and (3) increased integration of VS into government health programs.  All surgical and nursing personnel in the IPAVS-funded clinics were judged competent to perform in their jobs. However, field visits revealed that many projects suffered from funding delays.  IPAVS should investigate alternative mechanisms for disbursing funds, including increasing the initial disbursement of funds, transmitting funds through USAID channels, direct mailing of checks to grantees, and (for the refunding of current projects) sending unsigned project documents to the grantee at the same time they are sent to Washington.  Vasectomy remains considerably underutilized and underpromoted. Experience has shown that information and education campaigns invariably increase the use of male sterilization services.  The evaluation team recommends that all new grants for sterilization services include a vasectomy component when possible.  The evaluators note that IPAVS is a responsible organization with the technical and managerial capacity to expand; and, in fact, could double its grant program with a modest increase in staff.","Evaluation period: 1 Sep 1975-30 Sep 1979","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/pha/C-1100","","12/1/1979 12:00:00 AM","","FAMILY PLANNING|Family planning clinics|Family planning services|Delivery systems|Family planning promotion programs|Sterilization (birth control)|Private voluntary organizations","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAG259A1.pdf","5,124 KB","000262 - American Public Health Association","","","English","application/pdf","Evaluation team|Indepth evaluation|Onsite evaluation","","BHIWANDIWALA, POURU P.|BOYNTON, WILLARD H.|et al.","","20 Dec 1979","","","","EVALUATION REPORT : INTERNATIONAL PROJECT ASSOCIATION FOR VOLUNTARY STERILIZATION (9/17/79-10/15/79)","","PD-AAG-259-A1","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc2ODgz","Population and Humanitarian Assistance","9320968"
"Evaluates project to finance the construction of industrial estates in Antigua, Barbados, Belize, Dominica, Monteserrat, St. Kitts, and St. Lucia. This special evaluation covers the period up to 1/80 and was conducted on a country-by-country basis by survey teams. The Caribbean Development Bank (CDB) funded 11 sub-loans which contributed to the creation of 375,257 sq. ft. of factory space in the above countries. Presently, 26 firms are established within 345,257 sq. ft.  Of the total construction costs of $4.6 million, the CDB provided $4.2 million. Employment generation figures show that on the average, 172 sq. ft. per worker was attained.  This figure is considered low by international standards. In all countries, government support for industrial development projects has been evident, although incentives, while attracting local and regional investors, have lacked the outreach necessary for attracting multinational firms; and programs do not provide for worker assistance in new industries.  On-the-job training is the most effective means used by these governments.  Promotional and assistance functions within Barbados, Belize, and St. Lucia are both directed from either an international development corp., or a development finance corp.  In the other countries, these functions are divided.  The authors recommend consolidating these functions into one organization for better coordination. Concerning rental rates, subsidies should be eliminated and the rates increased.  Also, a uniform rental rate of $2.00 per sq. ft. for new and renewal leases and an annually revised rate review system should be instituted.  With the help of USAID experience, external promotional programs can be improved by establishing specific goals.  Project countries also lack the expertise for making demand projections regarding factory space.  USAID technical assistance in this area is essential and projections must be made for two-year periods beyond the planning of USAID and the CDB. Recommendations are also made for the CDB and USAID regarding inventory costs, building designs, and credit.","Evaluation period: Through 1 Jan 1980","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/SOD/PDC-C-0156","","5/1/1979 12:00:00 AM","","CREDIT|Financial institutions|Industrial development banks|Regional development|Development finance|EMPLOYMENT|Labor surveys|Industrial credit|Industrial development|Land development","Eastern Caribbean","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAG014A1.pdf","2,580 KB","000361 - Clapp and Mayne, Inc.","","","English","application/pdf","Indepth evaluation|Onsite evaluation","","","","1 May 1979","","","","EVALUATION OF INDUSTRIAL ESTATE LOANS PROVIDED BY CARIBBEAN DEVELOPMENT BANK","","PD-AAG-014-A1","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc2ODg2","Caribbean Regional","5380003"
"Evaluates project to provide village level agricultural extension services in 33 provinces in Thailand.  This special evaluation covers the period 12/76-11/79 and is based on discussions with key personnel, on-site visits, review of project reports, and random surveys of project participants. As of 10/31/79, the training programs for the tambon agents, amphoe officers, subject matter specialists (SMS's), and trainers were implemented in 25 of the 33 provinces, a total of 8,540 weeks of training were provided, and all training had either been completed or scheduled for completion.  The program was closely adhered to, despite the late arrival of the consultants, its emphasis on theory rather than practical skills, and on quantity rather than quality and the lack of significant farmer-level training aids.  Recruitment and quality of extension personnel was only fair, however.  Shortages of SMS's and tambon agents impeded the provision of extension services to farmers. Routine interaction among farmers, extension personnel, and research scientists did not occur as planned, although efforts were made in this direction.  Final figures concerning an anticipated 50% increase in crop yields were not available. Spot readings, however, showed that harvest and income increased over 1977 and 1978. Recommendations were made to:  (1) expand the time allocated to SMS's for subdistrict and demonstration plot visits; (2) increase the number of SMS's at the local and regional levels; (3) extend the audiovisual consultant services by six months and the life of the project by one year; (4) provide training for all contact farmers; (5) emphasize both method and result demonstrations during training; (6) extend training to the remaining targeted provinces; (7) assign new staff to their home regions; (8) reexamine the tambon agent-to-farm family ratio; (9) expand the training time spent on field observations and practical exercises; (10) provide annual refresher training and training in personnel management and supervision; (11) conduct a pilot trial of the video tape recorder; and (12) review the validity and utility of the crop modules.","Loan no. 493-T-019|Evaluation period: 1 Dec 1976-30 Nov 1979","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","12/1/1979 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural extension|Agricultural extension training|Agricultural management|Agricultural training|Demonstration|Farms|Agricultural production|CROP YIELD|Audiovisual educational materials|Video tape recorders|Farmer training|Beneficiary interviews|Sampling method","Thailand","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAF879C1.pdf","1,791 KB","008613 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to develop a community-based integrated rural development program (CBIRD) undertaken by Save the Children Foundation (SCF) in Aceh, Indonesia.  Evaluation covers the period 1976-1979 and is based on a field visit and a review of project reports and documentation. To date, CBIRD efforts have been concentrated in Tangse, a large subdistrict of 26 villages.  When it became apparent that the primary vehicles for organizing the rural poor, the community development committee (CDC), were being dominated by traditional leadership elements, two major changes were made to increase the participation of the poor:  (1) expansion of management training to include the poor involved in working groups; and (2) the formation of village-level development committees (VCDC's), each including, for the first time, a representative from the poorest element of society.  The VCDC's assumed greater operational authority, and the role of the CDC's changed from decision-maker to coordinator.  Funding was dispersed among all participating villages to reverse the concentration of efforts in a few areas.  By mid-1979, VCDC's were operating in each of the 15 villages in which CBIRD was functioning.  There has also been a shift in emphasis from long-term projects to those immediately impacting on the poor. SCF's open approach to management has maximized communication, especially with villagers.  SCF has also fostered informal relationships with both villagers and Government officials.  The latter have responded by greater support and cooperation for the CBIRD program.  These developments have been possible because of the small size and the relative isolation of Aceh. Although the project has been a success, SCF should face seriously now the problem of program coordination after it leaves, particularly since dynamic management appears to be the key to replicability. Also needed in the log run will be cost-benefit analyses of the 44 currently ongoing projects.","Evaluation period: 1 Jan 1976-1 Nov 1979","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/DSAN-C-0065","","11/1/1979 12:00:00 AM","","Community development|Community leadership|Community participation|Rural development|Integrated rural development|Villages|Private voluntary organizations|Technical assistance","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAG261B1.pdf","1,317 KB","006727 - Development Alternatives, Inc.

"Evaluates project undertaken by the Battelle Memorial Institute to assist in the development of population policies in LDC's. Evaluation is based on visits to Battelle Offices in Washington, D.C.; Seattle, Washington; and Lima, Peru. To date, Battelle's Population and Policy Development Program has been involved in 14 countries.  Battelle has assigned technical advisors to participating LDC's and subcontracted with indigenous researchers and institutions to carry out population policy development activities.  In all, Battelle has considered 47 subcontracts, with 15 having completed the review process. Although advising numerous changes, the evaluation team recommends that the project be extended to 6/82.  The contract should be amended to exclude the reference to an 18-month implementation cycle (three LDC's per cycle).  References to research projects on elite opinions should also be deleted.  The diversity of views within A.I.D. on population policy strategy was reflected in its management of the Battelle contract.  A.I.D. should clarify what role it expects Battelle and this project to play in the development of LDC population policies, as well as take immediate steps to increase its monitoring of the project.  The team recommends that Battelle concentrate its efforts in nine countries, to be selected in accordance with explicit criteria and in coordination with A.I.D.  In addition, Battelle should prepare detailed policy development strategy reports for each country.  The evaluation team's site visit to Peru revealed that Battelle needs a stronger ""presence"" in Peru.  Battelle should assign someone who can work on a regular basis with A.I.D., AMIDEP (The Interdisciplinary Association for Population Research and Teaching), and other public and private sector officials. The 20-30% field time guideline used by A.I.D. regional bureaus might be appropriate in this instance.  The evaluation team rates the Battelle Fellows Program as low-priority, and recommends either that it be more directly linked to on-going country efforts or that it be discontinued.","Evaluation period: 1 Jun 1977-30 Jun 1979","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/pha-C-1100","","4/1/1979 12:00:00 AM","","Population programs|Population policy|Population planning|Demographic research","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAH306A1.pdf","4,155 KB","000262 - American Public Health Association","","","English","application/pdf","Indepth evaluation|Onsite evaluation|Evaluation team","","PRESSER, HARRIET B.|MERRICK, THOMAS|BAKER, RAYMOND","","12 Apr 1979","","","","Population Policy Analysis","","PD-AAH-306-A1","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc2ODk1","Population and Humanitarian Assistance","9320635"
"Evaluates project to provide mineral intakes for grazing ruminants in tropical areas of Latin America, Asia, and Africa through the development of efficient mineral supplementation regimes.  This special evaluation covers the period since project initiation in 1974 to 6/79, with a focus on areas identified for further study in the previous review of 1976. Through the excellent work of the University of Florida (UOF), the project has been a success.  Significant research has begun in 16 countries. Mineral deficiency and toxicity surveys are underway, and mineral supplementation efficiency is being explored in many locations. Extensive data indicate low correlations among soil-plant-animal for minerals studied (Fe, Mn, Na, Zn).  Liver samples collected from the most productive animals toward the end of the wet season were often found best for determining the mineral status of grazing animals. In experiments in five Latin American countries, mineral supplementation increased calving percentage from 50% to 75%.  A doubling of weight gains were reported in one experiment. Preliminary cost-benefit data indicate returns of at least double the investment by correcting mineral deficiencies.  It was found that many mineral supplements sold in Latin American countries are of poor quality, particularly in regard to phosphorus content, and do not meet label guarantees.  Research programs to develop methodologies applicable to host countries have begun in three Asian countries. In countries where project activities are far along (e.g., Brazil, Costa Rica, and Columbia), research responsibility should gradually be transferred to in-country scientists, following an evaluation of the country's scientific and political readiness. In countries where the project is still developing, technican training and technology support will be necessary for program success. Team recommendations include a two-year extension of the project beyond the proposed 11/80 termination date in order to develop in-country research capabilities; and joint consideration by AID and UOF of a similar and expanded program in Africa and Asia.","Evaluation period: 1 Nov 1977-30 Jun 1979","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","6/1/1979 12:00:00 AM","","LIVESTOCK|Animal nutrition|Forage crops|Feed supplements|Agricultural research|Agricultural training|Mineral resources|Natural resource inventories|Technical assistance|Project change","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAG215C1.pdf","467 KB","","","","English","application/pdf","Logframe change|Pre evaluation data|Multi country evaluation|Evaluation team|Indepth evaluation","","BECK, GLEN H.|SALAZAR, JUAN|et al.","","1 Jun 1979","","","","DEVELOPMENT OF EFFICIENT MINERAL SUPPLEMENTATION REGIMES FOR GRAZING RUMINANTS IN THE TROPICS","","PD-AAG-215-C1","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc2ODk4","Technical Assistance","9310600"
"Evaluates two major activities of the formal education element of the non-formal education project in Honduras:  the Ministry of Education (MOE) programs in in-service teacher training and in training in research and evaluation.  Evaluation covers the period 7/78-11/79 and is based on reviews of project documentation, onsite visits, discussions with key project personnel, and questionnaires administered to the in-service teacher training group (ITTG). The objectives of the two programs have been achieved.  The in-service teacher training program prepared 24 experienced Honduran teachers to provide in-service training for other teachers through an intensive 18-month training program.  A total of six field trips were made, during which time the ITTG provided onsite in-service training to 657 rural primary school teachers in 157 schools.  Results show that improvements were made in the schools and that the climate for change was initiated.  In the program of training in research and evaluation, a research team composed of eight experienced Honduran teachers completed two years of intensive training in research methodology and evaluation techniques.  Since 7/78, the team completed nine research assignments, contacting a total of 442,438 persons. The team was highly productive and competent and proved that the MOE indeed possesses a research capability. While both the ITTG and the research team contain highly motivated, dedicated people, their low salaries threaten job commitment.  In addition, the ITTG needs more expertise in curriculum, and the Research Team needs training in inferential statistics. Recommendations are made to:  (1) increase both programs; (2) integrate the ITTG program into the normal schools, include trainees from new regions, improve the training facilities, and modify programs in regions which lack Spanish language proficiency; (3) establish a Research Group system to coordinate and prioritize work; and (4) institutionalize continuous in-service teacher training. A bibliography, budget information, and questionnaires are appended.","Loan no. 522-V-031|Evaluation period: 1 Jul 1978-21 Nov 1979","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/SOD/PDC-C-0158","","11/1/1979 12:00:00 AM","","Institution building|Primary education|On the job training|Teacher training|Mobile units|Educational research|Technical training|Indigenous education|Beneficiary interviews","Honduras","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAS009.pdf","12,982 KB","000436 - Development Associates, Inc.","","","English","application/pdf","Indepth evaluation|Final EOPS|Onsite evaluation","","MAXWELL, MARY E.","","21 Nov 1979","","","","EVALUATION OF THE FORMAL EDUCATION COMPONENT OF THE NON-FORMAL RURAL EDUCATION PROJECT","","PD-AAS-009","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc2OTAz","Honduras","5220108"
"Evaluates project to increase small farmer production in Haiti.  This special evaluation covers the period 1975-4/79 and was based on onsite interviews conducted by the Credit Union National Assoc. (CUNA) of Washington, D.C.  It focuses on the performance of the Bureau de Credit Agricole (BCA) in implementing the project's credit component. Although BCA's growth has been impressive, CUNA contends that institutional problems affecting the project do exist.  The rapid influx of new societies joining the project and requesting traditional loans has taxed the BCA's administrative and financial capabilities and has contributed to the attrition of societies from the PPC (technical aid lending) project component.  Regarding loan portfolio, CUNA concluded that loan documentation and management procedures were outdated and inefficient, loan processing periods excessive, and loan delinquency controls inadequate.  Concerning financing, BCA deficits have required constant Government of Haiti (GOH) and USAID financial support to satisfy short-term needs, yet no long-term strategies have been drafted. Organizationally, the BCA lacks functional specificity. CUNA believes that BCA's PPC services have been hindered by the lack of related agency support activities.  Since no cost/return studies have been conducted and research on coffee production has been minimal, BCA's provision of credit has not been based on solid economic information. Farm extension has been sporadic, farm input deliveries unpredictable, storage and marketing facilities inadequate, and no price stablization programs have been enacted. Two alternative credit systems, the Society Federation (SF) and the Caisses Populaires (CP), were advocated by CUNA.  The SF would organize the societies into several unions and would be run by an elected council, which would be responsible for the planning and financial management of societies.  The BCA would give the council technical and credit assistance when requested.  Regarding the CP, each CP would have its own administrative, credit, and surveillance councils which would relieve the BCA of administrative responsibilities.","Evaluation period: 1 Jan1975-31 Dec1979","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","4/1/1979 12:00:00 AM","","Small farms|Farmers|CREDIT|Agricultural credit|Agricultural extension|Agricultural inputs|Agricultural production credit|Credit unions|Financial management|Financial institutions|Short term credit|Financial resources|Credit bureaus","Haiti","","","000418 - Credit Union National Association, Inc.

"Evaluates project to improve incomes of small coffee producers in Haiti through the establishment of a cooperative marketing system.  This special evaluation, written in French by a contractor, covers the period 9/75-1/79; no methodology is specified. In the last few years, coffee production in Haiti has declined, reducing small producer profits and damaging the country's balance of trade, largely due to the inefficiency and high costs (e.g., taxes) of the existing coffee marketing system.  The Small Farmer Marketing Project (SFMP) was designed to raise the incomes of 384,000 coffee producers by establishing producer cooperatives and by creating a National Center for Coffee Marketing (CNCC).  Emphasis was placed on increasing washed coffee production (the more profitable coffee type, currently only 8% of the total produced), improving the quality of all coffee exported, and promoting the sale and export of large quantities of this standardized, high quality coffee.  Under the cooperative system, producers sell their product to the cooperatives at a pre-determined price. The cooperatives then market the coffee through the CNCC, the mediator between the producer and the importer. The CNCC was empowered to fix the purchase price according to world market conditions and to buy quantities of coffee not absorbed by the cooperatives. Problems noted included the constraint on washed coffee production posed by the lack of adequate roads; the incidence of dishonesty in producers' conduct; the lack of export marks for special coffees; and the faulty bagging system.  Some recommendations are:  (1) a study should be done on the possibility of fermenting and preparing coffee (both washed and natural) on site rather than shipping the beans to a processing center; (2) the cooperatives should offer credit to their members; (3) the cooperative system should make adjustments for the eventual export quotas which will take effect under the 1976 International Accord on Coffee; and (4) CNCC export on consignment should be eliminated in order to avoid possible losses.","Evaluation period: 1 Sep1975-31 Jan1979","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID-521-C-65-T","","1/1/1979 12:00:00 AM","","Coffee|Small farms|Farmers|Agricultural production|Marketing|Cooperatives|Balance of trade|Exports|Export promotion|Agricultural prices|Food processing|Agricultural product marketing","Haiti","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAD022A1.pdf","28,606 KB","","","","French","application/pdf","Indepth evaluation|Onsite evaluation","","Castro, Alvaro J.","","31 Jan 1979","","","","Projet de commercialisation cafeiere","Coffee commercialization project","PD-AAD-022-A1","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc2OTY1","Haiti","5210083"
"Evaluates CARE project to distribute PL-480 Title II commodities to children in Costa Rica.  This onsite evaluation covers the period 5/78-11/79 and is based primarily on individual interviews. Evaluation emphasis is on operations during the last four years of the 25-year project, which distributed food through Government of Costa Rica (GOCR) primary/pre-school and maternal feeding programs.  A major failing was the inadequate inspection by CARE of GOCR redistribution at the feeding center level -- only the school feeding programs in one province were visited in the last year and a half and actions were rarely taken on problems noted in inspection visits.  Many ineligible adults in old-age homes received the commodities for five or more years. Lack of CARE program planning inhibited adaptation to Costa Rican needs; for example, the high-protein, low-calorie foods supplied prevented the attainment of a balanced diet for recipients. Lastly, the project failed to reach children in the 0-3 age group despite the finding that 80% of all deaths due to malnutrition occur to this group. Project-supported nutrition centers neglected isolated rural areas and reached only 10% of the targeted age group.  However, during the life of the project, the number of malnourished children dropped from 54% to 44% and permanent, indigenous-supported child feeding programs were established. Specific recommendations are:  (1) CARE's inspection should be geographically broadened, include all feeding programs, and prevent redistribution of food to old age homes; (2) the justification for primary school feeding programs should be re-examined and a new emphasis placed on take-home food programs to target the greater needs of the 0-3 year old child and the pregnant or lactating mother; (3) the composition of Title II foods should be altered to supply more high calorie foods; (4) more functional and acceptable foods for household use should be developed. CARE should develop annual schedules of inspections, an improved beneficiary reporting system, and a new program description if it is to continue administering PL-480 in Costa Rica.","AID/Costa Rica purchase order #105-79A|Evaluation period: 1 May 1978-31 Nov 1979","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","11/1/1979 12:00:00 AM","","Private voluntary organizations|Food for Peace|Child feeding programs|Child nutrition|School feeding programs|Food aid programs|Maternal nutrition|Maternal child health care|Fortified foods|Infant nutrition|Sampling method","Costa Rica","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAH201B1.pdf","2,292 KB","","","","English","application/pdf","Country program evaluation|Pre evaluation data|Indepth evaluation|Final EOPS|Onsite evaluation","","DEL BOSQUE SCHOUTEN, PRISCILLA","","28 Nov 1979","","","","PL-480 TITLE II PROGRAM SPECIAL EVALUATION","","PD-AAH-201-B1","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc2OTc3","Costa Rica","515980053"
"Evaluates project to develop methods to control vertebrate pests that destroy crops in LDC's.  Evaluation covers the period 10/1/78-9/30/79, and was conducted by three livestock scientists from the U.S. government and the private sector.  No methodology is indicated. As a result of this project, the Denver Wildlife Research Center (DWRC) published over 200 technical reports on the results of their research and distributed them to cooperating LDC's.  Host country researchers co-authored many of these technical reports.  DWRC also explored new methodologies for damage assessment, such as producing index surveys for rodent damage in transplanted rice and bird damage to corn.  Predetermined goals achieved in the Philippines were improved anti-coagulant baiting methods for rice field rodent control, and pest control research and training which was incorporated into the National Crop Protection Center's Program. It was determined in the Sudan that currently ineffective bird control programs could be greatly improved by using methiocarb repellent head sprays. In Bangladesh, the Agricultural Research Institute formed a Vertebrate Pest Division; training sessions for government personnel were held; and a wheat rodent damage survey was completed.  In Haiti, information was assembled on vertebrate pests and related agricultural problems. DWRC TDY activities were important in evaluations, training, liaison/coordination and cooperative studies with international research organizations.  The need for DWRC personnel has decreased as target countries, like the Philippines, establish their own research and training to respond to the vertebrate-pest problems. It is recommended that USAID continue to assist DWRC field and laboratory research, evaluation, training, and information dissemination and to act as liaison between DWRC and field personnel. Specific needs resulting from this project are identified in the toxicological, chemical, pest, and environmental analyses of this paper. This report is attached to Project PES (PN-AAG-209-B1).","Evaluation period: 1 Oct 1978-30 Sep 1979","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","12/1/1979 12:00:00 AM","","PEST CONTROL|Rodents|Birds|Crop losses|Food losses|Institution building|Reference libraries|Agriculture|Agricultural research|Agricultural training|Agrochemicals|Technical assistance","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAG209C1.pdf","320 KB","001244 - U.S. Dept. of Agriculture","","","English","application/pdf","Multi country evaluation|Evaluation team|Indepth evaluation","","FITZWATER, WILLIAM D.|GRAY, ROBERT E.|LOVINGER, KING L.","Animal nutrition and health","1 Dec 1979","","PASA/ID/TAB-473-67","","CONTROL OF VERTEBRATE PESTS - RESEARCH REVIEW REPORT","","PD-AAG-209-C1","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc2OTky","Technical Assistance","9310473"
"Evaluates the socioeconomic impact of on-going project to build farm to market roads in Kenya.  On-site evaluation covers the period 1/1/77-10/1/79 and is based primarily on interviews with intended beneficiaries. The evaluators could not determine the project's actual benefits because most roads are still under construction or only newly completed. Local persons hired to work on road construction and maintenance are the clearest direct beneficiaries.  About 92% of these workers are men; most are less than 30 years old, own little or no land, and live near the work site.  Wages provided to these people will improve their purchasing power and strengthen the local economies. The evaluators surveyed local residents as to the benefits they expect.  Most people did not see increased agricultural production -- the project's goal -- as the primary benefit, but rather increased access to primary schools and health services. (Project personnel judge that agricultural benefits will be more evident in the future and that increased access to health facilities will not automatically improve the people's health, since health needs are more preventive that curative). Distribution of benefits cannot yet be precisely determined, but it is clear that the greater share will go to those who control local resources.  Extra efforts must be made to ensure that the targeted group--the rural poor--also benefit from the roads. Local participation, especially in site selection, is emphasized in the project, but ineffective local organization and reluctance of government officials to share decisionmaking authority has limited local action.  The selection process is deemed fairly efficient, but new economic and social indicators are needed. It is recommended that more women be included on development committees at every level; roads be coordinated with other development projects, especially forestry; efforts be made to utilize existing local knowledge; local needs be recognized; and local participation be increased.  District Development Committees should incorporate additional information categories into their plans to allow more extensive use.","Evaluation period: 1 Jan 1977-1 Oct 1979","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/afr-C-1529","","10/1/1979 12:00:00 AM","","Roads|Road construction|Road maintenance|Labor intensive technology|Farm to market roads|Integrated rural development|Community development|Appropriate technology|Rural areas|Beneficiary count|Beneficiary interviews|Sampling method","Kenya","","","006434 - Devres, Inc.","","","English","","Evaluation team|Onsite evaluation","","BROKENSHA, DAVID W.|MOOCK, PETER|RILEY, BERNARD","","18 Oct 1979","","","","KENYA RURAL ACCESS ROADS AND GRAVELLING, BRIDGES AND CULVERTS PROGRAM","","PD-AAG-051-A1","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc3MDEw","Kenya","6150170"
"Evaluates project to improve small farmer coffee production in Haiti. This special evaluation covers the period 1975-11/79 and is based upon onsite interviews with project personnel. Given the piecemeal nature of recent project evaluations and the project's expected termination in 1980, evaluators focus attention on the project's organization and major activities -- research, extension, and training -- to determine the feasibility of further U.S. assistance. The 10/78 transfer of extension and research functions to the Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources and Rural Development (DARNDR) strengthened project management considerably, although DARNDR is still evolving.  To date, seven coffee centers used for crop demonstrations, trials, and fertilizer distribution, have been built and three more are to be completed.  The centers, however, have not been fully utilized because the Agronomic Research Service (SERA) has yet to conduct adaptive research due to the lack of a vitally-needed coffee agronomist.  The absence of research has, in turn, caused extension efforts to be inadequate. The extension problem is compounded by the large number of coffee farmers and the uncertainty of land tenure, although extension activities increased in the past year after an energetic director was assigned to DARNDR's Coffee Project Unit at Damien.  Poor pay and isolated project locations are also constraining research and extension efforts.  Because of early delays in constructing the coffee centers, the Food and Agricultural Organization was able to conduct only on-the-spot counselling during the project's first two years and later terminated support for the project altogether. Formal training has been minimal, although the training of extensionists has recently increased. In addition to several specific recommendations, evaluators recommend that a team approach be used to integrate the project's various components.  They also recommend that prior to further assistance A.I.D. examine whether increasing coffee production is the best way to help Haiti economically and whether Haitian small farmers will respond to further U.S. assistance.","Evaluation period: 1 Jan1975-23 Nov1979","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/PDC/SOD-C-0218","","11/1/1979 12:00:00 AM","","Farmers|Small farms|Agricultural research|Agricultural production credit|Agricultural product marketing|Agricultural inputs|Agricultural extension|Agricultural development|Agricultural education|Fertilizers|Technicians|Technical training|Indigenous education|Agricultural production|COFFEE|Food processing facilities|National level","Haiti","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAC101A1.pdf","1,724 KB","000819 - Multinational Agribusiness Systems, Inc.","","","English","application/pdf","Pre evaluation data|Indepth evaluation|Onsite evaluation","","","","23 Nov 1979","","","","EVALUATION OF THE SMALL FARMER DEVELOPMENT PROJECT - HAITI","","PD-AAC-101-A1","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc3MDIz","Haiti","5210073"
"Evaluates project to promote private enterprise in the Entente countries of Togo, Benin, Upper Volta, Ivory Coast, and Niger under the aegis of the Council of the Entente States (CES).  This special outside evaluation covers the period 1968-1978 and was based on 9 weeks of in-country field work. The program has developed hundreds of successful private entrepreneurs of all ages and sexes and has thus attained its objective. A wide range of activities was supported in such areas as construction, manufacturing, transportation, education and health, agro-industry, and artisanal work.  A comprehensive list of recommendations is offered. (1) In regard to the project's central participants, CES should receive institution building assistance, especially through counterpart training aimed at Africanizing CES.  Development Banks should maintain their role but changes should be made to avoid present difficulties of Project Office (PO) personnel in contacting and assisting loan recipients. Promotion Centers must become an integral part of the program. Commercial Banks should be included in the program to facilitate lending to project clients, a central program objective.  (2) Regarding other donors, contacts and coordination of activities at the local and managing levels are essential. (3) More control over lending is needed. Auditing borrowers and monitoring repayments will guard against loan misuse and defaulting.  (4) A project re-emphasis based upon a priority selection of target activities is needed to insure program success.  (5) PO should be reorganized and better equipped (e.g., with communication facilities) to improve its efficiency.  The PO should assign an administrative officer in the PO to perform such duties as keeping expense and budget records and supervising and training the PO staff. (6) Increased emphasis on non-financial assistance is suggested.  (7) Institution building efforts, including Africanizing the PO staff, should be initiated.  (8) Continuation of the program is strongly recommended under the monitorship of a single AID/W officer, who should also prepare proposals for its replication elsewhere.","Evaluation period: 1 Jan1968-31 Dec1978","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1979 12:00:00 AM","","Banks|Small scale enterprises|CREDIT|Rural areas|Business enterprises|Urban areas|Industry|Indigenous education|Auditing|Participants|Private enterprises|Institution building","Central Africa|West Africa","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAH225A1.pdf","5,824 KB","001897 - International Development Consultants, Inc.","","","English","application/pdf","Indepth evaluation|Onsite evaluation","","TERREL, C.

"Evaluates project to assist the Nicaraguan Development Foundation (FUNDE) provide credit to low-income cooperatives in Nicaragua. This special evaluation covers FUNDE from its inception in 1969 through 6/80 and was based upon a review of files, interviews and site visits. The FUNDE cooperative system presents an extraordinarily effective and proven vehicle for meeting the wide-ranging needs of its members. FUNDE's activities, which have assisted 46,020 people, have been geared toward the rural poor (averaging $500 per capita), particularly those involved in small (on- and off-farm) enterprise development.  FUNDE has supported community activities and its affiliates have become an effective vehicle for savings mobilization and rural capital formation. Donor financing has been vital to this operation, providing over 90% of FUNDE's costs. FUNDE's highly professional and extremely well-managed staff maintains good channels of communication with its affiliates and is flexible, enabling FUNDE to respond quickly to cooperative needs. FUNDE's Research and Development Center is especially valuable given FUNDE's rapid growth, but is deficient in gathering socioeconomic data and developing long-range planning. Its Training Center is effective, although it excludes non-FUNDE members. FUNDE affiliates, while barely viable financially -- in 1979, only 34 of 58 cooperatives showed net surpluses -- display good leadership and management characteristics. The evaluation also covers FUNDE's technical assistance, commercialization, housing, audit, and rural family care components. Although demand for FUNDE's services has accelerated and expanded into new areas such as agriculture, commerce, and housing, FUNDE's growth is constrained by a lack of personnel and financial resources. Over the next 5 years, FUNDE is faced with a budget shortfall of $665,000.  Besides capital and budget assistance, FUNDE also needs assistance in finance and organization and in developing, for purposes of diversification, a multi-service model based on the primary credit cooperative system. Support through a three-phase consortium approach is recommended.","Evaluation period: 1 Jan 1969-31 Dec 1979","Special Evaluation","Documents","524-80-150","","1/1/1979 12:00:00 AM","","Small farms|Farmers|Small scale enterprises|Business enterprises|Rural development|Housing|Cooperatives|Financing|Housing cooperatives|Management operations|Management training|Financial institutions|Credit cooperatives|Community development|Agricultural credit|CREDIT|SAVINGS|Private voluntary organizations|Institution building","Nicaragua","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAF971A1.pdf","4,263 KB","","","","English","application/pdf","Indepth evaluation|Onsite evaluation","","HEARD, JOHN","","1979","","USAID/Nicaragua 80-2","","NICARAGUAN DEVELOPMENT FOUNDATION","","PD-AAF-971-A1","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc3MDky","Nicaragua","5240156"
"Evaluates project to assist Mission personnel assess the impact of rural development (RD) projects on fertility in LDC's.  This special outside evaluation covers the period from the project's inception in 1977 to 10/27/79 and is based on document review and staff interviews. Seven state-of-the-art papers (SOAP's) on the link between RD projects and fertility were written. A brief, yet concise summary of the SOAP's was also produced but has not yet been distributed to Mission personnel.  Problems associated with the SOAP's were a lack of mutual cross-referencing; neglect of Latin American Spanish-language literature; and the futile attempts to conform their format to the RD Office's (RDO) project categories.  The compilation of a list of 90 potential consultants to assist in research and writing impact statements was begun.  Staff from the Research Triangle Institute (RTI) identified potential sites for phase two case studies and data analysis. The planned manual containing guidelines for Mission personnel was considered unfeasible. As to the project's institutional aims, eight minority scholars from the Southeast Consortium for International Development (SECID), under RTI auspices, helped write the SOAP's.  A peer review panel (PRP) was established to ensure that RD officers translate cross-disciplinary population work into useful programs. Cooperation between RDO and the Population Office in project management was not close, with RDO initiating most activities. Recommendations include:  (1) advancing to phase two of the project, setting highest priority on further identifying the links between RD and fertility and lowest priority on developing a network of consultants; (2) re-evaluating the feasibility of the manual noted above; (3) continuing collaboration between RTI and SECID; (4) making PRP an advisory committee; (5) reviewing the SOAP summary report in a conference for PRP and SOAP authors; (6) not requiring that the SOAP format conform to RDO project categories; (7) concentrating case studies and data analysis in a few African countries; and (8) RDO's maintaining full responsibility for project management.","Evaluation period: 1 Jan1977-27 Oct1979","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/pha/C-1100","","9/1/1979 12:00:00 AM","","Rural development|Fertility|Determinants of fertility|State-of-the-art reports|Demographic analysis|Limited data","","","","000262 - American Public Health Association","","","English","","Interim evaluation","","NESS, GAYL D.","","18 Sep 1979","","","","MIDTERM EVALUATION OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT AND FERTILITY","","PD-AAC-102","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc3MDk1","Technical Assistance","9311170"
"Evaluates Bureau of the Census (BUCEN) performance in a project providing A.I.D. with computation and analysis of population data. Evaluation covers the period 1/1/78-4/26/79 and is based on a review of project documents and reports and interviews with A.I.D. and BUCEN personnel. BUCEN's work is generally high quality and up-to-date, as is evident from its 1977 report, ""World Population"".  BUCEN has a very comprehensive collection of world population data and has established a network of international contacts. Nevertheless, BUCEN should not be expected to provide an ""early warning system"" of fertility and mortality changes. Thus far, 10 country profiles have been published and four drafted.  Although these profiles contain much useful information, they could be substantially improved by:  (1) modifying them to reflect the size and importance of the individual countries; (2) including several pages of analysis for each country -- summarizing demographic levels and trends, and relating data to changes in socioeconomic development and availability of family planning services; (3) reducing the number of ""adjustments"" of total population; (4) introducing more flexibility, with the nature of the profile dependent upon the kinds of data available for an individual country; (5) changing the procedures for deriving short-term projections (rather than basing them on long-term multiple projects, BUCEN should extrapolate from current data on vital rates and population growth); (6) evaluating the quality of census data in more depth than is possible with the Age-Sex Accuracy Index and reporting these checks fully in an appendix; (7) reducing preparation time; and (8) determining exactly what kind of information is needed and by whom.  In addition, BUCEN should devote more attention to urban growth and manpower problem; and should take steps to improve the cost effectiveness of many of its activities.  With regard to the AID/BUCEN working relationship, the authors feel that both parties have exaggerated their differences and call for more understanding on the part of the Office of Population and greater flexibility from BUCEN.","Evaluation period: 1 Jan1978-26 Apr1979","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/pha/C-1100","","1/1/1979 12:00:00 AM","","Population and demography|Information storage and retrieval systems|DEMOGRAPHY|Population programs","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAC103.pdf","1,060 KB","000262 - American Public Health Association","","","English","application/pdf","Evaluation team|Indepth evaluation|Onsite evaluation","","KANTNER, JOHN F.|KIRK, DUDLEY|et al.","","1979","","","","EVALUATION OF THE CENSUS BUREAU'S COMPUTATION AND ANALYSIS OF POPULATION DATA PROJECT (4/26/79-7/18/79)","","PD-AAC-103","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc3MTE5","Population and Humanitarian Assistance","9320649"
"Evaluates project to increase seed production in Tanzania. This special evaluation covers the period 1/1/70-4/1/79 and is based on onsite visits and discussions with project personnel. Tanzania's seed industry, like that of most developing countries, acquires the majority of its seed from previous plantings.  Commercial seed is also used, but its quality from the standpoint of purity and germination is often questionable. The Tanzanian seed industry consists of five major components:  research development of breeder seed; the expansion of pure lines of the improved varieties on seed farms; certified seed production, processing, and distribution by the Tanzania Seed Certification Agency (TanSeed); purity and quality control by Government seed laboratories and the Official Seed Certification Agency (TOSCA); and distribution to farmers by regional district governments, the Tanzania Rural Development Bank (TRDB), and other institutions. The Government of Tanzania and USAID have been primarily concerned with the development of foundation seed farms, TanSeed operations, seed laboratories, and TOSCA.  This report includes a chapter on each of those components, describing their current situation, major constraints, and recommendations.  Recommendations regarding changes to the National Seeds Act are also included.  Concerning the project as a whole, the evaluation team recommends that only three seed farms (the Arusha, Dabaga, and Msimba farms) be developed and that these farms be given first priority.  Since the Dabaga farm is new, immediate steps should be taken to provide adequate staff, staff housing, and detailed planning for the construction of service buildings and implementation of erosion control measures.  Also, the National Seed Laboratory and its two branches should be placed in full operation as soon as possible. Considerable investment in facilities and highly qualified expatriate assistance will be required. TanSeed should be upgraded to handle all phases of seed certification.  There will be a continuing need for manpower training and technical assistance in the areas of research, extension, and marketing.","Evaluation period: 1 Jan 1970-1 Apr 1979","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/afr-C-1139","","4/1/1979 12:00:00 AM","","Seeds|Seed testing|Distribution|Agribusiness|Institution building|Agricultural inputs|Agricultural training|Agricultural technicians|Agricultural extension|Agricultural research|Agricultural product marketing","Tanzania","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAG373A1.pdf","5,278 KB","001459 - University of Missouri at Columbia","","","English","application/pdf","Evaluation team|Indepth evaluation|Onsite evaluation","","HAGAN, ALBERT R.|BEVINS, ROBERT J.|et al.","","1 Apr 1979","","","","TANZANIA SEED INDUSTRY SURVEY - REPORT OF EVALUATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS","","PD-AAG-373-A1","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc3MTM0","Tanzania","6210092"
"Evaluates project to improve nutrition in Haiti. Onsite evaluation covers the period 10/1/76-12/31/78 and is based on project documentation.  This special evaluation, attached to PES (PD-AAF-559-A1), focuses on the performance of the nutrition rehabilitation and education centers for mothers and children (CERN's) established in the project's first stage. Utilization of the CERN's was far below both the maximum and the expected rates.  Only 59 children were nutritionally rehabilitated and 181 children protected via mother education -- less than 60% of the maximum projected totals.  The per capita cost of $42.40 was $18.00 higher than projected.  Moreover, the most nutritionally vulnerable children are not being treated first, a situation made worse by the inadequacy of existing CERN guidelines, which need immediate revision. Criteria for location, admission/exit standards, age of children, length of stay, and supervision are provided. One of the program's most serious problems is that 74% of the children show second and third degree malnutrition upon leaving the CERN, despite an average stay of 5.4 months. The CERN diet is insufficient to fill a child's total nutritive requirements, yet 30% of mothers give no supplements to their children. Dietary studies of CERN food and of children's consumption should be made and a special formula should be given to seriously malnourished children immediately upon visiting a CERN.  The mother education component should receive greater stress and training made more applicable to home conditions. Basic nutrition lessons should be presented early and repeated often. Other suggestions to improve education are more frequent home visits and use of alternative teaching methods. Refresher training for CERN directors and extensionists is needed, as is stricter adherence to the length-of-stay limit (4 months).  The CERN system alone is incapable of reaching all 270,000 seriously malnourished children under five.  A nutrition education component should be introduced into the overall health delivery system in order to make integrated nutrition services available to all children.","Evaluation period: 1 Oct 1976-31 Dec 1978","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID-521-C-69-T","","1/1/1979 12:00:00 AM","","Nutritional analysis|Nutrition|Extension services|Nutrition improvement|Institution building|Health delivery|Nutrition surveillance|Nutritional status|Mothers|Health education|Nutrition education|Health facilities|Child feeding programs|CHILD NUTRITION|Deficiency diseases|Beneficiary count","Haiti","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAG315B1.pdf","12,438 KB","","","","English","application/pdf","Country program evaluation|Indepth evaluation|Onsite evaluation|Social science evaluation","","KING, JOYCE M.","","1 Jan 1979","","","","AID ROLE IN HAITI'S MOTHERCRAFT NETWORK FROM 1976, TOWARD THE FUTURE","","PD-AAG-315-B1","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc3MTM1","Haiti","5210075"
"This special study, attached to a PES (PD-AAF-559-A1), assesses the cost-effectiveness of mothercraft centers and other nutrition intervention strategies in Haiti.  It should be read in conjunction with a special evaluation (PD-AAF-559-A1). The study evaluates various interventions based on the following criteria:  capability of the strategy, number of participants per center, cost per recuperated child and educated mother, changes in percent of standard weight for age, and mortality rates. The author develops a cost-effectiveness rating for each of the five strategies commonly used in Haiti:  nutrition rehabilitation and education centers (CERN's); Hacho centers; Church World Service (CWS) centers; projet integre (foyer and nutrition centers); and hospital rehabilitation. Despite a lack of the detailed data needed for a thorough cost effectiveness study, the following conclusions are drawn. Hospital rehabilitation is the most expensive strategy, followed by CERN, Hacho, projet integre, and CWS.  The author's major conclusion is that, based on the number of benefits per dollar spent, the CERN program -- the one most emphasized by the Bureau of Nutrition (BON) -- is the least cost-effective method.  Projet integre and CWS are not only the cheapest strategies, but produce lower mortality rates among 1-4 year olds, increased life expectancy, and a higher rehabilitation rate. Further study is recommended to ascertain that the foyer system used in projet integre is the most cost-effective. A discussion follows which examines the elements of each individual program and describes the ideal mix of components for effective nutrition intervention, including untried elements of programs which are currently being developed.  These include integrating nutrition services into the rural health system and distribution of supplementary dry food. The final recommendation is that BON diversify its program and retract its current emphasis on CERN's.  A more cost-effective program than any of the options now used would be a mobile center offering a range of nutrition and education interventions in the regions of greatest need.","WORK ORDER NO. 2","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/SOD/FDC-0083","","1/1/1979 12:00:00 AM","","Technical assistance|Cost-effectiveness","Haiti","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAG316A1.pdf","3,857 KB","000769 - Medical Service Consultants, Inc.","","","English","application/pdf","","","FORT, CATHERINE J.","","1 Jan 1979","","","","COST-EFFECTIVENESS OF MOTHERCRAFT AND OTHER ALTERNATIVES FOR HAITI","","PD-AAG-316-A1","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc3MTM3","Haiti","5210075|9310262"
"This report, attached to a PES (PD-AAF-559-A1), is a special study of agriculture and nutrition in Haiti. The report begins with an examination of the major food crops grown in Haiti and how these foods are consumed. Typical peasant meals are described and evaluated for their nutritional quality.  The average Haitian peasant's diet is found to be deficient in protein, fat, and calories, while vitamin intake is dependent upon the season. Practical measures for improving the diet are presented.  In order to add green vegetables and fruit to the diet, home gardens should be encouraged. Calorie consumption can be increased through the production and consumption of root crops, such as sweet and Irish potatos.  The quality of the protein consumed could be improved though the introducton of milk, meat, and eggs into the diet.  Milk and beef, however, are neither affordable by the peasant nor economical for the agriculture sector. Therefore, the author strongly recommends the promotion of rabbit and chicken production to fill the country's protein needs. The agricultural extension activities of Haiti's Bureau of Nutrition (BON) are described.  BON employs agricultural extensionists (AE's) to encourage improved food production, preservation, meal preparation, and infant feeding practices.  One AE is assigned to each of the 30 nutrition centers; the AE's visit families with children in the feeding program, conduct weekly group meetings, and provide practical and theoretical agricultural assistance through the use of demonstration plots and other methods.  Specific recommendations to further improve the extension program are made for each of following subject areas: staple foods, fruit/vegetable production, animal husbandry, soil conservation, grain storage, logistics, training, and supervision.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID-521-C-49","","1/1/1979 12:00:00 AM","","Technical assistance","Haiti","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAG317A1.pdf","17,107 KB","","","","English","application/pdf","","","ATTFIELD, HARLAN","Agricultural education","1 Jan 1979","","","","AGRICULTURAL EXTENSION PROGRAM, BUREAU OF NUTRITION, DESCRIPTION AND NEW DIRECTIONS","","PD-AAG-317-A1","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc3MTM4","Haiti","5210075|9310262"
"Evaluates the Nutrition Education Project in Morocco from 5/1/75-12/1/78. Project consists of an operational program grant to Catholic Relief Services to assist in establishing a basic nutrition education program in 250 social eduction centers (SEC's), reaching 125,000 mothers with children of preschool age. To evaluate program effectiveness, a baseline nutritional survey was conducted in 1975 of mothers at 26 SEC's.  A questionnaire was administered and preschool-age children were weighed and measured. Survey participants were followed throughout the project period. A final survey was made in Spring 1978.  (Survey results are amended to this report). Comparisons show a significant improvement in child feeding and practices.  Figures indicate that mothers have accepted and implemented what they have been taught. Long-term training for four Moroccan counterparts and short-term training for 26 Provincial Directresses at the National Institute of Nutrition in Tunis was accomplished as scheduled.  Five hundred instructors have been trained through in-country seminars. Thirteen lesson plans for mothers' classes and course curriculum for the 4-week in-country seminars were prepared by the fall of 1975.  Both were further refined.  (Mothers' lesson plans are attached to PES). Enrolled in the program were 125,000 mothers.  At each monthly lesson, each mother received a supplementary PL 480 Title II food ration. As an experiment, 11 mothers' clubs were organized which provided nutrition education but no Title II foods.  Weekly lessons included demonstrations using local food, family hygiene, and sewing.  The fact that 6 of these clubs are still in existance is evidence that this concept can succeed.  These clubs are more popular among women on a higher economic level who can afford to contribute their share of food, thread, and other materials. A basic lesson of the project is that poorly educated women (i.e., those without a secondary school education) can be trained (in seminars) to teach basic nutrition and health concepts.  In the future, nutrition education should concentrate even more on the worst cases of malnourishment.","Evaluation period: 1 May 1975-1 Dec 1978","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","3/1/1979 12:00:00 AM","","Food for Peace|Curriculum design|Teacher training|CHILD NUTRITION|Food aid programs|Nutrition education|Nutrition research|Health surveys|Private voluntary organizations|Child feeding programs|Weight|Height|Nutritional analysis|Seminars|Mothers|Health education|Beneficiary count|Beneficiary interviews","Morocco","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAG371C1.pdf","3,598 KB","007337 - Catholic Relief Services (CRS)","","","English","application/pdf","Indepth evaluation|Final EOPS|Onsite evaluation","","","","19 Mar 1979","","USAID/Morocco 79-1; AID/NESA-G-1169","","FINAL REPORT AND EVALUATION OF NUTRITION EDUCATION PROJECT; CATHOLIC RELIEF SERVICES/MOROCCO; GRANT NUMBER : AID/NESA-G-1169","","PD-AAG-371-C1","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc3MTQw","Morocco","6080141|6080123"
"Evaluates project to provide an integrated rural health and family planning delivery system in Lofa County, Liberia. This final evaluation, attached to a PES Facesheet (DOCID: B6690125001501), covers the period 7/75-6/79 and prepared by a joint USAID/Government of Liberia (GOL) team, is based on site visits, a review of project files, and interviews. Health facilities have been well constructed and staffed, and possess adequate supplies of drugs, equipment, and recording materials; an operational county medical depot has also been established and equipped. Delivery of health services has increased markedly, especially in the areas of family planning; maternal child health (MCH), e.g., prenatal and under-five years of age visits; and, with the help of the Expanded Immunization Program, immunization coverage. The project's reorientation in 1978 had a positive impact, leading to well construction in communities, establishment of village health committees, and training of traditional midwives.  The MCH supervisory team, the counterpart, the community health physician, and the teacher/trainer benefitted the project greatly. Supervision of health posts and centers, particularly in Lower Lofa and Konia, was inadequate, however.  Cooperation between GOL and non-GOL health organizations, while good, could be improved. Although important progress was made, it is doubtful whether the project notably improved people's health status.  This is because the project design was institution, not people oriented -- a mistake that must be avoided in developing the national health plan. Recommendations include:  (1) A.I.D. should terminate the project in 9/79, as planned, but continue teacher training and public health assistance.  (2) Preventive health services and health education should be given greater emphasis.  (3) The expanded immunization program should be carried out.  (4) The Project Trust Fund should be continued, but under Liberian management.  (5) Uncommitted project funds should be used for commodities and additional participant training. (6) Project trainees should be assigned only to the Lofa County health program.","Evaluation period: 1 Jul 1975-1 Jun 1979","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","6/1/1979 12:00:00 AM","","Institution building|Indigenous education|Health delivery|Transportation|Medical equipment|Health outreach services|Health facilities|Building construction|Building renovation|Logistics|Health care planning|Health policy|Clinics|Medical education|FAMILY PLANNING|Family planning education|Rural areas|Beneficiary interviews","Liberia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAP179.pdf","877 KB","008570 - USAID.

Evaluation covers the period 12/1/78-2/1/79 and is based on the on-site observations of a specially contracted team. In general, the new marketing sysem (NMS) in the Chittagong Division is proceeding well. Fertilizer sales are up 5.5% over the same 2-month period last year, while the 15 newly created principal distribution points (PDP's) are handling 67.7% of the division's total fertilizer sales.  By reducing warehousing, transportation, and other costs, the PDP's have enabled a drop in retail prices to a level much closer to official prices.  Although fertilizer stocks are generally still not adequate to meet sales targets, the flow of fertilizer in the division has been improved through the transportation methods used by a new group of fertilizer wholesaler merchants.  Other problems faced by NMS include inadequate fertilizer stocks in most districts, persistent transportation difficulties, and inadequate warehousing capacity. Recommendations are:  (1) the warehouse construction program should be concentrated at PDP locations, especially those with acute storage inadequacies; (2) the awarding of transportation contracts should be re-evaluated and a uniform code of rates and qualifications should be developed; (3) PDP's should receive priority shipping status, and thana outlets whose sales drop 50% or more due to PDP business should be closed; (4) a dealer classification system should be developed in order to better estimate sales, identify warehousing needs, and bring farmers and dealers into close cooperation; (5) dealer training should be offered to encourage better understanding and management of the free market system; (6) NMS staffing pattern should be reorganized to reflect the high volume of PDP sales; (7) adequate stocks of fertilizer should be maintained; and (8) a cost evaluation of NMS should be made and dealers should be required to sell at or below official retail prices.","Evaluation period: 1 Dec1978-31 Jan1979","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","2/1/1979 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural inputs|Fertilizer distribution|Fertilizers|Agribusiness|Marketing facilities|Warehouses","Bangladesh","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAG314C1.pdf","1,926 KB","000630 - International Fertilizer Development Center (IFDC)","","","English","application/pdf","","","HILL, JOHN M.|BENTON, ROBERT D.","","28 Feb 1979","","","","FIRST EVALUATION OF THE NEW MARKETING SYSTEM IN THE CHITTAGONG DIVISION (SPECIAL EVALUATION OF 2/79)","","PD-AAG-314-C1","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc3MTc4","Bangladesh","3880024"
"Evaluates project to establish a pilot rural health program in the Danfa area of Ghana.  This special evaluation covers the period 1/1/69-9/1/79 and is based on an onsite review. The Danfa project consisted of three primary activities -- health services delivery and evaluative research, participant training, and institutional development.  In addition to the Danfa center, three satellite clinics were set up at Oyibi, Berecuso, and Abokobi. Priority was given to mothers and children. Traditional birth attendants, village health workers, and health education assistants were trained to assist the center health workers.  A mass immunization program, while failing to attain its goal of reaching 80% of the children in the target area, did demonstrate the greater effectiveness of multiple antigen innoculations over single antigens.  The malaria chemoprophylaxis program was more successful in reaching school-age children than in reaching pre-schoolers (who had to be brought in for treatment).  A number of epidemiological studies were conducted, and polio was found to be a significant problem.  Nineteen Ghanaians received training in the United States, mostly at UCLA. Project problems for the most part related to the evaluative research component.  For example, only limited use was made of the village health survey--which proved to be a very costly undertaking. Although project personnel claimed that the family planning survey revealed a significant increase in the number of acceptors, failure to provide age-specific rates or to designate the total number of eligible women made this claim difficult to substantiate.  Heavy migration rendered the results of the vital events registration and survey questionable.  Furthermore, the extent to which the Danfa area is typical of Ghanaian rural communities is not known.  This document contains a lengthy series of recommendations relating to health services delivery, family planning, health education, evaluative research, cost assessment, training, program continuation, linkages with other agencies, institutional development, and project management.","Evaluation period: 1 Jan 1969-1 Sep 1979","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/SOD/PDC-C-0160","","9/1/1979 12:00:00 AM","","Clinics|Health outreach services|Health research|Data collection|Health delivery|Health education|Medical education|Health care planning|Health professional education|Paramedical education|Change agents|Health surveys|Maternal child health care|Traditional birth attendants|Community health workers|Family planning education|Family planning surveys","Ghana","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAG356A1.pdf","2,997 KB","009024 - Dimpex Associates, Inc.","","","English","application/pdf","Evaluation team|Indepth evaluation|Final EOPS|Onsite evaluation","","","","1 Sep 1979","","","","DANFA RURAL HEALTH PROJECT EVALUATION","","PD-AAG-356-A1","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc3MTg0","Ghana","641005501|64l005502|641005503|641005504"
"Evaluates the organization and administration of a project to improve the access of Honduran small farmers to appropriate technology. This special evaluation, which is attached to a PES (PD-AAG-334-B1), covers the period 4/1/77-9/30/80 and is based on visits and interviews with project administrators. Only the farm system planning/evaluation component was functioning at the time of the evaluation; the other components are designed to establish an appropriate technology research and development unit, provide long-term credit for farm investments, and conduct farmer training programs. The project has no clear organizational structure and is hampered by a lack of binding commitments from the Government of Honduras agencies on which it depends for delivery of farmer services. Ineffective coordination is a major problem; nationally, the agencies implementing each component have not cooperated with one another, while the planning unit's regional teams have been inadequate. Project staff has failed to work closely with the existing national small farmer organizations and their local chapters, despite a mutual interest in the project's success.  Administration is hampered by ineffective and excessive procedures, such as those required for credit distribution.  Finally, an improved data analysis and accounting system is needed. Coordination of the information flow between all project components is vital for the effective transfer of appropriate technology to the farmers via farm plans and farmer organizations. Final recommendations are that project staff must be clearly placed within the Ministry of Natural Resources and given increased authority; selection of counterpart and expatriate staff must be improved; the information flow must be extended to include accurate financial data; an assessment is needed of the effect on beneficiaries of delays and failures; the planning skills of the regional units should be improved; teamwork in farmer assistance should be stressed; greater flexibility is needed in developing farm plans and granting credit; and small farmer organizations should be more involved in project activities.","Evaluation period: 1 Apr 1977-30 Sep 1980","Special Evaluation","Documents","DSAN-C-0065","","10/1/1979 12:00:00 AM","","Appropriate technology|Rural areas|Farmer training|Agricultural training|Educational materials|Technical information|Information management|Agricultural credit|Agricultural cooperatives|Farm management|Agricultural technology|Agricultural research|Delivery systems|Agricultural inputs|Agricultural development|Agricultural education|Financial management|Integrated rural development|Agricultural production|Information dissemination","Honduras","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAG334C1.pdf","1,621 KB","006727 - Development Alternatives, Inc.

"Evaluates regional nutrition project (RNP) to upgrade the food and nutrition planning capabilities of the six countries of Central America. This special evaluation, attached to PES (PD-AAG-337-B1), covers the period 8/78-10/79; methodology is unspecified.  Evaluation focuses on the structure and activity of the Institute of Nutrition of Central America and Panama (INCAP), the implementing agency. The basic program staff, composed of nine INCAP professionals in agriculture, health, and nutrition, are working well. However, the research-oriented extended program staff are uncertain of their role within RNP.  The research being conducted, although of high quality, is not sufficiently responsive to the region's nutrition problems.  The intersectoral development of RNP is limited in each country because INCAP works only through the national health ministries.  A.I.D. missions have not enthusiastically supported RNP, thus limiting the project's resources.  INCAP is having difficulty meeting the rising demand for technical assistance and has not received firm pledges of financial support from five of the countries. Despite these drawbacks, a planning process for food and nutrition strategies has developed in four countries.  Progress in Nicaragua is temporarily halted due to an impending change in government.  Three countries have national plans, four have initiated food/nutrition programs, and four have or soon will have a nutrition surveillance/evaluation system. Institutionalization of the planning process has occurred in three countries, but the new units are weak and will need continued support to move from the planning to the intervention stage.  It is recommended that:  (1) the institutionalization of the planning process continue, stressing definition of a target population; (2) INCAP staffing be reorganized; (3) communication flexibility be improved; (4) INCAP respond to the systems, finances, policies and priorities of international agencies; (5) an intense program for national counterpart training be begun; and (6) RNP be extended for four years.  A Spanish translation of the document is attached.","Evaluation period: 1 Aug 1978-31 Oct 1979","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","11/1/1979 12:00:00 AM","","Health policy|Sector planning|Nutrition improvement|Nutrition|Extension services|Management training|Indigenous education|Problem solving|Personnel|Personnel development|Institution building|Development project design|Development project implementation|Development project evaluation|Project change","Central America","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAG337C1.pdf","4,743 KB","","","","English","application/pdf","Multi country evaluation|Indepth evaluation","","MOSQUERA, TOMASURIBE|ORTEGA, REINALDO G.","","1 Nov 1979","","","","SUMMARY OF THE CONSULTANTS' REPORT ON THE SECOND EXTERNAL EVALUATION OF THE INCAP/ROCAP REGIONAL NUTRITION PROJECT","","PD-AAG-337-C1","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc3MjE0","Reg Office Cent America & Panama (ROCAP)","5960065"

"Evaluates project to upgrade the indigenous research capability of four of 17 agricultural research centers in the Philippines. Evaluation covers the period 5/76-11/79 and was prepared by a Joint Government of the Philippines (GOP)/USAID team. No methodology is indicated. Despite a slow start due to funding delays and difficulties of the implementing agency, the Philippine Council for Agriculture and Resources Research (PCARR), with A.I.D. procurement regulations, the project is now 83% complete.  All 17 centers have initiated research programs whose quality and quantity have increased and have focused on priority problems established with their participation. PCARR's Scientific Literature Service has expanded service to 30 libraries, and PCARR has produced many publications and conducted seminars and workshops using project-funded commodities. In-country training has proceeded as planned, but lack of available candidates and of GOP provision of per diem has kept the international Ph.D. refresher training and consequently the technical assistance targets seriously behind schedule. Recommendations are made to improve the project's infrastructure component by ensuring coordination between PCARR and the Ministry of Budget to ensure that seed funds are available on time (this is now being done) and by identifying sites for specific structures in advance. Recommendations are also made regarding the project's commodity procurement, international training, and technical assistance components. Evaluation is attached to a project PES (PD-AAG-403-A1) which summarizes it.","Attached to PD-AAG-403-A1|Loan no. 492-T-039|Evaluation period: 1 MAY 1976-31 OCT 1979","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","10/1/1979 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural research|Graduate education|Participants|Indigenous education|Professionals|Institution building|Agriculture|Information services|Project change|Limited data","Philippines","","","008592 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to increase resources and services to small farmers in English-speaking Caribbean countries.  This special contracted evaluation, attached to a PES (PD-AAG-597-A1), covers the period 6/76-9/80, is based in part on field reports (included in an annex) to Belize, Antigua, St. Vincent, and Grenada. The project's terminal disbursement date (TDD) cannot be met nor can the project be carried out as planned.  Responsibility for this must be shared by A.I.D. and cooperating Caribbean entities, especially the Caribbean Development Bank (CDB).  Before loan approval, A.I.D. failed to identify or resolve basic issues such as integrating the four components -- agricultural production credit (APC), inputs, marketing, and feeder roads (FR) -- on whose interdependence the project design was based. After project initiation, issues such as the use of force account construction for feeder roads were left unresolved longer than necessary. CDB failed to appoint a project manager with clear responsibility and, except for St. Lucia, did not appoint Farm Improvement Officers for APC schemes. There is no record that A.I.D. recalled CDB to its commitments.  A final problem is that the project is quite complex and has an unrealistically tight schedule, which has led to a disappointing record for loan disbursements. To date, CDB has committed $2.163 million for APC programs in Antigua, Belize, St. Lucia, and Grenada (of which $626,000 has been disbursed to farmers by development finance corporations) and has committed $2.325 million to feeder road projects in Antigua and St. Vincent. No commitments have been made for inputs or marketing.  The planned regional agricultural supply project in the Windward Islands has not been implemented. Because of CDB's importance for the area's development, evaluators recommend that A.I.D. extend the TTD 2-3 years after negotiating a new, detailed schedule and implementation plan with CDB. Such a new plan, which is spelled out in the evaluation's final section, should stress the few components in the few countries where spade work already done augurs well for speedy implementation.","Loan no. 538-T-006|Evaluation period: 30 Jun 1976-30 Sep 1979","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID-BRG-538-79-002-T","","10/1/1979 12:00:00 AM","","Financial institutions|Credit|Agricultural production credit|Agricultural product marketing|Access roads|Delivery systems|Agricultural inputs|Small farms|Farmers|FARM INCOME|Investment|Economic planning|FORCE ACCOUNT","Eastern Caribbean","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAP466.pdf","25,373 KB","000929 - Pacific Consultants","","","English","application/pdf","Multi country evaluation|Evaluation team|Indepth evaluation","","BROADNAX, MADISON|LOPEZ, NEY|STEPHENSON, JAMES E.","","13 Oct 1979","","","","EVALUATION OF PROJECT 538-T-006; CARIBBEAN REGIONAL INTEGRATED AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT (SPECIAL EVALUATION)","","PD-AAP-466","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc3MzU4","Caribbean Regional","5380007"
"Evaluates project to improve the institutional capability of the Tanzanian Livestock Development Authority and the Tanzanian Livestock Marketing Company (TLMC) to assist traditional livestock producers (TLP). This special contracted evaluation covers the period 1977-9/79 and was based on site visits, interviews, and a review of files by the contractor. Despite minimal support from both Texas A&M University (TAMU) and A.I.D., TAMU field members proved industrious and competent.  Specific outputs include some of the following.  TLMC has become established with Tanzanians holding key positions. Nevertheless, more competency in fiscal responsibility, accounting, management information system, the implementation of policy directives, and field management is needed. More than 79 livestock markets have been constructed or remodeled. Approximately 15 Ujama Cooperative ranches were formed but are having problems and 3 District Development Corporations have been organized. In addition, 12 National Ranching Company ranches have been started. For the remainder of the project, the TAMU team should stress improving the marketing of livestock and providing market information to TLP's.  It is recommended that the team be given an additional year to work toward this goal.  Among specific recommendations are that TAMU team members be fluent in Kiswahili and be given needed background literature; that markets not be built with project assistance unless there is a demonstrated need; that unprofitable markets be closed; that 15% of the operating turnover be used to maintain and improve market structures; that TAMU concentrate on completing one stock route approximately 100 km long with water facilities every 25 km, one holding ground with installed water facilities and a grazing management plan, and establishing on one Tanzanian National Ranching Company ranch a range site and condition survey, a range management plan, and necessary water facilities.","Bibliography: p. 90-96","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/SOD/POC-C-230","","9/1/1979 12:00:00 AM","","Institution building|Cattle|Livestock|Agricultural product marketing|Agribusiness","Tanzania","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAG633.pdf","16,674 KB","000883 - A.L.

"Evaluates research project to improve the production and nutritional quality of wheat.  This final evaluation covers the period 7/66-12/79; no methodolgy is specified. Analyses of 20,000 cultivars in the USDA's World Collection and in Nebraska showed that genetic variation for protein (P) of at least 5 percentage points exists in hexaploid wheat; genetic variation for lysine (L) amounts to only 0.5 percentage points; L, as a percent of P, correlates negatively with P at P levels up to 15%; and a strong positive correlation exists between L per unit weight and grain P content.  Major genes affecting grain P content were identified in Atlas 66 and Nap Hal.  Genes modestly effecting L were found in CI13449 and Nap Hal.  Hybridized genes were successfully transferred to productive short-statured winter and spring wheats.  High yield varieties (HYV's) developed included Lancota (a hard winter variety), Sava and Partizanka (Yugoslavia), Kavkaz and Aurora (U.S.S.R.), and Centurk (Nebraska). Genetic studies indicate that Atlas 66 carries two or more major genes for P. Genetic increases in L provided by CI13449 and Nap Hal, while limited, are great enough for use in breeding programs and for overcoming the depression of L % of P due to P elevation. Laboratory procedures were developed to streamline the large-scale screening of P and L samples.  Tests showed that Atlas 66 and its high P derivatives, when consumed whole-grain, are significantly more nutritional than ordinary wheat.  Significant associative nitrogen fixation could not be shown for Nebraska wheat. An international winter wheat evaluation network, involving 68 test sites in 38 countries, has been effective in early identification of new, stable, and broadly adaptable winter HYV's. Nineteen students associated with the project (seven from LDC's) received Ph.D. (13) or M.S. (6) degrees. Ten researchers from seven LDC's received non-degree training.  Some 544 researchers in 46 countries received high-protein L germplasm upon request. Four international wheat conferences and an international workshop on seed P were held and their proceedings distributed.","Evaluation period: 1 Jul 1966-31 Dec 1979","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","12/1/1979 12:00:00 AM","","Lysine|Fortified foods|Graduate education|Plant genetics|Varietal research|PLANT ANATOMY|Cultivars|Crop yield|WHEAT|Indigenous education|Agricultural research|Agricultural training|Classrooms|Technical assistance","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAH468A1.pdf","1,726 KB","000880 - University of Nebraska at Lincoln","","","English","application/pdf","Evaluation team|Indepth evaluation|Final EOPS","","","","31 Dec 1979","","AID/CSD-1208; AID/TA-C-1093","","GENETIC IMPROVEMENT OF PRODUCTIVITY AND NUTRITIONAL QUALITY OF WHEAT","","PD-AAH-468-A1","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc3Mzgw","Technical Assistance","9310471"
"Evaluates core project and adjunct projects promoting integrated rural development (IRD) in Tunisia's Siliana Province.  Special evaluation covers 9/77-8/79 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with project personnel. Although the IRD progam, which contains over 30 projects and subprojects (SP's), was designed to study and test features of Siliana's production-related social/institutional environment, over 60% of funds have been spent on road construction under project 305 (mainly MC 77, a highway between Makthar and Hababsa) and on potable water SP's and under 1% on data collection and analysis.  Due in part to the failure to find a suitable agronomist, almost no data have been collected on agriculture pilot SP's.  Range management SP's have not caught on among farmers; further investment is not recommended.  Beekeeping appears to be a dying tradition, unless made more attractive to the young, perhaps by Save the Children Foundation (SCF) under project 0307. Arboriculture and sheep- and goatdipping SP's pose cost-benefit and logistical problems.  If these can be solved, sheepdipping may be a good starting-point for project replication.  In regard to Highway MC 77, an unpaved penetration road, the choice of the Government of Tunisia's (GOT) highway department (HD) as implementing agency was a mistake, since HD technical standards tend to preclude the building of inexpensive, all-weather roads. Efforts must be made to ensure that MC 77 is maintained (no plans for this exist yet) and serves the region's people. Due to faulty technology and failure to consult with GOT at the design stage, 55 of 80 wells improved under project 0299 now lack water. Health project 0296 has not been implemented due to delays in hiring contractors and in acquiring land on which to build dispensaries. SCF's self-help strategy has been generally accepted - 17 SP's in a variety of areas have been (1) or are being (16) implemented, with high levels of community participation/contributions.  SCF has also developed good working relations with GOT and private Tunisian institutions, however the project has two weaknesses: people lose interest in projects once they are over; and, emphasis on cooperative work has led to neglect of technical matters.","Evaluation period: 1 Sep 1977-31 Aug 1979","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/SOD/PDC-C-0190","","1/1/1979 12:00:00 AM","","Integrated rural development|Road construction|Penetration roads|Road maintenance","Tunisia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAH456A1.pdf","4,726 KB","000980 - Practical Concepts Inc.","","","English","application/pdf","Evaluation team|Indepth evaluation|Onsite evaluation","","POPPER, ROGER|MCKEE, THOMAS A.","","1979","","","","EVALUATION OF USAID/TUNISIA'S SILIANA RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT, AND THE SAVE THE CHILDREN FOUNDATION PROJECT","","PD-AAH-456-A1","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc3NDAw","Tunisia","6640285|6640296|6640299|6640305|6640307"
"Evaluates project to improve the health and welfare of the rural population in Ghana through health services delivery, evaluative research, participant training, and institutional development.  This comprehensive, final (1970-79) evaluation was conducted by a contracted evaluation team who reviewed project reports and numerous papers and interviewed key project participants. The project was highly successful in extending primary health care services to the target area villages and in the areas of participant and in-country training and institutional development.  Unfortunately, however, summative evaluation activities as well as other operational research activities could not be completed.  This incompletion limited policy formulation, service delivery modalities, and overall project credibility.  Until project data are finally interpreted, the Government of Ghana will be severely handicapped in its health planning and primary health care strategy implementation. Major problems with the evaluation component in specific activities included the following:  Data of the Village Health Survey were expensive to collect and only limited use is made of them to assess the project's overall impact in improving health status.  The Health Practice Survey reported changes in several health practice areas -- both good (BCG vaccination and adequate human waste disposal for children under six) and bad (smallpox/measles innoculation and adequate adult male human waste disposal) -- for which no sufficient explanations were provided.  Significant migration in the four project areas rendered the results of the Survey and Registration of Vital Events questionable. No data were available to substantiate evidence of differences in demographic characteristics of project areas. Numerous recommendations are provided in the areas of health services/family planning delivery; health education program; evaluative research; cost assessment; participant and in-country training; traditional birth attendants; program continuation; linkages with other agencies; institutional development; and project management.","Evaluation period: 1 Jan1970-31 Dec1979","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","AID/SOD/PDC-C-0160WO2","","9/1/1979 12:00:00 AM","","Institution building|Participants|Rural areas|Health care|Indigenous education|Medical education|Community health care|Community participation|Integrated health care|Primary health care|FAMILY PLANNING|Maternal child health care|Health research|Data collection|Health delivery|Health outreach services|Statistical data|Health surveys","Ghana","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAI404A1.pdf","7,239 KB","009024 - Dimpex Associates, Inc.","","","English","application/pdf","Indepth evaluation|Final EOPS|Onsite evaluation","","MOORE, FERNE G.|ADIBO, MOSES|et al.","","30 Sep 1979","","","","DANFA RURAL HEALTH PROJECT EVALUATION - GHANA","","PD-AAI-404-A1","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc3NDY3","Ghana","6410055"
"Evaluates a family planning and maternal/child health project in Nepal.  This special evaluation, which focuses on the project's supply system, covers a period ending 12/79 and is based on site visits, interviews with project officials, and analysis of recommendations made in an 8/77 A.I.D. audit report. Weaknesses in the supply management system are linked to lack of top supervision, resulting in budget shortfalls for supply management training and warehouse leasing/renovation.  These deficiencies caused most of the inadequacies for which recommendations (Nos. 3-5) were cited in the audit report.  In analyzing these recommendations, the evaluator suggests that USAID/N and the Ministry of Health (MOH) develop jointly a coordinated logistical supply system to ensure proper inventory, storage, procurement, and distribution.  To improve quarterly and annual reporting, which will provide accurate data on total contraceptive stocks in Nepal and on the number of contraceptive users, the evaluator recommends that a budget be drawn up immediately for training (including seminars) of Store-in-Charge personnel who are currently unfamiliar with reporting procedures; and that a physical inventory of stocks be taken and the register books be brought up to date.  In meeting the auditor's recommendation to test excess stocks of condoms for quality before destroying surpluses, samples of condoms and pills were collected and sent to the United States for testing. When test results are received, appropriate action will be taken on their disposition. Staff job descriptions were redefined and additional storage space was located to improve improper inventory practices noted in the audit report.  The evaluator recommends that onsite inspection of storage facilities, including suitability of room, be conducted, and that the Supply and Procurement Section begin budgeting for 1980-81. Improvements were made in other problem areas which were identified in the audit report but for which no recommendations were made.  These areas include the commodity stock card system; inventory records; and disposal procedures for property.","Evaluation period: 30 Oct 1979-22 Dec 1979","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","9/1/1979 12:00:00 AM","","FAMILY PLANNING|Family planning services|Delivery systems|Logistics|Management training|Contraceptive distribution|Contraceptive agents and devices|Condoms|Oral contraceptives|Limited data plus","Nepal","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAI212A1.pdf","531 KB","000262 - American Public Health Association","","","English","application/pdf","Pre evaluation data|Onsite evaluation","","WEEKS, PHILIP O.","","27 Sep 1979","","CONTRACT AID/PHA-C-1100","","NEPAL FAMILY PLANNING AND MATERNAL CHILD HEALTH PROJECT","","PD-AAI-212-A1","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc3NTEw","Nepal","3670096"
"Evaluates project to assist the Onchocerciasis Control Programme (OCP) in the Volta River basin area.  Evaluation, attached to a PES (PD-AAI-383-A1), covers the years 1974-79 and consists of an indepth report prepared by the World Health Organization. Vector control, especially by aerial application of larvicide to the breeding sites, has been highly successful in approximately 75% of the OCP area -- target levels of the annual transmission potential (ATP) (below 100 infective larvae of O. volvulus) and the annual biting rate (ABR) (below 1,000 flies) have been met.  Where larviciding has been continuous for 3 years, the disease's incidence among children has been reduced and its symptoms among those already affected stabilized. During certain seasons, larviciding has failed to eradicate vector populations at hydrologically peculiar sites, and vector reinvasion continues to pose a seasonal threat to people at the peripheral zones (20%) of the OCP area. Entomological evaluation teams have produced data on the ABR and the ATP and have plotted the distribution of the principal vectors in the OCP area.  The epidemiological evaluation unit has collected data on the disease's clinical, ophthalmological, and epidemiological aspects in over 300 sample areas.  Development of new insecticides and drugs has been slow but is accelerating. OCP technical staff, as well as doctors, ophthalmologists, and entomologists from participating countries have received training for institution-building purposes.  Participating scientists have received in-service training. Although systematic larviciding on some perennial rivers of the controlled zone's central part has been suspended in the dry season, the Scientific and Technical Advisory Committee concluded that operations must be continued in the OCP area for the scheduled 20 years.  Efforts will continue to determine the parasite's longevity in the human host, develop suitable chemotherapy, reduce the impact of reinvasion, and modify control by developing alternative methods and other insecticides. Part two of the report (published separately) details the area's economic development.","Evaluation period: 1 Jan 1974-31 Jan 1979","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1979 12:00:00 AM","","ONCHOCERCIASIS|Technical training|BLINDNESS|Preventive health care|Children|Disease prevention and control|Disease vectors|Disease transmission|Health|Environmental aspects|Pesticide application|INSECTICIDES|Chemistry research|Indigenous education|Epidemiology|Institution building|Paramedical education|Blackflies|Physician education|Human diseases","West Africa","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAI384A1.pdf","5,180 KB","001297 - World Health Organization (WHO)","","","English","application/pdf","Pre evaluation data|Indepth evaluation","","","","1979","","OCP/78.2","","ONCHOCERCIASIS CONTROL PROGRAMME IN THE VOLTA RIVER BASIN AREA","","PD-AAI-384-A1","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc3NTIy","Africa Regional","6980399"
"Evaluates Title III project to provide affordable foodgrains to Bangladeshi small farmers by establishing procurement prices to serve as production incentives during the harvest season and an Open Market Sales (OMS) program to restrain prices during off seasons.  This USAID/Government of Bangladesh (BDG) evaluation covers the period 8/78-11/79 and is based on site visits. Although effective and well-priced procurement programs were carried out during the last two harvests, OMS were consistently low (overall, only 126,000 of 400-600,000 targeted tons) relative to need and to the level of the modified rationing (MR) program which BDG still prefers. For reasons not wholly under the project's control, the goal of constraining coarse rice prices was not achieved.  BDG reported allocating $15.1 of $16.5 million Title III local currency proceeds for USAID's fertilizer project. USAID finds no evidence of this. Major program emphases should be placed on keeping OMS prices above the support price; responding to year-to-year supply rather than seasonal variations; and making grains available before planting so as to provide price incentives to farmers. Specific recommendations include the following:  In regard to OMS, drop constraining coarse rice prices as a goal (wheat or atta should suffice in this regard); keep the OMS wheat price high enough to give traders a margin for storing, handling, and reselling wheat; base OMS on an atta trigger price and sell wheat wherever the latter is exceeded; keep OMS prices equal to the market price; and drop dealer, price, and volume restrictions and make efforts to sell to atta dealers.  As for local currency use, permit loan forgiveness upon proof of disbursements from project accounts, and make the fertilizer project ineligible for loan forgiveness.  As for wheat supply and attribution, increase FY 80 allotment from 742,000 to 942,000 tons; attribute 400,000 tons of this total to MR, the rest to OMS or BDG stocks; and apply the terms of the amended Title III agreement to all FY 80 wheat and to the proposed 5-year Title III program aimed at establishing an OMS stabilization reserve.","Evaluation period: 1 AUG 1978-30 NOV 1979","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","12/1/1979 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural production|Food production|FOOD PRICES|Price stabilization|Supply|Demand|Limited data plus","Bangladesh","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAI217A1.pdf","1,233 KB","008511 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to support a Cameroon Credit Union League (CAMCCUL) program to provide small farm production credit (SFPC) through member credit unions (CU's).  This special evaluation, attached to a PES (PD-AAI-382-E1), covers the period 1/75-12/79 and is based on site visits, interviews with CAMCCUL personnel, and a review of project files. A major emphasis has been placed on training.  To date, secretary-managers of 28 CU's have received short-term training at regional training centers in such areas as bookkeeping and CU management.  Local farmers have been trained in coffee pruning techniques and a small number of farmers have received formal training. The training was carried out by an SFPC specialist (now departed), who also provided technical assistance to CU's and farmers in loan evaluation and supervision.  His work, however, was hampered by poor transportation, and the Government of Cameroon has provided little field support.  A key difficulty in the future will be CAMCCUL's inability to fulfill member requests for technical assistance. To date, 50 individual farmers have benefitted from 84 loans totalling $39,978, mostly for improved livestock and coffee production. Loan delinquencies have been very low (0.5%). Borrower leverage rates were lower than the permitted loan-savings ratio due to increased loan demand and consequent drain on funds. Loans, moreover, have not been adequate to meet individual demands and have involved processing delays.  While increased lending has greatly increased CU gross income, high operating costs have prevented an equal rise in net income.  SFPC borrowers' savings have also increased and their average annual savings rate is 4-8 times that of other CU members. CAMCCUL provided an input supply service to 29 CU's, but did little to provide marketing assistance. It is recommended, inter alia, that CAMCCUL:  expand CU secretarial training; selectively increase the volume of SFPC lending; set firm lending targets for member CU's; train at least two more agricultural extension agents; ensure that the SFPC position is filled by a qualified person; and improve transportation.","Evaluation period: 1 Jan1975-31 Dec1979","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","11/1/1979 12:00:00 AM","","Indigenous education|Institution building|Credit unions|Small farms|Farmers|SAVINGS|Agricultural inputs|Agricultural production credit|Farmer training|Credit cooperatives|Credit|Management training|Animal husbandry|Livestock|Agricultural production|Agricultural credit|COFFEE|Financial management|Beneficiary count|Beneficiary interviews","Cameroon","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAI381D1.pdf","677 KB","000418 - Credit Union National Association, Inc.

"Evaluates project to assist the Cameroon Credit Union League (CAMCCUL) program to provide small farmer production credit through its member credit unions (CU).  This final evaluation, attached to a PES (PD-AAI-382-E1), covers the period 2/75-12/78 and is based on a review of files and observations of the project technician. CAMCCUL will not achieve financial self-sufficiency for at least another 3-5 years, and money on loan to both member CU's and non-member cooperatives has dropped. Suggestions for increasing CAMCCUL income include raising interest rates and promoting CU's with a high growth potential.  On the other hand, CAMCCUL is now generally able to provide basic technical services to CU's, although some CAMCCUL staff have not been cooperative with CU clients.  Despite a too-short training period, CAMCCUL's Agricultural Officer is in place, but lacks adequate transportation.  There will be an ongoing need for staff training as services are expanded. Due to lack of Government of Cameroon cooperation, CU officers were trained to help small farmers draw up production plans. It is recommended that the Agricultural Officer collect data on crop yields and production costs to sharpen the accuracy of these plans.  A training program was initiated for secretaries of participating CU's, which currently number 19 against a target of five.  Meetings were held with CU secretaries and Board of Directors to resolve serious CU problems regarding loan delinquency, cash shortages, slow growth, and inactive members.  All CU's have since made progress except the Mbangom CU, one of the three original CU's, which has not followed the program and which should be dropped -- as should any newer CU not adhering to program guidelines.  The other two original CU's, Banten and Ntundip, have made good progress.  It is recommended that no new CU's be brought into the system until existing CU's are well established and CAMCCUL can support them; and that the Agricultural Officer continue to insist on receiving monthly financial statements, since this forces secretaries to organize their records and identifies CU's needing help.","Evaluation period: 1 Feb 1975-31 Dec 1978","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1979 12:00:00 AM","","Indigenous education|Institution building|Credit unions|Small farms|Farmers|SAVINGS|Agricultural inputs|Agricultural production credit|Agricultural production|Credit|Management training|Pilot projects|Financial institutions|Financial resources|Credit cooperatives|Financial records systems","Cameroon","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAI381A1.pdf","1,406 KB","000418 - Credit Union National Association, Inc.

"Evaluates AID-assisted project implemented by the Maryknoll Missionaries to distribute Title II commodities in a preschool and elementary school feeding program in Puno, Peru.  Evaluation, which is written entirely in Spanish, covers the period 9/78-10/79 and is based on a cumulative report prepared by Peruvian personnel. After site visits and interviews with regional directors, the evaluating team used a sampling method to investigate the program's effectiveness.  An experimental group of schoolchildren, aged 6-14, who received benefits from the program was compared to a control group of children who did not participate in the school feeding program.  Among the general findings mentioned are that the feeding program has been of significant economic assistance to the families of the recipients, and that the program is meeting the goals and objectives for which it was designed.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","10/1/1979 12:00:00 AM","","School feeding programs|Food for Peace|Child nutrition|Child feeding programs|Sampling method","Peru","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAH568.pdf","12,304 KB","003151 - National Nutrition Institute","","","Spanish","application/pdf","Sampling method","","Haman de Barriga, Gladys","","1 Oct 1979","","","","Evaluacion del programa de alimentacion escolar","Evaluation of school feeding program","PD-AAH-568","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc3NTUz","Peru","527PL02"
"Evaluates project to institutionalize within the Government of Cameroon (GOC) a self-sustaining, regional system to produce, distribute, and use improved peanut and sorghum seed.  This special evaluation covers the period 6/76-1/79, is attached to a PES (PD-AAI-549-A1), and is based on a review of project documents, interviews with project personnel, and site visits. To offset the effects of a Sahelian drought upon area farmers, project personnel initially emphasized seed production and distribution. Seed production is proceeding apace, as the seed production area at the Maroua, Sanguere, and Dadjamka multiplication centers has increased sharply to 450 ha.  Farmland contracted for seed production has increased from 94.5 ha of peanuts in 1977, to 1,245 ha of peanuts and 33 ha of sorghum in 1978. The participation of 4,000 contracted farmers who obtained seed for 1978 production is essential to project success.  In 1978, 136.4 tons of peanut seed were distributed; 50 tons were sold to rural organizations and 85 tons to farmers, who will return the seed with interest the next year.  Only 450 kg of sorghum seed were planted on 33 ha in 1978, due to poor 1977 seed production.  U.S. training in seed technology was provided to two counterpart staffers and a 2-week, in-country seed production and processing course was held.  Radio communications contributed to farmer acceptance and the impact of training on farmer productivity/income appeared substantial. Key problems include unrealistic production goals; the lack (due to project emphasis and GOC limitations) of credit, inputs, marketing, and technical assistance; the difficulty and expense of training and employing many farm-level supervisory personnel; the lack of a bookkeeping system; and inadequate seed purchasing and storage means. Short-term recommendations include:  reducing 1980 project goals to meet GOC capability; adopting a standard bookkeeping system; considering price supports and storage programs to maintain price incentives; using audiovisual media in farmer training; and creating a revolving credit fund to buy contract farmer surplus and to fund inputs.","Companion project evaluation summary: PD-AAI-549-A1|Evaluation period: 1 Jun1976-31 Jan1979","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/OTR-C-1383","","1/1/1979 12:00:00 AM","","Delivery systems|Agricultural inputs|Laboratories|Agricultural research|Agricultural extension|Agricultural policy|Agricultural planning|Agricultural production|Varietal research|Agricultural training|Agricultural technicians|Seeds|Distribution|Agricultural storage facilities|Revolving fund|Seminars|Crop quality|CROP YIELD|SORGHUM|Peanuts|Farmer training|MASS MEDIA","Cameroon","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAG339B1.pdf","4,621 KB","006727 - Development Alternatives, Inc.

"Evaluates project to help World Education Inc. (WEI), a PVO involved in non-formal education (NFE) and development-oriented training of LDC leaders, to maintain its staff and program initiatives while restructuring its financial management systems and broadening its base of support.  Evaluation covers the period 1/79-12/79 and is based on a review of project documentation and a visit to WEI's headquarters. The evaluators first comment that they are confident that WEI's own analysis of its substantial progress toward fulfilling the objectives of the Institutional Development Grant (IDG, see DOCID: B9320114005301) are accurate, and they therefore feel no need to comment on these in great detail.  They do state that grant outputs are being produced on or ahead of schedule and that no discrepancy between planned and actual outputs is evident.  Concerning staffing, the evaluators conclude that only the difficulty in finding permanent directors of financial administration has marred an otherwise excellent personnel situation.  Two new areas of program activity are cited as noteworthy -- the inclusion of Latin America into WEI's sphere of program activity and the new emphasis and capability in WEI project evaluation.  Also significant is the fact that WEI is strengthening the capabilities of LDC agencies by assisting them to initiate activities in new geographic or sectoral settings or to research new systems which can then be continued after WEI's departure. As concerns finances, the evaluators found that WEI has made significant strides in improving its financial outlook.  It has utilized IDG funds on a declining annual basis to support its care costs, taking steps to realize more real costs from all its grants and contracts. Considerable progress has also beeen made in fundraising and broadening the base of support for WEI field and headquarters activities.  In spite of this, however, the anticipated adjustment upon grant termination will be severe, causing overhead rates to rise and making it more difficult for WEI to bid successfully on contracts. A.I.D. will discuss with WEI how best to ease this transition period.","Evaluation period: 1 JAN 1979-31 DEC 1979|Bibcode changed from 32 to 22, 2008-05-19","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","12/1/1979 12:00:00 AM","","Private voluntary organizations|Nonformal education|Institution building|Adult education|Limited data","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAI507A1.pdf","338 KB","000145 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to assist the Bicol River Basin Development Program (BRBDP) in the Philippines.  Special evaluation, covering the period l977-79, is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with project personnel. USAID has provided essential commodities and funded participant training, but BRBDP performance has been mixed.  A decentralized regional development approach of identifying constraints to area development and of developing complementary component projects using local resources to meet local needs has encouraged local participation and has attracted outside funding.  Success in designing/funding projects, however, has drawn attention away from other key development problems such as exploiting the benefits of irrigation projects. BRBDP's loss in the past year of most of its senior planners has exacerbated the situation.  Emphasis must shift to supporting the five on-going, AID-supported loan subprojects and promoting agribusiness/rural industry subprojects. It is recommended that:  (1) projects be designed/reviewed to minimize disturbance of the physical and socioeconomic environment; (2) second-generation projects include agro-forestation, coastal zone management, perennial cropping systems for smallholders, and annual mixed cropping systems; (3) line agencies/municipal offices be granted more responsibility for implementing projects; (4) general area profiles be conducted on areas unlikely to be attractive to private investors; (5) data collection/project selection methods be streamlined; (6) research on systems of resource management be increased; (7) field trials/applied research be coordinated with evaluation activities; (8) available data on rice yield be consolidated; (9) hydrologists and water management consultants be hired; (10) a permanent program director be hired and restaffing procede; (11) a new irrigation repayment policy be developed; (12) irrigation rotational systems/irrigation associations be examined for replication; and (13) a depository for BRBDP documents be created and a technical document be published for distribution to Philippine and international professionals.","Evaluation period: 1 Jan 1977-1 Sep 1979","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","8/1/1979 12:00:00 AM","","Road construction|RICE|Integrated rural development|Development project design|Development project implementation|Development project evaluation|Participants|Natural resource management|Water management|Hydrological surveys|Agricultural cooperatives|IRRIGATION|Irrigated farming|Community participation","Philippines","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAI562A1.pdf","2,237 KB","008592 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to develop improved varieties of rice in Sri Lanka. Special evaluation covers the period 5/77-5/79 and is based on site visits and interviews with project and Government of Sri Lanka (GSL) personnel. Substantial progress has been made in developing insect- and pest-resistant rice varieties.  Land characterizations have been developed which will enable rice varieties to be tailored to specific conditions and help farmers identify cropping patterns for increased production.  In addition, research on rice-based cropping systems has generated data which may help increase cropping intensity.  Production constraints have been identified and targeted for further research. However, research has been slowed somewhat by shortages of both resident specialists and local staff and by delayed commodity procurement.  Technical assistance (TA) in rice breeding and cropping systems was provided as planned, but significant problems were encountered in TA for the field trials program.  Field trials also suffered from training shortfalls; none of 4 planned degree trainees began training, only 5 of 21 planned short courses have been completed, and no workshops or seminars have been held.  For the cropping systems program, only one of 12 person-years of degree training planned has been provided; short-term training is on schedule. Recommendations are to:  link rice breeders more closely with regional adaptive trials agronomists and define breeders' responsibilities; provide adequate gall midge rearing facilities at the Central Agricultural Research Institute; intensify research on agronomic crop management; make regional stations responsible for field trials; disseminate project data to extensionists and farmers; improve linkages among the International Rice Research Institute, the GSL extension program, and AID-sponsored integrated water management projects; budget additional M.S., Ph.D., and non degree training; provide additional clerical and accounting assistance; and extend TA for the field trials program by 1 person-year.  Future efforts should focus on cultural practices and management of rice, seed problems, expansion of germplasm screening and testing, research data dissemination, and relevant aspects of rural sociology.","IRRI Review Team (21-25 May 1979, LK)|Project title: International agricultural research centers (IARCs)","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","5/1/1979 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural research|Agricultural training|Agricultural production|Cropping patterns|Limited data plus","Sri Lanka","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAM397.pdf","724 KB","000672 - International Rice Research Institute (IRRI)","","000036 - USAID.

"Evaluates rural development project to improve the living standards and increase social and economic growth among Mexico's poor majority. Special evaluation covers the project's entire 3-year period (to 12/79) and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with A.I.D. officials. Major findings and recommendations include: the project implementor, Institutional Development and Economic Affairs Service (IDEAS) has not established an effective, efficient, viable institution with the ability to replicate the Mexican rural development model in other countries. IDEAS' international division has only obtained funding from A.I.D. and cannot find other funding sources.  During the 3-year grant period, Mexicans financed and managed the rural development model.  Rather than operating as part of IDEAS, it has been an independent and separate entity.  Mexican technicians have developed a programming evaluation and training capability.  They appear anxious to establish direct association with sources of financing and entities interested in employing their services.  The Mexican model has unique features unlikely to be found elsewhere. Replication within Mexico has been slow and at least one effort has failed.  The model is not financially self-sufficient at any level. Modification of the Mexican model to make it suitable for replication elsewhere reduces it to an approach similar to others in the rural development field.  Costa Rican and Guatemalan reactions to the model, while informal, were favorable, but capital and TA from host country or private sector sources has not been assured.  AID/W should consider making its own intensive audit of IDEAS, to track all monies disbursed, ascertain services performed, and dispel any doubts arising from the organizational arrangements and other sources of income.  Any future AID/W financial arrangements with IDEAS should include specific requirements for frequency and content of reporting on uses of funds and on personnel.  Deadlines should be set and action taken on non-performance.  If AID/W and A.I.D. missions consider projects in the rural development field which might benefit from TA or training by the Mexican personnel, A.I.D. should examine the option of a direct contract with the Mexican institutions.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","12/1/1979 12:00:00 AM","","Rural development|Economic models","Mexico|Costa Rica|Guatemala","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAM668.pdf","838 KB","","","000145 - USAID.

"A study of family planning (FP) program effectiveness culminated in a workshop in April 1979, the proceedings of which are reported here. Workshop participants sought to identify from research and experience the combination of direct FP services and development activities most appropriate for reducing population growth in specific country situations. Part I summarizes the four background papers used as a framework for discussion, one of which was a typology for estimating the possible success of FP strategies in a specific country; Part II summarizes discussion of individual country experiences and policy-related issues; and Part III summarizes areas of consensus and concluding statements. Country conditions identified as crucial to FP effectiveness are political commitment, administrative ability, and the socioeconomic and cultural acceptability of FP.  Countries were categorized as ""certain,"" ""probable,"" ""possible,"" and ""unlikely"" to achieve an annual birth rate of 20 per 1,000 by the year 2000, based on the above-noted typology.  It was proposed to follow the Asian Bureau in adapting FP programs to each country's needs by varying their sequencing, their mix of services, and their relationship to other development activities, including efforts to enhance the status of women and to upgrade the quality and availability of demographic data. Consensus was reached on recommendations to:  (1) adopt a country-specific approach to FP planning and policy based on realistic, long-term goals; (2) identify conditions within individual countries, regions, or subgroups that favor specific strategies; (3) provide more varied and more flexible FP services; (4) seek support from local governments and institutions for a decentralized FP program; (5) promote awareness, especially among African politicians, planners, and decisionmakers, of the links between population and development; and (6) revise FP policy statements to reflect the large numbers of adult unmarried women and the high rates of adolescent pregnancy.  Two of the four background papers are appended.","Family Planning Program Effectiveness Study Workshop (3 Apr 1979)","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","12/1/1979 12:00:00 AM","","Family planning|Development strategies|Family planning policy|Development program planning","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAN196.pdf","4,184 KB","000156 - USAID.

"PROJECT TO DETERMINE SCIENTIFICALLY THE TRANSFERABILITY OF AGRO-PRODUCTION TECHNOLOGY AMONG TROPICAL AND SUB-TROPICAL COUNTRIES IS EVALUATED FOR THE PERIOD 6/76 TO 3/79. THIS EVALUATION, CONDUCTED ON-SITE BY A TEAM OF EXPERTS, IS ATTACHED TO THE PES DATED 6/15/79 (PD-AAF-309-A1). DURING THE INITIAL TRANSFER STUDIES AT THE MAUNALOA SITE ON MOLOKAI, PHOSPHOROUS AND LIME WERE THE VARIABLES SELECTED TO TEST THE TRANSFER CONCEPT.  HOWEVER, LACK OF RESPONSE TO LIME LED TOTHE SELECTION OF NITROGEN AS A REPLACEMENT. ALTHOUGH SOYBEANS WERE UNDER INVESTIGATION AT THAT TIME, CORN HAS  BECOME THE SOLE TEST CROP IN THE TRANSFER AND MANAGEMENT EXPERIMENTS BECAUSE OF THE NITROGEN PARAMETER. AT THE IOLE AND KUKAIU SITES ON THE ISLAND OF HAWAII, A MARKED RESPONSE TO PHOSPHOROUS, BUT NOT LIME WAS DEMONSTRATED. HOWEVER, LITTLE RESPONSE OCCURRED BEYOND THE FIRST LEVEL OF APPLIED PHOSPHOROUS DUE TO AN OVERESTIMATION OF PHOSPHOROUS NEED BY THE FOX SORPTION METHOD. SEVERAL CONSECUTIVE CORN CROPS HAVE SHOWN A SIGNIFICANT RESIDUAL CARRYOVER OF PHOSPHOROUS. THE EVALUATORS WERE IMPRESSED WITH THE EXCELLENCE IN PERSONNEL AND COMMENDED THE PROJ STAFF FOR THE ACTIVE TRAINING COMPONENT.  QUALITY AND QUANTITY OF INFORMATIONAL MATERIAL ARE RATED EXCELLENT. ALSO, CONSULTING STATISTITIANS WERE JUDGED TO BE DISPLAYING A HIGH DEGREE OF COMPETENCE AND INNOVATION IN DEVELOPING THE TRANSFER MODEL. RECOMMENDATIONS WERE MADE IN THE FOLLOWING AREAS: 1)STRENGTHENING THE STATISTICAL EVALUATION AND DOCUMENTATION OF THE PROJECT; 2)DOCUMENTING DIFFICULTIES AND CONSTRAINTS OF ANALYTICAL METHODS AND THE NEED FOR LIMITED TISSUE ANALYSIS; 3)INCREASING EMPHASIS ON THE DOCUMENTATION OF THE DATA BANK AND BENCHMARK TECHNOLOGY; 4)STRENGTHENING THE TECHNICAL VISIBILITY OF THE PROJECT AND CERTAIN ASPECTS OF THE TRAINING PROGRAM; AND 5)STRENGTHENING CERTAIN MANAGERIAL ASPECTS OF THE PROJECT SUCH AS REGULAR MEETINGS OF PROJECT LEADERS, INTERACTION WITH USAID MISSIONS, ADDITIONAL CONSULTANTS, TIGHTER CONTROL OF MANAGEMENT EXPERIMENTS, AND RELOCATION OF ONE OF THE PROJECT LEADERS.","Evaluation period: 1 Jun 1976-1 Mar 1979","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/TA-C-1108","","3/1/1979 12:00:00 AM","","Soybeans|Maize|Phosphorus|Nitrogen|Fertilizers|Tropical soils|Agricultural research|Soil research|Soil types|Technical assistance","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAI688.pdf","1,102 KB","001244 - U.S. Dept. of Agriculture","","","English","application/pdf","Evaluation team|Onsite evaluation","","GIORDANO, PAUL M.|EHRENREICH, JOHN H.|FLACH, KLAUS W.","Soil sciences and research","1 Mar 1979","","","","SOIL FAMILIES - HAWAII [SPECIAL EVALUATION REPORT - A1]","","PD-AAI-688","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc5Mzcw","Technical Assistance","9310582"

"Evaluates project to help World Education, Inc. institutionalize within Ghana's Department of Community Development and Social Welfare (DSWCD) a capability to provide non-formal education, including literacy, to rural adults (FLEP project). Special evaluation, dated 10/79, is based on a review of documents and project surveys, and was conducted to determine the feasibility of extending the project 1 year at a cost of $138,000. The project has performed poorly, meeting only a third of its original objectives.  Although FLEP staff have been trained in Accra and in their districts in literacy and community development, functional literacy material (FLM) has reached only 100 of a targeted 1,100 rural adults and only 12 of 25 expected new FLEP groups have been established. (The number of groups has in fact dropped).  Follow-up FLM's and FLM for a fourth vernacular have not been developed, nor have facilitators been trained in the use of such materials.  The key constraint has been lack of printed literacy materials for dissemination to FLEP groups. Failure in delivery of the materials and then of supplies to build an in-house printing capability have hindered project expansion. Nonetheless, revolving funds for small-scale community development projects have been disbursed to an impressive number of groups and the support given to village-level organization by DSWCD staff has been impressive.  Also, the needed literacy materials are due within a week or two.

"The Danfa Comprehensive Rural Health and Family Planning project is a service, research, and training project designed to help find solutions to health problems and to demonstrate feasible methods of delivering effective health and family planning (HFP) services in rural Ghana. The project emphasized four main objectives: (1) strengthening the institutional capability at the Ghana Medical School to conduct research and train doctors in HFP services; (2) transfer of information derived from project activities; (3) demonstration of several different health care models to include family planning as an integrated component suitable to the Ghanaian culture; (4) epidemiological investigation of the state of a rural Ghanaian community, concentrating on factors associated with health and family planning behavior. The formal research and development phase supported by the AID contract resulted in innovative approaches to expand the work of health centers in a cost-effective manner and to involve Ghanaians in solving their own health problems. Rural Ghanaians approve of family planning and will use effective contraceptive methods if provided with necessary information and services. The research experience and the participant training program have greatly enhanced the capability of the Department of Community Health of the Ghana Medical School to teach, plan, and evaluate health programs, and to conduct field research. A number of conclusions, recommendations, and appendices in the Final Report and in the accompanying document, ""Summary Conclusions and Recommendations,"" cover the following topics: (1) status of physical health and the sociodemographic and environmental factors related to it, including maternal and child mortality, nutritional status, immunization, morbidity, and death rate; (2) maternal and child health care delivery including health center and satellite services and health education and evaluation; (3) fertility and the factors influencing its rate among Ghanaian women; (4) family planning activities such as education and contraceptive services; (5) institutional development and information transfer; (6) sources of demographic data and the results of coverage estimates for births and deaths, age and sex distribution, and population growth; (7) longitudinal knowledge, attitudes, and practices surveys; (8) the village health survey; (9) the health practices survey; (10) data processing of survey results and all project statistics; (11) a list and summary of DANFA project publications and reports; (12) a list of participants trained overseas; and (13) a list of AID-DANFA personnel.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/CM/afr-IDA-73-14","","9/1/1979 12:00:00 AM","","Rural areas|Health delivery|Health outreach services|Family planning|Health education|Health research|Health surveys","Ghana","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAH078.pdf","2,120 KB","006862 - University of California at Los Angeles.
