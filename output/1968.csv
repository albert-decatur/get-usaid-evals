"Evaluates selected supervised agricultural credit programs funded by USAID during the period 1964-1968 in Peru.  The credit programs are designed to increase agricultural production and farm income for small and medium-sized farmers.  The report is based on interviews with a sampling of farmers and with personnel from implementing agencies, as well as loan census data and production data. The majority of loan funds are channeled through the ""Plan Costa"", the supervised credit program for coastal farmers administered by the National Agricultural Research and Extension Service (SIPA).  The Plan Costa increased the level of living of the farmers, if not over the long-run, at least during the time of the loan.  No production data are available for Plan Costa borrowers before they participated in the credit program; therefore, production impact of the program is difficult to judge. Success varied greatly between agencies (i.e., districts). Based on interviews with 279 farmers in 5 of SIPA's 54 agencies, crop yields among borrowers were found to be below the coastal average. This is partly due to the lack of water in certain agencies. In the future, SIPA should channel credit to the more productive agencies. The more unstable agencies need aid directed at the basic problems of water supply and soil structure before supervised agricultural credit is warranted. The mere existence of people in an area is not a sufficient basis for provision of supervised credit. At present, all loans are made solely on the basis of general crop budgets for the area. Since each farmer presents a special case, a farm plan should be prepared for the individual farmer or at least for each group of farmers that use similar inputs and have the same levels of skill. The farm plan would include the farmers's present status, where he plans to be in one or two years, and how he plans to get there. Loans thus budgeted on an individual basis will decrease the number of defaults. Report also evaluates the credit programs supervised by Nat Off of Agrarian Reforms & the Nat Forestry Serv. Several recommendations also made re improving prog admn by Agr Dev Bank.","Evaluation period: 1 Jan 1964-1 Jun 1968","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","6/1/1968 12:00:00 AM","","Forestry|Small farms|Farmers|LAND REFORM|Agricultural inputs|Agricultural extension|FARM INCOME|Agricultural production|Agricultural development banks|Agricultural credit|Economic studies|Beneficiary interviews|Project change|Sampling method|Limited data plus","Peru","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAB374A1.pdf","30,683 KB","000891 - University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill","","","English","application/pdf","Evaluation team|Indepth evaluation|Onsite evaluation|Field test","","BAANANTE, CARLOS A.|AMORIN, CESAR|et al.","","1 Jun 1968","","","","EVALUATION OF SELECTED SUPERVISED AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROGRAMS IN PERU","","PD-AAB-374-A1","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc1MDY2","Peru","5270060|5270120"
"Evaluates present rice drying, storage, and milling practices in Laos. Report is based on observatns. Laos does not have sufficient rice productn to satisfy consumer needs. New rice varieties requiring less growing time &amp; responsive to fertilizer have been developed. When irrigatn is possible these new varieties allow farmers to grow 2 crops/yr on the same land. Problems which result with increased rice productn include the following: 1) the harvest gathered at the beginning of the wet season is difficult to dry by traditional methods; 2) rice storage space is inadequate; 3) Laos transportatn does not allow movemt of grain to markets; and 4) milling quality is inadequate. Since current milling techniques often break grains, evaluator recommends utilizatn of larger, more efficient rice mills; and training of millers in proper milling procedures through an outreach program. Many farmers have been convinced in using new rice varieties that agr techniques can be improved with effort but the educatnal level of farmers, along with poor transportatn, and small farm size will require the developmt of simple procedures. Mission should provide a technician to assist Laos devel improved drying, storage, and milling. The research to improve agr techniques could be conducted at the Salakham Rice Exp Sta. Recommendatns include the following: 1) farmers should continue to use traditional sun drying techniques until artificial drying is available through well administered cooperative systems, 2) storage capacity should be increased and grain quality encouraged by having the Govt of Laos (GOL) establish rice grain standards based on Thailand's system, 3) research work on harvesting, drying, and milling of rice should be started; 4) farmers should establish grading procedures for rice mrtg; and 6) when adequate rice production is realized the GOL should investigate potentials for production of other crops.","Evaluation period: 15 Sep 1968-28 Sep 1968","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID-W-607","","10/1/1968 12:00:00 AM","","IRRIGATION|Food storage|Agribusiness|RICE|Crop driers|Agricultural production|Laboratories|Agricultural research|Food marketing|Fertilizers|Technical assistance","Laos","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAC616B1.pdf","328 KB","002009 - Mississippi State University.

"Evaluates performance of the Industrial Development Center (IDC) as of 8/68. IDC, located at Zaria, provides management and technical assistance to small entrepreneurs in Northern Nigeria engaged in woodworking, metals, automotive, leather, or other manufacturing. In the past, this project has experienced numerous difficulties in construction, recruitment of US personnel, equipment procurement and installation, and GONN recruitment of counterpart staff. These have now been solved. During 1967, management workshops were conducted, both at IDC and in the field, for 300 participants.  IDC provided consultation to 125 small establishments and prepared formal feasibility studies as required. During the past 6 months, IDC conducted 9 woodworking demonstrations for 54 supervisory personnel and 5 metalworking demonstrations for 37 personnel, IDC also regularly provided on-the-spot, extension-type demonstrations from mobile equipped carryalls of woodworking, metals, and automotive equipment. IDC now provides technical advice to the Small Industry Credit Scheme (SIC) in assessing loan applications and monitoring subsequent implementation. As a result of IDC's own activity and of the joint IDC/SIC activities, 27 firms have been established or expanded as of 6/30/68, with a total new investment of $504,560 and 465 additional employees. The major remaining problem is the present operation of IDC under the umbrella of the Interim Common Services Agency, which is scheduled to phase out by 3/69. It is essential that IDC be transferred to the Federal Ministry of Industries. Evaluator recommends that USAID request Peace Corps Volunteers for IDC assignment throughout the 6 Northern states as industrial specialists. Also, the present USAID support should be continued until project termination in 6/70.","Evaluation period: Through 1 Aug 1968","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","9/1/1968 12:00:00 AM","","Private enterprises|Management training|Extension services|Industry|Small scale enterprises|Limited data","Nigeria","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAA856C1.pdf","1,538 KB","008586 - USAID.

"EVALUATES PROJECT PERFORMANCE FROM 1964 TO 1968 IN BRAZIL. PROJECT WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR A SCHEMATIC MAP OF THE WESTERN 2/3'S OF BRAZIL IDENTIFYING AGRICULTURAL AREAS, SOIL AND INTERPRTIVE MAPS WITH SUPPORTING TEXT, RECONNAISSANCE SOIL SURVEYS OF AREAS PROMISING FOR AGRICULTURE, AND 60 TO 100 FIELD TECHNCINS FOR THE DIVISION OF PEDOLOGY AND SOIL FERTILITY (DPFS). ON-SITE EVALUATION WAS MADE. PROGRESS HAS BEEN REASONABLE  DESPITE STOPPAGES IN RECRUITMENT AND FIELD WORK DUE TO INADEQUATE FUNDING. THE RESULTING SCHEMATIC SOIL MAP AND 3 INTERPRETIVE MAPS WITH TEXT ARE EXPECTED TO HAVE A FAR-REACHING INFLUENCE ON BRAZIL'S DEVELOPMENT. THE 4 MAPS WERE USED PRIOR TO PUBLICATION OF THE TEXT TO PLAN COLONIZATION,AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT,AND LOCATE HIGHWAYS INTO BRAZIL'S INTERIOR. THERE IS STILL A HIGH DEGREE OF URGENCY FOR MORE DETAILED SURVEYS,ESPECIALLY IN GOIAS AND MATO GROSSO. SETTLEMENT OF UNOCCUPPIED REGIONS WILL CONTRIBUTE TO BRAZIL'S PROGRESS AND STIMULATE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT. TO MEET THE DEMANDS OF THE NEXT 10 YEARS,30 MILLION HECTARES OF HIGH FERTILITY NEED TO BE LOCATED WHICH HAVE ADEQUATE ACCESS TO MARKETS,CLIMATE,VEGETATN,SURFACE WATER,ETC. UNFORTUNATELY,BUDGETARY AND PERSONNEL RESTRICTNS HAVE REDUCED THE AREAS OF LAND AVAILABLE FOR STUDY. SELECTED FARMERS IN SURVEY AREAS HAVE BEEN CONSULTED AS TO AGRICULTURAL CAPACITIES BUT THEY HAVE NOT FREELY RESPONDED TO QUESTNS. ALTHOUGH STAFFING HAS BEEN SLOWER THAN EXPECTED DUE TO INADEQUATE FUNDING,BRAZIL'S SOIL SCIENTISTS NOW HAVE ADEQUATE COMPETENCY TO HANDLE MOST PROBLEMS WITHOUT US HELP. DPFS'S STAFF IS TO BE INCREASED AND IN-SERVICE TRAINING PROVIDED FOR MORE STAFF. EVALUATOR RECOMMENDS THAT: SCHEMATIC MAPS WITH ACCOMPANING INTERPRETIVE MAPS FOR THE EASTERN 1/3 OF BRAZIL BE PREPARED WITH DPFS RESPONSIBLE FOR DEVELOPMENT,MAINTENANCE,AND COORDINATION OF THE NATIONAL SYSTEM OF SOIL CLASSIFICATN & CORRELATN; RESEARCH RESULTS OBTAINED FROM EXPERIMENTAL AREAS BE CORRELATED WITH SOIL TYPES; AND SIZE,SCOPE,AND EFFECTIVENESS OF SOIL STAFFS BE INCREASED WITHIN THE MINISTRY OF AGRICULTURE.","Evaluation period: 30 May 1964-26 May 1968","Special Evaluation","Documents","PIO/T80253","","6/1/1968 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural product marketing|Soil types|MAPS|Roads|Penetration roads|Rural development|Agricultural development|Development strategies|Cadasters|Land development|Agricultural land|SOIL RESEARCH|Project change","Brazil","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAA285A1.pdf","1,174 KB","001244 - U.S. Dept. of Agriculture","","","English","application/pdf","Country program evaluation|Indepth evaluation|Onsite evaluation","","HOCKENSMITH, ROY D.","","27 Jun 1968","","","","RESOURCES SURVEY PROJECT OF THE FRONTIER HOMESTEAD PROGRAM MINISTRY OF AGRICULTURE, BRAZIL (05/26/68-06/27/68)","","PD-AAA-285-A1","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc1ODAx","Brazil","512024904"
