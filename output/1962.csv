"This report is one of twenty-three country studies conducted as part of the worldwide survey of returned participants in accordance with AID/W instructions and guidelines contained in ICATO Circular A-175, November 1959.  The major purpose of this global effort was to obtain an overview of how the participant training progam was progressing to ascertain ways in which future training might be more effective at the country, AID/W, and training institution levels.  This country study presents factual data concerning the participant population and provides some measure of the effectiveness of the training.  The study involved structured oral interviews with 182 returned Nicaraguan participants, 75 supervisors, and 13 U.S. technicians concerning the training program. The report contains no recommendations, per se, but several are implied in the summary in the areas of pre-departure preparation and utilization of training.

The major purpose of this global effort was to obtain an overview of how the participant training program was progressing to ascertain ways in which future training might be more effective at the country, AID/W, and training institution levels.  This report is somewhat different than the other twenty-two inasmuch as the Israel Mission was closing and the authors did not prepare conclusions and recommendations for improvements in future programs.  The report presents rather raw data to AID/W for use in the regional and worldwide analysis.  However, a set of suggestions were made in a transmittal memorandum to the report which focused on training design, pre-departure preparation, support services, and follow-up.  The interview sample included 369 participants who had returned between 1951 and 1960, 200 supervisors, and seven USAID technicians.
