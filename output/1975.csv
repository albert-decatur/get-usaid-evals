"Evaluates performance of the Thai National Family Planning Project (NFPP) from 1968 to 1975.  Purpose of proj is to deliver Family Planning Services (FP) to families.  Eval methodology based on statistics from NFPP and other agencies, interviews with Ministry of Health Staff, and on-site observatns. NFPP has brought FP to 2.275 million reducing Thailand's birth rate from 3.3-2.54%.  All contraceptive methods are available and the number of acceptors has exceeded projectns each yr: FP training is now included in all Thai medical trng progs, in which 179 NFPP personnel have participated.  Both overseas training and improved staff transportation have improvd staff performance.  Evaluator also feels clinics maintain excellent client records. Proj's impact has been impossible to demonstrate due to poor demographic records.  Problems in adequately providing FP resulting -- -due to some medical centers lacking certain forms of contraceptn such as sterilizatn; staff not dealing with numerous rumors concerning contraceptive side effects; insufficient supplies of equipment and doctors; and lack of staff supervision. Also, FP Centers are often located where land is donated and not where they are needed. It is recommended that: 1. there should be a projected target for every contraceptive method, based on the number of clinics & staff in each province; 2. doctors & equip be assigned to medical centers; 3. nurses trained abroad in operational tech be assigned to the field & not medical centers; 4. weekly supervisory visits be conducted; 5. more IUD insertion time be provided; 6. all midwives carry condoms & the pill with them into the field; 7. all FP equipment & supplies be tested for the Thai physiology, psychology, and socio-economic conditions; 8.  FP clinics be provided with at least 2 types of oral contraceptives; 9. more adequate transportation budgets be allowed; 10. FP charges be standardized; and, 11. record keeping be improved.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","5/1/1975 12:00:00 AM","","National level|Government departments|Family planning services|Delivery systems|Contraceptive distribution|Family planning occupations|Medical education|Beneficiary count","Thailand","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAL067.pdf","1,846 KB","008613 - USAID.

"BECAUSE THE TWO SEED PROCESSING CENTERS CONSTRUCTED IN HONDURAS IN 1967 HAD NOT ACHIEVED MAXIMUM OPERATIONAL CAPACITY OR EFFICIENCY, ASSISTANCE WAS REQUESTED IN 1974. WHEN THE SEED CENTERS WERE OPENED, THE SEED PRODUCED WAS OF POOR QUALITY ATTEMPTS TO MARKET IT WERE NOT VERY SUCCESSFUL; WHEN SEED WAS PROCESSED, THE COST WAS PROHIBITIVE, THE QUALITY WAS USUALLY LOW, AND THUS DEMAND WAS LOW. IN ADDITION, IT WAS FOUND THAT 1) POOR QUALITY SEED WAS RECEIVED BY THE CENTERS, MAKING IT DIFFICULT TO PRODUCE HIGH QUALITY SEED; 2) SEED PRODUCERS COULD NOT GET PAID PROMPTLY; 3) THERE WAS POOR MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION; AND 4) PRODUCTION AND MARKETING OF THE SEED WAS NOT EFFECTIVE. ON TOP OF THESE, A RECENT HURRICANE AND DROUGHT HAD MADE THE SITUATION EVEN WORSE. THE LOAN AGREEMENT TO AID THE SEED CENTERS CONTAINS PROVISIONS FOR A REVOLVING FUND TO PAY COMPETITIVE PRICES TO CONTRACT SEED PRODUCERS IMMEDIATELY UPON RECEIPT OF THEIR SEED. PROVISIONS WERE MADE ALSO FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A VERY CLOSE WORKING RELATIONSHIP (AGREEMENT) BETWEEN THE MAG AND THE BNF (BANCO NACIONAL DE FOMENTO). SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS FOR AND COMMENTS UPON THE TWO SEED CENTERS ARE DETAILED IN THIS REPORT.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/TA-C-1219","","1/1/1975 12:00:00 AM","","Evaluation|Materials handling operations|Production management|Seed production","Honduras","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAB470.pdf","760 KB","001385 - Mississippi State University","","","English","application/pdf","","","Andrews, C.

"THE INDUSTRIAL STANDARDS PROJECT 910 WAS AN EXPERIMENT TO TEST BOTH PROCEDURAL AND SUBSTANTIVE ELEMENTS OF TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. AS AN EXPERIMENT, THE PROJECT MAY NOT HAVE BEEN EXPECTED TO SOLVE A PROBLEM (OR ACHIEVE A PURPOSE) BUT RATHER TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THE TYPE OF ASSISTANCE PROBABLY COULD SOLVE THE PROBLEM IF APPLIED ON A LARGER SCALE. GENERAL CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS ARE DETAILED AT THE END OF THIS EVALUATION. THIS EVALUATION OF THE INDUSTRIAL STANDARDS PROJECT IS BASED ON A SAMPLING OF ITS EXTENSIVE RAMIFICATIONS. THE SAMPLING WAS DETERMINED BY READING MOST OF THE REPORTS ISSUED DURING THE PERIOD AND SOME OF THE GENERAL FILES; INTERVIEWING SOME OF THE MANY OFFICERS IN THE NATIONAL BUREAU OF STANDARDS AND AID ASSOCIATED WITH THE PROJECT; AND VISITING ECUADOR, BOLIVIA, AND ETHIOPIA. IN EACH COUNTRY THERE WAS AN EXTENSIVE ROUND OF INTERVIEWS AND IN THE FIRST TWO VISITS TO LABORATORIES OF THE STANDARDS INSTITUTIONS.

"Summarizes a four-year joint project between A.I.D. and the University of Massachusetts.  Goals in this exploration of non- formal education were: 1) To create and field-test a range of non-formal education techniques using local institutions to im- plement and support these techniques in a field situation; 2) to develop a number of non-formal educational methodologies which can be used by existing Ecuadorian institutions; 3) to implement selected methodologies with local institutions, including the Ministry of Education, with an on-going evaluation system desig- ned to provide both current as well as terminal evidence of pro- gram impact; 4) to make these methodologies available to other interested agencies and to provide support for their efforts; 5) to devise and test training procedures of carrying out these methodologies and of using the support materials; and 6) to pro- vide techinical assistance in non-formal education to the Minis- try of Education, and to assist the Ecuadorian Government and other Ecuadorian institutions development non-formal education projects.  The actual activities carried out during this project are examined and evaluated here in a question-and-answer format.  Among the materials used in this project were games, and human ""facilitators"" were trained to implement them. Each year of the project, the scope and goals of both the games and facilitators were evaluated and often modified or increased as needed. Now as an office of the Ministry of Education, the Non-Formal project expects to pursue its original goals. However, the scope of its work will be more limited, as will the opportunity to explore highly experimental non-formal models; the accent will be on con- solidation and systemization of the games made to date.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/TA-C-1124","","1/1/1975 12:00:00 AM","","Nonformal education|Universities and colleges|Educational methods|Games","Ecuador","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAB684.pdf","675 KB","001444 - University of California at Los Angeles","","","English","application/pdf","","","Laosa, L.

"The format of this report was a series of questions and answers. Thus, this series of questions here are an outline of the report; the answers were much too long and complex to reproduce here.  Volume III outlines the goals of the project, discusses each project year's activities, and answers in detail thirteen ques- tions concerning its evaluation. They are:  1) What does the University of Massachusetts Non-Formal Education Project purport to do? 2) How does the University of Massachusetts NFE Project go about implementing its goals and objectives? 3) To what ex- tent is the University of Massachuestts NFE Project carrying outs its intended objectives effectively? 4) What are the learning outcomes of selected non-formal education materials developed by the University of Massachusetts NFE Project? 5) What are the characteristics of the more and less effective materials devel- oped by the University of Massachusetts NFE Project? 6) What are the characteristics of materials that work well with learners of what characteristics? What are the best matchings? 7) What facilitator/teacher variables have affected the relative effec- tiveness of various materials? 8) What are the motivational at- tributes of each of the four educational games selected for in- depth experimental analysis in the evaluation? 9) What changes in attitudes and behavior (critical consciousness) are produced by each of the selected non-formal education games? 10) What sequencing factors or prerequisities are important for the four non-formal education games? 11) What are the effects of replay frequency for each of the non-formal education games? 12) Can the University of Massachusetts NFE Project be replicated in other countries? What conditions are most necessary to ensure success? and 13) What is needed to develop effective non-formal education materials and programs in countries similar to Educador?","","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/TA-C-1124","","1/1/1975 12:00:00 AM","","Educational materials|Nonformal education|Educational methods|Games|Universities and colleges","Ecuador","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAC080.pdf","3,042 KB","001444 - University of California at Los Angeles","","","English","application/pdf","","","Laosa, L.

"AN EVALUATION OF EXISTING USAID TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO THE LAKE VICTORIA FISHERIES PROJECT OF THE EAST AFRICAN FRESHWATER FISHERIES ORGANIZATION (EAFFRO). EAFFRO HAS DETERMINED THE EXISTENCE OF OFFSHORE DEMERSAL STOCKS (MAINLY HAPLOCHROMIS) THAT COULD BE EXPLOITED; ANNUAL YIELD HAS BEEN ESTIMATED AT 200,000 TONS, OR ABOUT TWICE THE PRESENT HARVEST OF INSHORE WATERS. THE PRESENT CONCERN IS THAT OFFSHORE MECHANIZED FISHING MAY HAVE DETRIMENTAL EFFECTS UPON THE HEAVILY EXPLOITED INSHORE STOCKS. EAFFRO'S RESEARCH ACTIVITIES APPEAR TOO AMBITIOUS FOR THE AVAILABLE STAFF, AND IT IS FELT THAT EAFFRO WILL NOT BE ABLE TO PROVIDE MANAGEMENT GUIDELINES IN TIME TO AVOID COMPETITION BETWEEN THE TRADITIONAL INSHORE AND PROPOSED TRAWL FISHERY. THE ASSESSMENT OF THE PROPOSAL TRAWL FISHERY HAS NOT BEEN EMPHASIZED SUFFICIENTLY IN THE WORK PLANS OF THE USAID BIOLOGIST. THERE HAVE BEEN INSUFFICIENT COMMUNICATION AND COOPERATION BETWEEN EAFFRO PERSONNEL AT ALL LEVELS AND FISHERIES DEPARTMENT PERSONNEL, AND THE INFORMATION BEING PRODUCED APPEARS NOT TO BE IN A FORM AND OF A TYPE THAT CAN BE USED READILY BY THE PEOPLE DIRECTLY INVOLVED IN THE DEVELOPMENT AND MANAGEMENT OF THE FISHERY.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/CSD-2455","","1/1/1975 12:00:00 AM","","Lake Victoria|Deep sea fisheries|Inland fisheries|Development organizations|Regional development|Fishing equipment","East Africa","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAC165.pdf","739 KB","001238 - University of Rhode Island","","","English","application/pdf","","","Sutinen, Jon G.|Davies, W.

"THE LAND SALE GUARANTY PROGRAMS IN BOTH ECUADOR AND COSTA RICA WERE BASED ON TWO MAJOR PREMISES. ONE WAS THAT THERE WERE LAND OWNERS WILLING TO SELL LAND TO SMALL FARMERS AT REASONABLE PRICES AND ON REASONABLE TERMS, PROVIDED THEY WERE GIVEN A GUARANTY OF PAYMENT. THE SECOND PREMISE WAS THAT THERE WERE NUMEROUS SMALL FARMERS WHO HAD A STRONG DESIRE TO OWN LAND. IN ECUADOR THE FIRST PREMISE WAS NOT TESTED BECAUSE A NEW GOVERNMENT INSTITUTED PROGRAMS THAT MADE UNNECESSARY THE NEED FOR AID'S LAND SALE GUARANTY PROGRAM. IN COSTA RICA THE FIRST PREMISE DID NOT HOLD BECAUSE LANDOWNERS REQUIRED LARGE DOWNPAYMENTS. THE LACK OF MONEY FOR DOWNPAYMENTS WAS PROBABLY THE SINGLE MOST SIGNIFICANT FACTOR IN THE LIMITED USE OF THE PROGRAM. ONLY FIVE CAMPESINO GROUPS OF 21 MEMBERS EACH PARTICIPATED. IN BOTH COUNTRIES THERE WERE DIFFICULTIES OVER THE AID REQUIREMENT WHICH PREVENTED GUARANTY FUNDS FROM BEING DISBURSED UNTIL THERE WAS AN ACTUAL CALL ON THE GUARANTY. INCLUDED IN THIS REPORT IS A CHECKLIST OF QUESTIONS RELATING TO POTENTIAL PROBLEMS A GROUP MAY ENCOUNTER IN ATTEMPTS TO OWN AND OPERATE A FARM COLLECTIVELY. THEY CONCERN LEGAL STATUS OF THE GROUP, ITS SOCIAL COMPOSITION, GOVERNMENT, SKILLS, PAST EXPERIENCES, ACQUISITION OF LAND, USE OF GOVERNMENT BONDS FOR PAYMENT TO LANDOWNERS, WORK ROLES, CAPITAL INVESTMENTS, CREDIT, TRAINING, AUXILIARY SERVICES AND HOUSING, AND MANAGEMENT AND ADMINISTRATION.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1975 12:00:00 AM","","Landless Laborers|Financing|Land ownership|Purchasing|Land tenure|Technical assistance|Communal land|Small farms","Costa Rica|Ecuador","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAD112.pdf","1,644 KB","000108 - USAID.

"IN MOST OF LATIN AMERICA THE MUNICIPALITY IS THE MAIN UNIT OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT, TYPICALLY ENCOMPASSING A TOWN AND A SURROUNDING RURAL AREA. IT IS OFTEN CALLED A DISTRICT, A CANTON, OR A MUNICIPALITY, AND IT MAY BE SUBDIVIDED INTO SMALLER UNITS. MUNICIPAL DEVELOPMENT IS OFTEN AS MUCH RURAL AS URBAN DEVELOPMENT IN THE LATIN AMERICAN CONTEXT. THE MOTIVATION BEHIND ESTABLISHING A MUNICIPAL DEVELOPMENT INSTITUTION (MDI) IN NEARLY ALL CASES HAS BEEN TO PROVIDE A SOURCE OF CONCESSIONAL CREDITS FOR PUBLIC WORKS AND OTHER CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. IN ADDITION, MOST OF THE INSTITUTIONS HAVE INCLUDED A COMPONENT TO DELIVER TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND TRAINING TO MUNICIPAL LEADERS AND OFFICIALS. THE VALUE AND POTENTIAL OF FOUR OPERATING MUNICIPAL DEVELOPMENT INSTITUTIONS ARE ASSESSED AS INSTRUMENTS FOR THE PROMOTION OF SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. THERE IS A BRIEF DISCUSSION OF THE MUNICIPAL DEVELOPMENT INSTITUTIONS AND THE OBJECTIVES OF THE PROGRAMS WHICH THEY HAVE CARRIED OUT ALONG WITH AN EVALUATION OF THE IMPACT OF THESE PROGRAMS AT THE MUNICIPAL LEVEL. THIS IS THE LEVEL AT WHICH THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THESE INSTITUTIONS CAN BE BEST ASSESSED. THE MDIS ARE EXAMINED AS AGENTS OR INSTRUMENTS OF NATIONAL AS WELL AS MUNICIPAL DEVELOPMENT AGAINST THE BACKGROUND OF ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND NEEDS IDENTIFIED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. THERE IS A DISCUSSION OF GAPS IN PAST PERFORMANCE AND POTENTIAL AREAS FOR STRENGTHENING THE MUNICIPAL DEVELOPMENT EFFORT.

"THE MATERNAL AND CHILD HEALTH (MCH) EXTENSION PROJECT WAS DESIGNED AS A REGIONAL PROJECT TO ASSIST SMALL ""NON-EMPHASIS"" AFRICAN COUNTRIES TO IMPROVE AND EXPAND BASIC HEALTH SERVICES FOR MOTHERS AND CHILDREN AND TO INTRODUCE CHILD SPACING AS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THESE SERVICES. AT THE REQUEST OF THE A.I.D./AFRICA BUREAU AND THE A.I.D./OFFICE OF POPULATION, A TWO MEMBER TEAM HAS EVALUATED THE MCH EXTENSION PROJECT ACTIVITIES IN THE GAMBIA AND DAHOMEY. THE ON-SITE REVIEW WAS CONDUCTED FROM MAY 18-31, 1975. THIS REPORT IS DIVIDED INTO THE FOLLOWING SECTIONS: SUMMARY CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS; HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF THE PROJECT; PROJECT GOAL AND PURPOSES; FINDINGS IN THE GAMBIA; FINDINGS IN DAHOMEY, AND CONTRACTOR PERFORMANCE. THE PROJECT GOAL AND PURPOSES WERE FOUND TO BE APPROPRIATE IN THE LIGHT OF THE GAMBIA'S AND DAHOMEY'S STATED NATIONAL HEALTH OBJECTIVES AND PRIORITIES AND OF A.I.D.'S HEALTH STRATEGY FOR AFRICA. HEALTH EDUCATION, NUTRITION AND CHILD SPACING HAVE BEEN RECOGNIZED AS ESSENTIAL MCH SERVICES. SIMPLE LOW COST METHODS OF ADDING THESE FUNCTIONS AND IMPROVING SERVICES HAVE BEEN DEMONSTRATED IN THE PILOT AREAS. IN-SERVICE TRAINING HAS BEEN PROVIDED FOR HEALTH WORKERS IN AND OUTSIDE THE PILOT AREAS. THE POTENTIAL EXISTS IN BOTH COUNTRIES FOR THE EXTENSION OF DEMONSTRATED IMPROVEMENTS IN MCH SERVICES. IT WAS RECOMMENDED THAT A.I.D. CONTINUE TO SUPPORT MCH ACTIVITIES IN BOTH GAMBIA AND DAHOMEY AND THAT A WAY BE FOUND TO GIVE MORE AUTONOMY TO CONTINUED PROJECT DEVELOPMENT SO THAT PROJECT ACTIVITIES CAN PROCEED AT THEIR OWN PACE IN EACH COUNTRY.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/csd-2604","","1/1/1975 12:00:00 AM","","CHILDREN|DELIVERY SYSTEMS|FAMILY PLANNING|WOMEN|NUTRITION","Benin|Gambia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNRAB635.pdf","2,282 KB","000262 - American Public Health Association","","","English","application/pdf","","","HILBORN, ELIZABETH|WILLIAMS, WALKER C.","Health care","1975","","","","REPORT OF AN EVALUATION OF THE MATERNAL AND CHILD HEALTH EXTENSION PROJECT IN THE GAMBIA AND DAHOMEY","","PN-RAB-635","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTYyNjQ0","Africa Regional","6980358"

"FIRST PHASE OF TAX OFFICE REORGANIZATION COMPLETED WITH CREATION OF 5 MAJOR FUNCTIONAL DIVISIONS: AUDIT,COLLECTION,PLANNING,LEGAL COUNSEL AND ADMINISTRATION. THE IMPLEMENTATION PHASE IS UNDERWAY; THE AUDIT DIVISION IS OPERATIONAL. LEGISLATION HAS BEEN PROPOSED TO LEGALLY SANCTION ALL REORGANIZATION MEASURES AND TO VEST IN THE DIRECTOR GENERAL (DG) OF THE TAX OFFICE OVERALL ADMINISTRATIVE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE OPERATIONS OF THE TAX OFFICE. STATISTICAL INFORMATION ON ALL TAXES HAS IMPROVED WITH APPOINTMENT OF NEW DIRECTOR FOR THE DIVISION OF DATA PROCESSING WHO WORKS WITH THE OAS ADVISOR TO IMPROVE QUALITY & TIMELY SUBMISSION OF REVENUE DATA. A SINGLE-PAYMENT DOCUMENT HAS BEEN DESIGNED TO ALLOW DIRECT PAYMENT OF TAXES TO THE TAX OFFICE. THE EFFECT WILL BE TO IMPROVE QUALITY & REDUCE PROCESSING TIME,THUS IMPROVING MANAGEMENT'S USE OF STATISTICS AND OVERALL REVENUE COLLECTIONS. TAX COURSES WILL BE CONDUCTED FOR 350 TAX OFFICE EMPLOYEES IN THE NEW SYSTEMS. A REPORT ON THE OFFICE OF INTERNAL TAXES (FOR FUELS,ALCOHOL,TOBACCO,BEVERAGES) IS NEARING COMPLETION BY AN IRS TECHNICAL ADVISOR. REGARDING COLLECTION PHASE OF PROJECT, A COLLECTION DIVISION WAS INCLUDED IN REORGANIZATION OF THE TAX OFFICE AND POLICY GUIDELINES COVERING MAJOR DIVISION FUNCTIONS HAVE BEEN APPROVED: INSTALLMENT PAYMENTS WILL BE ALLOWED ONLY IN HARDSHIP CASES; TAX AMNESTIES HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED; AN ENFORCEMENT UNIT HAS BEEN CREATED TO FOLLOW-UP ON NON-FILERS AND DELINQUENT TAXPAYERS. A MONTHLY BULLETIN IS NOW BEING PUBLISHED FOR TAXPAYER EDUCATION ON TAX LAWS,DECREES,ADMINISTRATIVE RULINGS.

"EVALUATES USAID FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE FROM 1/1/68-6/1/75 TO BOLIVIA'S SERVICO NATIONAL DE DESARROLLO DE LA COMUNIDAD (SNDC.) SNDC HAS ESTABLISHED 5 REGIONAL TRAINING CENTERS (AT PILLAPI, ZUDANEZ, NUCCHU, PARACAYA & MUYURINA) FOR RURAL CAMPESINO COMMUNITY LEADERS. EVAL TEAM VISITED THE NATL OFFICE & EACH OF THE REGIONAL OFFICES. OVERALL THE PROG PERFORMED IMPRESSIVELY DESPITE VERY LIMITED RESOURCES. THE NATL-LEVEL STAFF WAS VERY SMALL & OVER-WORKED. THERE APPEARED TO BE A MIMIMUM OF COORDINATION BETWEEN THE TRNG DIV AND OTHER DEPTS OF SNDC -- PARTICULARLY ITS DEPT OF COMMUNITY PROJS. THE NATL STAFF DISREGARDED OTHER RELATED EDUC PROGS WITH WHICH IT COULD LINK-UP TO THE ADVANTAGE OF BOTH. COMMUNICATION PROBLEMS WITH THE REGIONAL CENTERS RESULTED FROM THE AUTOCRATIC BACKGROUND OF ITS STAFF & THEIR INABILITY TO SEE THE NECESSITY OF EXPLAINING WHY IT DID OR DID NOT DO CERTAIN THINGS. THE FACILITIES OF THE REGIONAL CENTERS WERE IN GENERAL INAPPROPRIATE AS TRNG CENTERS. THE PHYSICAL CONDITIONS WERE DEPRESSING AND IN A GENERAL STATE OF DISREPAIR. THE STAFFS WORKED UNDER TREMENDOUS CONSTRAINTS WITH LOW SALARIES,MINIMAL EQUIPMENT & ISOLATION. MORALE WAS LOW AND THE STAFF TURN-OVER RATE WAS HIGH. THE EDUC BACKGROUND OF THE INSTRUCTORS PREDOMINANTLY CONSISTED OF A FEW YRS OF COLLEGE-LEVEL AGRICULTURE. THE CURRICULAE HAD REMAINED RELATIVELY UNCHANGED FOR MANY YRS. REPORT RECOMMENDS INCREASED STAFF WITH WIDER EDUCATIONAL BACKGROUNDS FOR BOTH THE NATL OFFICE & THE REGIONAL CENTERS. USAID SHOULD ASSIGN A FULL-TIME ADVISOR WITH EXPERTISE IN NON-FORMAL EDUC,TEACHING MATERIALS & TRNG METHODS. EVALUATORS DETERMINED THAT SNDC SHOULD UPGRADE THE SALARIES FOR REGIONAL TRNG STAFFS. COURSE COSTS FOR PARTICIPANTS SHOULD BE INCREASED. RECOMMENDS THAT CURRICULAE INCLUDE MORE COOPERATIVE TRNG INCLUDING BUDGETING,BOOKEEPING AND MANAGEMENT.

"Evaluates 211D grants to Cornell University, the University of Minnesota (UM), Michigan State University (MSU), and Iowa State University (ISU).  Special evaluation covers the period 5/70-3/75. The impact of 211D support on research, staff development, graduate training, and talent sharing is difficult to quantify. Moreover, grant agreements lacked specific targets for number of staff devoted to LDC-related research, foreign graduate students in agricultural economics, or use of university services by A.I.D. and LDC's.  While all 4 schools now have more faculty involved in agriculture and rural development, their use of 211D funds has varied.  Some have stressed participation of faculty from nonagricultural fields and others use of graduate students. The flexibility of the 211D mechanism has allowed support of research not germane to A.I.D.'s primary interests. Ironically, while increasing the schools' capacities to perform significant research and to develop informational and personnel resources, the grants have also in most cases increased administrative and academic demands on faculty, thus limiting time spent on research and availability to A.I.D. Specifically:  (1) The grant to ISU has increased the size of core staff for development economics.  Funds were used primarily to support graduate research.  The 211D supplement to a sector analysis in Thailand was an important use of ISU's 211D-trained faculty and graduate students. (2) Cornell also used 211D mostly to support graduate training. Faculty of the Department of Agricultural Economics have had only limited involvement, and that department, while strengthened, has not reached the point where it can provide A.I.D. with contractual assistance. (3) MSU has expanded its work in sector analysis, marketing, and rural employment generation in Africa, and in international trade and multiple cropping.  A significant new sector analysis methodology has been developed.  Most funds have been used for graduate research. (4) UM has used 211D to partially fund research and training for at least 20 staff from the Departments of Economics and Agriculture and Applied Economics.","Evaluation period: 30 May 1970-24 Mar 1975|Prefaced by transmittal memorandum","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","3/1/1975 12:00:00 AM","","Institution building|Economic research|Agricultural economics|Technical assistance|Universities and colleges","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAA472A1.pdf","2,368 KB","000197 - USAID.

"This project is a complex of indigenous institutions (rural banks, extension system, grain marketing agency); national media; tested high yielding rice varieties and technology for their use; and an active agrarian reform program; all being interacted upon by a farm population ready to move from a traditional acceptance of risk aversion to becoming economic partners in their country's development.  The evaluators believe that while some aspects of this program could serve as a guide to other countries, it is not replicable in its Philippine format and they caution against over-publicizing Philippine results as a possible cure-all for other countries' rural development and food production dilemmas. The project is achieving its goals.  The initial programs accomplished the two purposes set for them: alleviate the situation caused by flood and drought; and, increase production of rough rice. The delivery system set up is working quite well.  Many of the program's early problems have been overcome or diminished.  The evaluators made 14 recommendations including: (1) the Government of the Philippines and USAID should continue to support the program with particular emphasis on high repayment rates for loans and continued development of the agricultural technologists capabilities; and (2) research studies of the credit system and its uses should be initiated.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/CM/OTR-C-73-198","","3/1/1975 12:00:00 AM","","RICE|Agricultural production|Agricultural credit|Small farms|Farmers|Agricultural extension|Agricultural product marketing|SEED TESTING","Philippines","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAB625.pdf","3,163 KB","","","","English","application/pdf","","","BERNHART, RICHARD V.|BORTON, RAYMOND L.|et al.","Food crops","1 Mar 1975","","","","FINAL REPORT OF AN EVALUATION OF PHILIPPINE ACCELERATED RICE PRODUCTION PROGRAM","","PN-AAB-625","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc0MDE2","Philippines","4929706"

"THE PROVINCIAL DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE PROJECT (PDAP) IS SOUNDLY CONCEIVED AND GOOD PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE IN ITS IMPLEMENTATION. IT IS WELL UNDERSTOOD AND SUPPORTED BY MISSION AND HOST COUNTRY LEADERSHIP. IT HAS A CLEAR FOCUS ON CREATING THE SEVERAL PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENT CAPABILITIES NEEDED TO MEET THE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT NEEDS OF PRIMARILY RURAL POPULATIONS. THE UNIQUE ADVISORY TEAM HAS BEEN AN IMPORTANT FACTOR IN PDAP'S SUCCESS. IN ADDITION, USING US EXCESS EQUIPMENT HAS GIVEN THIS PROJECT A HIGH RETURN ON AID'S INVESTMENT. PDAP'S CONCENTRATION ON DEVELOPING PROVINCIAL CAPABILITY IN INFRASTRUCTURE, TAX ADMINISTRATION, AND PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT HAS PROVED TO BE AN EFFECTIVE MEANS OF ENABLING PROVINCES TO IMPROVE SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. A PROGRAM WITH A WIDER AREA OF OPERATIONS WOULD HAVE PRODUCED LESS SATISFACTORY RESULTS. THE EVALUATORS MADE 17 SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS INCLUDING: (1)EXPAND THE PROJECT TO PROVIDE SPECIALIZED ASSISTANCE TO CHARTERED CITIES IN PDAP PROVINCES, AND LATER, COUNTRYWIDE; (2)ARRANGE FOR SOCIO-ECONOMIC RESEARCH AND EVALUATION SERVICES; (3)ENCOURAGE PROVINCIAL INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAMMING TO EXPAND ITS ACTIVITIES INTO THE DEVELOPMENT OF SMALL-SCALE IRRIGATION FACILITIES; AND (4)ENCOURAGE PDAP TO TRY TO FOSTER THE COOPERATION OF THE PRIVATE SECTOR.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","4/1/1975 12:00:00 AM","","Public administration|Rural development|Sector planning|Taxation|Government policy|Economic planning|Planning|Provinces|Government departments","Philippines","","","008592 - USAID.

"THE EVALUATION CONCENTRATES ON ANALYZING THE LOGIC AND INTERNAL CONSISTENCY OF THE PROJECT AND THE VALIDITY OF THE ASSUMPTIONS AND ON THE THEORETICAL INCIDENCE BENEFITS. ALTHOUGH PROJECT PERFORMANCE WITH RESPECT TO INPUTS AND OUTPUTS HAS BEEN REASONABLY GOOD, THE PROJECT IMPACT HAS NOT BEEN AS ANTICIPATED. THE EVALUATORS BELIEVE THIS IS BECAUSE OF UNREALISTIC ASSUMPTIONS AND CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH HAVE BEEN ESSENTIALLY BEYOND THE PROJECT'S CONTROL. THE EVALUATORS CONCLUDE THAT A BASIC PROJECT REDESIGN IS CALLED FOR AND THEY SUGGEST SIX ALTERNATIVES. THE PRIMARY RECOMMENDATION IS THAT THE GOVERNMENT AND USAID CONSIDER UNDERTAKING A COMBINATION OF THREE OF THE ALTERNATIVES. THE EMPHASIS OF THIS RECOMMENDTION IS ON IMPROVING THE EFFICIENCY OF EXECUTION OF THE LAND TRANSFER. THE NEW PROJECT DESIGN SHOULD FOCUS ON A GOAL THAT IS SPECIFIC REGARDING THE TRANSFORMATION OF TENANTS INTO AMORTIZING OWNERS AND FACILITATE THEIR ABILITY TO IMPROVE THEIR LIVELIHOOD IN THIS STATUS. THE PROJECT PURPOSE SHOULD BE CHANGED TO CONCENTRATE ON LAND TRANSFER OPERATIONS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL WITH FULLER COLLABORATION OF THE FARMER SUPPORT ORGANIZATIONS AND SYSTEMS ALREADY DEVELOPED.

"GROWING ACCEPTANCE OF NATIONAL COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT SERVICE (NCDS) AGENTS IN THE FIELD, AN INCREASING BACKLOG OF COMMUNITY REQUESTS FOR PROJECTS,AND INCREASING CASH CONTRIBUTIONS ON THE PART OF POOR COMMUNITIES ALL TESTIFY TO PROGRESS TOWARD THE NCDS OBJECTIVE OF REINFORCING THE SELF-HELP COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT CONCEPT IN RURAL AREAS. LACK OF DATA MAKES IT IMPOSSIBLE TO QUANTIFY THE EXTENT TO WHICH THIS IS SO, HOWEVER. THE PROJECTS COMPLETED UNDER LOAN 044 AND THE GROWING UNDERSTANDING AND ACCEPTANCE OF THE NCDS SELF-HELP COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT CONCEPTS HAVE CONTRIBUTED IN A POSITIVE WAY TO THEINTEGRATION OF THE CAMPESINOS INTO THE NATION'S DEVELOPMENT PROCESS. THE  NCDS FAILED TO CONSTRUCT THE NUMBER OF PROJECTS ANTICIPATED DUE TO INFLATION, A GREATER THAN ANTICIPATED SHIFT IN STRATEGY TOWARD FEWER AND MORE EXPENSIVE PROJECTS, AND OVERAMBITIOUS PLANNING.

"THE PROGRAMS HAVE HAD LIMITED IMPACT INSOFAR AS THE LAND SALE GUARANTY FEATURE IS CONCERNED, ALTHOUGH THE COMPLEMENTARY PORTION OF AID'S ASSISTANCE PACKAGE UNDER THE TWO LOANS DID BENEFIT SMALL FARMERS WHO OTHERWISE MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN REACHED. ON THE BASIS OF THIS STUDY THE EVALUATORS CONCLUDED THAT IF SIMILAR PROJECTS ARE CONTEMPLATED IN THE FUTURE, THEY SHOULD BE UNDERTAKEN ONLY IN THE CONTEXT OF AN ACTIVE AND SUPPORTIVE HOST GOVERNMENT LAND TENURE PROGRAM AND THE CLEAR IDENTIFICATION OF SIGNIFICANT PRIVATE LAND SALE OPPORTUNITIES. MOREOVER, THERE SHOULD BE FULL RECOGNITION THAT SUCH PROJECTS ARE COMPLEX IN DESIGN AND THAT THEY REQUIRE A RANGE OF SERVICES WHICH MAY SERIOUSLY OVERBURDEN HOST GOVERNMENT CAPABILITIES. THERE SHOULD ALSO BE FULL HOST GOVERNMENT INVOLVEMENT IN THE INITIAL DESIGN OF LAND SALE GUARANTY PROJECTS. IN BOTH COSTA RICA AND ECUADOR, THERE WERE DIFFICULTIES OVER THE AID REQUIREMENTS WHICH PREVENT THE GUARANTY FUNDS FROM BEING DISBURSED UNTIL THERE WAS AN ACTUAL CALL ON THE GUARANTY. BOTH LOANS WERE ULTIMATELY AMENDED TO SHIFT AID FUNDS FROM THE GUARANTY TO AGRICULTUAL PRODUCTION CREDIT. THE EVALUATORS MADE FIVE RECOMMENDATIONS ABOUT HOST GOVERNMENT POLICY AND SUPPORTING INFRASTRUCTURE, SUPPLY AND DEMAND FOR PRIVATE LAND TRANSFER, TARGET POPULATION, AND THE ""GUARANTY"" CONCEPT.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","7/1/1975 12:00:00 AM","","Land ownership|Agricultural credit|LAND REFORM|Land tenure","Costa Rica|Ecuador","","","","","","English","","","","GOLDSTEIN, BERNICE A.|HOUSE, ROBERT W.","Natural resources (General)","1 Jul 1975","","","","INTERCOUNTRY EVALUATION OF AID LAND SALE GUARANTY PROGRAMS; ECUADOR; COSTA RICA","","PN-AAD-112-A1","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc0MDQ2","Ecuador","5150117|5180103"

THE EVALUATOR FOUND THAT FINANCIERA HAS CARRIED OUT THE PROJECT WITH DUE DILIGENCE AND EFFICIENCY, AND IN CONFORMITY WITH SOUND FINANCIAL, BUSINESS, AND ADMINISTRATIVE PRACTICES; CARRIED OUT AN EXPANDED DEVELOPMENT ROLE IN THE CAPITAL MARKETS; DEVELOPED LIMITED INVESTMENT BANKING ACTIVITIES; INITIATED AND CARRIED OUT AN AGRIBUSINESS PROGRAM TO INCREASE PRIVATE INVESTMENT IN AGRICULTURE; AND MAINTAINED A REASONABLE PORTFOLIO BALANCE BETWEEN SMALL, MEDIUM AND LARGE SUBLOANS.

PROBLEMS OF TIME DELAYS, SELECTING AND ACQUIRING SITES, TOGETHER WITH COST INCREASES AND BUDGETARY CONSTRAINTS WILL PREVENT THE CONSTRUCTION OF EXTENSION AGENCIES AND SUPPORTING CENTERS.

"THE INSTITUTO DE FOMENTO MUNICIPAL OF GUATEMALA (INFOM) HAS GENERATED OVER 1,000 PROJECTS DISTRIBUTED AMONG MORE THAN 90 PER CENT OF ITS MUNICIPALITIES. INFOM HAS USED ITS OWN RESOURCES RECENTLY TO MAKE ABOUT THREE-QUARTERS OF ITS LOANS FOR REVENUE-PRODUCING PROJECTS. PRIOR TO 1970, A HIGHER PERCENTAGE WAS BEING USED FOR NON-INCOME-PRODUCING PROJECTS. THE FOUR MAJOR AREAS OF CONCERN ARE: (1)THE LENDING PROGRAM HAS NOT SERVED TO ENCOURAGE LOCAL INITIATIVE, PLANNING, COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT AND ACTIVE SUPPORT; (2)THE LENDING PROGRAM HAS NOT BEEN USED AS A LEVER TO CARRY OUT FINANCIAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE REFORMS; (3)THE STANDARD LIST OF BASIC SERVICE PROJECTS IS LIMITED IN ITS IMPACT ON GUATEMALA'S BASIC PROBLEMS; AND (4)MUNICIPAL DEVELOPMENT SO FAR HAS BEEN UNRELATED IN MOST INSTANCES TO OTHER DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS IN GUATEMALA. WITHOUT WELL-DEFINED ESTIMATES OF NEEDS AND TARGETS FOR MEETING THEM, INFOM LACKED A BASIC FOR SOUND BUDGETING AND FINANCIAL PLANNING WHICH RESULTED IN WIDE VARIATIONS BETWEEN PLANS AND PERFORMANCE. AID ASSISTANCE APPARENTLY SERVED TO CONFIRM INFOM'S LIMITED APPROACH. THE EVALUATORS MADE 24 RECOMMENDATIONS ON: (1)STRATEGY AND POLICY; (2)ORGANIZATION AND PROCEDURES; (3)LEGAL MATTERS; (4)FINANCIAL MATTERS; AND (5)AID SUPPORT.

"THE PROJECT TO DATE HAS BEEN QUITE USEFUL, BUT COULD HAVE BEEN MORE USEFUL HAD THE OBJECTIVES INCLUDED THE ESTABLISHMENT OF FISCAL INCENTIVES AND EXPORT FINANCE, AND THE ELIMINATION OF RED TAPE. SOME PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE IN REMOVING THE OBSTACLES FACED BY EXPORTERS, AND CONSIDERABLE PROGRESS IN CREATING CONDITIONS MORE FAVORABLE TO EXPORT PROMOTION. CHIEF AMONG THESE IS THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A DYNAMIC AND HIGHLY RESPECTED EXPORT DEVELOPMENT OFFICE IN THE MINISTRY OF ECONOMY. IT IS IMPORTANT THAT AID ASSISTANCE IN SPECIFIED FUNCTIONAL AND PRODUCT AREAS CONTINUE. A FIRM COMMITMENT FROM THE GOVERNMENT OF HONDURAS (GOH) TO DYNAMICALLY INCREASE EXPORTS IS SORELY NEEDED. THE GOH NOW HAS THE CAPACITY TO HELP EXPORTERS AND TO UTILIZE ADDITIONAL TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. NEW EFFORTS ARE UNDERWAY TO MOVE THE PROPOSED EXPORT INCENTIVES AND FINANCING LAW FORWARD. HONDURAS HAS A BASIC AGRARIAN ECONOMY WITH EXTENSIVE FOREST RESOURCES, SO AGRICULTURAL AND FORESTRY ARE THE LOGICAL SOURCES OF RAW MATERIALS FOR EXPORT PRODUCTS.

THE CONSULTANTS DISCUSSED THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM AND THE IMMEDIATE ACTION AND RECONSTRUCTION PLAN. THEY REASSESSED STATED GOALS AND PURPOSES, MEASURED PERFORMANCE AGAINST STATED GOALS, PURPOSES AND OUTPUT TARGETS, AND MADE DETERMINATIONS ABOUT FUTURE REQUIREMENTS OF THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM.

"Evaluates the Central American tourism infrastructure loan from 2/73 to 8/75.  Loan funds are sub-lent by the Central American Bank for Economic Integration to finance public infrastructure projects in member countries (Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica). Evaluators confirm that tourism is of growing importance to the region and that the loan remains valid. Delays in completing feasibility studies have set the project back two years.  The loan paper failed to take into account potential legal problems, changes in tourism management, legislative delays, difficulties in ordering priorities, and other time consuming obstacles. While all feasibility studies were to be completed by the beginning of CY 74, the first study (Honduras) will actually not be finished until 9/75.  Evaluators recommend that the terminal date of disbursement be extended from 3/31/77 to 6/30/79 to allow for time lost in the feasibility study phase.  The projected construction phase of three years remains valid. Loan funds earmarked for promotion, technical assistance, and training are not needed and should be re-allocated for financing of infrastructure.  Promotion efforts are carried out independently of the loan by the national tourism institutes and the private sector.  Their successful efforts have increased tourist traffic by 18.4% from 1970 to 1973. Training and technical assistance are carried out by individual hotels and other tourism industries.  Both public and private sectors have successfully managed to hire and train personnel without the need of additional loan resources. Changes have been made in items to be financed.  For example, the feasibility study of El Salvador indicated that Costa Del Sur was a better site than Icacal.  Volcan Irazu in Costa Rica has been deleted because the government has already improved the road and little else can be done.  Ruins restoration has been added as a possible item for financing in Honduras.","Evaluation period: 28 Feb 1973-1 Aug 1975","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","8/1/1975 12:00:00 AM","","Tourist industry|Feasibility studies|Investment|Limited data","Central America","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAA469A1.pdf","931 KB","003289 - U.S. Dept. of Commerce.

"THE PRINCIPAL RECOMMENDATION IS THAT AID SHOULD CONCURRENTLY (1)AUTHORIZE A LOAN TO COLAC OF FROM $6 TO $8 MILLION AND (2)PROVIDE COLAC WITH GRANT ASSISTANCE DURING THE FIRST TWO YEARS OF THE LOAN DISBURSEMENT, PERMITTING AN OPERATIONS BUDGET OF $600,000.

THERE ARE ABOUT 25 OTHER RECOMMENDATIONS, MANY OF WHICH DEAL WITH PROJECT-SPECIFIC PROCEDURAL AND PERSONNEL MATTERS. MORE GENERAL RECOMMENDATIONS INCLUDE: (1)COLAC SHOULD DEVELOP UNIFORM GUIDELINES TO BE USED THROUGHOT THE COOPERATIVE MOVEMENT; AND (2)COLAC SHOULD PERFORM PERIODIC LOAN APPRAISALS. THE EVALUATORS REVIEWED THE 1973 LOG FRAME AND SUGGESTED REVISIONS AND ADDITIONS. THEY FOUND THAT MOST OF THE INDICATORS OF SATISFACTORY PERFORMANCE HAD BEEN MET OR EXCEEDED BUT POINTED OUT THAT THE LACK OF DATA AND FAILURE TO IMPOSE REALISTIC TARGETS DIMINISHED THE VALIDITY AND USEFULNESS OF THE PERFORMANCE INDICATORS. THEY CONCLUDED THAT COLAC, IN ADDITION TO SHIFTING TO AN INTERMEDIATE CREDIT INSTITUTION, HAD PROVIDED TRAINING AND OTHER ASSISTANCE ACTIVITIES DURING 1974 WHICH SPELLED CONTINUED GROWTH TO FEDERATIONS. THE REPORT DISCUSSES SOME OF THE CHANGES IN THE MOVEMENT: MORE MODERN ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS PRACTICES, THE RISE IN PROFESSIONALISM OF PERSONNEL, AND GREATER DEPENDENCE ON EXTERNAL CAPITAL AND FINANCING.

BOTH PROJECTS HAVE BEEN SERIOUSLY DELAYED FOR DIFFERING AND UNANTICIPATED REASONS. IN KENYA, THE WORK HAS BEEN HINDERED PRINCIPALLY BY THE EXTENT OF COMPUTER CONVERSION UNDERTAKEN IN THE CENTRAL BUREAU OF STATISTICS. IN CAMEROON THE DELAY WAS ATTRIBUTED PRINCIPALLY TO TIME CONSUMED IN CLEARANCES AT VARIOUS LEVELS AND THE FACT THAT THE CAMEROON PROJECT AGREEMENT WAS NOT SIGNED UNTIL FEBRUARY 1975.

DURING THE SIX MONTHS' IMPLEMENTATION, SERIOUS MANAGEMENT, LEADERSHIP, AND ADMINISTRATIVE PROBLEMS WERE ALREADY INHIBITING THE PROJECT. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR RELEVANT, WORK-ORIENTED TRAINING FOR THE RURAL MASSES SHOULD BE CONTINUED; (2)THE PROJECT SHOULD BE REDESIGNED; (3)THE APPROACH OF THE PROJECT SHOULD BE CHANGED FROM ITS EXPERIMENTAL MOLD TO ONE OF DELIVERY SYSTEM DESIGN, DEVELOPMENT, AND EVALUATION; AND (4)FUNDAMENTAL DECISIONS SHOULD BE REVIEWED TO PROVIDE THE REDESIGNERS WITH CLEAR GUIDELINES ON SUCH TOPICS AS URBAN VS RURAL, YOUTH VS ADULTS, AGRARIAN VS CRAFTS-TRAINING, AND INDIVIDUAL VS COMMUNAL PROGRAMS.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","10/1/1975 12:00:00 AM","","Nonformal education|LITERACY|SOCIALIZATION","Ethiopia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAA571A1.pdf","487 KB","001681 - U.S. Dept. of State","","","English","application/pdf","","","","Nonformal education","1 Oct 1975","","","","JOINT DEPARTMENT OF WORK-ORIENTED ADULT EDUCATION AND USAID SUMMARY EVALUATION OF PILOT PROJECT IN NON-FORMAL EDUCATION (TOAID A-104)","","PD-AAA-571-A1","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc0MDk4","Ethiopia","6630167"
"TO DATE MUCH OF THE PROGRAMMING APPEARS TO HAVE MATERIALIZED ON SCHEDULE. THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE IN THE BROAD AREAS OF PROPERTY AND SUPPLY MANAGEMENT, ACCOUNTING, FINANCIAL CONTROL AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF AN ESTABLISHED PLANNING COMMITTEE. THE TEAM FOUND THAT PROJECT OUTPUT ACCOMPLISHMENTS NAMED ABOVE WERE OF GOOD TO EXCELLENT PROGRAM QUALITY. A KEY DEFICIENCY, HOWEVER, HAS BEEN THE LACK OF READILY AVAILABLE NON-CLINICAL CONTRACEPTIVE COMMODITIES AT THE COMMUNITY LEVEL. OUTPUTS IN OTHER PROGRAM AREAS, SOME OF WHICH TECHNICALLY QUALIFIED FOR BEING ""ON SCHEDULE"", HAVE IN FACT NOT BEEN DEVELOPED TO THE DEGREE OF EFFICIENCY THE TEAM FEELS REQUISITE FOR THE PROGRAM TO ACHIEVE SUCCESS. THESE INCLUDE THE MANPOWER PROGRAM, AN INTEGRATED AND EFFECTIVE HEALTH EDUCATION AND PUBLIC INFORMATION PROGRAM, AN EFFICIENT MANAGMENT COMMUNICATIONS AND RECORDS OPERATION, AN INTEGRATED AND EFFECTIVE MEDICAL SERVICES PROGRAM, AN ADEQUATE ORGANIZATIONAL UNIT FOR NURSING AND MIDWIFERY SERVICES, STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES AND REGULATIONS ESTABLISHED FOR THE NATIONAL FAMILY PLANNING OFFICE, AND STATISTICAL SERVICES. THE EVALUATORS RECOMMEND THAT THE PROGRAM TERMINATION DATE BE SHIFTED TO FY 78. TERMINAL FUNDING SHOULD CONCENTRATE ON THREE STRONG SUPPORT YEARS FOR THE COMMUNITY-BASED DISTRIBUTION PROGRAM, WITH MAJOR EMPHASIS ON THE AVAILABILITY OF SUPPLIES.

"THABA BOSIU HAS MADE A SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTION TO AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT IN LESOTHO IN EVOLVING A PROCESS BY WHICH THE GOVERNMENT OF LESOTHO (GOL) CAN REACH AND INFLUENCE RURAL PEOPLE TO ACCEPT CHANGE. IT HAS SURFACED A GREAT DEAL OF INFORMATION ON THE MOTIVATION OF THE BASOTHO AND THE REASONS FOR LOW AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION. WITH THE POSSIBLE EXCEPTION OF PROFITS TO SOME VILLAGES FROM FISH PONDS, IT HAS NOT YET CAUSED ANY INCREASE IN RURAL INCOME AND, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF A FEW HOUSEHOLDS, WILL NOT BRING ABOUT AN APPRECIABLE INCREASE DURING THE LIFE OF THE PROJECT. IT HAS DEMONSTRATED THAT BASOTHO PERSONNEL EMPLOYED BY THE PROJECT, AND PRESUMABLY OTHERS, CAN BE TRAINED FOR TECHNICAL TASKS. IT HAS DEMONSTRATED THAT, GIVEN THE TIME, MONEY, MACHINERY, AND SKILLED MANPOWER, CONSERVATION MEASURES CAN BE INSTALLED IN A WORKMANLIKE MANNER. THE APPROACH WHICH SHOULD COME INTO PLAY NOW IS MODIFYING TRADITIONAL FARMING SYSTEMS AND ADOPTING CROPPING AND HUSBANDRY PRACTICES WHICH ARE CONSISTENT WITH SOIL AND RANGE CONSERVATION.

TO ASSIST AID IN ACHIEVING THESE GOALS THE SCIENCE EDUCATION PROGRAM FOR AFRICA (SEPA) WAS FORMED. SEPA IS ONE THE MOST SUCCESSFUL ENTERPRISES OF ITS KIND. SIMILAR ATTEMPTS IN OTHER SUBJECT AREAS HAVE NOT SUCCEEDED IN ACHIEVING THE LEVEL OF SUPPORT, PRESTIGE OR EFFECTINVENESS THAT PRESENTLY CHARACTERIZES SEPA.

"THE EVALUATION PANEL HAS DIFFICULTY IN EVALUATING THE PROJECT ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND PERFORMANCE OF THE CONTRACTOR DURING THE FIVE YEARS OF THE PROJECT DUE TO A LACK OF CLEAR DEFINITION THE OBJECTIVES AND FOCUS IN THE ORIGINAL PROJECT DESIGN. ABOUT 60 DEFINABLE ACTIVITIES WERE IMPLEMENTED UNDER THE CONTRACT. WITH ONLY ONE OR TWO EXCEPTIONS, NONE OF THE ACTIVITIES WAS LARGE ENOUGH TO BRING ABOUT OBVIOUS AND DIRECTLY ATTRIBUTABLE CHANGES IN AID OR THE LDC'S. THE PANEL AGREED THAT THE PAST PERFORMANCES OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCE (NAS) HAS BEEN GOOD, HAS LAID A FOUNDATION FOR PROVIDING ADVICE ON SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY RELATED TO DEVELOPMENT, AND SHOULD  BE CONTINUED. HOWEVER, IN DEVELOPING A NEW PROJECT, CARE SOULD BE TAKEN TO INSURE THAT OBJECTIVES AND THE METHOD FOR FURTHER EVALUATION BE CLEARLY DEFINED. THE PANEL AGREED THAT THE REPORTS, WORKSHOPS, ETC OF THE PROJECT HAVE BEEN A SIGNIFICANT SOURCE OF HIGH QUALITY INDEPENDENT AND OBJECTIVE ANALYSIS AND RECOMMENDATIONS. A POSITIVE THOUGH UNMEASURABLE PRODUCT OF THIS PROJECT IS THE DEVELOPMENT OF A SCIENTIFIC NETWORK THROUGH WHICH LDC SCIENTISTS CAN BE IN REGULAR CONTACT WITH THEIR COLLEGUES COMPLETELY OUTSIDE OF GOVERNMENT CHANNELS.

AFTER THE FIRST INEFFECTIVE YEAR-AND-A-HALF OF THE GRANT CALENDAR, THE TIME REMAINING FOR THE PROJECT TO MEET GOALS SET INITIALLY IN A FIVE-YEAR CONTEXT IS INADEQUATE. AID WAS LESS THAN CLEAR IN DEFINING THE PURPOSES OF THE PROGRAM EITHER IN THE GRANT DOCUMENT OR IN THE COURSE OF ITS EXECUTION. THE WIDE-RANGING SCOPE OF ACTIVITIES IN THE GRANT DOCUMENT WAS NEVER ADJUSTED TO THE FUNDING REALITIES LIMITING THE PROJECT TO THE INITIAL $1,000,000 AUTHORIZATION. SINCE LATE 1973, PROJECT MANAGEMENT BY AID HAS GENERALLY BEEN SPOTTY AND INADEQUATE, AND AT TIMES, CLEARLY MISLEADING TO THE GRANTEE. THE QUALITY OF PASITAM'S (PROGRAM OF ADVANCED STUDY IN INSTITUTION DEVELOPMENT AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE METHODOLOGY) PROUDCTS IS VARIABLE, FROM EXCELLENT TO FAIR, WITH THE  AVERAGE OF SUFFICIENT UTILITY TO JUSTIFY THE EFFORTS AND EXPENDITURES INVOLVED. PASITAM IS NOT MAKING FULL USE OF MUCIA (MIDWESTERN UNIVERSITIES CONSORTIUM FOR INTERNATIONAL ACTIVITIES) RESOURCES; NOR IS MUCIA ADEQUATELY USING PASITAM AS A POTENTIAL CONSORTIUM CLEARINGHOUSE IN DEVELOPMENT OPERATIONS. PASITAM HAS ACHIEVED SUFFICIENT RECOGNITION AND VISIBILITY TO ATTRACT THE INTEREST OF POTENTIAL CLIENTELE TO ITSELF, MUCIA AND ITS MEMBER INSTITUTIONS; IT OPERATES INCREASINGLY AS AN ORGANIZATION IN ITS OWN RIGHT AND LESS AS AN INSTRUMENT OF MUCIA.

"THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT (ASIP) HAS ESSENTIAL WORTH IN BOTH ITS CONCEPTION AND IMPLEMENTATION. GIVEN THE PURPOSE OF THE PROJECT AND ITS TRAINING OBJECT, THE CONTRACTOR HAS PRODUCED THE MATERIALS IT CONTRACTED TO PRODUCE AND THESE, WITH SOME MODIFICATION AND FINALIZING, CAN BE ADAPTED AND FIELD TESTED WITH APPROPRIATE TRAINING INSTITUTIONS IN ONE OR MORE SELECTED LDC'S. THE OUTPUTS PRODUCED THUS FAR SHOULD HAVE BEEN COMPLETED IN A SHORTER TIME FRAME AND FOR LESS COST. PERFORMANCE HAS NOT BEEN FULLY RESPONSIVE TO WHAT WAS ORIGINALLY SOUGHT. THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT DIFFERENCES IN INTERPRETATION, LACK OF UNDERSTANDING AND POOR COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN THE AID REPRESENTATIVE AND THE DIRECTOR OR THE ASIP STAFF RESULTED IN DELAYS AND A PRODUCT OUTPUT WHICH,IN THE OPINION OF THE EVALUATORS,NEEDS RE-WORKING. THE EVALUATORS BELIEVE THAT AID DID NOT GIVE ADEQUATE AND SUFFICIENT ATTENTION TO THE PROJECT DURING ITS IMPLEMENTATION. PROFESSIONAL STAFFING OF THIS PROJECT WAS WEAK GIVEN THE STATED OBJECTIVES. ONE OF THE PRINCIPAL OUTPUTS OF THE PROJECT, THE SOURCE BOOK OF TRAINING MATERIALS, HAS ELICITED CONSIDERABLE NEGATIVE CRITICISM BY A CROSS-SECTION OF AID OFFICERS, SEMINAR PARTICIPANTS, AND OTHERS INTERESTED IN DEVELOPMENT WORK. GENERALLY, THE CRITICISMS HAVE RELATED TO DEFINING THE TARGET AUDIENCE, MATERIALS ORGANIZATION, SUBSTANCE AND UTILIZATION, ABSENCE OF AID EXPERIENCE, AND HEAVY EMPHASIS ON PLANNING OVER MANAGEMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION. VERY LITTLE WAS DONE ABOUT MEETING THE CRITICISMS BY EITHER THE CONTRACTOR OR THE AID BACKSTOP.

"THE SCOPE OF THIS PROJECT IS DIVERSE; THE TECHNICAL OUTPUT IS GREAT; AND THE NUMBER OF COUNTRIES WHERE GE-TEMPO HAS BEENINVOLVED IS CONSIDERABLE. THE EVALUATION DISCUSSED: (1)COUNTRY STUDIES; (2)CONSULTANT SERVICES; (3)TRAINING; AND (4)STAFF STUDIES. UNDER THE FIRST CONTRACT AN ECONOMIC-DEMOGRAPHIC MODEL CALLED TEMPO I WAS CONSTRUCTED TO EXPLORE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN DEMOGRAPHIC CHANGE AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. TEMPO I IS A SIMPLE, YET ADEQUATE, MODEL TO DEMONSTRATE THE IMPORTANCE OF DEMOGRAPHIC VARIABLES IN DEVELOPMENT PLANNING. THE LIMITS OF TEMPO I, BECAUSE IT IS HIGHLY AGGREGATED AND SOMEWHAT OVERSIMPLIFIED, ARE ALSO ITS STRENGTHS SINCE BASIC DEMOGRAPHIC-ECONOMIC INTERACTIONS CAN BE DEMONSTRATED WITHOUT BEING OBSCURED BY UNDUE MODEL COMPLEXITY. SEVERAL OF THE SHORTCOMINGS OF TEMPO I WERE OVERCOME IN TEMPO II. THE TWO MAJOR USES OF TEMPO I ARE TO SHOW THAT FERTILITY DECLINE INCREASES GROWTH IN PER CAPITA INCOME OF LDC'S UNDER A WIDE VARIETY OF CIRCUMSTANCES AND TO PROVIDE INSTRUCTION OF ECONOMIC-DEMOGRAPHIC INTERACTION. THE PURPOSE OF TEMPO II IS TO MAKE AVAILABLE A FLEXIBLE TOOL OF ANALYSIS WHICH MID-LEVEL GOVERNMENT PLANNERS IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES CAN USE TO STUDY THE LONG-RANGE, COUNTRY-SPECIFIC IMPLICATIONS OF ECONOMIC-DEMOGRAPHIC INTERACTIONS. WHILE MARKING AN ADVANCE IN SOPHISTICATION OVER TEMPO I, THERE ARE ALSO FACTORS OPERATING WHICH TEND TO REDUCE THE USEFULNESS OF TEMPO II. THE ISSUANCE OF THE DEMOS MANUAL REPRESENTS PERHAPS THE MOST IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTION THAT HAS BEEN MADE TO THE POPULATION FIELD BY GE-TEMPO, ALTHOUGH IT IS STILL TOO EARLY TO ASSESS THE IMPACT OF THE MANUAL. THE EVALUATOR MADE 8 SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS INCLUDING THAT THE PROGRAM SHOULD: (1)CONCENTRATE ON COUNTRY STUDIES: (2)ACCELERATE MOVEMENT OF TEMPO RESEARCH TO MICRO AND SECTORAL STUDIES; AND (3)INVOLVE LOCAL LDC PERSONNEL TO A GREATER DEGREE IN PROJECT ACTIONS AND DIRECT STUDIES EXPLICITLY TO NEEDS OF LDC OFFICIALS.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","11/1/1975 12:00:00 AM","","Economic models|Economic demographic interaction|DEMOGRAPHY|Demographic research|Population policy|Population planning","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAA497A1.pdf","523 KB","000262 - American Public Health Association","","","English","application/pdf","Tempo","","WALSH, THOMAS B.","","14 Nov 1975","","","","EVALUATION OF THE GE-TEMPO PROJECT : BACKGROUND TECHNICAL REPORT","","PD-AAA-497-A1","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc0NTE4","Population and Humanitarian Assistance","9320516"

IT IS DIFFICULT TO ASSESS THE IMPACT OF CURRENT IFRP TECHNIQUES IN DISSEMINATION OF INFORMATION, ITS THIRD OBJECTIVE. THE DISTRIBUTION OF PREPRINTS AND SELF-PRINTED PAPERS APPARENTLY REACHES A LIMITED BUT HIGHLY SELECTED AUDIENCE.

IT WOULD BE DESIRABLE IF MORE OF THESE COULD BE APPENDED TO REGIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL MEETINGS. A NUMBER OF PROBLEMS APPEARED DURING THE SITE VISITS, SOME RELATED TO THE SEPARATION OF IFRP FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA AND OTHERS TO INDIFFERENT PROCESSING OF COMMUNICATIONS FROM CONTRIBUTORS. THE EVALUATORS DISCUSSED THEIR SPECIFIC FINDINGS AND OBSERVATIONS ABOUT THE PROGRAM AT NORTH CAROLINA, LONDON, LJUBLJANA, CAIRO, ASSUIT, BANGKOK, SINGAPORE, JAKARTA, DEN PENSAR, SEOUL, AND THE CONFERENCE AT PALM SPRINGS.

"THE EVALUATION IS DIVIDED INTO THREE PARTS; (1)A SERIES OF 14 RECOMMENDATIONS WITH DISCUSSION OF EACH; (2)A LISTING OF REQUIREMENTS OF THE CONTRACT WITH BRIEF COMMENTS ON CONTRACTOR COMPLIANCE; AND (3)A DISCUSSION OF THREE GENERAL ITEMS WHICH THE PROJECT CALLED TO THE ATTENTION OF THE EVALUATORS. THE GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ARE THAT: (A)AID SHOULD GIVE SERIOUS CONSIDERATION TO TAILORING FUTURE CONTRACTS IN CONTRACEPTIVE DISTRIBUTION TO A GIVEN COUNTRY SITUATION AND WITH AS MUCH BUILT IN FLEXIBILITY AS POSSIBLE CONSISTENT WITH AID OBJECTIVES AND REQUIREMENTS; (B)THERE IS A MAJOR PROBLEM WITH THE REQUIREMENT THAT THE CONTRACTOR SUBMIT FOR APPROVAL A MARKETING PLAN FOR COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION IN A PARTICULAR COUNTRY AND AID SHOULD CONSIDER REQUIRING A FEASIBILITY STUDY AND A MARKETING PROTOCOL IN ITS PLACE; AND (C)THAT AID SHOULD CONSIDER PACKAGING ORAL CONTRACEPTIVES AND CONDOMS IN A COMMERCIAL PACKAGE THAT IS CONSIDERED DESIREABLE FOR USE IN COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION PROGRAMS WORLD-WIDE AND UNDER THE MOST ADVERSE CLIMATIC CONDITIONS. THE EVALUATORS FOUND THAT THE CONTRACTOR WAS GENERALLY ON TARGET IN MEETING CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS. THE EVALUATORS MADE 14 PROJECT-SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS ABOUT SUCH MATTERS AS PRICING, PACKAGING, RETAILER EDUCATION, COORDINATION OF SALES ACTIVITIES, CONTINUATION OF PROJECT EFFORTS AFTER CONTRACT PHASES OUT, COMMUNITY-BASED DISTRIBUTION, USE OF NORMAL TRADE PRACTICES IN THE NATIONAL DISTRIBUTION EFFORT, AND PROJECT ADMINISTRATION.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","12/1/1975 12:00:00 AM","","Contraceptive agents and devices|Condoms|Oral contraceptives|Contraceptive distribution","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAA503A1.pdf","391 KB","000262 - American Public Health Association","","","English","application/pdf","","","MARKOW, THEODORE G.|SMITH, ROBERT H.","","15 Dec 1975","","","","CONSULTANT REPORT ON COMMERCIAL CONTRACEPTIVE DISTRIBUTION IN BANGLADESH","","PD-AAA-503-A1","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc0NTIz","Population and Humanitarian Assistance","9320611"
"IN GENERAL, THE EVALUATION TEAM CONCLUDED THAT THE PATHFINDER FUND HAS BEEN MEETING ITS OBJECTIVES AS STATED IN ITS GRANT FROM AID. THE EVALUATION FOCUSSED ON CERTAIN GENERIC AREAS OF PERFORMANCE, NAMELY: BASIC ASSUMPTIONS; DIRECTIONS AND OBJECTIVES; RELATIONSHIPS; STAFFING PATTERNS; COMMUNICATIONS; AND PROJECT SELECTION, SUPPORT, EVALUATION AND FEEDBACK. THE EVALUATORS AGREED THAT AT THIS POINT PATHFINDER HAS A CHALLENGE TO RE-THINK AND RE-DEFINE ITS UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS, GOALS, AND OBJECTIVES IN ORDER BETTER TO EXPRESS ITS BASIC ROLE AS AN ORGANIZATION DEDICATED TO LENDING THE WAY, TO ENCOURAGING AND SUPPORTING INNOVATIVE APPROACHES TO SOLVING MANKIND'S POPULATION CRISIS. THE TEAM FOUND LITTLE INDICATION THAT PATHFINDER PRESENTLY HAS A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF THE ASSUMPTIONS UPON WHICH ITS PROGRAM ACTIVITIES AND STATED OBJECTIVES ARE BASED. THE RANGE AND VARIETY OF PROJECTS SUGGEST THAT PATHFINDER LACKS THE POLICY DIRECTION NECESSARY TO BE CONSISTENTLY SELECTIVE IN PROJECT CONSIDERATION, DEVELOPMENT AND ACCEPTANCE FOR FUNDING. THIS LACK OF WELL-DEFINED CRITERIA FOR PROJECT SELECTION PRESENTS AN OBSTACLE WHICH NOW APPEARS TO LIMIT PATHFINDER OPERATIONS. IT WAS THE CONSENSUS OF THE TEAM THAT PATHFINDER HAS COME UNDER UNDUE EXTERNAL INFLUENCE BECAUSE OF THE ABSENCE OF A WELL-DEFINED BASIS FOR ITS OPERATIONS. THE RE-EXAMINATION AND EXPLICIT RE-STATEMENT OF ITS BASIC ASSUMPTIONS AND OBJECTIVES WAS THE CENTRAL RECOMMENDDATION OF THE EVALUATION. THE EVALUATORS MADE 21 RECOMMENDATIONS ABOUT THE FIVE GENERIC AREAS OF PERFORMANCE INCLUDING THAT: (1)PATHFINDER SHOULD DEVELOP A SYSTEM OF GUIDELINES WHEREBY PROJECT APPLICATIONS CAN BE EVALUATED ACCORDING TO CLEARLY DEFINED PRIORITIES; AND (2)PATHFINDER SHOULD CONSIDER DEVELOPMENT OF AN EVALUATION SYSTEM AMONG ITS HIGHEST PRIORITIES FOR THE IMMEDIATE FUTURE.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","10/1/1975 12:00:00 AM","","FAMILY PLANNING|Contraceptive agents and devices|Family planning services|Delivery systems|Family planning education|Family planning occupations|Medical education","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAA505A1.pdf","398 KB","001772 - USAID.

"THE PLATO (PROGRAMMED LOGIC FOR AUTOMATED TEACHING OPERATIONS) SYSTEM IN POPULATION DYNAMICS HAS MANY GOOD FEATURES TO RECOMMEND IT. THE COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY IS SOPHISTICATED AND PROVIDES A RAPID FEEDBACK OF INFORMATION. THE MODE OF PRESENTATION ATTRACTS CONSIDERABLE INTEREST. THE ABILITY TO FOCUS ON THE CONSEQUENCES OF POPULATION GROWTH FOR AN INDIVIDUAL COUNTRY ADDS GREATLY TO PRESENTATIONS OF POPULATION DYNAMICS. THE USER CAN INTERACT WITH PLATO AND, IF TEACHING MATERIALS ARE WELL PREPARED, PLATO CAN BE AN EXCELLENT TEACHING DEVICE. AT PRESENT, THE PRIMARY USE OF PLATO HAS BEEN FOR DEMONSTRATIONS OF POPULATION AWARENESS. THE RESPONSE OF MOST VIEWERS HAS BEEN FAVORABLE. BUT IT IS DIFFICULT TO ASSESS JUST HOW MUCH, OR HOW WELL, BASIC RELATIONSHIPS AND CONCEPTS HAVE BEEN UNDERSTOOD. TIME LIMITATIONS PRECLUDE PARTICIPANTS RECEIVING MORE THAN A LIMITED AWARENESS OF POPULATION IMPLICATIONS, BUT PLATO DOES WELL FOR THE TIME ALLOWED. THE FULL CAPABILITIES OF PLATO ARE NOT BEING REALIZED, LARGELY DUE TO THE CONSTRUCTION OF OVERLY SIMPLISTIC MODELS. PLATO CAN BE USED FOR POPULATION AWARENESS DEMONSTRATIONS, BUT NOT WITHOUT SUBSTANTIAL TECHNICAL IMPROVEMENT IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE MODELS, THE NATURE OF THE ASSUMPTIONS MADE, AND THE METHODOLOGIES EMPLOYED, THE MODELS ARE INADEQUATELY LINKED TOGETHER AND DO NOT SUFFICIENTLY REFLECT THE IMPACT OF POPULATION SIZE, GROWTH, AND COMPOSITION ON ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL FACTORS. THE OVERALL RECOMMENDATIONS ARE: (1) LIMIT THE USE OF PLATO TO POPULATION AWARENESS; (2) RECONSTRUCT MODELS FOR POPULATION PROJECTIONS, ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, AND EDUCATION; (3) DO NOT DEVELOP OR USE OTHER MODELS AT THIS TIME; AND (4) DO NOT INITIATE INSTALLATION OF THE MINI-COMPUTER. THE EVALUATORS CRITIQUED FIVE MODELS; MADE 9 SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS ABOUT THE POPULATION PROJECTION MODEL AND THE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT MODEL; AND DISCUSSED USES AND LIMITATIONS OF THE PLATO PROGRAM.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","8/1/1975 12:00:00 AM","","Computers|Technical training|Population policy|Population planning|Simulations|Population dynamics","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAA511A1.pdf","2,258 KB","000262 - American Public Health Association","","","English","application/pdf","","","WALSH, THOMAS B.|HILL, GARY","","29 Aug 1975","","","","EVALUATION REPORT; COMPUTER ASSISTED INSTRUCTION IN POPULATION DYNAMICS FOR NATIONAL PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT PLANNING AND EVALUATION","","PD-AAA-511-A1","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc0NTI3","Population and Humanitarian Assistance","9320924"
"THE PROGRAM CONCERNED ITSELF WITH SIX AREAS: CREDIT, DEVELOPMENT OF HUMAN RESOURCES, MARKETING, DISTRIBUTION OF MATERIALS, RURAL ADMINISTRATION, AND ROAD CONSTRUCTION. A NUMBER OF INSTITUTIONS WERE CHARGED WITH ADMINISTRATION OF VARIOUS SEGMENTS OF THE PROGRAM. THE PROGRAM WAS EVALUATED FROM THE PERSPECTIVES OF ECONOMIC IMPACT, TECHNICAL OPERATIONS, AND FINANCIAL ADMINISTRATION. ON THE WHOLE, PERFORMANCE WAS MODERATELY SUCCESSFUL, BUT THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE PROGRAM THROUGHOUT 1975 WAS RATHER UNEVEN, WITH MOST DIFFICULTIES ARISING FROM INADEQUATE COORDINATION BETWEEN THE PARTICIPATING AGENCIES. THERE WAS AN EIGHT-WEEK DELAY IN THE START-UP OF THE CREDIT PROGRAM DUE TO POOR PLANNING ON THE PART OF THE AGRICULTURAL BANK AS WELL AS DEFICIENCIES IN THE SELECTION AND TRAINING OF TECHNICAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE PERSONNEL. POOR COMMUNICATION BETWEEN BANKS AND THE SECRETARIAT OF AGRICULTURE RESULTED IN INSUFFICIENT AND LATE DISBURSEMENTS. THE DISTRIBUTION PROGRAM FARED BETTER; IT REACHED A TOTAL OF 9,000 FARMERS. ALTHOUGH THE CREATION OF NEW DISTRIBUTION CENTERS POSED THE PROBLEM OF HIRING QUALIFIED PERSONNEL, CONTROL OVER OPERATIONS WAS MAINTAINED. IT IS HOPED THAT WITH THE INCREASING ACTIVITY, THERE WILL BE A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN COSTS. BOTH THE MARKETING AND PROPERTY ADMINISTRATION PROGRAM ENCOUNTERED TYPICAL PROBLEMS: LACK OR DEFICIENCY OF PERSONNEL, PAUCITY OF EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS, AND LITTLE OR NO MEANS OF TRANSPORTATION, ALL OF WHICH CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO LACK OF FUNDS. NEVERTHELESS, THE DEDICATION OF RESPONSIBLE PERSONNEL HAS OVERCOME THESE INITIAL DIFFICULTIES TO A LARGE EXTENT. IN THE AREA OF HUMAN RESOURCES, THE VOCATIONAL EDUCATION EFFORT REACHED 2,000 SMALL FARMERS IN SPITE OF POOR COORDINATION BETWEEN RESPONSIBLE INSTITUTIONS. IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT A PERMANENT EVALUATING COMMITTEE BE ESTABLISHED TO EVALUATE ALL ACTIVITIES AND PROJECTS ON AN ONGOING BASIS.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1975 12:00:00 AM","","Small farms|Farmers|Agricultural credit|Personnel development|Agricultural product marketing|Road construction|Rural development|Vocational training","Dominican Republic","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAA719A1.pdf","5,100 KB","002097 - Dominican Republic.

"THIS PROJECT IS BASICALLY SUCCESSFUL AND IT WAS A GOOD MAJOR INVESTMENT. WITH FEW MINOR EXCEPTIONS, THE FORMAL TRAINING OBJECTIVES HAVE BEEN MET WITH POSITIVE NET RESULTS. THE PROGRAM PROVIDED THE FUNDAMENTAL EDUCATIONAL TRAINING WHICH NOW ENABLES THE STAFF TO UNDERTAKE MEANINGFUL RESEARCH, AND IS, ON BALANCE, THE MOST SUCCESSFUL AND HIGHLY SIGNIFICANT ELEMENT OF THE PROGRAM. THE EVALUATORS BELIEVE THAT THE ON-THE-JOB RESEARCH AND PLANNING GUIDANCE BY MINNESOTA STAFF RESIDENT IN TUNISIA IS STILL A NEED AND THAT FOREIGN EXPERTS PLAY A USEFUL ROLE. THEY BELIEVE THE OBJECTIVE CAN BE ACHIEVED IN A MORE EFFICIENT MANNER. INITIALLY, NO TUNISIAN COUNTERPARTS WERE AVAILABLE TO WORK WITH THE US STAFF. FOREIGN EXPERTS WORKED DIRECTLY ON AGREED-UPON PROBLEMS OF A MAJOR SUBSECTOR OF TUNISIAN AGRICULTURE. GENERALLY, THE TEAM MEMBERS WERE REGARDED AS EFFECTIVE RESEARCHERS, BUT THE QUANTITY AND QUALITY OF THEIR RESEARCH WAS CONSTRAINED BY LACK OF DATA AND A RESEARCH BASE ON WHICH TO BUILD. UTILIZATION OF THE RESEARCH, WHILE SIGNIFICANT IN SOME INSTANCES, ALSO SUFFERED. THE MOST IMPORTANT ELEMENT OF THIS COMPONENT IS THE CAPACITY FOR RESEARCH THAT HAS BEEN CREATED IN THE MINISTRY OF AGRICULTURE, PRIMARILY IN THE BUREAU OF PLAN. THE EFFORTS OF THE PROJECT IN PLANNING HAVE ONLY RECENTLY BEGUN TO PAY OFF AS PARTICIPANTS RETURN AND OCCUPY KEY ROLES ON PLANNING COMMITTEES.

"Evaluates project performance from 1971 to 1975 in Puerto Rico (PR). Loan was made to help University of Puerto Rico (UPR) identify soil types & concentrate on soil conservation.  This was an on-site team evaluation conducted through group sessions with faculty & students. UPR developed a soils research program & improved its physical facilities, educational materials & staff.  Principal areas improved were production of starch root crops & edible legumes & soil analysis of tropical soils.  Communication with other institutions was increased. Ongoing research at UPR & the University of Hawaii may establish methodology for tropical soil classification data. Utilization of grant has been disappointing, primarily because UPR did not conduct any soil conservation studies.  Many team members felt UPR was caught in a bind in trying to build its graduate soils program -- and at the same time develop & expand its knowledge base applicable to Less Developed Countries (LDC's).  Other disappointments were UPR's failure to:  coordinate its research with other institutions; optimally use funds (expenditures were approved by Department head & not Grant Project Director); recruit either staff or LDC students; effectively coordinate personnel; fully report soil composition useful to LDC problems; & utilize the capacities of UPR in Latin America. Since UPR is not located in an area conducive to soil conservation research & its present strengths are in other areas, it was recommended that emphasis shift from conservation & protection to classification & geography of soils in the tropics, land planning, land use evaluation & technology transfer.  Team feels financial assistance should be continued only if UPR: recruits new staff for research, not teaching; has expenditures approved only by the Grant Project Director; increases its capacity to classify tropical soils; begins research in soil taxonomy; develops a soil data base; assembles ""package"" programs of information on numerous crops for LDC's; produces state-of-the-art reviews; & conducts more field research using research stations.","Evaluation period: 1 Jan 1971-14 Apr 1975","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","4/1/1975 12:00:00 AM","","Environmental planning|LAND USE|Cassava|Agricultural research|LEGUMES|SOIL RESEARCH|Soil management|Tropical zone|Agriculture|Tropical soils|Soil types|Technical assistance|Beneficiary interviews|Limited data","Puerto Rico","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAA473A1.pdf","2,692 KB","000035 - U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)","","","English","application/pdf","Evaluation team|Indepth evaluation|Onsite evaluation","","KITCHELL, RAYMOND E.","Soil sciences and research","14 Apr 1975","","","","COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW OF INSTITUTIONAL GRANT 211(D) TO UNIVERSITY OF PUERTO RICO ON TROPICAL SOILS (02/06/75)","","PD-AAA-473-A1","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc1MTk2","Technical Assistance","9310128"
"Evaluates performance of the ""Rapid Feedback for Family Planning Improvement"" (RFFPI) project for the period 6/25/69 - 6/30/75.  The project consists of a contract with the Community and Family Study Center (CFSC) at the University of Chicago. The purpose is to improve the evaluation of family planning programs in LDC's. Evaluation is based on meetings with CFSC personnel at the University of Chicago and a review of project documentation. CFSC helped create an awareness of the field of family planning evaluation in LDC's. 7,000 copies of RFFPI manual #1 have been distributed which define the field of family planning evaluation. CFSC also developed a series of 12 manuals which include ""cookbook"" instructions on various evaluation methodologies. CFSC developed a series of computer programs for these methodologies and distributed them to LDC's free of charge.  The MINI-TAB programs are written in Fortran for use on small computers (32K memory). They include pregnancy history analysis, cross-tabulations, client record tabulations, and multiple regression programs.  CFSC helped install MINI-TAB programs in Pakistan, Bangladesh, Thailand, Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, South Korea, Columbia, and other countries. Computer data processing is now readily available to any LDC on a cheap, easy, and efficient basis. To create indigenous capabilities in family planning evaluation, CFSC has conducted a 3-prong training program:  short-term workshops in host countries, summer workshops at Chicago, and MA and PhD training at Chicago. All have been successful. Technical assistance provided by the CFSC has also had visible impact on several LDC's.  Report cites as an example, the model evaluation program established in Indonesia. Report recommends extending the project 3 more years.  Future activities should emphasize the measurement of the demographic impact of AID-funded family planning programs.","Evaluation period: 25 JUN 1969-30 JUN 1975","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","5/1/1975 12:00:00 AM","","Demographic research|DEMOGRAPHY|Demographic data collection|Research methodology|Fertility surveys|Family planning surveys|Family planning services|Delivery systems|Data collection|Evaluation methodology|Information storage and retrieval systems|Family planning|Development program evaluation|Public data|Limited data","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAA507A1.pdf","751 KB","000035 - U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)","","","English","application/pdf","Pre evaluation data|Onsite evaluation","","MARTIN, RAYMOND|CORNELIUS, RICHARD M.","","1 May 1975","","AID/CSD-2251","","EVALUATION OF RAPID FEEDBACK FOR FAMILY PLANNING IMPROVEMENT (RFFPI)","","PD-AAA-507-A1","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc1MjAy","Population and Humanitarian Assistance","932084202|932084201"

"Evaluates sector loan to create a regionalized integrated health delivery system in Colombia including:  a) provision of infrastructure to support the system; b) development of intra and inter-sectorial mechanisms of coordination; and c) efforts to lower system costs by cost effectiveness analysis from 1/1/74 to 12/31/74.  Evaluation format is based on the logframe, containing statements of progress at each level (goal, purpose and outputs).  Information presented is the result of a conscious use of management by exception to locate weakness and difficulties in the health program. Evaluators note marked improvements in the health sector, especially in the development of information systems and in improving the planning and implementation of health facility construction.  Additional attention was given to human resources development and the regionalization scheme by the planning office in the Ministry of Health. These activities are expected to result in greater integration of planning at the regional level and human resources and equipment more in line with updated policies and priorities. Several problems are also noted.  A change in govt in August, 1974 caused a 6-9 month slow down in the health sector.  Vacancies created by people leaving their positions due to the change were not quickly filled.  In addition, the immediate emphasis of the new administration on fiscal reform and reduction of investment to control inflation did little to enhance the possibility of short-term progress in the health sector. The requirement of sector activity progress reports is seen as having a salutary effect on the GOC ability to deal with the health sector in a more systematic fashion. Although not uniformly complied with, the conditions of the loan provided a useful framework within which to maintain support for essential elements of GOC health policy.","Evaluation period: 1 Jan1974-31 Dec1978","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","11/1/1975 12:00:00 AM","","Health delivery|Logistics|Health research|Data collection|Operations research|Health care administration|Sanitation|Environmental aspects|Rural areas|Decentralization|Health care|Medical education|Health facilities|Building construction|Building renovation|Personnel development|Information storage and retrieval systems|Limited data","Colombia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAA621A1.pdf","347 KB","008530 - USAID.

"Evaluates USAID assistance to Morocco from 1971 to 1974 to develop indigenous expertise in the fields of agronomy and veterinary science. The major problems in the project developed from AID's misunderstanding of the role, objectives and official context of the Hassan II Institute of Agronomy and Veterinary Science (the proj beneficiary). Because of this misunderstanding, the University of Minnesota contract team was sometimes frustrated and out of synchrony with the ojectives of H II Inst.  While American universities place great emphasis on research, under the European system followed by H II Inst, field and laboratory research are considered technical pursuits inappropriate to intellectuals and scholars. As a result, some US team members had no students to supervise for the first two years.  A research program to develop improved and disease-resistant barley varieties was effectively implemented. Research and study efforts were also directed toward crop viruses and soil conditions.  One team member is producing a textbook on Moroccan soils, their classifications and productive capabilities. Since 1974, the average number of sixth-year students per faculty member rose from 1.0 to 1.6.  Evaluators note that the above figure is misleading since US faculty members often give advice to students not officially assigned to them. The major flaws in the project were the inability of AID-supported faculty to attract motivated researchers to replace them and the failure of Hassan II administrators to place a high priority on the Moroccanization of its research and teaching staff. The evaluators recommend that USAID assign project technicians only to those disciplines for which counterparts are provided and a US faculty replacement is likely within one or two years.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","5/1/1975 12:00:00 AM","","Crop pests|Crop diseases|BARLEY|Curriculum design|Higher education|Veterinary medicine|Agricultural research|Agricultural training|Curriculum|Universities and colleges|Agricultural education|Institution building|Participants","Morocco","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAA861A1.pdf","1,594 KB","000980 - Practical Concepts Inc.","","","English","application/pdf","Indepth evaluation","","","","13 May 1975","","","","HASSAN II INSTITUTE OF AGRONOMY AND VETERINARY SCIENCE","","PD-AAA-861-A1","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc1MjQ1","Morocco","6080088"
"Analyzes the organizational structure and the number and type of personnel employed at the Philadelphia headquarters of Opportunities Industrialization Centers International (OICI) as of 6/12/75.  AID has contracted OICI to assist in establishing Opportunities Industrialization Centers (non-formal vocational training centers) in Ghana, Nigeria, Ethiopia, and Kenya.  The evaluation is based on interviews with OICI staff and AID/W officials. OICI and AID are not using common indicators to measure program performance.  OICI measures effectiveness in terms of numbers of the target group trained, the skills in which they are trained, job placements, and job retention.  AID measures OICI's performance in terms of viability (i.e., achievement of 100% local funding of the training centers) within the 3-year target for self-sufficiency.  In order to obtain agreement on performance indicators, use of the logframe is suggested. AID and OICI should also seek agreement on a realistically longer period for attainment of full local funding.  For new OICI programs which are under preparation, both parties should re-examine the practicability of the underlying concept of complete viability in OICI's target countries. As OICI seeks to relate to the needs of new target countries, it may depart radically from service and manufacturing industry skill training in which it has expertise.  Should AID be in accord with OICI entry into rural development and agricultural production, OICI will have to add agricultural/rural development expertise to its headquarters staff. OICI has 17 positions:  11 professional and 6 clerical/secretarial. This headquarters staff backstops 16 US technicians and 45 local nationals in 4 African nations.  While the central office staff may well be irreducible, the type and quality of staff can be modified to assure better levels of accomplishment.  OICI should tighten qualifications for some of its professional positions to strengthen its planning, analytical, and evaluative capabilities.  In addition, OICI is urged to utilize more fully the seasoned staff of OIC/America and other entities established by Rev. Sullivan.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/OTR-C-1381","","6/1/1975 12:00:00 AM","","Educational methods|Nonformal education|Technical training|Industrial occupations|Vocational training|Educational centers","Ethiopia|Ghana|Kenya|Nigeria","","","002434 - Wolf and Co.","","","English","","Logframe change|Indepth evaluation","","","","12 Jun 1975","","","","PERSONNEL AND MANAGEMENT ANALYSIS SURVEY OF OPPORTUNITIES INDUSTRIALIZATION CENTERS INTERNATIONAL (OICI) CENTRAL OFFICE AT PHILADELPHIA.","","PD-AAB-229-A1","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc1Mzkx","","9320055"
"Evaluates the evaluation methodology used to determine the effectiveness of the radiophonic schools component of the Nicaraguan Rural Community Health Service Project (PRACS).  PRACS is intended to provide rural health extension services, paramedical & hlth educator training, and public hlth educ.  The radiophonic schools component utilizes radio instruction & classroom discussion to inform community members of beneficial hlth & hygiene practices while providing experiential trng to hlth educators in radiophonic teaching methods. The eval was conducted by interviewing key schl personnel and studying the evaluative information which was generated by 2 hlth & hygiene trng courses for pregnant women. Participants were tested orally before & after the courses.  Tests were done one by one as many of the participants were illiterate.  The tests were apparently not conducted nor recorded properly as there was no knowledge change with some of the students. Also, there was some lack of correlation between info tested & info transmitted and evidence of testing info which had no relevance to actions within the control of the rural mother (eg, clinical procedures).  In addition to rectifying the above test deficiencies, it is recommended that the wording of the test questions be improved and that more efficient test procedures be developed. There was no scientific eval of change in hlth habits & practices of the women participants.  Progress charts were developed which measured the positive actions of graduates of the 1st course during the 3 mos after they gave birth.  This chart cannot be considered as a true eval tool as the target group surveyed had access to other info inputs and that the charts do not record reasons for non-action or reversal of actions.  It is recommended that info available in the community hlth diagnosis be examined and the hlth promoters & the women, themselves, be interviewed to compare the actions of those trnd by existing programs with those who also attended the radiophonic schls. There was also no credible eval of the incentives used to maintain schl attendance.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/TA-BOA-1060","","11/1/1975 12:00:00 AM","","Educational materials|Radio|Maternal child health care|Training centers|Rural areas|Paramedical education|Change agents|Teacher training|Health education|Educational facilities|Health delivery|Beneficiary interviews","Nicaragua","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAB133B1.pdf","875 KB","000223 - Academy for Educational Development, Inc.

"EVALUATES THE CAPABILITY OF THE PROJECT LOAN RECIPIENT, THE LATIN AMERICAN AGRIBUSINESS DEVELOPMENT CORP  (LAAD), TO EXPAND ITS OPERATIONS INTO THE CARIBBEAN AREA  (INCLUDING COLOMBIA). LAAD PROVIDES LOW-INTEREST LOANS TO LAT AMER AGRIBUSINESSES AND ALSO MAKES EQUITY INVESTMENTS IN THESE ENTERPRISES. PURPOSE OF PROJ IS TO INCREASE LAAD'S AVAILABLE LOAN CAPITAL AND THEREBY INCREASE THE NO OF AGRIBUSINESSES WHICH COULD OBTAIN CREDIT. INFORMATION FOR THIS EVAL WAS DEVELOPED THROUGH AUTHOR'S BRIEF VISIT TO LAAD OFFICES IN MIAMI & GUATEMALA CITY AND DISCUSSIONS WITH THE MANAGERS OF THOSE OFFICES. IT APPEARED THAT EXISTING LAAD LOANS WERE SENSIBLE AND THE ENTERPRISES WHICH HAD RECEIVED CREDIT WERE IN ON DANGER OF FAILING. ALTHOUGH LAAD INTENDS TO MAKE LOANS TO PROMOTE ENTERPRISES WHICH WOULD PEOVIDE ""NEW"" GOODS TO THE MARKETPLACE,PRESENTLY,MOST OF THE LOANS ARE BEING PROVIDED TO MORE PROVEN AGRIBUSINESSES. THE STAFF OF THE VARIOUS LAAD OFFICES SEEMS HIGHLY QUALIFIELD AND IS ADEQUATE FOR PRESENT TASTS. IT WILL REQUIRE STRENGTHENING IF THIS 2ND AID LOAN IS TO BE PROPERLY ADMIITERED,DISBURSED & MONITORED. LAAD HAS PRESENTED ADDIT STAFFING PLANS WHICH ARE JUDGED AS APPROPRIATE. AT PRESENT,LAAD/MIAMI & LAAD/CA HAVE BEEN MUTUALLY SUPPORTIVE WHEN NECESSARY BUT BOTH HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FUNCTION INDEPENDENT OF ASSISTANCE. IT IS,THEREFORE,CONCLUDED THAT ESTABLISHMENT OF AN ADDIT OFFICE WOULD NOT DETRACT FROM THE OPERATIONS OF THE EXISTING OFFICE.

THE MKTG CONTACTS ALREADY ESTABLISHED BY LAAD-MARKETING COULD BE UTILIZED BY LAAD/CARIBE-SUPPORTED AGRIBUSINESSES AND SUCH UTILIZATN WOULD RECIPROCALLY STRENGTHEN LAAD-MKTG. ITS ACCEPTANCE IN THE AREA WOULD SEEM ASSURED AS NO SIMILAR LENDING INSTIT CURRENTLY EXISTS. IT IS RECOMMENDED,THEREFORE,THAT A 2ND LOAN TO LAAD IS FEASIBLE ALTHOUGH AID SHOULD RECONSIDER ITS PLAN FOR ADMINISTERING THE LOAN IN WASHINGTON.

THE RURAL ENTERPRISE DEVELOPMENT FUND, ADMINISTERED BY THE BANCO INDUSTRIAL DEL PERU, IS INTENDED TO PROVIDE CREDIT AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO RURAL ENTERPRISES WHICH DO NOT HAVE NORMAL ACCESS TO CREDIT ON REASONABLE TERMS AND CONDITIONS. THE 3-WEEK EVALUATION INCLUDED INTERVIEWS WITH BANK OFFICIALS IN LIMA AND 2 OF THE 4 REGIONAL BRANCH OFFICES OF THE BANK. THE BANK HAS EMPLOYED 3 ""PROMOTORES"" TO HEAD THE FUND'S OPERATIONS IN THE REGIONAL BRANCHES. DURING THE FIRST 6 MONTHS OF THE FUND'S EXISTENCE, ONLY 7 SUB-LOANS REPRESENTING LESS THAN 1% OF THE ENTIRE FUND HAVE BEEN APPROVED.

BRANCH PERSONNEL DO NOT HAVE A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF THE FUND'S PURPOSE. SUB-LOANS ARE BEING MADE TO PARTIES ELIGIBLE FOR COMMERCIAL BANK FINANCING. ONE BRANCH MANAGER STATED THAT HIS UNDERSTANDING OF THE FUND WAS MERELY THAT IT ""OFFERED LOWER INTEREST RATES"", AND ADDED THAT THE BRANCH OFFICE WOULD CONTINUE TO REQUIRE 100% GUARANTEES FOR ALL SUB-LOANS. AT PRESENT, THE ADMINISTRATIVE SYSTEM UNDER WHICH THE FUND OPERATES IS NOT ADEQUATE. THERE IS CONSIDERABLE CONFUSION AS TO WHERE ADMINISTRATIVE AND SUPERVISORY AUTHORITY LIE.

"Evaluates the Family Planning Training and Research Center of the Planned Parenthood Association/Chicago Area (PPA/CA) over the period 5/72 - 2/75. Under contract with USAID, PPA/CA provides flexible training programs, tailored to meet the individual needs of LDC participants. Generally, PPA/CA is used as an auxiliary rather than a primary training center.  Most participants are sent to PPA/CA for brief training sessions, often before or after an academic program elsewhere. From 5/72 to 10/74, 310 LDC participants have been trained. The training center, located in the University of Illinois Medical Complex, has a cadre of 34 consultant faculty available for training on an ad hoc basis.  The Center's International Training Division consists of a core staff of 6 individuals. The staff is well coordinated, and while they lack overseas experience, they are dedicated to their work and sensitive to the needs of the participants. Clinical facilities utilized in training of participants are well staffed and efficiently operated.  Leadership throughout PPA/CA in clinical and non-clinical activities was found to be excellent.  Patient counseling is stressed at all clinics, an aspect of acceptor management generally neglected in LDC clinics, leading to an increased drop-out rate. The 2 mobile clinics are seldom used and should be eliminated from the contract.  The Center's Demonstration Clinic provides an adequate training setting. There is no formal systematic follow-up of returned participants by PPA/CA or AID.  Since most participants receive their primary training at other facilities, PPA/CA feels that measuring the impact on later job performance of training received just at PPA/CA is usually not possible. It is recommended that USAID ask LDC's to contact participants of the past 3 years to determine their current use of training. Authors recommend that the PPA/CA contract be continued. Report briefly reviews two previous contracts with PPA/CA dating back to 6/78.","Evaluation period: 1 May 1972-1 Feb 1975","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","2/1/1975 12:00:00 AM","","Family planning occupations|Medical education|FAMILY PLANNING|Participants|Family planning clinics|Training centers|Beneficiary count|Limited data plus","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAM830.pdf","5,730 KB","000035 - U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)","","","English","application/pdf","Pre evaluation data|Evaluation team","","WINFIELD, GERALD F.|WARD, THOMAS|et al.","","1 Feb 1975","","AID/CSD-3421","","EVALUATION - PLANNED PARENTHOOD ASSOCIATION/CHICAGO AREA FAMILY PLANNING TRAINING AND RESEARCH CENTER","","PD-AAM-830","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc1Njcx","Population and Humanitarian Assistance","9320651"
"EVALUATES THE ""TECHNICAL INFORMATION NETWORK"" PROGRAM FROM FY72 TO 10/75. THE OBJECTIVE OF THE PROGRAM, IMPLEMENTED BY THE NATIONAL TECHNICAL INFORMATION SERVICE (NTIS), IS TO PROMOTE THE DISSEMINATION OF US GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED RESEARCH RESULTS TO LDC'S IN LATIN AMERICA. A TEAM OF 3 EVALUATORS REVIEWED PROJECT MATERIALS AND INTERVIEWED NTIS PERSONNEL IN WASHINGTON AS WELL AS NTIS AGENTS AND CLIENTS OF THOSE AGENTS IN BRAZIL, ECUADOR, AND COLOMBIA. THE AGENCY RELATIONSHIPS WHICH NTIS HAS ESTABLISHED WITH LDC INFORMATION ORGANIZATIONS HAVE HELPED TO INCREASE SALES OF USG REPORTS. THE EVALUATORS NOTE, HOWEVER, THAT EXCEPT FOR SALES RECORDS, NEITHER USAID NOR NTIS HAS COLLECTED CASE STUDIES OR OTHER INFORMATION WHICH CAN DEMONSTRATE THAT THE REPORTS ARE RELEVANT TO LDC NEEDS AND HAVE AN IMPACT ON DEVELOPMENT. DISCUSSIONS WITH AGENTS AND END-USERS IN THE COUNTRIES VISITED INDICATED THAT USG REPORTS, ALTHOUGH USEFUL, ARE NOT NECESSARILY THE BEST RESOURCES FOR THEIR NEEDS. PARTICULARLY IN SMALL AND MEDIUM INDUSTRY, RESEARCH RESULTS DO NOT PROVIDE THE KINDS OF INFORMATION THAT CAN IMMEDIATELY BE APPLIED TO THE TECHNICAL PROBLEMS AT HAND. WHAT PLANT MANAGERS AND ENGINEERS NEED ARE ACTUAL SYSTEM DESIGNS, PRODUCT SPECIFICATIONS, ""HOW-TO"" MANUALS, MACHINERY CATALOGS, AND NAMES OF MANUFACTURERS AND TECHNICAL PERSONNEL WITH RELEVANT EXPERIENCE. END-USERS INDICATED THAT USG REPORTS HAVE BEEN PRIMARILY USEFUL IN STIMULATING IDEAS FOR NEW BUSINESS VENTURES AND THAT NEED IS GREATEST FOR OLDER US TECHNOLOGY RATHER THAN FOR CURRENT, MORE SOPHISTICATED TECHNOLOGY. MANAGEMENT CONTROL BY BOTH USAID AND NTIS HAS BEEN LESS THAN ADEQUATE. NTIS SHOULD INSTITUTE A SYSTEM OF REPORTS FROM AGENTS, COLLECT CASE STUDIES, AND VISIT AGENTS MORE FREQUENTLY FOR TRAINING AND EVALUATION. NTIS SHOULD ALSO IMPROVE ITS PROMOTIONAL ANNOUNCEMENTS BY ADDING ABSTRACTS, SIMPLIFYING ORDERING INSTRUCTIONS, AND HELPING AGENTS PREPARE LOCAL-LANGUAGE VERSIONS.

"The Farmer Development Program had three objectives: (1) to strengthen existing institutions; (2) to create new institutions; and (3) to coordinate the diverse participating agencies.  The Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock, the University of Costa Rica, and six other public institutions had responsibilities for different project tasks which included: (1) reorganization of small farmer services; (2) coordination of the agricultural sector; (3) adoption of evaluation techniques; (4) credit programs; (5) sale of and title to land; (6) seed laboratory; (7) nutrition technology laboratory; and (8) encouraging the cooperation of farmers.  Major shortcomings encountered were: (1) the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock did not give adequate support to program and regionalization activities; (2) correspondent banks did not increase the availability of credit to small farmers; (3) the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock did not coordinate its activities with other institutions; (4) personnel responsible for developing cooperatives did not have the necessary skills to administer cooperatives or develop satisfactory relations with other institutions; (5) the National Production Council was reluctant to accept administrative reforms and it performed poorly in the grain storage project; and (6) the community development institution was unable to coordinate its activities in the rural communities.  Although the primary objective of helping small farmers was accepted by the participating institutions, variations of interpretation sometimes resulted in effective neglect of the program's intended goals. Shortcomings notwithstanding, the evaluators believe the program is relatively successful.  Their recommendations include: (1) reduce the number of participating agencies; (2) hire better qualified personnel; and (3) improve coordination between institutions.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","12/1/1975 12:00:00 AM","","Public land records|Agricultural cooperatives|Rural development|Cereals|Food storage|Seeds|Agricultural storage facilities|Cadasters|Agricultural credit|Institution building|Small farms|Farmers","Costa Rica","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAA442A1.pdf","1,974 KB","001952 - American Association of Retired Persons","","","English","application/pdf","","","","","26 Dec 1975","","","","EVALUACION FINAL DEL PROGRAMA DE DESARROLLO AGROPECUARIO; 1971-1974 (FINAL EVALUATION OF THE FARM DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM; 1971-1974)","","PD-AAA-442-A1","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc2MzQx","Costa Rica","5150117"
"The three major functions of the Centro Nacional de Tecnologia Agropecuaria (CENTA) -- research, education, and extension -- seem to work well together.  The graduates, trained at the Escuela Nacional de Agricultura, move into the extension and research offices, and the results of laboratory and field experiments flow to the extension office.  The staffs in the extension offices use a variety of methods to communicate new data to the farmers. While staff tunover rate has been high, recent changes have reduced staff loss considerably.  While the original plan to make CENTA a semi-autonomous unit would have given CENTA greater flexibility of operation, it does not appear that CENTA suffers as a division of the Ministry of Agriculture. Autonomy may come, but until it does, CENTA's position within the organizational structure of the Ministry appears logical and appropriate. In spite of a somewhat slow and shaky start for CENTA, the present environment is decidedly positive, though certain success can not be guaranteed. Periodic semi-annual evaluations should be made to assure continuation of current progress.  The Government of El Salvador has committed itself to providing additional resources to meet substantially increased costs and to complete the regional and support centers.  The request of the Government of El Salvador for extension of the Terminal Commitment Date to June 30, l976, and the Terminal Disbursement Date to December 31, 1976, seems reasonable and the evaluators recommended that the extensions be granted.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","7/1/1975 12:00:00 AM","","Building construction|Agricultural buildings|Delivery systems|Agricultural inputs|Institution building|Agricultural education|Agricultural research|Agricultural extension","El Salvador","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAA793F1.pdf","1,095 KB","","","","English","application/pdf","","","BROWN, ALBERT L.|COHEN, NORMAN","Agricultural development","11 Jul 1975","","","","APPRAISAL TRIP REPORT ON EL SALVADOR AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT - RESEARCH, EDUCATION AND EXTENSION LOAN, NO. 519-L-018","","PD-AAA-793-F1","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc2MzQy","El Salvador","5190164"

"Evaluates project to improve the primary education system in Ecuador. This loan completion review covers a period ending 12/31/74.  No methodology is indicated. The loan resulted in the construction of 222 schools with 1,430 classrooms, as follows:  195 new schools with 1,310 classrooms; 26 schools not completed due to lack of funds, with 98 classrooms; one normal school with 22 classrooms; and 10 teacher's lodgings in remote rural areas. Approximately $4.7 million was spent on the construction component of the project. Approximately $500,000 was spent on the textbook component, under which a total of 2.5 million primary school textboooks and 30,000 teacher's guides were printed for grades 1-4. The estimated future capacity for textbook purchases by the Ministry of Education (MOE) is 1.1 million primary school textbooks and 30,000 teacher's guides for grades 5-6.  The MOE has not yet established a special fund for repair and replacement of primary textbooks, as stipulated in the Loan Agreement, due in part to its plan to provide all primary textbooks free out of its general budget. Approximately $160,000 in PL 480 funds was allocated to the MOE to maintain the schools constructed with loan funds. Achievement in this area has not been complete.  The MOE has not yet prepared a satisfactory school maintenance plan, finalized a school maintenance manual, nor carried out maintenance training, as required by the Loan Agreement. MOE clearly needs further assistance in this area. Of the $641,000 allocated for imported construction materials, equipment, and office items, $141,00 was used to procure steel plate to construct prefabricated schools.  A total of 1,276 classrooms classrooms have been built so far, about seven classrooms per eight hour shift. The Government of Ecuador (GOE) considered the $168,000 it spent for equipment for these structures as a counterpart contribution to the Project Revolving Fund. The loan is now fully disbursed, all project elements are completed, and no further field monitoring of the loan is needed.","Loan no. 518-L-027|Evaluation period: Through 31 Dec 1974","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","2/1/1975 12:00:00 AM","","Primary education|Educational materials|Primary schools|Teacher training|Educational facilities|Building construction|Financial resources|Institution building|Teachers' colleges|Limited data","Ecuador","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAF773A1.pdf","220 KB","008538 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to implement a comprehensive primary school improvement project in Ecuador.  This final evaluation covers a period ending 12/31/74 and is based in part on a loan completion report (PD-AAF-773-A1).  No methodology is indicated. The loan is fully disbursed and terminated.  As a result of a 1972 special evaluation, there was a major replanning of the project and an amended loan agreement.  Largely because of inflation, the number of classrooms to be constructed was substantially revised downwards. The number of schools actually completed exceeded slightly the amended target.  Despite the shortfall from the original target, the project purpose of creating a viable institutional framework capable of further activity was achieved. The quality of instruction improved considerably as a result of loan-funded textbook activity and related grant-funded materials preparation and teacher training programs.  Although there is still a classroom deficit, loan-funded technical expertise and increased oil revenues should enable the Government of Ecuador (GOE) to redress this problem.  The Ecuadorean Department of School Constructions is now self-sustaining and is producing seven steel-framed classrooms per day and over 300 metal school desks and chairs using a loan-funded prefabrication process. The GOE plans to triple this output by l975-76 and should overcome the classroom gap within five years. The loan helped the GOE to create a staff of over 200 professionals in the Ministry of Education to undertake and supervise school construction.  In addition, a textbook department fully staffed with trained professionals was created.  Over 2.5 million copies of 12 books written by department personnel for grades 1-4 have been published so far, and those for grades 5-6 will be published by 6/75. The GOE also created a national system of bookstores to sell and distribute educational materials. The project contributed considerably to the sector goal of helping the marginal poor participate in socioeconomic life.  The assumption that these people would make use of loan-provided opportunities was verified.","Loan no. 518-L-027|Evaluation period: Through 31 Dec 1974","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","2/1/1975 12:00:00 AM","","Primary education|Educational materials|Primary schools|Building construction|Professionals|Financial resources|Institution building|Teacher training","Ecuador","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAI586A1.pdf","152 KB","008538 - USAID.

"Evaluates loan project providing seed capital to the Cooperative Bank of Ecuador to finance subloans to agriculture and transportation credit unions and cooperatives for the procurement of needed goods and services, including the importation of office and accounting equipment. Neither evaluation time period nor methodology is specified. Of the $1.2 million provided under this loan, $319,600 was used to finance 24 subloans to small cooperatives for agricultural machinery and equipment, vehicles and spare parts, and other commodities.  The average size of the subloans was $13,300 -- one indication of the loan's success in reaching smaller producers.  In addition, approximately, $642,000 was subloaned to FENACOOPARR, a private federation of rice-growing cooperatives, to finance an agricultural machinery pool (14 tractors and one excavating machine).  Five subloans totalling $210,000 were made to transporation cooperatives to purchase machinery and vehicles. Approximately $16,000 was used for the purchase of office equipment for the cooperative Bank through the Letter of Commitment Procedure. Approximately $12,373 will be available for deobligation upon loan reconciliation.  Monthly and quarterly reports have been received through 9/30/74.  USAID has requested that the Cooperative Bank provide the remaining reports.  A joint USAID-Cooperative Bank inspection of the initial operations of the FENACOOPARR machinery pool was carried out in 3/75.  The inspection was favorable.  Authors note that this loan project was a particularly successful example of A.I.D. institution-building in Ecuador.","Loan no. 518-L-131","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","3/1/1975 12:00:00 AM","","Cooperatives|Development banks|Financing|Agricultural cooperatives|Agricultural credit|Institution building|Financial resources|Small farms|Farmers|Agricultural equipment|Limited data","Ecuador","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAF936A1.pdf","160 KB","008538 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to reconstruct Managua after the 1972 earthquake. This special evaluation, which was conducted in 6/75 and is based on interviews and meetings with project personnel and a review of relevant files, focuses on the Government of Nicaragua's Program for Immediate Action (PRAI) for rebuilding Managua. Generally, the PRAI is a successful ""action planning"" program, both for its specific purposes and as a tool used for middle-range planning. Nevertheless, problems do exist. First, private sector projects have not been integrated into the reconstruction process.  Also, meaningful project consultations have been limited to the technical and high administrative levels.  To be more effective, these meetings must have a larger perspective.  People involved in packaging aspects of the project do not have a full understanding of programing methods.  Also, long-range planning techniques have not matured to the point where they can provide specific guidelines to be followed. Finally, the attitude that reconstruction is an ongoing process is not yet widespread in the PRAI staff. Although daily, informal, on-the-job training has been taking place, no efforts have been made to use resident U.S. technical advisors to teach Nicaraguans urban planning and programming. It is recommended that such a training program be developed by the project's principal advisor. It is also recommended that all urban planners be educated in either architecture, civil engineering, law, or an empirical science; that programming and a sense of process be emphasized in their training; and that they be trained in data processing and evaluation, and in how to package related projects into various programs.  The importance of long-range urban design and environmental plans as a heuristic device to test program combinations and long-term implication should be recognized and the link between planning and implementation be made clear. Finally, planners should understand the need for outside participation in the planning process and how this interaction can be developed at the early planning stage.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID-524-76-059-T","","6/1/1975 12:00:00 AM","","On the job training|Urban renewal|Disaster relief|Technicians|Technical training|Higher education|URBAN PLANNING|Government policy|Urban areas|Land use","Nicaragua","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAF969A1.pdf","238 KB","","","","English","application/pdf","Indepth evaluation","","MANN, LAWRENCE","","6 Jun 1975","","","","EVALUATION OF MANAGUA RECONSTRUCTION PLANNING","","PD-AAF-969-A1","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc2OTQ3","Nicaragua","5240140"
"Evaluates project to integrate population and family planning (P/FP) curriculum into LDC home economic (HE) programs.  This special evaluation covers the period 1972 to 1975 and is based on an examination of data according to a predetermined evaluation design. Approximately 150 home economists (HIC) representing 34 LDC's have attended P/FP courses.  Most HIC's and FP personnel appear eager to integrate HE programs into their domestic FP programs.  The American Home Economics Association (AHEA) has established a foundation for further work and has contacted women and girls not reached by other programs.  Its plans and methods should be continued. Specific findings and recommendations include the following.  (1) This project has increased the number of persons providing FP information and has contributed to the development of FP information delivery systems in LDC's.  The AHEA contract should be continued for at least three more years. (2) AHEA has not established new objectives for projects in specific countries nor encouraged new countries in the program.  AHEA should assess the current status of the project in each participating LDC and develop country-specific goals and schedules to meet these objectives.  The involvement of new countries should also be considered.  (3) AHEA has not developed an adequate follow-up system for monitoring HIC's and such a plan is urgently needed.  (4) AHEA has made headway in coordinating international HE efforts, yet HIC's are not well organized internationally and are still uncertain in their support for action in FP.  AHEA should expand its contacts with the International Federation for HE and with UN agencies.  (5) High quality teaching and orientation materials have been developed and distributed to participating LDC's.  AHEA should catalogue and evaluate all materials emerging from LDC's to determine further development and informational gaps. (6) All project staff presently work directly under the project director.  Staff responsibilities should be and include long- and short-term delegation of authority.  AHEA should balance the headquarter's staff size with the project.","Evaluation period: 1 Jan 1972-1 Mar 1975","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","3/1/1975 12:00:00 AM","","Institution building|Family planning services|Associations|Delivery systems|Information dissemination|Family planning education|FAMILY PLANNING|Private voluntary organizations|Curriculum design|Family planning promotion programs|Development program evaluation|Educational materials|Household management|Seminars","","","","001398 - Pennsylvania State University","","","English","","Evaluation team|Indepth evaluation","","RAY, ELIZABETH|STATHES, GEORGE H.|et al.","","1 Mar 1975","","","","EVALUATION REPORT - FAMILY PLANNING PROMOTION THROUGH HOME ECONOMICS - AMERICAN HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION","","PD-AAA-315-A1","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc3MzEz","Population and Humanitarian Assistance","9320980"
"Evaluates project to strengthen family planning programs in developing countries.  Evaluation covers the period 6/30/71-2/28/75 and is based on interviews with Family Planning International Assistance (FPIA) personnel and visits to 39 field projects in 14 countries. Most of the field projects were well conceived and adequately administered. Contraceptives, supplies, and equipment are being provided by FPIA, but mostly outside of the subproject. The Colorado training program and the Philippines sterilization center are good examples of the specialized training programs being funded by FPIA. However, aside from supporting a training project in Tanzania and the presence of midwives in many of the subprojects, training has not been emphasized as planned.  Training should be expanded to include other auxiliary and paraprofessional personnel. information, education, and communication (IEC) objectives are being achieved as evidenced by the knowledge and attitude studies carried out in some of the projects, audience response to mass communications programs, and acceptor response to joint IEC/FP services.  The innovative nature of many of the subprojects (such as FP services for the Hill Tribes of Northern Thailand, the introduction of a FP program by a Catholic service organization in Indonisia, and the use of women's association members as FP workers in Nepal) is a major strength. Principal project weaknesses are the lack of a comprehensive management system, the lack of systematic feedback to the field, and the failure to integrate evaluation activities into the overall project. Forty recommendations are outlined, including:  (1) that FPIA assist its clients to find alternative sources of financing; (2) that the evaluation of the current project information system be continued, emphasizing project management/monitoring needs; (3) that an integrated system of program planning, administration, and evaluation be developed; (4) that a limited clearinghouse be established to disseminate ideas, approaches, and materials developed under the subprojects; and (5) that the administrative burden on subproject managers be reduced.","Evaluation period: 30 Jun 1971-28 Feb 1975","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","2/1/1975 12:00:00 AM","","Private voluntary organizations|Family planning services|Delivery systems|Family planning education|Family planning promotion programs|Family planning surveys|Workshops|Information storage and retrieval systems|Logistics|Contraceptive agents and devices|Contraceptive distribution|Paramedical midwives|Nurse midwives|Assistants|Health workers|Family planning occupations|Medical education","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAJ807.pdf","20,965 KB","000380 - Columbia University.

"Evaluates project to increase the availability of U.S. technical publications in LDC's.  Special evaluation covers the period 1/74-11/75 and is based on site visits and document review. Although the goal of transferring technical information to LDC's is worthwhile, the ability of the National Technical Information Service (NTIS) to direct such an effort is questionable.  NTIS is primarily a document collection and dissemination service and does not provide the complete range of services available from Canadian, Danish, and British organizations.  NTIS reports are too research-oriented and can already be obtained either from NTIS itself or from local libraries and information centers. While use of agents from counterpart LDC information institutions can boost sales (e.g., Ecuador), in other cases sales are only slightly influenced (e.g., Brazil), or agents are poorly equipped to act as sales promotors (e.g., Colombia).  Also, given that A.I.D. subsidizes some agents, the system may jeopardize an agent's ability to act in his/her nation's interest in judging the appropriateness and relevancy of the information being transferred. Project management by both NTIS and A.I.D. has been inadequate. NTIS, while responding to agents' problems, has not worked sufficiently with agents to assure achievement of project objectives.  For its part, A.I.D. has not demanded NTIS report its activities with sufficient frequency or detail. Although it is recommended that A.I.D. continue the project using NTIS through FY77, it is recommended that NTIS visit agents more frequently; increase training in information retrieval/dissemination methodology; better report agent achievements; handle all announcements through agents; assist agents to develop better announcement systems using local language promotional aids; and fund agent purchases of microfiche reader/printers.  It is also recommended that A.I.D provide discounts in countries where report prices have constrained sales; study new ways of assisting the transfer of more relevant information to LDC's from a variety of U.S. sources; and prepare case studies on the project's economic impact.","Evaluation period: 1 Jan 1974-1 Nov 1975","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1975 12:00:00 AM","","Scientific information|Technical information|Information dissemination|Technology transfer|Management information systems|Management training|Scientific publications|Technical assistance","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAH542.pdf","7,345 KB","000204 - USAID.
