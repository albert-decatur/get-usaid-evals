"Mid-term evaluation of a project to help developing countries develop a strategic management approach to implementing policy changes that involve stakeholders with conflicting agendas.  The evaluation covers the period 1990-1993. The project is unusually well-designed.  A.I.D.'s project leadership in Washington has been outstanding, and the personnel recruited by the contractors have been impressive.  The project has been very successful in helping the initial group of host countries to implement policy changes, although it is too early to judge the sustainability of these changes.  While it is not certain that all the elements of strategic management have been applied, early success of the field projects implies that most have.  Application of some of the management concepts and techniques has been outstanding. The involvement of various stakeholders in planning the implementation of policy changes in several field projects has been impressive.  The perception that the project is rendering worthwhile assistance in a complex and difficult area is evidenced in the positive statements from host country participants and a higher than expected level of Mission buy-ins. The project clearly warrants continuation, with increased emphasis on ensuring the sustainability of project concepts and processes not only in host countries but in A.I.D. itself. Regional buy-ins have come mostly from the Africa Bureau, and senior Agency personnel have shown little interest in the project.  Further, the current reorganization of A.I.D. and funding cutbacks pose new challenges to the project.  It is recommended that the project approach be adapted for use in Eastern Europe and the New Independent States.  The project also needs a suitable home within A.I.D., possibly the democratic development office within the new Global Bureau, or the new office concerned with economic growth.","Delivery order no. 17|Project title: Advancing basic education and literacy (ABEL)|Project title: Implementing policy change (IPC)","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-5832-I-00-0081-00","","1/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Development policy|Policy reform|Implementation|Strategic planning|Management development","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABH475.pdf","4,773 KB","000223 - Academy for Educational Development, Inc.

"Final evaluation of a project component to provide credit to small-scale enterprises (SSEs) in Senegal.  The evaluation covers the period 1/90-7/31/93. The project achieved its objectives.  The project has been institutionalized, with the establishment by law on 5/9/93 of a private financial institution (Agence de Credit pour l'Entreprise Privee -- or ACEP) in Dakar to continue SSE credit activities in the project area; all project assets were transferred to ACEP, which will commence operations as of 1/94.  ACEP's staff were fully trained and their abilities to manage the project were demonstrated over the past year, during which period the project was under total Senegalese management and continued to be successful and profitable.  In fact, the profitability of lending to SSEs in Senegal has been clearly demonstrated, as the project posted net profits of CFA 19.970 million in 1991, CFA 63.625 million in 1992, and CFA 56.368 million as of 7/31/93. Numerical targets were exceeded by far.  A total of 3,793 SSEs in five major economic sectors received a total of 5,412 loans; evaluations of 2,209 of these loans showed that 2,477 new jobs had been created.  At this rate -- 1.12 new jobs per loan -- it is conceivable that 6,061 jobs may have been created. The outlook for sustainability of ACEP is very good:  ACEP's financial position has improved steadily over the past 3 years, showing net profits and keeping non-performing and trouble loans within manageable parameters; the Ministry of Finance has reaffirmed its support for the credit union and its expansion into the agricultural sector; and the Canadian Government has agreed to provide TA to ACEP over the next 3 years to assist in the establishment of credit union networks and guide ACEP in its new operations. Finally, it is noted that the National Project Committee (NPC), comprised of representatives from USAID and Government of Senegal (GOS) ministries (Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Interior, and Ministry of Women, Children, and Family), performed an important function in helping to develop consensus on policies regarding ACEP's mandate and operations. Lessons learned included the following.  (1) Future similar project grant agreements should clearly define the disposition of project assets at the end of the project period.  (2) USAID needs to expedite approval and implementation of policy decisions; for example, Amendment No. 6 to the present project, a request to allow the GOS to contribute $1.7 million (an action unprecedented by the GOS) to the project, took a full year to be finalized. (3) USAID should give more weight to the advice and expertise of its contractor in regard to the project and its institutionalization.  (4) In projects where monitoring of profitability is important, USAID should ensure that the project establish at the outset an accounting system that can be effective within the legal and regulatory context of the host country.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","685-0260-C-00-3381-00","","1/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Small scale enterprises|Credit|Financial institutions|Credit unions|Private sector|Institution building|Management development","Senegal","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABH491.pdf","2,864 KB","004247 - Social Consultants International, Inc.","","008600 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (8/84-3/93) to help the Government of Rwanda (GOR) develop an integrated farming systems approach to research and extension (FSR/E). Results were less than expected. Project attempts to diffuse the FSR/E approach among personnel of the Institut des Sciences Agronomiques du Rwanda (ISAR) and the Ministry of Agriculture (MINAGRI) had only limited success, due to the unfamiliarity of the University of Arkansas (UOA) TA team with FSR methodology. Due to an reorganization of ISAR's structure, FSR is now conducted under programs funded by many donors. On the positive side, UOA did assist ISAR in conducting research to adapt food crops to high altitudes. Crops which adapted well were distributed as seed to farmers. Further, agricultural inputs such as lime were used to improve soil fertility. Adaptive research on livestock was never undertaken. Project research was conducted at the Rwerere research station, constructed with the help of project funds. Unfortunately, the War of October 1990 had very adverse effects on the station: expatriate advisors were relocated to Kigali between 11/90 and 11/91, leaving research in the hands of Rwandans newly graduated from U.S. universities. The station was attacked by both the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) and the Rwandan Army during 1992, and was severely damaged in February 1993, when the whole area was occupied by the RPF, stopping all project activities. In the extension component, UOA developed a parallel extension service which served ISAR researchers well, though lacking close ties with the MINAGRI extension service. After the termination of the UOA contract, the project extensionists were given a competency test and the best were either taken up by Africare for work in the Natural Resource Management Project (6960129) or were absorbed by MINAGRI; those who failed the test were fired. Under the participant training component, 4 Ph.D., 10 M.S., and 8 B.S. candidates studied various agricultural disciplines in U.S. universities. Only 12 of the 21 students who returned to Rwanda after completing their degrees have remained with ISAR, however. Although training was considered the most lasting effect of the project, it is likely that the increasing capability of ISAR staff to perform adaptive research is due less to project training, than to hands-on training by the German Society for Technical Cooperation (GTZ) under its current FSR programs. Under an OPG, Africare implemented a rural infrastructure component composed of training centers, water supply systems and spring capping, and the improvement of rural access roads. One 10 km road in Butaro was not improved due to civil unrest. Funds intended for the road improvement were used to construct a large bridge in Nyarutovu commune, as suggested by local authorities. The project taught that the selection of a prime TA contractor is critical to project implementation. The contractor must have a proven capability to execute a project as required by the scope of work and must provide qualified and competent long- and short-term experts. The project also taught the importance of monitoring by the Mission, especially in the first years of implementation.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Applied research|Farming systems research|Agricultural extension|Universities and colleges","Rwanda","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABH602.pdf","713 KB","008598 - USAID.

"Evaluates two projects to support environmental conservation in Latin America and the Caribbean.  The Development of Environmental Management Systems project (DEMS) was implemented from 1979 through 1989.  The Environmental Support (ESP) project, launched in 1990, is a follow-on to the DEMS project. In general, the projects have been a success.  They have: contributed to an understanding of environmental issues at the regional and country levels; made significant contributions to USAID compliance with environmental regulations and Congressional mandates; helped USAIDs to incorporate environmental concerns cross-sectorally; and enhanced the design, implementation, and monitoring of environmental/natural resource projects.  Missions have greatly benefitted from the existence of a Washington, D.C.-based central office, which provided up-to-date interpretations of complex environmental concerns, and from the presence of regional advisors to respond to pressing issues. Pilot projects financed under the two projects have provided inexpensive solutions to a range of environmental problems, and particularly addressed Congressional mandates.  These projects have demonstrated which paths to pursue and which to avoid on the road to practical environmental solutions.  They also enhanced the capabilities of many U.S. and local NGOs. The principal limitations of the two projects were due to there being more demand for services than could be satisfied by the personnel involved or financial resources available.  There were not enough project specialists to respond to the needs of more than 20 Missions. At the same time, the projects have provided poor documentation of results and have rarely been able to provide the depth of assistance and training which is needed by regional and country Mission personnel. Pilot projects were poorly monitored, and the historical record of lessons learned from these initiatives is incomplete.","Delivery order no. 6","Special Evaluation","Documents","AEP-0085-I-06-3001-00","","2/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Environmental management|Development programs|Development administration|USAID|Pilot projects","Latin America|Caribbean","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABH758.pdf","2,836 KB","003970 - Management Systems International, Inc.

"This assessment of USAID/Togo's program impact during FY93 covers a period marred by political violence, a 9-month national strike, and ensuing economic and social deterioration.  The political crisis caused serious delays in program implementation, and in 2/93, suspension of U.S. economic aid, except for humanitarian programs.  In 11/93, the decision to close USAID/T was announced, and all U.S. direct hires are expected to be gone by 6/30/94. Section I of the report describes the factors affecting USAID/T's program in  FY93.  Section II outlines progress toward the overall program goal of sustainable market-oriented economic growth, and the subgoal of an improved human resource base, and includes tables of macroeconomic and educational/health indicators.  Section III discusses level of achievement of the Mission's two strategic objectives:  (1) improved maternal/child health and reduced fertility; and (2) a strengthened national credit union.  Finally, Section IV discusses democratic initiatives undertaken by the Mission. Overall, USAID has had a positive impact in Togo, especially in the health sector and the credit union movement.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Internal conflict|Development programs|Political aspects|Economic indicators|Education|Health aspects|Credit unions|Democratization","Togo","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABH765.pdf","693 KB","008614 - USAID.

"Interim evaluation of a component of a project in Kenya to strengthen institutions that support private business growth through policy reform advocacy or the provision of financing and advisory services.  The component focused on channeling funds through a Trustee (Standard Chartered Bank Ltd.) to two Kenyan equity capital companies -- Industrial Promotion Services Ltd. (IPS), and Kenya Equity Management Ltd. (KEM) -- to strengthen their capacities to invest in business ventures.  The evaluation covered the period 5/87-2/94. The evaluation concludes that the venture capital program, which it calls ""an experiment,"" should be discontinued or at least thoroughly restructured.  The reason lies not in poor project implementation, but faulty design -- the market conditions and demand for venture capital companies simply do not exist in Kenya. In fact, neither IPS nor KEM is operating as a true venture capital company as outlined in the Trust Agreement, nor is it likely that either will do so in the near future.  IPS is essentially a holding company, while KEM essentially operates as a merchant banking company.  However, the success of both in their respective activities indicates a demand for such institutions in Kenya; USAID should consider modifying its approach to support these institutions as they are. Finally, from a purely financial point of view, the program had little chance of succeeding -- USAID-provided funds are not enough to support one, much less two, private investment companies.  Furthermore, the value of the funds in the Trust, being held in Kenyan shilling-denominated securities, has been dissipated by the devaluation of the Kenyan shilling; in fact, the Trustee, in reinvesting reflows from Trust loans, has not been able to keep up with rate of currency devaluation. Lessons learned include the following.  (1) A project such as this one which is basically experimental in nature (venture capital markets are rare in the developing world, and previous efforts to advance venture capital in Africa have met with little success) should be identified as such in the project description; this would both facilitate evaluation, and increase the value of any evaluation findings.  (2) It is not enough for donors to perceive an economic need for a commercial venture capital market; investors and companies in recipient countries must also perceive a need.  As a rule, no amount of donor support will be sufficient to create a market where demand does not exist.","Delivery order no. 13","Special Evaluation","Documents","PCE-0001-I-00-2051-00","","2/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Financial institutions|Capital markets|Venture capital|Institution building|Investment promotion|Business enterprises|Equity|Demand","Kenya","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABH766.pdf","2,277 KB","001335 - Chemonics International Consulting Div.","","008565 - USAID.

"The development of legal systems in support of the Rule of Law has emerged as a major goal of USAID's democracy portfolio.  This study, based on field work in six countries (Argentina, Colombia, Honduras, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, and Uruguay), assesses the recent Rule of Law experience of USAID, the Asia Foundation, and the Ford Foundation, all longtime donors in the justice sector. The study identifies four alternative, although often complementary, strategies for legal development. In sequential order, these are:  building political support for reform; establishing adequate legal system structures; making these structures accessible and equitable; and strengthening existing legal structures.  Lessons pertaining to these strategies are summarized.  (1) Building of political support is critical, but donor efforts in coalition- and constituency-building have often failed.  The commercial sector can offer valuable support, as can bar associations, while a free press is essential.  (2) Structural reform is a formidable challenge, but sometimes it is more rewarding to create new institutions than to reform entrenched ones.  Efforts to introduce merit-based career systems and oral trial procedures have succeeded in several of the countries. Any reform process that does not include mechanisms to ensure enforcement will likely prove ineffective.  (3) Legal advocacy NGOs represent the most promising strategy for improving legal access for the poor, while alternative dispute mechanisms are also attractive, although they need close supervision.  More conventional means (e.g., legal aid, legal literacy campaigns, paralegal training) are effective when integrated around specific issues.  (4) Strategies for legal system strengthening, pursued in all six countries, include traditional institution-building efforts such as improving court administration and training judicial personnel.  Successful components of strengthening vary widely among countries; understanding the reasons for court delays is an essential, but almost always difficult task.  In conclusion, the study discusses several cross-cutting lessons.","Evaluation highlights: PN-ABG-033|Summary: PN-ABG-030|French ed.: PN-ACC-088","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","2/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Administration of law|Development strategies|Legal reform|Legal systems|Judicial reform|Judiciary|Rule of law","Colombia|Philippines|Sri Lanka|Uruguay|Honduras|Argentina","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAX280.pdf","3,084 KB","008058 - USAID.

"Mid-term evaluation of a project to establish a pilot private sector family planning (FP) service delivery system in Romania. The project has been implemented by the Centre for Development and Population Activities (CEDPA) through subgrants to 3 Romanian NGOs:  the Society for Education in Contraception and Sexuality (SECS), Family Planning Movement of Vranchea (FPMV), and Youth-for-Youth.  Evaluation covers the period 1991-1/94. SECS is the largest NGO and runs 10 FP clinics, 7 of which are funded by CEDPA; FPMV runs one clinic; and Youth-for-Youth is very small and has only recently begun receiving support.  The NGOs are providing high-quality services, with an adequate choice of methods, accompanied by good information on these methods. They are eager to expand their activities to include public outreach and education, which would increase the project's impact, as it currently serves a very small population.  The project could nurture this potential by providing the NGOs with TA for institutional development and adding a large IEC component. Project deficiencies are related to poor management, both general and financial.  Some valuable management tools, such as needs assessments and scopes of work for TA, have not been fully realized, and relationships between CEDPA and the NGOs have been unclear, and at times, troubled.  Financially, the project as it stands is not sustainable and will not be sustainable in the near future.  The TA in financial management has been haphazard, delayed, and of poor quality. Conflicting CEPDA and USAID policies regarding currency have led to significant problems with disbursement and monitoring of funds. In sum, the project is at a crossroads; activities need to be redefined.  Funds should be set aside for a meeting among USAID, CEDPA, the subgrantees, and other potential donors.","Delivery order no. 4","Special Evaluation","Documents","AEP-0085-I-00-2060-00","","1/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Family planning services|Family planning clinics|Private health care|Pilot projects|Private voluntary organizations|Indigenous private voluntary organizations","Romania","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABH882.pdf","2,125 KB","005886 - Datex, Inc.","","007888 - USAID.

"Mid-term evaluation of a project to improve maternal/child nutrition. The project includes four components:  lactation management education, implemented by Wellstart International; operations research, implemented by the International Center for Research on Women (ICRW); an information clearinghouse, implemented by the American Public Health Association (APHA); and field support and TA, implemented by the Educational Development Center (EDC).  The evaluation covers the period 1989-12/93. The project is well-managed, and the solid working relationships among the various implementing agencies and USAID have led to the delivery of high-quality, well-documented, and well-monitored products and services.  All components are on track except field support, which is somewhat behind schedule and may have to be scaled back if activities now underway are to be completed by project end. Project implementors have built on the successes of the predecessor Maternal/Infant Nutrition project (9311010), but have added several new dimensions to reach broader audiences and contain costs. Wellstart has developed core teams of health professionals to promote breastfeeding, facilitated the development of national breastfeeding programs, and expanded lactation management education into two new languages.  ICRW has implemented peer review research on the nutritional status of adolescent girls around the world.  APHA has produced a newsletter, ""Mothers and Children,"" managed data bases for health and nutrition practitioners, and responded to information requests from around the world.  Finally, EDC has provided TA and integrated, community-based programming for nutrition promotion through local organizations. The project has had an impact on several levels.  At the individual level, each component -- through training, mentoring, and TA -- has prepared professionals, para-professionals, and nonprofessionals to improve the nutrition of women, infants, and children.  At the organizational level, Wellstart has influenced hospital policies and practices regarding breastfeeding, ICRW has strengthened research networks, APHA is strengthening regional capacities for information dissemination, and EDC has effected health policy changes within institutions.  At the sectoral level, Wellstart, through education, information, and advocacy, has influenced breastfeeding policies and programs of government agencies, health professionals, and community organizations. Impact at the beneficiary level has been difficult to document, although the Wellstart program has clearly been effective. It is recommended that the Office of Nutrition emphasize the importance of maternal/child nutrition as part of USAID's overall development strategy; and that the project's design be modified to clarify the project purpose, better integrate its components, and reflect a more realistic mix of core funds, buy-ins, and non-USAID resources.  As for the individual components, recommendations are to: (1) make lactation management education less reliant on USAID funding and accessible to a wider audience; (2) expand operations research to include intervention research and dissemination, with focus on action-oriented issues; (3) expand the activities of the Clearinghouse -- which is highly dependent on USAID funding and recovers little of its costs -- and either scale down its structure in the interests of efficiency or incorporate it into a larger information service; and (4) re-evaluate the field support component on the basis of cost, Mission interest, and effectiveness of delivery.","Delivery order no. 38|Project title: Advancing basic education and literacy (ABEL)","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-5832-I-00-0095-00","","1/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Nutrition improvement|Child nutrition|Infant nutrition|Maternal nutrition|Breastfeeding|Operations research|Nutrition research|Information dissemination|Information centers|Technical assistance","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABH886.pdf","2,683 KB","001341 - Creative Associates International, Inc.

"PACR of a project (8/82-5/92) to expand the provision of production credit to the Egyptian private sector. Results were mixed.  The short-term credit component used almost all of its funds, approving over 350 transactions with an average value of $100,000; the number of participating banks increased from 5 to 9. Progress in the Bankers' Training Institute (BTI) component, on the other hand, was slow; three project extensions were needed to give BTI sufficient time to become organized before start-up of its activities. Ultimately, however, thanks in part to the appointment of a new Director, the component moved forward, and BTI now serves as a major educational body to the business sector, offering bankers training in finance, banking, and economics, and providing the general business community with conferences on various topics as well as networking opportunities.  The World Bank plans to provide the Institute with further assistance in its upcoming Banking Sector Reform Program. Implementation schedules were overly ambitious; overall, the PACD had to be extended five times.  The project also failed to facilitate policy reforms -- concerning the exchange rate at which project transactions were to be repaid and the interest rate to be charged to borrowers of project funds -- that were prerequisites for project success. Due to its relatively modest funding level, the project lacked the leverage needed to increase private sector production.  The project goal and purpose were neither established on the basis of detailed economic analysis of private sector needs, nor linked to specific constraints. Economic/financial analysis should have included a full examination of project costs and benefits.  In addition, the Project Paper should have defined objectives, performance indicators, alternative means of accomplishing objectives, and mechanisms for evaluation.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Private enterprises|Production credit|Short term credit|Economics education|Banks|Technical training","Egypt","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABH892.pdf","198 KB","008539 - USAID.

"PACR on a grant (3/89-12/92) to the International Executive Service Corps (IESC) to provide TA to micro, small, and medium-sized companies in Honduras. Overall, the project was successful.  IESC completed 178 TA projects, 38 more than planned, and indirectly supported 54 non-USAID financed projects.

The VEs failed to meet the expectations of some client companies; the chief complaint of the dissatisfied clients was that the VEs could not relate to very small operations, many of which used relatively obsolete shop equipment.  Other clients chose not to implement the VE recommendations.  VEs made more progress in increasing sales, profitability, and production and in improving product quality, than in improving management systems. The following lessons were learned.  (1) IESC should make a greater effort to ensure that VEs have experience working with small companies. IESC should also expand its resource base to include qualified ex-Peace Corps volunteers or ex-small company owners and managers.  In addition, the VE recruitment process should be completed swiftly so as to retain the interest and enthusiasm of clients.  (2) IESC should place more emphasis on longer-term TA projects for fewer companies, and companies with greater prospects for success.  (3) IESC should improve its client monitoring system and follow-up on its recommendations; firms that consistently refuse to act on VE recommendations without a valid reason should be ineligible for future A.I.D. assistance.  (4) VE assistance should focus on strengthening client accounting, administrative, and managerial systems, where appropriate.  (5) The system of client contributions should be analyzed and modified, including the impact of client contributions to the IESC and the quality of TA that is piggybacked, or shared among several firms.  (6) The project design should include detailed cost-benefit and economic analyses.  (7) Before future A.I.D. assistance is granted to IESC/Honduras, the organization's accounting and reporting systems should be assessed and given a clean bill of health.  (8) Gender considerations should be analyzed and incorporated at the design stage, in the project's baseline data, and during implementation, monitoring, and reporting.  Information in all project analyses and reports should be disaggregated by gender.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","2/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Business support services|Management development|Consultants|Volunteers|Microenterprises|Small scale enterprises|Beneficiary count","Honduras","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABH936.pdf","100 KB","008555 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (8/84-6/91) to improve food security management in Pakistan. The project made significant progress under each of its three components.  Under the policy analysis component, an Economic Analysis Network (EAN), comprised of public and private professionals and the Economic Wing of the Ministry of Food, Agriculture, and Cooperatives (MINFA), was established and provided with computer and policy training and computer equipment.  The EAN has implemented an ongoing economic and policy analysis program, the most successful part of which has been the production of 26 (many more than planned) major publications.  Also under this component, the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) and Pakistani researchers spurred agricultural policy reform through the completion of far more studies than originally planned. These studies, inter alia, validated the rural development concept and strategies, verified that subsidized institutional credit was not reaching some small farmers, and compared alternative credit pricing scenarios.  One study led the Government of Pakistan (GOP) to abolish its wheat rationing system and another scuttled a planned $30 million Asian Development Bank project for new public sector godowns. Under the data collection component, Area Sampling Frame (ASF) methodology was successfully implemented in 7 districts to produce acreage and yield estimates for wheat, cotton, rice, corn, and sugarcane.  The Federal Bureau of Statistics's ADC Unit can now independently implement ASF design at the national level. Provincial ADC offices were provided with data processing capabilities and training, both local and foreign. Under the postharvest management component, the Lahore Training Center provided training in grain storage techniques to private millers, and to provincial Food Departments and PASSCO (unidentified acronym); produced and disseminated publications on storage operations; trained operators and managers of storage facilities built by a World Bank project; and produced a major publication which the GOP used to formulate policies governing wheat procurement and storage. The vertebrate pest control subcomponent provided professional pest management training, upgraded the University of Agriculture, Faisalabad's degree program in pest management, disseminated a great variety of educational information, and conducted applied research on preharvest vertebrate pest damage.  Further, the project rehabilitated 578,900 tons of wheat storage capacity at one-fourth the cost of constructing a new facility, and facilitated a tripartite agreement between MINFA, provincial Food Departments, and PASSCO (unidentified acronym) on recurring costs for repair and maintenance of godowns, a major achievement. The following lessons were learned.  (1) Policy reform projects are generally slow to start, require major adjustments, and require a great deal of time to mature.  Project design should permit flexibility for adjustments during implementation.  (2) Reliable and timely data are essential for improved policy decision making.  (3) Successful economic and policy analysis units must establish linkages with policy makers, as well as working relationships with complementary organizations.  (4) Plans for continued training should be built into the project's design. (5) Grain-storage rehabilitation is a feasible alternative to the construction of new facilities.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural policy|Economic analysis|Food security|Agricultural economics|Policy analysis|Data collection|Post harvest food losses|Food storage","Pakistan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABH942.pdf","446 KB","008588 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to provide prosthetic devices and services to victims of Mozambique's civil war.  The project has been implemented through subgrants to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), Health Volunteers Overseas (HVO), Handicap International (HI), and the Mozambican Association of the Disabled (ADEMO).  Evaluation covers the period 1992-10/93. The ICRC is now using polypropylene rather than polyester resin technology to construct prosthetic devices.  Devices constructed of polypropylene are technically superior; are composed of interchangeable parts which can be replaced anywhere in the country; unlike the resin method, do not use dangerous chemicals that have short shelf lives; and require less fabrication time, allowing the technician more time to fit the patient. With the cease-fire, the demand for prosthetic services is increasing (due to, inter alia, potential patients' greater mobility, and the return of amputees from refugee and rebel areas).  This increase in demand is already outstripping the production capacity of the traditional workshops operated by HI, where primary level technicians fabricate prostheses of leather and wood. Construction of transit centers -- hostels for disabled persons waiting to receive prosthetic services -- which had been delayed for several years, now appears to be on track; the Maputo center should be completed in January 1994, and construction of a center in Beira should begin in November 1993. HVO's surgical training program is unfortunately not much further along than it was at the time of the 1992 evaluation. Bureaucratic delays and obstacles from both the Ministry and A.I.D. have so frustrated surgical training that the imminent termination of the HVO grant makes it impossible even to start it.  While some useful activities, such as training of nurses and provision of orthopedic surgical kits, have been implemented, the basic purpose of the HVO grant -- the upgrading of orthopedic surgeons -- never took place. ADEMO has made significant progress and now has a membership of more than 6,000 disabled persons.  ADEMO has developed written materials on handicap laws, and booklets to assist the disabled in their pursuit of equal rights in employment, education, and training.  ADEMO, which has received support from a variety of donors, sees itself as a political, rather than a technical organization, and has proven itself an effective fundraiser. The evaluation team also visited the offices of ADEMIMO, a new NGO for disabled military personnel (from both FRELIMO and RENAMO), which serves 2,000 members -- only 10 of whom, however, are current with their monthly dues because military pensions have not yet been issued, though many of the members have been disabled for 10 years or more.  ADEMIMO has received approval from the European Economic Community for its first project and support from HI in the form of an advisor.  If ADEMIMO is successful it may become an advocate for a large group of disabled persons, attracting both Mozambican and international resources. It is recommended that all prosthetic devices in Mozambique be standardized on polypropylene technology and manufactured at the ICRC workshop in Maputo, and that HI manage all rehabilitation services and transit centers, training ADEMO and/or other local NGOs to take over. Such a change would capitalize on the great strengths of both ICRC and HI.  It is also recommended that the PACD be extended, as the project is not sustainable at this point.","Assignment no.

"Final evaluation of a project to strengthen the capacities of developing countries to design and implement nutrition education programs.  Evaluation covers the period 9/87-12/93 (15 months prior to the extended 3/95 PACD), with emphasis on efforts since the 1990 mid-term evaluation.  The project is being implemented by the Academy for Educational Development (AED). Overall, the project has been a success.  Since the mid-term evaluation, the project has strengthened, in varying degrees, the ability of public and private institutions in Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger, and Honduras to design and implement nutrition education/communication programs using a wide range of communications strategies from mass media to interpersonal exchange.  TA and training targets have been far exceeded, and counterparts have generally been satisfied with the TA provided. Project monitoring and evaluation strategies have been thorough, and collaboration with PVOs, USAID Missions, and other donors has been effective. The recommendations of the mid-term evaluation have been conscientiously acted upon, especially regarding the project's need to consolidate and concentrate its efforts, undertake more innovative community-based efforts, and focus on sustainability. In particular, since the mid-term evaluation the project has devoted considerable resources to state-of-the-art syntheses and lessons learned.  These include Questions and Answers on Infant Feeding, published in English, French, and Spanish and distributed worldwide; Media Promotion of Breastfeeding, a popular review of breastfeeding promotion efforts in over 25 countries; and videos on training in interpersonal communications and on solutions to micronutrient problems.  Also of note are two experimental approaches to interpersonal communication developed by the project:  a manual, entitled Learning to Listen to Mothers, designed to strengthen the interpersonal communications skills of nutrition and growth promotion field staff; and Healthy Communities, a new approach to rural, community-based nutrition problem assessment and counseling currently being implemented in Mali and Burkina Faso. Preliminary data reveal that project activities have had a positive effect on nutritional behaviors, and to a lesser degree, on nutritional status, and that the project merits continuation, although future activities should link more closely with P.L. 480 Title II and II programs and with other nutrition and child survival projects. Where the project has fallen short of target is more a function of unrealistic design assumptions than faulty implementation. Reducing the incidence and severity of malnutrition among young children and their mothers in a 5-year centrally funded, buy-in project is an unrealistic goal, except for possible limited demonstration purposes. Recommendations for a follow-on project are included.","Delivery order no. 36|Nutrition Communication Project document|Project title: Advancing basic education and literacy (ABEL)","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","PDC-5832-I-00-0095-00","","1/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Nutrition education|Child nutrition|Communication media|Communications development|Educational methods|Institution building","Mali|Burkina Faso|Niger|Honduras","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABH949.pdf","2,451 KB","001341 - Creative Associates International, Inc.

"Evaluates the Government of El Salvador's (GOES) A.I.D.-supported Municipalities in Action (MEA) program, which has since 1987 channeled funds to municipal governments in areas of civil conflict for popularly chosen, small-scale reconstruction projects.  The evaluation involved a random survey of over 1,000 persons in an effort to determine public attitudes about the MEA program, its impacts on the public's perceptions of national and local governments, its contribution to strengthened local government, and its overall contribution to democratization. Arising from the context of civil war, the MEA program has become a vehicle for strengthening local democracy and a cornerstone of the National Reconstruction Program.  By 1989, it was active in the entire country, with the exception of 19 northern municipalities controlled by the FMLN.  Since 1989, municipal governments have implemented nearly 9,000 projects, primarily in roads, schools, water, and electrification, reaching into remote rural cantons throughout the country.  In 1993, MEA projects were implemented in all 261 municipalities of the country (except the capital). The survey showed conclusively that the program has had widespread success in increasing confidence in local government, and, by association, the national government; support for both is higher among those who know of or have attended the cabildos abiertos -- the open town meetings, held by the mayor, at which infrastructure projects are identified or discussed -- or who have benefited from MEA projects.  The positive impact of the MEA program on attitudes toward local government has been felt almost as strongly in the ex-conflict zones as in the rest of the country.  Most surprisingly, the popular image of the implementing organization, the Secretariat for National Reconstruction (SRN -- formerly CONARA), is quite positive, even in ex-conflict zones, based on its ability to respond to people's needs for infrastructure. Clearly, the program contributes directly to two of USAID's strategic objectives:  (1) to help the country make the transition from war to peace by building local level democratic institutions and increasing civic participation; and (2) to promote enduring democratic institutions by strengthening local government and responding to the basic infrastructure needs of the community. Contrary to the findings of two earlier critical reviews (Sollis, 1993, and Yariv and Curtis, 1992), people see the cabildos as a representative forum open to all members of the community and as a genuine expression of the mayor's concern for the community's needs. Nevertheless, people are dissatisfied with the level of participation that the cabildos afford, expressing a desire for involvement beyond the initial project selection and the willingness to contribute more of their own resources if invited to do so.  The survey also revealed a major weakness of local government, for, despite the growth in cabildos, people perceive a lack of opportunity for popular participation.  The municipal councils are blamed for their practice of frequently holding closed council meetings.  Finally, people see community organizations as the most important promoter of their interests and want local government to work more closely with these organizations; further, communities that have legally recognized community organizations show higher confidence in local government than those that do not.  Thus, it would be in the mayor's interest to promote and work with such organizations. Lessons learned included the following.  (1) Local government is an effective vehicle for prioritizing and implementing multi-sectoral investments.  (2) Mayors are willing to collaborate at a regional level to prioritize investments and plan strategically.  (3) Public attitudes towards national government are enhanced by improving the image of local government.  (4) Organized communities have a more positive attitude towards local government than do unorganized communities; there is a natural bridge waiting to be built between local government and community organizations.  (5) People want to participate in local government, and the more they do so, the more willing they are to contribute their own resources and to help maintain projects.","Later ed.: PD-ABI-968","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","2/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","War recovery|Disaster reconstruction|Domestic government programs|Democratization|Attitude change|Development projects|Popular participation|Community participation|Municipal level","El Salvador","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABH963.pdf","7,784 KB","000356 - Checchi and Co.

"There is growing interest in Congress and the Executive Branch in using foreign aid to advance U.S. commercial interests while promoting development overseas.  This study examines total U.S. aid and trade relationships with Egypt between 1975-91, concluding that U.S. economic assistance has not been effective in generating commercial exports to Egypt.  The fundamental problem has been stagnation in Egyptian imports overall.  Egypt's policies have impeded the growth of export earnings, thus limiting the country's capacity to buy goods.  Particular assistance modalities, such as capital projects, cannot overcome this constraint.  Nor has the fact that the United States provides the bulk of bilateral aid to Egypt given it a privileged share of Egypt's capital equipment market.  Compared with its competitors, U.S. market penetration for capital equipment is actually lower in Egypt than in developing countries generally. These findings, it is noted, are similar to those of a case study (PN-AAX-281) of nine U.S. capital projects in Egypt, which found that the projects produced little follow-on business for U.S. firms.  In sum, neither total A.I.D. assistance nor capital project assistance to Egypt seems to have greatly developed or expanded U.S. commercial (non-aid-financed) sales in Egypt.

"Based on evaluation of nine capital projects carried out between 1977 and 1992, this report assesses A.I.D.'s capital assistance program in Egypt in terms of both its commercial benefits for the United States and its developmental benefits for Egypt.  In regard to the first aspect, the study found that few A.I.D.-funded projects or studies generated either participation by other donors or follow-on sales for U.S. companies; none generated participation by a private investor.  The report places much of the blame for this on U.S. firms' failure to take advantage of a clear opportunity to develop the Egyptian commercial market; in short, U.S. firms were ""out-marketed"" by their European and Japanese competitors.  Findings regarding the developmental benefits of the projects are mixed.  (1) The projects helped support strong private sector growth in Egypt through the 1980's.  They increased electric power, introduced a modern telephone system in Cairo and Alexandria, and rehabilitated water and sewage systems, significantly improving the quality of life of many poor Egyptians.  Nonetheless, their economic and financial rates of return were generally disappointing.  (2) The projects were built to a high technical standard, but their sustainability is in doubt due to insufficient financial resources, uneven operations and maintenance practices, and inadequate employee training and compensation.  (3) The pursuit of commercial advantage for U.S. firms did not distort the developmental goals of the projects. Overall, the report attributes the disappointing economic results of A.I.D.'s capital assistance program to a poor policy environment, which the reforms pursued in connection with the program did little to change. In Egypt, A.I.D.'s leverage in promoting reforms has historically been hampered by the precedence given to U.S. political concerns.  However the USAID Mission in Egypt believes that a changing political climate, especially since 1989, has increased the effectiveness of economic incentives and improved the climate for policy change. Companion reports provide (1) a detailed look at the nine projects' economic and financial rates of return (PN-AAX-282); and (2) a macro-level analysis of the relationship between U.S. aid and exports to Egypt (PN-AAX-265).","Related documents: PN-AAX-265 and PN-AAX-282","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","3/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Capital assistance|Economic infrastructure|Economic impact|Public services|Economic growth","Egypt","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAX281.pdf","5,567 KB","008058 - USAID.

"Over the period 1977-92, A.I.D. funded nine capital projects in Egypt, which collectively increased electric power generation, introduced a modern telephone system in Cairo and Alexandria, and rehabilitated a water and sewer system that served 23 million people. This study presents detailed ex post facto analyses of the projects' economic and financial internal rates of return. The methodology, assumptions, and data are examined and described.  Results indicate a mixed performance, with generally low to medium financial and economic rates of return.  These low rates are not due to technical problems -- the projects were well designed, used appropriate technology, and were operated in a sound manner.  In large measure, the poor performance was due to the Egyptian Government's poor economic policies, such as government price controls, regulations, subsidies, and employment and management structures that resulted in inefficient production and inefficient use of project outputs. A clear lesson is that in a bad policy environment, even technically sound projects cannot generate a good rate of return.  In the last few years, Egypt has initiated several policy reforms that have corrected a number of inappropriate prices and subsidies.  These actions, it is hoped, will improve the economic rates of return on future capital projects.

"Evaluation of project component to mobilize capital to support alternative crop development in the Cochabamba Department of Bolivia. The component has been implemented by Agricultural Cooperative Development International (ACDI).  Mid-term evaluation covers the period 8/91-2/94. The project has established Agrocapital, a well-designed, private foundation that provides loans to producers, agribusinesses, and agroindustry.  With its well-trained staff of 27, Agrocapital has made significant efforts in a difficult political environment to collect and restructure the P.L. 480 credit portfolio, which was donated to Agrocapital to provide the foundation with a start-up base of capital resources.  Agrocapital staff have successfully kept pace with client needs as they evolve, and exhibited good credit-granting techniques. However, there are not sufficient internally generated funds available for lending in 1994. To become a regional financial intermediary, a necessary stepping stone to the domestic savings market and self-sufficiency, the foundation will have to improve its compliance with Bolivian Banking Law and international lending norms.  Agrocapital also needs to develop a strategic planning which will help it choose from the many opportunities available at the current time -- the market demand for Agrocapital services has been well beyond that envisioned in the project design.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","2/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural credit|Capital","Bolivia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABH987.pdf","12,023 KB","000238 - Agricultural Cooperative Development International (ACDI)","","008515 - USAID.

"Fostering outward-oriented growth in developing countries by providing services to exporters and export-oriented investors has become an important part of USAID's portfolio.  This assessment of USAID's experiences in 10 countries -- Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Guatemala, Chile, India, Indonesia, South Korea, Thailand, Egypt, and Morocco -- addresses three key questions: (1) What is the rationale for donor support of export promotion? (2) Is USAID assistance in this area paying off? and (3) What service strategies and providers are most effective?  The study, which was based on interviews with 90 service providers, a survey of 300 exporters, and a review of overall export performance and policy environments in the 10 countries, reached five main conclusions.  (1) Sound macroeconomic policies and partial trade reform are preconditions for export success and effective use of subsidized export promotion services.  Export services have negligible impacts in hostile policy environments.  (2) Subsidized services to exporters can have high payoffs:  a few USAID projects had rates of return of 12%-26%.  Furthermore, a ""bandwagon effect,"" wherein early, visible export success encourages regulatory improvements, the entry of additional firms, and the development of specialized private providers of export services, has been observed.  (3) The most highly rated export promotion programs encouraged active involvement of private exporter associations through advisory councils or cost sharing, and focused on providing results-oriented services.  (4) The services most valued by incipient exporters are those that lead to enduring relationships with business partners, particularly buyers, investors, and suppliers able to help them meet international standards for price, product, and quality. Assistance to export support services contributed little to export growth if a dynamic service provider market already existed.  (5) Government-provided services are usually ineffective; government providers typically focus on the wrong services, lack trained staff able to provide a quality product, become consumed by bureaucratic procedures, and are particularly susceptible to assuming a regulatory rather than a promotional function.","Evaluation highlights: PN-ABG-022|Summary: PN-ABG-042","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","3/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Export promotion|Investment promotion|Private sector|Business support services","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAX279.pdf","2,091 KB","008058 - USAID.

"A.I.D. has devoted considerable resources over the past several years to services that directly support exports or export-related foreign investment.  This study summarizes results of a survey of 131 exporting firms in India, Indonesia, and Thailand on their use of 33 export services, ranging from foreign market information to production TA; 100 of the firms were randomly selected and 31 had been assisted under A.I.D. projects.  The survey findings demonstrate that direct services play a vital role in encouraging new entrants into exporting and in assisting foreign investors.  Key services are provided predominantly by business partners (including trade associations, informal contacts, distributors, suppliers, buyers, and licensers, as well as formal joint venture partners).  Important services are not provided nearly to the same degree by government or nonprofit agencies, nor are services usually obtained from for-profit professional service firms (e.g., lawyers and consultants). Government services are most useful to foreign investors for basic information early in the decision process, and, for local firms, were helpful in making initial contact with buyers.  The characteristics of firms receiving export services made no important difference in service use or impact, except when comparing local exporters with foreign-owned firms.  A final section of the report discusses the match between the mix of services provided and those sought by firms, focusing on evidence of potential roles for governments in filling the gaps left by private service providers.  Three overall conclusions are reached.  (1) Firms rely on networks of associates as their primary source of assistance.  (2) Business relationships evolve over time, and the distinction between export promotion and investment promotion will blur due to close business ties.  (3) International ventures are fragile in their early stages, particularly if long geographic and/or cultural distances are involved.  This is probably the reason that for-profit professional service firms stay out of the investment process until it is well advanced.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","2/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Export promotion|Investment promotion|Private enterprises|Business enterprises|Exports|Investment|Foreign investment","Asia|India|Indonesia|Thailand","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAX278.pdf","71 KB","008058 - USAID.

"PACR of a project 8/88-6/93 to upgrade the policy analysis capabilities of economic research centers and universities in Central America.  The report focuses on the Central American Institute of Business Administration (INCAE), one of the project's three implementing agencies. Over the life of the project, INCAE researchers prepared 15 studies on such subjects as the informal economy, the social costs of economic adjustment, economic and industrial modernization, and economic stabilization.  In addition, INCAE conducted seminars for cabinet-level economic policymakers and for members of Central American Chambers of Commerce; subjects included structural adjustment, financial reform, debt management, economic management, and industrial reconversion. INCAE also conducted 9 courses for 109 junior researchers in such areas as macroeconomic analysis, structural adjustment, and sectoral policy; the junior researchers went on to prepare 35 studies applying the techniques and methodologies they had learned. INCAE's major impact was in the areas of training and policy dialogue.  Several of the training participants went on to become high-level personnel in key development offices in their countries.  In the area of policy dialogue, INCAE played a key role in facilitating discussions by public and private national leaders on difficult economic topics. The following lessons were learned.  (1) Steering Committees that provide guidance in research projects should be aware of ""real world"" issues, not simply technical problems.  A failure in this regard early in this project led to studies that, while relevant and interesting, were not timely.  (2) When two or more entities participate in a project, both should be involved in project planning from the beginning. (3) An aggressive dissemination program, including nontechnical publications for the general public, should be implemented after research has been reviewed at the technical level.  Politicians, government officers, private sector leaders, and the general public are eager for good analyses.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","2/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Business schools|Economic policy|Policy analysis|Economic research|Policy dialogue|Economic studies|Technical training|Seminars|Courses|Policy reform|Beneficiary count","Central America","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABI176.pdf","186 KB","002290 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (2/89-6/93) to strengthen the Federation of Private Sector Enterprises of Central America and Panama (FEDEPRICAP), a private sector umbrella organization. While FEDEPRICAP did not reach all planned outputs, it did have a positive impact on integrating the Central American region into the international market, and became the private sector's representative at Central American economic cabinets meetings. FEDEPRICAP's activities included seminars on copyrights as they relate to the U.S. and Central America free trade initiative, a publication on copyright and free trade in Central America, and a regional seminar and book on financial resource mobilization. FEDEPRICAP also presented two proposals:  one to the Central American Economic Cabinets for the removal of trade barriers affecting nontraditional exports, and a one to the Secretariat of the General Treaty of Central American Economic Integration (SIECA) to establish a multilateral investment treaty.  Training included numerous workshops and seminars on issues such as debt-for-equity swaps, privatization, etc., as well as 37 regional seminars.  The project also resulted in creation of the Central American Exchange (BOLCEN), an information network for investors interested in the Central American market. Despite its overall success, FEDEPRICAP suffers from several deficiencies.  Its planning system is somewhat weak, in that it focuses on immediate, short-term opportunities rather than long-term goals. Participation of member organizations in planning at a high, strategic level is still low, and communication from member organizations to FEDEPRICAP is weak. The project also suffered from a lack of clarity of objectives. This resulted in FEDEPRICAP staff preparing studies and collecting information that were neither useful for member organizations nor pertinent to measuring project impact. In sum, since its creation in 1987, FEDEPRICAP has always represented the private sector in regional fora, but the organization's centralized management and emphasis on studies have kept it at times from satisfying national agenda and from producing tangible results.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Private sector|International trade|Markets|Regional economic integration","Central America|Panama","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABI198.pdf","150 KB","002290 - USAID.

"Presents final Mission report on the African Economic Policy Reform Program for the Gambia (1987-9/93).  The program, and its complementary grant, focused on a set of economic and agricultural marketing reforms to encourage more private sector involvement and public sector disinvolvement in productive activities. The program succeeded in that the Gambia Cooperative Union (GCU) no longer receives preferential access to credit at below market rates, nor does it receive a preferential allowance for purchases of groundnuts. All commercial bank loans are now made at positive real rates of interest, thus encouraging savings and stemming capital flight. Nonetheless, private traders have not captured a greater portion of the domestic groundnut market, for two reasons.  First, the marketing allowances, although equal, were too low.  Private traders had trouble covering their costs, while the GCU simply went further into debt. Second, private traders had to pay their loans on time and finance their operations from their own funds while the GCU was allowed to accumulate a large debt at the Gambia Commercial and Development Bank (GCDB) without making payments on it in a timely manner. The program has taught some important lessons.  (1) Donor coordination is essential, but split donor staffing of a management team can lead to problems.  In this case, the World Bank funded the managing director position at GCDB, while USAID funded a controller and a computer specialist, who often disagreed with the director's policies. (2) Policy reform programs need the intensive services of highly skilled professionals (both host country and donor).  (3) Designers should be sensitive to the phenomenon of interlinked markets. One important reason the GCU can retain its share of the groundnut marketing business is that agricultural input and output markets are closely linked in The Gambia. Farmers are inhibited from dealing with private traders out of fear that the GCU will deny them access to credit, seed, and fertilizer.  (4) The effects of a complex policy reform program do not emerge quickly, and their causes are often difficult to determine because other influential changes are occurring at the same time. The reforms achieved under this program provided the foundation for two other USAID/G programs  -- the Financial Restructuring Program (6350233/0234) and the Financial and Private Enterprise Development Program (6350232/0237) -- both of which have significantly enhanced private sector growth.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","3/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Privatization|Nonproject assistance|Policy reform|Agricultural product marketing|Commercial banks|Interest rates|Market economy|Credit unions|Parastatals|Risk aversion|Commercial credit|Loan administration|Donor coordination|Market structure","Gambia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABI200.pdf","128 KB","008545 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (6/84-11/92) to increase the capacity of the Government of The Gambia's (GOTG) Ministry of Finance and Economic Analysis (MFEA) to conduct economic and financial policy analyses.  The project was implemented by Harvard Institute for International Development (HIID). The project was highly visible and performed well in a crisis management mode in its early years, during implementation of The Gambia's Economic Recovery Program (ERP).  Its success was partly due to the personalities and strong convictions of the MFEA Minster and the HIID Chief of Party at the time.  However, the style of these individuals and the pressures of crisis management meant that few others were involved in the process and little capacity was built. As planned, the project established the Macroeconomic and Financial Analysis Unit (MFAU), a semiautonomous unit within the MFEA, and the MFAU became critical to monitoring IMF program targets.  Twelve policy studies were conducted by HIID advisors, with some participation from MFAU economists, and a major review of the tax system, also performed by HIID, is being used as a basis for administrative and policy reforms. HIID advisors were extremely influential in developing the ERP and in its implementation. The training program was deficient in that its focus was not on helping the MFEA to develop macroeconomics and financial policy analysis skills, its trainee selection process was arbitrary, and it failed to provide Ph.D.-level training.  Only 20% of long-term trainees, and 50% of short-term trainees were from the MFEA.  However, seminars and workshops for senior policymakers were successful in raising awareness of national economic matters. So far as institution building is concerned, the project was only partially successful.  MFAU staff turnover was high (many trainees took positions with other government agencies or with the private sector), and by the end of the project the MFAU was understaffed.  Thus, after 6 years of operation, the MFAU effectively does not have any staff who benefited from the project and has only a minimal capacity to continue producing economic and financial analysis and statistics.  The MFAU's mandate was never clear -- neither MFEA nor HIID developed a term of reference for the Unit.  As a result it was not operated as an integral part of the MFEA. The following lessons were learned.  (1) An economic research and policy analysis unit cannot be institutionalized unless the unit becomes an integral part of the MFEA, has a clear mandate, has access to data through clearly established procedures, and is staffed according to employment policies that are competitive with the private sector.  (2) Successful personnel development in a research and policy analysis project requires a master plan outlining needed staff skills, development of career paths, specification of skills transfer in expatriate advisors' terms of reference, development of incentive systems, and training of understudies when principal staff members are away for long-term training.  (3) The capacity to conduct economic research and develop policy papers requires experience, which can be developed through conferences and peer review sessions at which Gambian researchers can present their work, collaborative studies by long-term expatriate consultants and Gambian researchers, choosing of policy analysts from senior civil service staff to enhance the retention of skilled personnel, and development of a Ph.D.-level cadre of economists.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Institution building|Economic policy|Policy making|Economic analysis|Economic research|Government departments|Personnel development","Gambia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABI221.pdf","168 KB","008545 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (6/85-12/92) to help The Gambia develop a unified agricultural research system, linked to extension and responsive to farmers' needs.  The University of Wisconsin was the implementing entity. The project was a success on several counts.  An Agricultural Research Management System -- consisting of a National Agricultural Research Board, a Program Budgeting System, a task force, and a technical secretariat -- was created, and well-focused research has been carried out, including soil calibration tests; a plant nutrient survey of maize, millet, and groundnuts; on-farm trials of cereal varieties; and preparation of a cropping system map.  In addition, the project facilitated meetings between Gambian scientists and regional, national, and international agricultural research centers (although no formal research contracts resulted), and developed a Farmer Innovation Technology Testing program which was accepted by Gambian agricultural organizations, but which has not reached its potential because of the lack of support from researchers, DAS (unidentified acronym), and NGOs. Training included 12 B.S. and 7 M.S. degrees (of the 19 participants, 3 were female, and 15 returned to the Ministry of Agriculture); short-term training, including regional training for research scientists and U.S. technical training for Gambians; in-service programs; networking programs; and in-country training.  Training topics included agroforestry, animal traction, livestock research, agricultural statistics, crop research, soils, agricultural extension, and research-extension linkages. Finally, eight promotional programs were developed in collaboration with NGOs.  These NGOs cooperated in disseminating and promoting groundnut seed dressing, use of row markers, use of cowpeas and sesame in nutritious meals, and ram fattening.  The ram fattening campaign in Tobaski was particularly successful and resulted in the development of annual livestock shows and increased ram sales. In sum, the project made considerable progress in achieving its goals of institutionalizing national agricultural research.  It tested, generated, and promoted improved crops and livestock technologies that meet farmers' needs and expand and diversify the agricultural economy. The following lessons were learned.  (1) The Program Budgeting System (PBS), when fully operational, will allow USAID/G to monitor counterpart contributions.  (2) Implementation and evaluation are easier when the contractor and A.I.D. have the same interpretation of the project purpose.  (3) Contractors should be familiar with A.I.D. procedures and regulations, and with the contract's terms and conditions; the complete text of contract clause attachments should be made available to the contractor at the start of the project.  (4) Reporting of local, project expenditures should be accurate, timely, and in accordance with A.I.D. policies and procedures; an inventory management system with checks and balances should have been instituted earlier in the project.  (5) An agricultural research management system that includes end-user participation can provide farmers with useful technologies.  (6) Farmers will readily adopt new technologies if their relevance has been proven and incentives for their use are provided.  (7) Farmer constraints should be identified through linkages among researchers, extensionists, and farmers.  Prioritization of research depends on this identification, as well as on the efforts of a multidisciplinary team of scientists, administrators, and policymakers.  (8) For a new system like PBS to have a lasting effect, high-level support must be present in the recipient country.  (9) Institutionalization of an agricultural research program can be facilitated by the support of both the private and public sector. (10) Relevant training reinforced by job opportunities and incentives for returning trainees is an important element of capacity building.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","2/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural research|Research centers|Institution building|Agricultural extension|Agricultural education|Agricultural training","Gambia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABI222.pdf","315 KB","008545 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (3/78-6/91) to establish a soil and water management unit (SWMU) in The Gambia to combat environmental degradation, increase and stabilize agricultural production, and deliver improved extension services to farmers. Despite a slow start-up, the project's purposes were for the most part achieved.  Establishment of the SWMU within the Ministry of Agriculture has increased the number of Gambian villages receiving agricultural services.  Several soil and water conservation structures and measures were constructed and/or implemented, and the unit developed a program to train farmers in conservation techniques.  Efforts to halt or reverse environmental deterioration included reclamation of 780 ha of lowland rice-growing area and 1,631 ha of upland conservation area and creation of watersheds at eight villages, resulting in fourfold increase in land under cultivation at these sites.  The SWMU also screened for rice varieties adapted to saline conditions, and conducted soil surveys on 24,000 ha and established tree nurseries in 10 villages. Project activities reduced or eliminated drought conditions by increasing fresh water infiltration, and significantly reduced siltation.  SWMU's efforts to control erosion and saltwater intrusion and to introduce improve varieties and agronomic practices not only increased yields, but increased the total production area without undue damage to the environment.  More than 20,000 farmers in 78 villages have benefited from lowland and upland rice cultivation rehabilitation work, and their food productivity has increased by well over 50%.  Women benefited most in lowland rice projects while men benefited most from upland conservation. The SWMU also initiated development of a National Natural Resources Policy document which, however, was not accepted because it did not cover environmental issues outside water and soil conservation. Nonetheless, the document was used in preparation of the Gambia Environmental Action Plan (GEAP). In addition, the SWMU hosted a number of international and national seminars; published 3 supplemental readers on the environment and natural resources conservation for use in primary schools; developed 5 operational manuals; developed a soil and water conservation program for Gambia Technical College; and produced a video illustrating the history of the project. Eight persons received B.S. degrees, 6 received Associate degrees, and 13 Unit staff attended 19 U.S. training programs.  Nearly 75% of participants trained under the project returned to the country and are working at the SWMU. The SWMU's sustainability is doubtful, however; the Government of The Gambia (GOTG) has provided only salary costs, and no other support (e.g., for fuel and vehicle maintenance).  On the positive side, the SWMU has developed a political base by demonstrating its value to farmers.  This support is evidenced by the fact that SWMU was commissioned to create a Soil Conservation District in The Gambia, that over 50 villages are demanding services from the SWMU, and that farmers are willing to contribute their labor and other resources to accomplish conservation activities. TA provided by USDA was less than expected due to costs; no short-term TA was provided in soils, agroforestry, or range management, monitoring, and evaluation; very little was provided in monitoring and socioeconomic impact research, and in computer-assisted data collection and analysis. The following lessons were learned.  (1) Farmers will readily adopt technologies if their relevance has been proven and if incentives are offered for their use.  (2) Farmer problems should be identified via a participatory mode.  (3) High-level support and involvement of many actors at various levels was needed to institutionalize SWMU.  (4) Appropriate training (i.e., offshore, followed by on-the-job) is an important element in capacity-building.  (5) To succeed, an agriculture and natural resource project should operate within the labor, time, and capital constraints of participating farmers.  (6) Gambian villages are willing to work together for social well-being if they get the right message.  (7) The benefits of conservation technology can be achieved and sustained only if its users have ongoing access to technical advice. Once an institution is created, it must have the resources needed to provide ongoing technical advice.  (8) National institutions, which are essential for designing technically complex conservation infrastructure, require a long time to develop and mature.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","2/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Soil management|Water management|Institution building|Crop production|Soil conservation|Water conservation","Gambia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABI223.pdf","344 KB","008545 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (9/88-10/93) to strengthen Bolivia's judiciary and public prosecution system. The project succeeded in strengthening the legal framework for judicial reform:  it more than met its target to develop a legal framework for arbitration, and it appears to have met its technical training targets -- although it met by only half its goal to establish a uniform financial management system for the courts.  Specifically, the project facilitated the promulgation of the landmark Public Ministry and Judicial Organization laws; established the National Council for Judicial Reform and Modernization, an Executive Branch organization that promotes judicial reform; funded legal clinics that were instrumental in gaining support for judicial reform (and particularly for the oral process) from judges, prosecutors, and law professors; installed legal libraries in 12 justice sector organizations; developed an Alternative Dispute Resolution Center under the auspices of the Bolivian Chamber of Commerce; modernized the printing capacities of the Supreme Court; and developed plans for the implementation of the SAFCO Law in the judiciary. The following lessons were learned.  (1) Administration of justice interventions should be focused in specific areas of the justice sector where measurable impact can be assessed.  (2) A judicial reform project should work in tandem with key justice sector personnel including judges, prosecutors, the police, and public defenders.  (3) Project assistance should be delivered in a flexible manner since exogenous political variables can obstruct implementation plans.  (4) Institution building activities should be complemented by activities that empower local citizens and professional groups so that judicial reforms can be sustained.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","4/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Judicial reform","Bolivia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABI330.pdf","261 KB","008515 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (8/84-6/92) to develop Makran Division in Pakistan's Balochistan Province and integrate it into the country's economic mainstream. Despite a very slow start under isolated and difficult conditions, the project made many concrete improvements from which the Makran people will continue to reap benefits for years to come.  The project completed the Ketch River bridge, a highly visible and politically important project which provides an all-weather link to Turbat, and improved the Talar Gap pass, removing a major road bottleneck between Turbat and Gwadar.  It also rehabilitated and maintained roads; constructed water systems, including dam spills to recharge aquifers, which should last for many years with little or no maintenance; and made karez and korjo improvements, which will be maintained by private owners.  Agricultural practices have been improved on a sustainable basis, and new plant varieties were introduced with a high degree of receptivity and cooperation from farmers.  Farmers and extensionists received training in vine pruning and propagation, date pollination and bunch thinning, fertilizer use, and plant spacing.  The project supported personnel development for line agencies and the private sector; constructed schools and a maternity home; developed a computerized project management information data base; and trained Communication and Works (C&W) staff in equipment management.  Decentralization of planning and development was initiated, and a framework for regional planning was established.  The project also strengthened to a limited degree the Government of Balochistan's planning and management. The following lessons were learned.  (1) Even with the provision of TA, training, and equipment, there was little improvement in the performance of Makran's governmental departments, which have failed to maintain equipment, and which are continuing to undertake projects in an ad hoc manner.  (2) Frequent transfers of government employees are detrimental to project continuity and sustainability.  (3) The project's initial phase stressed visible outputs over institutional development. The 12/90 work plan integrated physical outputs with institutional ones, including training.  However, because of an almost 25% reduction in funds stemming from the Pressler Amendment, the work plan was scaled back dramatically, thwarting its major objectives.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","3/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Integrated rural development|Regional development|Economic integration|Economic infrastructure","Pakistan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABI332.pdf","678 KB","008588 - USAID.

"PACR of a subproject (1/89-12/93) to fund studies and TA to support the design and implementation of post-conflict reconstruction assistance to Afghanistan.  The subproject was implemented jointly by Robert R. Nathan Associates and Louis Berger International (Nathan-Berger). When the contract with Nathan-Berger was let, it was expected that the communist regime in Kabul would collapse soon after Soviet troop withdrawal in 1989, and be succeeded by a noncommunist government.  This critical assumption did not come to pass: the Najibullah regime collapsed in 4/92, but resistance parties and remnants of the old regime have not been able to put together a workable government.  Nevertheless, the contract has been very useful to the Mission.  Nathan-Berger produced a great variety of good quality, low-cost products (at an average unit cost of about $86,000).  These have figured prominently in the planning of Mission activities in the areas of food aid, agribusiness, human resources development, maternal/child health, and primary education.  Although not all of the planned activities came to fruition, due to the Administrator's decision in 11/93 to close out the Afghanistan program, this does not detract from the solid professional contributions made by the project. Two major evaluations were also carried out under the project, along with numerous socioeconomic studies, and two special consultancies for the new Afghan Interim Government.  The contract has served as a versatile, quick-response mechanism.  In a number of instances, the Mission was able to handpick consultants and study team members, and bring them on board quickly; this was much simpler and more efficient than using the time-consuming and cumbersome IQC method.  Further, Nathan-Berger contributed to the project as no other contractor could have done; the contractor has had 20 years of experience in managing the Planning Ministry in pre-war Afghanistan, including a wealth of contacts, networks, individuals, and databases.  This type of contract would be of use to every Mission. Due to the fact that 30 (vs. an estimated 10) delivery orders were carried out, an almost 10-month delay in the start-up of contracts, and the labor-intensive nature of small project activities, some program funds were shifted to administrative overhead to cover costs.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Economic reconstruction|War recovery|Economic studies|Technical assistance|Development project design","Afghanistan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABI336.pdf","755 KB","008505 - USAID.

"Interim report by the USAID Mission for Afghanistan and Pakistan on a technical support project to help design and evaluate cross-border humanitarian assistance projects for war-affected Afghans.  Report covers the period 2/86-2/94. The project has served as a critical resource to enable the Mission to conduct the Afghanistan program successfully in an unusual operating environment, i.e., the absence of a cooperating host government.  In response to urgent need, project consultants performed design and development analyses, studies, etc. in record time to enable the Mission to put in place its portfolio of humanitarian assistance projects, including PVO Co-Financing, Health Sector Support, the Commodity Export Program, Education Sector Support, Agriculture Sector Support, and Afghan Humanitarian Relief, all of which began in 1986 or 1987.  In addition, grants were made to the Agency Coordinating Body for Afghan Relief, a PVO/NGO umbrella organization, for a wage survey, for Afghan NGO upgrading, and for NGO training, and a grant was made to UNOCHA to fund the Afghan Mine Detection Dog Center. The project's provision of 44 long-term U.S. personal services contractors (PSCs) supported by 23 long-term FSN PSCs under the Technical Assistance Component was a key to its success.  Because USAID staff and U.S. staff of contractors/grantees were prohibited from traveling in Afghanistan for security reasons, the Peshawar-based Data Collection and Analysis (DC&A) Unit became critical to the project's accountability; at times, the Mission suspected some contractors/grantees of reporting their cross-border successes while keeping back certain other facts. The DC&A Unit helped each project activity to set up a data collection and reporting system. Unfortunately, relations between the DC&A Unit and contractors and grantees were often confrontational, although the addition of a team of neutral observers helped to improve the quality of the information being provided to the Mission.  Also, Mission management of the DC&A Unit was unnecessarily complicated and poorly structured; office politics and conflicting directives led to confusion in the Unit's perception of its role.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Humanitarian assistance|War victims|Development project design","Afghanistan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABI337.pdf","1,908 KB","008505 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of a grant to Opportunities Industrialization Centers International (OICI) for a project (6/86-3/94) to establish a vocational and small enterprise training center (the Cameroon OIC) in the town of Buea in southwest Cameroon. The Cameroon OIC is fully prepared to graduate from its direct dependence on OICI and the original A.I.D. grant arrangement.  The institutional and managerial basis for the long-term sustainability of this Cameroonian NGO are now well developed and on a solid foundation. The Cameroon OIC provides quality training, as evidenced by the numbers of its graduates who find employment or meaningful self-employment in these times of economic stagnation.  The evaluation team estimates that approximately 80% of Cameroon OIC graduates are employed or self-employed within 6 months of completing the program. The process is well underway of reorienting the Cameroon OIC program so that job creation, in the form of entrepreneurship training and small business management seminars, is given equal or greater weight relative to job placement.  This is proving effective in preparing trainees for the tough employment situation in Cameroon, and attractive to donors. The financial future of the institution is precarious, as is the financial situation of just about every institution, public and private, in Cameroon at this time.  For the immediate future, the Cameroon OIC is funded by the World Bank National Employment Fund (NEF) grant, and a grant from Bread for the World.  A large debt for development arrangement is being negotiated by the International Foundation for Self-Help (IFESH), which, if successful, will support the center in Buea for several years and help start new centers and programs in Yaounde, Douala, and Bamenda.  However, both the NEF Grant and the debt swap depend on the availability of large amounts of local currency, which may not be available at the required levels at the required times. The evaluation strongly recommends that the Cameroon OIC's Buea training center continue operating largely as it is, avoiding radical changes in its program content.  It would be a mistake to completely close down a training program in skills such as auto mechanics or building construction because of the current lack of employment or on-the-job placement opportunities.  As the economy changes, more opportunities will open up for Cameroon OIC graduates.  For instance, 2 years ago, there was little construction work to be had, but it has now picked up as people invest what little resources they have in the relatively safe haven of real estate. One might expect that the recent devaluation of the franc could have a positive effect on the auto repair business, as the cost of new cars and parts will double.  In any case, Cameroon OIC graduates are as prepared as can be to find employment and self-employment in a changing economic situation.

"USAID's Private Sector in Development Project (1983-1987), aimed at stimulating increased investment in Thailand's export sector, is assessed.  The project focused on helping the Thai Board of Investment to mount a campaign to attract U.S. investors to Thai industries; it also established a mechanism for the private sector to undertake policy studies and dialogue, and promoted technical cooperation between U.S. and Thai agroindustry.  This report describes the economic context of the project and the services it provided, and assesses the effectiveness of these services.  The report reaches three main conclusions.  (1) A stable macroeconomic policy regime, a realistic exchange rate, and an efficient manufacturing sector were critical to Thailand's outstanding export growth.  This export growth led to the emergence of a dynamic and diverse market for export and investment services.  (2) Links between buyers and export firms are critical to stimulating export growth.  An export promotion agency that facilitates ties between buyers and exporters in a favorable policy environment can help overcome entry barriers facing firms new to exporting.  The Thai Department of Export (DEP) complemented the private market for export promotion services because of its service oriented mission, outstanding staff, well-run overseas trade centers, and high quality services.  (3) Government institutions are not effective providers of investment promotion if delivery of promotion services is not a primary institutional objective. The Thai Board of Investment's (BOI) technical and bureaucratic limitations, uncertain commitment to investment promotion, and focus on tax-based investment incentives have undermined its capacity to attract and generate investment.  Contracting out promotion services to others did not lead to investment deals; promotion institutions must instead develop a clear vision of their promotional mandate and sufficient staff motivation to follow through.","Summary highlights: PN-ABG-020","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","4/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Exports|Export promotion|Investment promotion","Thailand","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAX283.pdf","106 KB","008058 - USAID.

"A.I.D.'s experience in designing and implementing compensatory or social safety net programs to offset the negative effects of structural adjustment on the poor is summarized.  Following an introduction, Section 2 briefly discusses the definitional problems involved in categorizing safety net programs and presents an overview of the countries in which A.I.D. has implemented or is planning to implement such programs; this discussion is organized by region and emphasizes issues specific to each region.  The heart of the study, Section 3, presents case studies of the Mali Voluntary Early Departure Program, the Tunisia Rural Works Program, and the Madagascar Food for Progress (FFP) Program.  The final section identifies implications for future A.I.D. programming.  (1) The major finding is that social safety net programs are often political; while this does not necessarily detract from their efficiency, A.I.D. must remain aware that it can lose control of a program if political criteria overwhelm economic and equity considerations in host government decision making.  (2) The decision whether or not to implement a social safety net program should be made on a case-by-case basis. Missions should use a decision tree approach to guide them in identifying target groups and appropriate programs and in assessing feasibility.  (3) Severance programs should no longer be dismissed as purely political.  Lump-sum payments may be a cost-effective way to stimulate entrepreneurial activity while providing a safety net for displaced public workers; credit and retraining programs, by contrast, have had less success.  (4) It is usually impossible for labor-intensive public works programs to serve as both a short-term safety net and a means of long-term job creation.  Program design should be based on one or the other objective and should include a monitoring component.  Missions should be wary of supporting national public works programs if they feel that geographic targeting for cost-effectiveness and equity is important.  (5) Food aid, while a useful safety net, does not offer as much flexibility for promoting policy dialogue as do other forms on nonproject assistance.  For one thing, the usefulness of food aid varies annually, depending on local production levels; for another, Missions may be reluctant to stop food aid when policy conditions are not met.  The study concludes by identifying several areas that need further research.","Earlier ed.: PN-ABM-952","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","5/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Structural adjustment|Economic impact|Poor|Income distribution|Public works|Food for Progress|Nonproject assistance","Mali|Tunisia|Madagascar","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAX275.pdf","127 KB","008058 - USAID.

"To alleviate the negative impacts of structural adjustment on the poor, donors and host countries have undertaken a variety of compensatory programs, including public works, social services, credit programs, and subsidies for the most vulnerable.  This study examines the recent experience of the World Bank and other donors with both sectoral and multisectoral compensatory programs, and identifies lessons learned for USAID.  Section 2 summarizes some of the potential effects on various socioeconomic groups of adjustment programs, and examines the economic and political justifications commonly offered for these programs. Section 3 identifies countries (mainly in Latin America and Africa) in which such programs are being implemented or planned, detailing the types of interventions, the institutions involved, and funding levels.  Section 4 presents case studies from Bolivia, Ghana, Chile, Senegal, and Mexico of the major types of programs that have been implemented (USAID was one of several donors that financed the Bolivia and Ghana programs), and assesses the extent to which they benefited their intended targets.  A final section presents tentative lessons learned. (1) Despite claims to the contrary, the primary objective of most of these programs was not to redress the social costs of adjustment. (2) Except in the case of redeployment and severance pay schemes for public employees, programs designers have usually not thought through the implications of adjustment measures for income distribution and incorporated them into compensatory program design; nor is much attention given to the opportunity costs implications of adjustment. (3) Though multisector programs can lend political legitimacy to the adjustment process, it is very doubtful that multidonor, multisector programs can provide short-term poverty relief; in most cases donor coordination has been lacking and performance has been very uneven.  (4) Compensatory programs can be successful only if governments are committed to them, independently of donor agendas.  (5) It is necessary to examine carefully the ability of existing institutions to implement short-run programs cost-effectively and rapidly and to make sure that such programs do not stigmatize the poor. (6) The long-term efficacy of emergency public works programs is probably overestimated.","Earlier ed.: PN-ABL-327","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","5/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Structural adjustment|Economic impact|Social impact|Poor|Income distribution|Social services|Public works|Employment","Bolivia|Ghana|Chile|Senegal|Mexico","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAX287.pdf","103 KB","008058 - USAID.

"This evaluation of Cameroon's Fertilizer Sub-Sector Reform Program (FSSRP) is one of seven case studies being carried out as part of a worldwide assessment of USAID-financed agribusiness programs.  The evaluation finds, with some qualifications, that the FSSRP achieved its main policy reform objective -- the liberalization and privatization of fertilizer distribution in Cameroon -- as well as its intermediate objective of making fertilizer available to farmers on a more timely basis and at a lower cost.  However, this applies only to the seven coffee-producing provinces; fertilizer distribution in the three northern cotton-producing provinces is still controlled by the government.  The FSSRP has had little impact on increasing agricultural production or farmers' income, which, while not stated goals of the FSSRP, are basic objectives of USAID's agribusiness programs; the evaluation attributes the stagnation in production to factors outside the project's control, mainly a sharp decline in world coffee prices, and maintains that if the project's policy reforms are sustained and expanded (which is by no means certain), they will ultimately lead to improvements for small farmers and agribusiness distributors.  Two principal, and contrasting, lessons learned are identified.  (1) Policy reform can be effective in bringing about positive change in the agribusiness sector, and success in one area can pave the way for reform in other sectors; for example, arabica coffee marketing in Cameroon has been privatized, based largely on the FSSRP experience.  (2) Successful policy reform does not guarantee an increase in production, employment, and/or agricultural value added; such achievements require both favorable macroeconomic conditions and an integrated approach encompassing marketing policy reforms, improved marketing infrastructure and services, and more effective public and private sector agricultural research and extension.","Also known as: Impact assessment of USAID's agribusiness program :|Cameroon case study, USAID working paper no. 199|Evaluation highlights: PN-ABS-528|Project title: Agricultural marketing improvement strategies (AMIS)","Special Evaluation","Documents","DHR-5447-Z-00-7074-00","","4/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural policy|Fertilizers|Fertilizer distribution|Privatization|Policy reform","Cameroon","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAX291.pdf","1,211 KB","008058 - USAID.

The project made significant progress in both of its phases (institution building and citizen participation).  In phase 1, the project strengthened the management capacities of Title II Cooperating Sponsors -- Caritas, Adventist Development Relief Agency (ADRA), Food for the Hungry (FHI), and Project Concern International.  Caritas and FHI are providing child survival services, as Adventist Development Relief Agency (ADRA) is to a lesser extent.  All three organizations have implemented agricultural production programs, and FHI has become self-sufficient.  Moreover, the Title II Food for Work (FFW) program has dramatically improved and now focuses on activities in urban areas, which have proven successful, while reducing involvement in less successful activities, e.g., Mothers' Clubs and rural FFW programs. In phase 2, the project used Title II food and training workshops to facilitate grassroots citizen participation in municipal decisionmaking in 12 cities.  A.I.D. was the only donor in Bolivia to engage in this initiative, which is fundamental to democratization.  The activity was incorporated into the Government's recently unveiled and revolutionary Popular Participation initiative. The following lessons were learned.  (1) TA provided via A.I.D. to Title II cooperating sponsors for institutional strengthening is more effective than TA contracted by the sponsors themselves.  (2) Democratic participation is strongest where the Mayor's Office, the local citizenry, and local organizations are interested in making democratization work.  If this participation is to be sustained, an independent body should be established to continue the efforts of the present project.  (3) Citizen participation in municipal decisionmaking is essential to engendering public confidence in the democratic process.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","5/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Food for Peace Title II|Institution building|Development program management|Private voluntary organizations|Democratization|Municipal level","Bolivia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABI672.pdf","137 KB","008515 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (6/83-12/92) to help the Government of Bolivia (GOB) build its capacity to conduct economic and policy analyses. Through support of the GOB's Economic Policy Analysis Unit (UDAPE), the project was able to play a significant role in accelerating economic growth in Bolivia by providing the GOB with recommendations for structural reforms that facilitated alternative development and expanded investment in non-coca activities.  It also supported the Mission's efforts to address policy reform crosscutting issues.  UDAPE completed 779 (versus a target of 225) economic policy studies, and the Institute of National Statistics, the Social Policy Analysis Unit, the Central Bank, and the Population Policy Unit developed 15 analyses leading to macroeconomic and sectoral reforms.  UDAPE established a good reputation among public and private sector entities, international organizations, and foreign research institutions; participated actively in GOB economic cabinet meetings; and represented the GOB during meetings with multilateral donors. The following lessons were learned.  (1) UDAPE provided the GOB with high-quality technical recommendations in the areas of macroeconomic and sectoral policy reform without participating in partisan political activities.  Consequently, UDAPE increased its prestige, and insured its independence and continuity over the past decade.  (2) UDAPE's extensive experience in macroeconomic and sectoral analysis has given it the status of a model institution; other countries, including Honduras, are interested in learning more about UDAPE's role in policy design and implementation.  (3) The approval of a follow-on project, Technical Support for Policy Reform, and the GOB's development of the Social Policy Analysis Unit (UDAPSO), modeled after UDAPE, are testimonies to the project's success.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","5/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Institution building|Economic analysis|Economic reform|Policy reform|Policy analysis","Bolivia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABI794.pdf","225 KB","008515 - USAID.

"Evaluates U.S. emergency food assistance provided to southern Africa during the 1991-92 drought.  The report synthesizes material contained in individual country evaluation reports. Southern African cereal harvests during the 1991/92 drought were 11.4 million MTs less than average, placing more than 17 million persons at risk, some 15 million of them in Malawi, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, and Zambia.  A massive and timely international response averted famine, prevented off-farm migration, and facilitated recovery.  With the exception of Mozambique, which had been experiencing prolonged civil war, there were no famine deaths reported. By a significant margin, the United States was the largest contributor to the relief program; moreover, the United States provided significant quantities of food sooner than any other donor. The following lessons were learned.  (1) Donors should begin shipping food as quickly as possible.  The fastest that relief food can be delivered is 2-3 months.  In this case, 4-5 months were required to deliver U.S. food to inland destinations in landlocked countries.  In early 1992, USAID shipped 45,000 MT to maize to Durban, South Africa in response to the first indications of a serious regional crisis.  This was allocated to Malawi, where it arrived in 6/92 (5 months before any Malawi-specific food aid), and was critical to the prevention of widespread famine.  (2) Governments faced with extraordinary food shortages should quickly purchase cereal from commercial sources to satisfy early drought relief needs and reduce reliance on donor food, which cannot always be supplied quickly enough in sufficient quantities. The ability of Zambia and Zimbabwe to purchase grain was critical to their being able to avert famine. (3) Use existing food distribution channels, which are likely to be more cost-effective and efficient than setting up a parallel distribution system.  (4) Food for work (FFW) projects may be appropriate if they are operational prior to the emergency, or if the affected country already has an inventory of labor-intensive projects. In general, however, short-term FFW projects are not an effective alternative to free food distribution.  Botswana's cash-for work program should be studied as a possible model.  (5) Use of NGOs was a resounding success in getting food to those most in need.  (6) Planning and administrative capability is a country's best preparation for managing a drought.  Simply having a unit in place is not the answer, however. Mozambique, Lesotho, and Malawi had pre-existing structures, but these in no way guaranteed an effective response.  The willingness of governments to decentralize operations was also a factor in success. Many conditions contributed to the successful drought relief response.  (1) Except for Mozambique and Angola, there were no civil conflicts which inhibited access to vulnerable populations. The Mozambican conflict came to a peaceful settlement during the drought. (2) The drought came at a time when the USDA had on hand record amounts of surplus yellow corn.  (3) Several countries in the region were undertaking transitions toward democracy, increasing U.S. political interest in promoting stability.  (4) The region's linked rail systems, which have received massive support from A.I.D. and other donors, were sufficient to carry the extra volume of food imports.  The region also has relatively good road and communications systems.  (5) Fortunately, rainfalls during 1992/93 returned to normal; plantings during this time yielded above average harvests in most of the affected countries.  (6) Considerable, unprecedented cooperation was exhibited between the Republic of South Africa and its southern African neighbors.  Similarly unprecedented were the efficiency of and cooperation among USAID, USDA, the World Food Program (WFP), the U.S. State Department's Bureau for Refugee Programs, governments within the region, and other donors in transporting over 11 million MTs of emergency food aid under pressing circumstances.","Related documents: PD-ABI-804 through PD-ABI-811 and PD-ABP-826","Special Evaluation","Documents","AEP-0085-I-00-3001-00","","6/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Drought|Famine|food shortages|Emergency food distribution","Southern Africa|USA|Malawi|Zimbabwe|Mozambique|Zambia|South Africa|Swaziland|Lesotho|Namibia|Botswana","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABI803.pdf","4,145 KB","003970 - Management Systems International, Inc.

"Evaluates U.S. Government response to the 1991/1992 drought in Malawi. Despite problems with timeliness, beneficiary targeting, and less than optimal participation by the Government of Malawi (GOM), the relief program accomplished its primary objectives of preventing starvation and migration and enabling successful agricultural recovery.  This success was possible because of the responsiveness and flexibility of the international aid community and a high degree of regional and local coordination. The early availability of U.S. grain enabled relief distributions to begin almost immediately after the disaster was declared and to continue almost until other donor maize arrived.  In April 1992, at USAID's urging, the GOM began distributing, in the most affected areas, 20,000 MTs of U.S. Title II food that had been left in Malawi after a previous relief effort.  In addition, at the request of the U.S. Ambassador, 45,000 MTs of maize which A.I.D/W had pre-positioned in South Africa after the first indications of a serious regional crisis was allocated to Malawi and began arriving June 5, 5 months prior to the arrival of Malawi-specific relief maize.  Finally, 44,700 MTs of U.S. maize was borrowed from the Mozambican refugee program and distributed in July and August 1992.  These three sources provided nearly 110,000 of the 190,000 MTs of total U.S. maize contributions, which themselves accounted for about two-thirds all the relief food provided to Malawi.  After the emergency, the flexibility to deprogram food pledged to Malawi but no longer needed led to considerable savings in effort and funding. Despite its success, the relief program suffered from the disappointing and inappropriate response of the GOM, which acknowledged the crisis only after strong and persistent donor pressure, was reluctant to distribute its Strategic Grain Reserve or even to assign counterparts (believing all material and financial aid should come from donors), and insisted absolutely on retaining control over food allocation and distribution decisions in order to reap political benefit from the free distribution of donor food. The following lessons were learned.  (1) The degree of control maintained by donors in allocating resources and managing relief efforts should be based on a government's capabilities, legitimacy, and accountability to its citizens.  The less capable or legitimate a government, the less it should be permitted authority over the programming of donated emergency commodities. (2) Where feasible, a disaster response program should use existing food distribution systems; such an approach is likely to be more cost-effective and logistically efficient than setting up a parallel distribution system.  If donors decide not to support monetization of emergency commodities in order to avoid a co-opting of the process by the host government for political gain, then donors must maintain a high degree of control over resource input levels and in-country distribution.  (3) International disaster responses should use a lead agency approach to channel and pool resources and facilitate a unified response.  At the same time, bilateral donors who contribute significant resources have an obligation to actively participate in decisions as to how those resources are used. (4) Development programming should seek to reduce a country's vulnerability to frequently recurring disasters.  Likewise, initial planning for relief programs should include planning for the recovery phase, e.g., distributing agricultural seed packs.  (5) The levels of responsibility and accountability among the host government, World Food Programme, and NGOs need to be defined at an advanced stage of an emergency and clear policy guidelines agreed upon by all as soon as possible.  (6) Where extraordinary imports of relief aid are contemplated, a logistics appraisal should be undertaken as part of the overall needs assessment; this appraisal should make recommendations on required financial and personnel resources, suggest strategies, and estimate costs.","Related document: PD-ABI-803","Special Evaluation","Documents","AEP-0085-I-00-3001-00","","6/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Disaster relief|Emergency food distribution|Donor coordination|Drought","Malawi","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABI804.pdf","1,672 KB","003970 - Management Systems International, Inc.

"Evaluates emergency U.S. food assistance in Zimbabwe during the 1991/92 drought in southern Africa. Although the drought led to almost total crop failure, disaster was averted.  There were no deaths from famine and few from drought-related disease, and people did not have to leave home and thus were able to resume planting when the rains returned in late 1993.  The success of the drought relief program is largely attributable to the commitment of the government and people of Zimbabwe and the prompt response of donors, most notably the World Food Program and USAID.  USAID/Z was in the forefront in alerting A.I.D. and other donors to the severity of the drought and recognizing that regional transport logistics needed priority attention.  Nevertheless, it was a full 12 months from the U.S. Ambassador's declaration of disaster to the first free distribution of sorghum to vulnerable households. The United States contributed 672,475 MT of maize, i.e., 27% of all maize consumed during the drought emergency period (1/92-5/93) and was the largest bilateral contributor of non-food aid.  USAID enlisted the help of the Africa Bureau's Famine Early Warning Systems (FEWS) project to identify the most vulnerable populations, and also committed funds to allow leasing of South African locomotives and railwagons.  Relief foods were distributed through existing government and parastatal systems, with some assistance from NGOs.  Both public and private sectors made extraordinary contributions to logistics management to ensure that not only Zimbabwe's food import needs were met, but also those of its neighbors.  Thanks to monitoring by the national government, the private sector, and USAID, the U.S. contribution was delivered with a loss of less than 1.5%, and households in most rural areas received the food they needed to survive.  Distribution of agricultural inputs packets (some of which originated in USAID's sorghum and pearl millet seed production project) contributed to a significant recovery in agricultural output. Zimbabwe and the Southern Africa Development Community organizations located in Zimbabwe are committed to continuing the institutions and processes established during the drought and to benefitting from the lessons learned.  Primary needs are for Zimbabwe to develop a national food security policy and a permanent drought preparedness planning capability.","Related document: PD-ABI-803","Special Evaluation","Documents","AEP-0085-I-00-3001-00","","2/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Emergency relief|Disaster relief|Humanitarian assistance|Emergency food distribution|Drought","Zimbabwe","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABI805.pdf","4,245 KB","003970 - Management Systems International, Inc.

"USAID's response to the 1991/92 drought in Zambia can be considered a model of effective relief management.  The severity of the drought and the magnitude of the food gap, combined with the new government's limited resources, could have led to widespread famine and economic catastrophe, but this did not occur and a great deal of the credit is due to USAID for its creativity and leadership in helping the Zambian government to manage the crisis. The operation was an impressive example of coordination among USAID, the Republic of Zambia, donors, the UN, NGOs, and neighboring governments.  Clearly defined roles and responsibilities, along with frequent coordination meetings, enabled a unified and well executed relief force.  Task forces and special committees were effective mechanisms with which to organize resources.  The government's commitment protected relief operations from political interference. Among the key findings of this evaluation are the following.  (1) Early warning systems worked.  (2) The response was executed in a timely manner and without interruption of food supplies -- generally before debilitating nutritional consequences occurred. (3) USAID/Z used two creative, cost-saving mechanisms to pool donor resources -- first, to permit maize transport on less expensive non-U.S. ships, and second, to pool donor resources for purchase of U.S. commercial maize.  (4) The strategy to support the market system was effective in providing sufficient food while preventing disruption of structural adjustment activities. (5) Food forwork (FFW) was an effective and appropriate self-targeting mechanism which ensured that food relief went to those who needed it.  (6) NGOs were effective in delivering targeted emergency food.  The use of an overall coordinating organization helped inexperienced NGOS to quickly develop effective operations.  (7) Initial food needs assessments were not accurate, leaving considerable foreign food left over at the end.  (8) The supplementary feeding and health delivery system was not sufficient.  As the need for such supplemental feeding increased, supplies did not -- malnutrition rates for women and children in the supplemental feeding system reached 48%, with severe malnutrition reaching 15%. The following lessons were learned.  (1) At the onset of a disaster, donors and aid agencies should define a clear focal point for emergency response.  The structure should work collaboratively between donors and government and allow quick financial and operational decisions.  (2) Emergency food assessments must acknowledge and integrate socioeconomic and structural factors and account for behavioral shifts during emergencies so that the proper amounts of resources are allocated.  (3) Emergency services should be phased out with care.  Commercial assistance should not become a disincentive to local production or depress prices for post-drought harvests. (4) While FFW can be an effective targeting mechanism, it is difficult to create well-designed labor-intensive development projects in emergency situations. Preference should be given to completing existing projects rather than creating new ones, and care should be taken to ensure that sufficient resources for completing the projects are available.","Related document: PD-ABI-803","Special Evaluation","Documents","AEP-0085-I-00-3001-00","","2/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Drought|Disaster relief|Disaster response|Emergency food distribution|Donor coordination","Zambia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABI806.pdf","1,009 KB","003970 - Management Systems International, Inc.

"Evaluates the U.S. response to the 1991/92 drought in Swaziland. A.I.D. provided over 50% of the 20,000 MTs of food relief that was channeled through the World Food Program (WFP) to 16 zones most severely affected by the 1991/92 drought.  Twelve NGOs arranged the food's transport, which reached an estimated 410,000 people, 48% of Swaziland's population.  A 1993 rapid assessment of health and nutrition indicated that 91% of the population in one of the worst hit target zones had received food aid. Although nutritional status among target groups deteriorated (maize-based diets are deficient in protein and nutrients), no famine-related deaths occurred.  From time to time grain arrivals were delayed due to a lack of available storage facilities; however, local shortages were not significant. A.I.D. was the only major donor to provide, at the request of the Swazi government, subsistence farm families with agricultural inputs needed for the 1992-93 growing season.  The activity was an outstanding success; 5 NGOs used some $1.87 million to distribute packages of seed, fertilizer, and pesticides to an estimated 14,000 farmers, facilitating the production of an estimated 24,000 MT of maize, almost 30% of the expected national harvest.  Farmers repaid some of the production costs. The program's one drawback was that it provided inputs in only 5 of the 16 zones most severely affected by the drought. The following lessons were learned.  (1) Donor shipments of food did not arrive until October, 1992, although Swaziland had formed a Disaster Drought Committee in January and the WFP conducted a needs assessment in March.  Given the time required to assess needs, commit funds, and ship commodities, a country suddenly afflicted by a severe drought cannot rely on donors to meet initial food needs; rather it must mobilize donor interest as quickly as possible, but must use its own resources to purchase immediate relief and should be prepared to reimburse NGOs which must draw on their own resources in the early phases of the response. (2) A country with no recent experience with emergency food aid programs requires organization and management assistance from experienced donors. (3) Needs assessments conducted by UN agencies may duplicate (though not fully corroborate) assessments made by local technical staff. Although the former may lend credibility to a UN appeal, they tend to be less reliable than local assessments.  (4) A drought-afflicted country can accelerate its recovery by providing farmers with agricultural inputs.","Related documents: PD-ABI-803 and PD-ABP-285","Special Evaluation","Documents","AEP-0085-I-00-3001-00","","2/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Drought|Emergency food distribution|World Food Program (FAO)|Food aid programs","Swaziland","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABI807.pdf","671 KB","003970 - Management Systems International, Inc.

"U.S. food aid to Lesotho following upon the 1991-92 drought in southern Africa was provided as part of a regional multi-donor effort, administered by the UN's World Food Programme (WFP). While the decision to turn over food distribution to WFP facilitated the movement of huge quantities of food, the strategy used by WFP was essentially the same for chronically food-deficit countries -- like Lesotho -- and traditionally food-surplus countries.  USAID/Maseru, had it been given the chance, could have better tailored the U.S. drought response to the specific conditions of Lesotho.  In any case, lack of a generally accepted definition of Lesotho's structural food deficit left the WFP without a technical basis for determining how much food over and above stocks handled through normal channels were to be imported into Lesotho as drought relief. In light of the well-established commercial channels for cereal importation and distribution, donors might have better served vulnerable groups by monetizing relief cereals, distributing cereal products such as maize meal through commercial networks, and using the receipts generated to provide the most vulnerable households with the means (e.g., vouchers) to access normal commercial channels.  To the extent that food distributions were not free, it would have been more appropriate for Lesotho's monetized economy to design cash-for-work, rather than food-for-work programs. While a lack of baseline data made it impossible to distinguish between the chronically poor and those suffering as a direct result of the drought, such distinctions are, according to UNICEF, unacceptable in local communities being served. At early planning meetings, Save the Children Federation (SCF) and CARE, both with extensive experience in providing emergency drought relief assistance, had reservations about the practicality of a targeted approach, considering the inaccessibility of many Lesotho mountain villages.  Seemingly, WFP never addressed the issue, and neither CARE nor SCF were invited to follow-up meetings. The following lessons were learned.  (1) Lesotho's fundamental food insecurity issues are chronic -- WFP is already feeding up to 30% of the Basotho population through programmed feeding programs -- and cannot be resolved through an ad hoc emergency relief program.  Lesotho must make fundamental changes in its land management system and in its agricultural practices. At present, the country's food security is most directly linked to South Africa, as a food-surplus neighbor; however, continuation of this link cannot be guaranteed, given the political changes in South Africa.  (2) Standardized relief procedures are needed. Tapping into the experience of international disaster relief organizations (e.g., the International Red Cross, CARE, and SCF) as reflected in their operations manuals and training materials is vital to the success of fledgling relief organizations like Lesotho's Disaster Relief Implementation Group.  (3) The development strategy of any drought-prone country should include drought preparedness, response, and recovery strategies, covering not only drought-tolerant plant varieties and soil and water conservation strategies, but also rural work projects that increase the income needed to purchase food.  (4) The Lesotho government and NGOs could better reach rural populations by decentralizing food security administration to the district and village levels.  (5) Properly planned and implemented drought relief efforts should not engender dependency.  The danger for creating dependence exists when the government confuses drought relief with development and then seeks to capitalize on a temporary emergency to further its development objectives.","Related document: PD-ABI-803","Special Evaluation","Documents","AEP-0085-I-00-3001-00","","2/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Drought|Emergency relief|Food aid programs|Multilateral organizations","Lesotho","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABI808.pdf","1,075 KB","003970 - Management Systems International, Inc.

"Evaluates the U.S. response to the 1991-92 drought in Namibia, and provides lessons learned related to food distribution, water and resource management, and institutional development. Evaluation of food distribution activities resulted in the following conclusions.  (1) Financial grants may be less disruptive to the economy than the direct import of commodities; grants increase the capacity of vulnerable groups to purchase food in domestic commercial markets and to select from a wider range of commodities.  (2) Distribution of different drought relief packages for different segments of the target population based on age, sex, or other criteria was unworkable and inappropriate to the social context (Namibian families share their food).  Also, organizations involved in food distribution had difficulty simultaneously stocking many commodities included in the packages, and delivering even partial packages, under field conditions. (3) In the past, Food For Work (FFW) activities attempted in Namibia during drought have been largely unsuccessful.  So too were these FFW activities, which in many cases were ill-conceived, hastily designed, poorly executed, unsustainable, and expensive, and in which only a very small group participated.  (4) Occasionally, donors supplied commodities that were inappropriate or already available in Namibia's commercial market, including tinned and fried fish, cooking oil and beans, and leftover Gulf War stock. Evaluation of water and resource management activities resulted in the following conclusions.  (1) Water must be seen as an input into a resource management system and not an objective in itself. Development of water sources is likely to have adverse economic and environmental consequences where well-established community-based resource management systems did not already exist.  (2) Water resource development should not aim to meet short-term political objectives, but be pursued only in the context of long-term, well-articulated development programs.  (3) Development of local water resources for human consumption in targeted locations may be appropriate in a drought mitigation program, but not for livestock.  In fact, the periodic absence of water in overgrazed areas provides an opportunity to force reductions in grazing pressures; during droughts, the principal cause of livestock mortality is lack of forage resources, not water.  In this instance, U.S. support for installation of additional boreholes unfortunately reinforced the Namibian government's emphasis on borehole development as the primary means of supplying water to both humans and livestock. The following lessons were learned regarding institutional aspects. (1) The most significant impact of the drought relief effort may be that the Namibian government is reorganizing its institutions to better meet needs of people in communal areas, and inter-ministerial coordination has improved.  (2) The formal government, donor, NGO coordination mechanism did not promote frequent or frank discussion related to drought relief; for example, some donor representatives were not sufficiently critical of government presentations during meetings with the government, while others were overly aggressive in pushing individual agendas.  Although donors and NGOs engaged in useful informal discussions, there were never any formal fora, independent of the government, which could have eased tensions that arose between implementors.  (3) Government/donor/NGO discussions failed to arrive at a working distinction between activities appropriate to emergency relief and those appropriate for longer-term development objectives, which would be better implemented with ""programmed"" food aid.  This deficiency was particularly true in the case of FFW activities, but also with respect to water development schemes.  (4) Devolution of responsibilities to regional and local authorities must be accompanied by appropriate and timely financial transfers; regional committees were not provided with sufficient financial resources to distribute commodities in a timely manner.  (5) Properly planned and implemented short-term relief efforts are likely to be self-terminating and should not engender long-term dependencies among local constituencies. Dependency can be engendered when the host government confuses short-term drought relief with longer-term development objectives, and tries to capitalize upon the temporary emergency situation to further its development objectives.  (6) Drought needs assessments should pay greater attention to the fact that food commodities and livestock regularly flow back and forth over the Namibia/Angola border, in response to changes in annual rainfall patterns and economic conditions.

"The Government of Botswana (GOB) has proven itself increasingly adept at managing drought relief, and has applied lessons from past efforts to achieving the difficult balance between short-term relief and long-term development.  Two of its exemplary approaches are:  self-targeting cash for work; and effective permanent institutional mechanisms for dealing with drought.  In Botswana, statutory institutions meant to deal with emergencies meet periodically.  These institutions work efficiently, across ministries and sectors.  Moreover, the GOB program has effectively decentralized drought relief implementation to the district level, with corresponding transfers of authority and financial means.  A strong tracking and monitoring system provides ongoing assessment of local food security.  The GOB's approach avoids creation of parallel bureaucracies by implementing programs using existing field officers. This also avoids duplication of efforts and conflict with implementation of ongoing development programs.  In this way, relief activities are carried out and monitored by the same officers who plan and manage the country's overall economic development program.  The philosophy underlying Botswana's drought relief program is that rural households are responsible for their own food security and people are expected to plan for bad years during good rainfall years.  The need for government assistance in the form of food aid is seen as a programmatic failure to be avoided.

"Interim evaluation of a program to promote housing sector reform in Eastern Europe by developing a functioning housing finance system, strengthening local government housing capacity, and expanding the private sector's role.  Evaluation covers 1991-4/94 and includes an overview of the program's politico-socioeconomic and management context and reports on programs in Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Bulgaria. The program at mid-point is poised to ""take off.""  It has demonstrated great flexibility in seeking clients and points of intervention.  Promising pilot programs in rent policy and housing allowance are underway in Hungary and beginning in Bulgaria, and Housing Guaranty programs have been designed in 3 countries -- focusing on housing finance in Poland and Hungary and municipal finance in the Czech Republic. Major efforts have been undertaken in every country to enhance understanding of a market-based approach to the housing market and housing finance.  Although the political context has often made rapid reform impossible, these efforts have nevertheless inspired an enormous shift in thinking. The program has undertaken pathbreaking efforts in designing mortgage instruments for use in transitional and inflationary markets.  In addition, two major organizations for assisting the private sector have been established -- the American-Polish Home Builders Association (APHBA) and the Eastern European Real Property Foundation (EERPF). Despite the program's successes, the arrival of competitive private housing finance is still in the future.  The state-owned savings banks, which for a long time dominated deposit-taking and mortgage lending, face immense problems in restructuring unprofitable portfolios, and their staffs require extensive training.  Their privatization is some time away, especially given their conservative nature.  A.I.D. should integrate housing finance reform with efforts to restructure the financial sector as a whole. After some early successes, privatization of the housing stock has gone slowly and will likely continue this way.  Reluctance to raise rents remains a major deterrent; other issues include affordability, social welfare policy, tenant rights, and condominium laws.  The poor condition of the housing stock, and simply a lack of desire for ownership among a substantial portion of the population (e.g., the elderly) will also slow down privatization.  This suggests that A.I.D.'s privatization goals should include a stronger focus on asset management, rehabilitation, and privatization of management services.  A.I.D. should avoid ""creaming"" the stock, i.e., leaving the least desirable buildings and poorest tenants under public ownership. Also, U.S. experience with public housing suggests that A.I.D should help local governments to develop a privatization strategy that recognizes a phased approach and mixed public/private housing stock. Decentralization has placed enormous financial and management pressures on local governments; in many countries, the relative roles and powers of central/local structures have not yet been rationalized and local government's revenue-raising powers are often inadequate, with public housing one of the more serious fiscal drains.  To stem the deterioration of physical assets and the strain on local government resources, USAID should provide more assistance in municipal financial management.  Also needed is more attention to the privatization of municipal services and to local government implementation of policy and regulatory reforms that assist the private sector. The private construction and development industry is a vital and growing force which will strengthen itself without extensive assistance. It is recommended that A.I.D., while continuing current efforts, shift its focus from direct assistance to support of associations through intermediaries such as APHBA and EERPF. Finally, since attainment of the program's overarching goal of creating a private real estate market seems quite distant, A.I.D. should pursue the more realistic goal of a market-oriented shelter sector. Such a strategy:  (a) allows the program to be declared a success for countries such as the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Poland, which will graduate from the program before all reform elements are accomplished; (b) provides a context in which to work with social policies that differ from those prevailing in the United States; and (c) allows A.I.D. to focus on the key features of the private sector approach -- market-derived pricing, efficiency incentives in management, and transparent subsidies that minimize price and income distortions and are targeted to those in need. There have been significant lessons learned with regard to management, substance, and implementation.  (1) Overall, the program did not achieve an rapid start.  Although housing finance efforts proceeded quickly, local government efforts lagged due to both contracting delays and personnel constraints and private sector efforts were slowed by difficulties in defining or locating appropriate clients.  (2) In the early phase, the program suffered both lack of field presence (which is essential because of the complexity of the policy environment) and a lack of strategic approach to management.  (3) Balanced programs such as this one are appropriate in transition economies.  (4) The program's demand-driven approach did not work well because many potential clients did not understand the market-oriented framework well enough to ""demand"" a specific program; as a consequence, the program was often supply driven, with consultants and contractors offering assistance in the elements they best understood.","Delivery order no. 3|Earlier ed.: PD-ABH-306","Special Evaluation","Documents","PCE-1008-I-00-2064-00","","4/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Housing markets|Housing policy|Policy reform|Privatization|Decentralization|Housing finance|Housing administration|Private sector|Political aspects","Central and Eastern Europe|Poland|Hungary|Czech Republic|Slovakia|Bulgaria","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABI846.pdf","6,078 KB","006381 - Abt Associates, Inc.","","007922 - USAID.

"Final evaluation, conducted by the grantee, Save the Children/Bolivia (SC/B), of a child survival project in Inquisivi, Licoma, and Circuatao zones of Bolivia's La Paz Department. The evaluation includes both quantitative (KAP survey) and qualitative assessments. According to the quantitative assessment, goals were met or exceeded for polio3 and TT2 immunization, management of diarrheal diseases (use of oral rehydration therapy [ORT], adequate feeding with breast milk and fluids), identification of acute respiratory infections (ARI), knowledge and practice of growth monitoring, colostrum administration within the first hour postpartum, weaning practices, consumption of iodized salt and Vitamin A-rich foods, and deliveries attended by trained staff. Results were low, however, with regard to maternal identification of signs of dehydration and knowledge about when to receive treatment during diarrheal episodes (although practice was adequate) and during ARI episodes; the practice of exclusive and prolonged breastfeeding; distribution of Vitamin A capsules (although there was a high level of Vitamin A-rich vegetable consumption); and prenatal care. The qualitative assessment found that SC/B efficiently coordinated the various institutional activities, and its use of integrated development fairs as a mechanism for community mobilization was a success; however, diversification of this strategy to avoid supersaturating the population must be considered.  Likewise, methodological alternatives must be emphasized to make training more active and responsive to the target population's characteristics. Appraisals by women's groups and community authorities generally coincide with the KAP survey findings.  People are satisfied with achievements of EPI, diarrheal diseases management and, especially, the production of Vitamin A-rich foods in vegetable gardens.  Findings regarding growth monitoring and iodized salt consumption were also confirmed.  Community authorities emphasized problems with the health promoters or village health workers (VHWs) and suggested that an alternative strategy for community outreach be found.  It is clear that VHWs are not sustainable since they are resisted within their own communities. In relation to the health information system, the methodology used for providing feedback to the community has proved extremely useful and has increased motivation within the communities. However, it is clear that VHWs are not motivated to participate in data collection.  Also, SC/B is duplicating informational activities carried out by the National Secretariat of Health.  In the future, there should be better coordination. The project's most important counterpart has been the Regional Secretariat of Health through the Tres Cruces District.  Earlier obstacles to the establishment of smooth working relationships, due in part to personality factors, have been overcome and relations are now very open and collaborative.  In regard to sustainability, the project played an important role in influencing decisions at the policy level. Formal community authorities, such as general secretaries of agrarian unions, became part of the project.  SC/B has also been working continuously to institutionalize the project's key components by strengthening related capacities of the Regional Secretariat of Health. Another notable achievement of SC/B that should contribute to overall project sustainability is the integration of activities with other projects serving local community needs in the areas of education, economic opportunities, and agricultural production.  Efforts in health promotion and education based on cultural respect also contributed to sustainability.  Incorporating local input into all activities involving change increased the possibility of successful adoption of new behaviors.  Finally, SC/B is working to empower communities economically through other systematic actions, thereby improving the economic basis of the communities in order to support desired social change.

"Evaluates project to support the Cooperative Development Program of Israel's Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MASHAV), which provides TA and training to developing countries.  The evaluation covers the period 1988-12/93. The project has been a success, its positive aspects far outweighing problems encountered with management and delivery. MASHAV has effectively used program resources to deliver Israeli expertise to developing countries for improved agriculture development, environment/natural resource management, social development, and personnel development. MASHAV has provided training in Israel to 2,135 individuals, conducted 199 On the Spot Training Courses (OTSCs), and provided 156 short-term consultancies and 95 person-years of long-term TA. Trainees in Israel, who, along with OTSC participants, have overwhelmingly endorsed training effectiveness, were made aware of the scarcity of natural resources in Israel and the necessary role that education and personnel development play in sustainable development.  TA, which emphasized skills transfer and applied technologies, has provided a variety of contributions, ranging from the development of poultry cooperatives in Africa and assistance to tomato producers in Honduras, to eye care in Malawi. Assistance has been channelled through Israeli Embassies, enhancing both the Embassies' and Israel's standings in assisted countries. Israel has expanded diplomatic relations from 6 to 26 countries in Africa and from 17 to 22 in Asia and Oceania.  In addition, A.I.D. Missions and Israeli Embassies have developed significant cooperation in the utilization of Israeli long-term experts. It is recommended that MASHAV:  (1) expand its activities in the Central Asian Republics and Eastern Europe (a Farmer-to-Farmer program in the New Independent States is particularly recommended); (2) increase interaction with A.I.D. Missions so as to improve the integration of development objectives; (3) expand its evaluation system to include strategic planning; (4) increase training targets for women and persons from the private and NGO sectors; and (5) direct more long-term TA to private organizations.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","AEP-0085-I-00-3001-00","","1/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Technical assistance|Technical training|Development cooperation","Israel","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABI851.pdf","3,737 KB","003970 - Management Systems International, Inc.

"Evaluates a housing guaranty program to increase the availability of low-cost housing in Ecuador by fostering private sector participation in shelter programs and by eliminating the major constraints in housing sector.  The program's results have been notable, including structural transformation of the housing finance system in Ecuador, the generation of public policies and new financial instruments for allowing long-term housing lending, and a transformation of Ecuadorian housing institutions. Conceptually, the Government of Ecuador (GOE) has accepted its need to facilitate housing solutions through policies that motivate private initiative and help organize the actors in the sector to provide housing solutions.  Both the GOE and the private sector have recognized that informal private initiative plays an important role in housing solutions.  The program has fully incorporated the housing cooperatives into the housing finance system and encouraged credit unions, savings and loans, and private banks to participate.  In summary, the program has enabled the GOE to define its role, to begin a secondary housing market, and to recognize the importance of housing in family and national economies. The GOE has created a new Ministry for Housing and Urban Development, incorporating existing public entities -- the National Housing Board, the Ecuadorian Housing Bank, and the Ecuadorian Institute of Sanitary Works.  The GOE has redefined the roles of housing institutions, taking them out of direct production of housing and focusing their efforts on planning, coordination, and support for the sector.  These government entities are now set to give private entities the responsibility for both the finance and generation of housing. The GOE has also transferred the Financial Fund for Housing (the program implementing agency), to the Ecuadorian Housing Bank, to be used to refinance mortgage portfolios. The most important program advance to date has been the diffusion of the refinancing concept which will stimulate private financial entities to have a role in housing finance.  Further, the legal framework has been totally restructured to allow the issuing of mortgage-backed securities to generate increased financing for housing.  Mechanisms were established to correct for interest rates and inflation.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Housing investment guaranty|Housing finance|Housing policy|Private sector|Financial institutions|Construction industry|Credit unions|Housing cooperatives|Mortgages|Housing markets|Housing credit","Ecuador","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNABR853.pdf","781 KB","","","006711 - USAID.

"This report, based on a desk review of project documentation, synthesizes USAID's export promotion (mostly in Morocco) and investment promotion (in Egypt) experience in the 1980's. Findings include the following.  (1) The performance of export and investment promotion projects is closely linked to a country's policy regime.  Egypt's poor policy environment was one of the main reasons USAID interventions failed to promote foreign investment, whereas Morocco's significant reforms liberalizing trade created an enabling environment for USAID's efforts to increase firm-level exports.  USAID should not pursue export or investment promotion in countries where the policy environment is unfavorable.  (2) Before intervening in the services-provider market, USAID should first determine if there is sufficient market failure to justify action.  (3) Private sector intermediaries are more responsive than public sector institutions.  USAID should work through private sector intermediaries as much as possible.  (4) Investment promotion activities in Egypt were not cost effective, but export promotion activities in Morocco were.  Cost effectiveness analysis is an important component of project monitoring and evaluation.  (5) Accurate evaluations require adequate data collection, including baseline and life-of-project data.  Data collection was inadequate in Egypt.

"PACR of a project (1990-9/93) to conduct a socioeconomic sample survey of rural Bolivia.  The project was implemented by the Bolivian National Institute of Statistics (INE), with TA from the U.S. Bureau of the Census. INE's shortcomings, including technical and administrative inadequacies and a lack of commitment to the project (e.g., at the last minute A.I.D. had to provide INE with vehicles to conduct household interviews), caused the project to miss the 1-2 month period following harvest during which the national survey should have been conducted.  It was therefore decided to conduct a smaller survey of the Department of Cochabamba. Using the Cochabamba data, a variety of analyses were carried out, including a multivariate analysis that defined a typology of rural households for assessing the impact of interventions, including interventions aimed at  raising household incomes through non-coca related activities.  Planned analyses of labor use by gender, non-farm activities, and market access and farm incomes were not completed, however.  The project has been criticized for its high apparent costs -- $990 for each of the 1,344 households sampled --  but many expenditures were for applications useful beyond this particular survey; for example $500,000 was spent on a comprehensive cartographic survey which facilitated Bolivia's 1992 Census.  Targets for developing survey procedural manuals, training professionals, and publishing survey results were met or almost met.  Planned publicity campaigns were not done because of the great political sensitivity of questions regarding coca production. Despite its small size, the Cochabamba survey produced high quality results which were used by the Government of Bolivia (GOB) to analyze labor organization in rural households, examine food security, and engage in preliminary rural development planning; and by the Cochabamba Regional Development project to design a complementary agricultural area survey in Chapare where non-coca crops are being introduced. The GOB also used the results of the survey to produce a comprehensive and well thought out proposal for going forward with the national survey at the end of the 1994 agricultural season.  However, given USAID/B's resources and objectives, and the INE's technical and administrative shortcomings, USAID/B decided not to assist this survey through the present project, which was then terminated 9/30/93, consistent with the PACD. The following lessons were learned.  (1) Due to its ad hoc nature, the institutional analysis conducted during project design overestimated INE's institutional capacities, requiring USAID/B to play a larger management role than it had anticipated. (2) A full-time project manager/coordinator of statistical and survey methods and analyses should have been contracted before the survey was initiated to collaborate with INE personnel and look after A.I.D. interests throughout the project.  Temporary PASA experts undoubtedly shared valuable expertise, but one full-time coordinator would have prevented problems resulting from long-distance coordination.  (3) Except for the Department of Cochabamba, the problem of paucity of household data has not been resolved and poses a serious problem in designing sustainable development activities in rural areas.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","4/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Household surveys|Demographic surveys|Rural development|Host country cooperation|Data analysis|Development planning|National level","Bolivia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABI925.pdf","318 KB","008515 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (10/84-8/93) to provide bilingual education to Mayan children in the Guatemalan Highlands. The project met and, in many instances, surpassed its targets.  A permanent Bilingual Education Division and the National Program of Bilingual Education (PRONEBI) have been established; the latter is the only unit within the Ministry of Education (MOE) that provides schools with pre-primary education and learning materials.  Regionalization of bilingual education services is now in process and regionalization was included as a condition precedent under the Basic Education Strengthening (BEST) project (5200374). A B.A. program was instituted in two private universities to prepare professionals in bilingual education; the program trained or retrained some 5,400 bilingual personnel (324% of target).  In addition, more than 800 bilingual promoters (vs. a target of 500) were certified by the MOE as pre-primary bilingual teachers; 1,600 bilingual school directors were trained (vs. a target of 400); and 3 technicians received M.A. training at the University of New Mexico.  A complete bilingual education curriculum and materials were developed. The following lessons were learned.  (1) Project designers often overestimate the capacity of implementing units and set ideal benchmarks unilaterally; realistic benchmarks should be set in consultation with host country officials and beneficiaries.  (2) Even if project officers conduct regular dialogue with government authorities, there should be a component that institutionalizes dialogue.  (3) Donors should coordinate their efforts in order to avoid duplication and maximize their resources.  (4) Varying levels of bilingualism within target populations should be considered when developing bilingual education materials.  (5) A well-developed bilingual education program can be more effective than programs in the second language.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","6/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Bilingual education|Indigenous populations|Government departments|Public education|Primary education|Institution building|Personnel development|Teacher education","Guatemala","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABI926.pdf","224 KB","008550 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (9/92-9/93) to support the 1993 national and legislative elections in Senegal by educating voters and providing election materials. A major voter education campaign was conducted.  The project produced 5,000 large illustrated posters encouraging voting, 200,000 how-to-vote brochures and 16 how-to-vote audiocassettes, and 6 radio and 6 TV spots. All materials were produced in French and 6 local languages and made available through Senegal's 18 registered political parties.  The project also helped to ensure secret balloting by providing ballot boxes, voting booths, voting booth curtains, and indelible ink.  To exercise quality control and ensure political neutrality, USAID carried out all procurements for TA and commodities and contracted a local NGO, the Groupe Multimedia Sud-Communication (SUDCOM), to produce the radio and TV spots. However, due to the lack of private radio and TV stations, the TV and radio spots had to be aired by the Government of Senegal (GOS), whose commitment to the project was tenuous at best.  As it turned out, the GOS aired the TV spots only 15-20 of the 300 times scheduled, and aired the radio spots fewer than 25 times and then in only two languages. Although the ballot boxes and voting booths were delivered to the GOS before the February presidential elections, they were not used until the May legislative elections.  And, while there was no evidence (despite rumors) that the indelible ink had been tampered with, instructions for using it seem not to have been followed in all cases. A key lesson learned is that politically explosive projects are best implemented through a recognized, nonpartisan NGO; such an approach obviates any appearance or actuality of partiality on USAID's part. Also, the project would have benefited from a clearer initial agreement with the GOS, which lost interest in the project when it discovered it would not be permitted to control certain activities.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","6/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Political development|Elections|Civic education|Voting","Senegal","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABI959.pdf","143 KB","008600 - USAID.

"Interim evaluation of a program/project to support policy and institutional reforms aimed at improving primary education in Lesotho. The evaluation covered the period  3/91-4/92. The evaluation team encountered universal support for the policy changes being implemented under the program.  Policies requiring support at the highest levels of the Government of Lesotho (GOL) have included an increase of more than 50% in the education budget, allocation of sufficient budgetary increases to primary education in order to implement the Education Sector Development Plan (ESDP), raising teachers' salaries to a par with the civil service, support for the Education Order of 1992, and reorganization of the administrative structure of the Ministry of Education (MOE).  Still needed is sufficient GOL support to ensure that the empty positions in the new MOE structure are filled as expeditiously as possible. Mainly due to the disruption resulting from Lesotho's transition to democracy, the program is approximately one year behind schedule.  The program should not be criticized or punished for this, but the country applauded for making the transition. Nonetheless, implementation of the ESDP and of the program should continue to be closely monitored by the MOE and the three main donors to ensure that it falls no further behind. Most of the systemic institution building policy objectives have been met, and activities are now centered on aspects that will directly affect the quality and efficiency of primary education in Lesotho.  (1) The 70 District Resource Teachers are in place, and the design of the District Resource Centers to support their efforts is underway.  (2) Considerable training of district education officers has taken place, and in-service training for 450 classroom teachers has been initiated. (3) Development of a new primary school curriculum and of texts, teachers' guides, and other materials by the National Curriculum Development Center is proceeding well.  (4) Procurement of classroom furniture is on track, and construction has begun on a planned 850 classrooms to be funded by the International Development Agency and the European Union. On the negative side, the National Teacher Training College (NTTC), the only source of qualified teachers, suffers from a lack of leadership, and its output has dropped to the point where it can no longer keep up with attrition in the teacher force; as a result, more unqualified teachers are being hired each year and the force as a whole is becoming increasingly unqualified.  The type and extent of support to the NTTC should be reviewed and actions developed to reverse this trend. Finally, it is important that the GOL remain focused on making effective the Education Order of 1992.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","4/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Educational development|Educational reform|Educational policy|Primary education","Lesotho","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABI961.pdf","3,831 KB","003970 - Management Systems International, Inc.

"Interim evaluation of Africare's P.L. 480 Title II program in Guinea-Bissau.  The evaluation, which covers the period 1991-94, addresses the impact on food security of (1) the process by which Title II food commodities are monetized through direct sales to local traders; and (2) the use of local currency generated by the sales to support Tombali Region Rural Associations under the Tombali Sustainable Rural Initiatives Project (TSRIP). The most important conclusion is that monetization of Title II commodities is having a double impact:  getting food to the target population more effectively than other mechanisms, and generating funds for potentially food security-enhancing activities at the local level. By filling in gaps in the food supply system, monetized P.L. 480 wheat flour and vegetable oil is helping to stabilize the system and improving food security for rural and urban consumers alike.  And because the marketing chain in Guinea-Bissau is relatively short, the food reaches the consumer without excessive markup or price inflation.  It is recommended that, despite requests from wholesalers for smaller drums or prepackaged cooking oil, the current practice of shipping cooking oil in barrels be continued, as it allows retailers to dispense oil in very small quantities which poorer households can afford.  Also, delivery schedules should keep in mind cyclical demand, and a diversification of commodities, possibly to include millet, should be considered.  Finally, it is recommended that Africare look at ways in which the P.L. 480 program could be used to effect national-level policy changes to improve food security. While food security for most households in the Tombali region has improved in recent years, at least in terms of access to external food sources and expanding markets for local products, such improvements are probably not attributable to the TSRIP, but to other factors such as market and price reforms under the structural adjustment program, and recent road construction which has expanded access.  While the project-assisted associations have played a role in expanding opportunities for producing and marketing crops, the fact is that many of these associations predate Africare's involvement.  Also, food security, though improved, is still very poor, with all villages experiencing a ""hungry season"" during the rains and child mortality and malnutrition still very high.  The TSRIP is well positioned to have a positive impact on food security in its next phase; the key will be implementation of an expanded small-scale rural credit scheme.  A series of recommendations are made to simplify loan procedures, establish clear repayment schedules, and strengthen contractual agreements between Association members.","Project title: Food security and nutrition monitoring (IMPACT)","Special Evaluation","Documents","DAN-5110-C-00-0013-00","","3/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Food for Peace Title II|Food security|Local currency|Agricultural development|Associations|Rural areas|Food aid monetization","Guinea-Bissau","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABI964.pdf","4,990 KB","000673 - International Science and Technology Institute, Inc.

"PACR of a project (8/88-9/93) to build ten supplemental irrigation systems in rainfed areas of Morocco.  The project was implemented by five Government of Morocco (GOM) Ministries (Agriculture, Public Works, Interior, Economic Affairs, and Finance). The project proved to be unworkable, with the only tangible outputs being the participation of three Moroccans in a drainage workshop in Cairo, and four partial feasibility studies of possible dam sites; at the PACD, only $360,000 of the $9 million obligated had been expended. The project was consistently delayed by misunderstandings among the five implementing agencies, which, overseen by two separate committees, were unable to agree on their responsibilities.  In addition, use of the Fixed Amount Reimbursement (FAR) System was not appropriate to the GOM's budgetary structure:  the GOM had no resources to devote to the project before reimbursement, so the FAR would have required each Ministry to replace its usual activities with project activities, and reimbursements would have been made to the National Treasury, not to each Ministry's budget.  This was the crucial element which discouraged the GOM from implementing the project.  Finally, the project became even more unmanageable when project responsibilities were transferred to the Ministry of Interior, which increased the number of members of the already ineffectual management committee. The following lessons were learned.  (1) It was not a good idea to involve several technical ministries in the project, or to include the Ministries of Agriculture and of Public Works, two entities which historically have disputed control over water resources.  When the involvement of several ministries in a project is unavoidable, one ministry should be charged with implementation and the others included on an informal or an information-need basis.  (2) Financing methods should consider the context of the host country, including its budget procedures. (3) Implementation delays might have been avoided if a long-term implementation contract had been established with a U.S. institution.","Attached to PD-ABI-941","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","4/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Irrigation system construction|Government departments|Host government departmental coordination|Fixed amount reimbursement","Morocco","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDABI941A.pdf","190 KB","008579 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to strengthen Egypt's capacity for agricultural research and extension.  Evaluation covers the period 1985-6/94. Significant advances have been made in Egyptian agriculture during the project's existence.  However, the project cannot take exclusive credit for these, which must also be attributed to: (1) major policy reforms implemented during the past 12 years, many of which removed significant disincentives to agricultural development; and (2) improvements in agricultural research programs made by A.I.D.-sponsored projects in the late 1970s and mid-1980s.  Rather, the project has built itself on the foundations laid by the above efforts, and pursued new activities, resulting in significant improvements in the production, nominal value, and commodity prices for a broad spectrum of crops, as well as for wheat, the production of which has increased more since 1987 than at any other time in Egypt's history. Specific project accomplishments have included the development of management information systems at 9 agricultural extension facilities, and the formation of research and extension councils for each of Egypt's 4 major regions; an extensive training program, which has significantly improved the seed industry; and a new initiatives component, through which unanticipated problems may be solved or opportunities pursued. Unfortunately, the project has been constrained by significant problems with implementation, management (which may have resulted, in part, from the 2-year delay in establishing a project administration unit), and funding.  (1) Leadership changes plagued both USAID/E (which has had 3 Mission directors) and the GOE.  (2) A critical audit resulted in reductions in project funding, and the cancellation of several important components in 1992, and further reductions have been proposed. However, the audit's major complaints have been addressed, the GOE's failure to provide its share of project funding has been positively resolved, and management problems have ended with the appointment of a new project manager in 1990. Despite these problems, the project has been a vital part of the USAID effort to improve Egypt's agricultural productivity.  It is recommended that most of the original funding level be restored, and that it should continue, intact, until a successor project has been developed and set in place.  Future activities should be more sharply focused, take advantage of Egypt's excellent production capacities, and seek to improve and expand domestic and export markets for agricultural commodities.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","LAG-4200-I-00-3056-00","","6/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural development|Crop production|Agricultural research|Agricultural extension training|Agricultural technology|Institution building","Egypt","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABI987.pdf","9,629 KB","005072 - Tropical Research and Development, Inc.","","007970 - USAID.

"This report presents an assessment of one aspect of the quality and consistency of USAID Mission strategic plans.  The information was drawn from an examination of 50 randomly chosen strategic objectives which were assessed against a matrix of quality criteria.  These criteria were developed from the program performance measurement guidelines cabled to all field Missions and offices by CDIE in April 1991. Results are as follows.  (1) An assessment of qualitative changes in strategic plans from 1992 to 1993, as recorded by the LAC and Africa Bureau Missions, reveals that Missions continue to refine and improve their strategic plans each year.  These changes have been made in response to new funding scenarios, better knowledge of strategic planning and performance monitoring, and the practical aspects of data collection.  (2) There are three general conclusions about the quality of strategic objectives, a pattern which varies little by program area: (a) 37% and 33% of the strategic objectives (SOs) and program outcomes (POs), respectively, were not logically consistent; (b) 34% and 35% of the SOs and POs, respectively, were not defined precisely; (c) 50% and 54% of the indicators for SOs and POs, respectively, were not direct measures of the SO or PO.  (3) The quality of strategic plans must be improved to respond to managers' needs and some quality improvements are already being made by individual Missions.  CDIE should continue to provide input on the quality of strategic plans during annual program reviews and before PRISM (Program Performance Information for Strategic Management) TDYs; and CDIE should work to provide information/guidance on indicators and data collection, especially in the newer areas of USAID activity.

"Evaluates the African Emergency Locust/Grasshopper Assistance (AELGA) project.  Since the mid-term evaluation in 1989, AELGA, in collaboration with strong efforts from other donors, has made great strides in improving Niger's national capacity to launch effective, organized, and environmentally sound crop protection efforts.  Niger's crop protection program has significantly increased its capability to conduct adequate surveys and control in recent years.  Approximately 34,600 farmers in village brigades were trained in defense against pest infestations. AELGA funding in the past six years has virtually sustained Niger's aerial survey and control operations.  It has also provided the necessary fuel for ground survey and control, essentially built the entire communication network, and contributed to the expertise level through training. Niger's crop protection program is nevertheless losing substantial donor support.  It is during this transition to self-sufficiency that USAID should pay specific attention to pest management issues in order to maintain the national capacity and assist in its evolution toward sustainable crop protection. Without USAID support and many other significant efforts, DCP's (Directorate of Crop Protection) capacity to handle pest outbreaks would have been seriously flawed.  Given the marginal food production capability in Niger, AELGA assistance is vital to preventing possible famine. AELGA should look for new ways to foster sustainability in Niger's pest management program, specifically, through further development of Niger's unique aerial control capability.  This resource should be developed so that Niger could ""export"" its aerial pest control services to the region. should be continued include initiatives in village brigade training.  In order for self-sufficiency to develop, AELGA should initiate efforts to coordinate the efforts the numerous donors and agencies for a more consolidated and sustainable approach. These institutions should conduct regular meetings on pest management issues. One of the most dramatic developments was the removal of all of the unwanted dieldrin from Niger through AELGA's innovative Niger Dieldrin Disposal Project (NDDP).  Empty pesticide containers, however, remain as potential risks to human health in Niger, as containers are a valuable commodity in the country primarily for food, water, and fuel storage. USAID/N has begun an approach to the issue of container disposal with last year's draft of a ""Prototype Barrel Disposal Plan"" for empty organophosphate containers.  The draft should be thoroughly reviewed before implementation. The security issue in northern Niger remains an impediment to effective locust control.  Desert locust population upsurges in key breeding areas of Niger's remote Air Mountains and the Tamesna can result in massive and highly mobile swarms if left uncontrolled.  Early intervention can minimize the threat to Niger as well as to other countries in the Sahel, the Maghreb, and the Horn of Africa. It is imperative that any future pest management system include an environmental impact agenda.  Environmental monitoring can identify negative effects on flora and fauna, as well as detect improper application methods which can harm human health and increase operational costs. Locust and grasshopper control involves vigilant surveillance, monitoring, and preventive intervention as well as emergency response. The overriding goal is the complete evolution from emergency intervention during plagues to preventive pest management, and from donor-driven to national and regional self-sufficiency with auspicious, comprehensive, and self-sustaining operations.  While USAID (through AELGA) and other donors have made significant progress in developing Niger's crop protection services, the objective of securing a preventive strategy has not yet been attained.  Were USAID and the Disaster Preparedness and Mitigation program not to continue support for pest management activities, the achievement of this goal would certainly be precluded. Furthermore, effective pest outbreak intervention capacity will be derailed and the remarkable gains made over the past five years will have been for naught. USAID/N's agenda should include: making pest management a priority within the DPM program's mandate, assisting the DCP in capacity-building, and maintaining inter-agency and regional relationships in crop protection.

"Final evaluation of the Cooperative Health Program (12/90-3/94), which provides TA, through a PASA with the U.S. Public Health Service (USPHS), to Egyptian researchers. In general, collaboration among USAID, the USPHS, and the Egyptian Ministry of Health (MOH) was quite successful, and the collaborative work of U.S. and Egyptian investigators generated significant research results that could improve health in Egypt. TA was of very high quality. There were many individual achievements.  Laboratories and offices in the MOH and universities have been upgraded through equipment purchases; several can now serve as reference laboratories in Egypt and for the region.  The capacities of research groups have been greatly enhanced; most received computers and data management training, and several groups gained the capacity to evaluate potential health problems through community prevalence surveys.  In service and production-oriented projects, protocols and Standard Operating Procedures were standardized among collaborating institutions and brought up to international norms. Despite these individual achievements, the sustainability of the program and its impact on public health is questionable.  At the most basic level, the program simply wasn't long enough to establish a widespread increase in capacity, nor to ensure the sustainability of many of the projects; several investigators expressed apprehension that the equipment and expertise gained may not be usefully employed in the near future.  The program also suffered considerable management and logistical deficiencies, especially in the earlier stages, although USAID, by requiring the establishment of an in-country Management Support Unit, was able to resolve many of the logistical issues. On a broader level, the program seemed to lack purpose and cohesiveness.  For example, the 17 projects in the program portfolio lacked a common theme, and the translation of research findings into policy was limited.  Most this has to be blamed on USAID, which failed to provide adequate direction and oversight, and on the design of the program, which did not establish clear goals or lines of responsibility between the U.S. Office of International Health (OIH), which was responsible for managing the project, and USAID; in fact, there was significant disagreement between USAID and OIH about the nature of the program.  The MOH seemed to be left ""out of loop"" in many cases, and as a result did not feel a sense of ownership of research findings, nor seem very motivated to translate findings into policy recommendations. Future collaborations of this type should include a formal project paper, link program components more closely to current MOH and USAID strategies and goals, focus TA more clearly on sustainability goals, and specify terms of reference and expectations for both USAID and OIH.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","PDC-5929-I-00-0109-00","","3/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Health research|Research management|Disease research|Research collaboration","Egypt","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABJ063.pdf","6,867 KB","001441 - U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Services.

The project, which was implemented in five secondary cities on the coast (planned efforts in the sierra were dropped), included two components:  (1) Instituto de Investigaciones Socio-economicas y Tecnologicas (INSOTEC) provided TA to enterprises that made intensive use of local labor and materials, especially in the food processing, clothing, wood product, and metal works sectors; (2) CARE, working through Fundacion Carvajal and Accion International (AITEC) and their subgrantees, provided training and credit.  Thousands of microentrepreneurs, many of them women, were trained in business administration by local foundations using the methodology developed by Fundacion Carvajal in Colombia, and more than 4,000 loans were made.  By the PACD, the project had helped to create 2,149 new jobs, and the 5% increase in value added during 1988 and 1989 in projected-assisted microenterprises surpassed expectations. Several lessons were learned.  (1) The project's design was too complex and far-reaching.  The participation of many institutions and the abundance of services offered led to overlapping of functions and lack of coordination.  (2) The creation of new foundations in the secondary cities to carry out the project was not at all successful; the foundations were organizationally weak and their leaders not genuinely committed to microenterprise strengthening, as was evident when they abandoned their programs after the project ended.  The use of existing institutions such as INSOTEC proved much more effective in developing and replicating programs.  (3) Support for small enterprises should be integrated, i.e., should include credit, TA, and management training. (4) Channelling credit through the formal banking system was not effective.  Because of the program's social nature, the banks gave it only limited support, and the program served the banks more than it did the SSE sector.  Also, the credit provided was insufficient to allow participating NGOs to cover their operating expenses.  Channelling credit through the foundations would have been a better option.  (5) Continuation of project activities after the PACD has been only partial. Of the new NGOs, only the INSOTEC office in Santo Domingo is still operating; of existing NGOs strengthened by the project, those in Guayaquil, Quito, Esmeraldas, and Cuenca continue to operate their own programs.  The expectations raised by the government's new microenterprise program, CONAUPE, have apparently discouraged private institutions from continuing to work in the SSE sector. (6) Support for NGOs through the use of subgrants was not effective.  Direct agreements between the NGOs and USAID may be a better alternative.  (7) Credit graduation was achieved in very few cases:  microentrepreneurs are reluctant to request loans from banks because of paperwork and collateral requirements. Institutional graduation (i.e., to cooperatives and associations) is a more feasible target.  Future programs need to take into account the political and economic environment of each community. (8) A final project evaluation should have been conducted (instead of a sector assessment, as was the case).","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","2/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Small scale enterprises|Microenterprises|Entrepreneurs|Commercial credit|Commercial banks|Business support services|Private voluntary organizations|Indigenous private voluntary organizations|Employment|Management training|Secondary cities","Ecuador","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABJ080.pdf","168 KB","008538 - USAID.

"PACR of a grant to Asociacion Amigos del Pais (AAP) for a project (7/87-5/93) to implement the Program of Integral Basic Education (PEBI) in Guatemala, a program to provide post-literacy training to graduates of the Government of Guatemala's National Literacy Program (CONALFA). The project did not develop in the way planned.  In the first phase of implementation (1987-88), the coverage and impact of PEBI services (weekly newspapers and other reading materials) were low.  Not only were rural adults unable to afford the newspaper, but, due to CONALFA's slow start-up, the post-literacy training model itself proved inapplicable because of high illiteracy levels in the areas selected for project implementation.  As a result, AAP added literacy training to PEBI, which now includes specific strategies to respond to the literacy deficiencies of a range of persons. PEBI has now been institutionalized in AAP and has attained self-sufficiency thanks to the fundraising efforts of the Board of Directors.  The program includes a system for periodic validation and revision of educational materials, as well as a permanent system for training staff in materials design, promotor training, newspaper design and promotion, and merchandising. PEBI has gained national recognition, and more than 30 NGOs now use PEBI materials in their literacy programs. The most important output of the project was a Governmental Agreement by which the Ministry of Education grants elementary third grade certificates to graduates of PEBI and similar NGO programs. On the negative side, PEBI suffers from several management weaknesses, particularly in the area of budgeting and financial management; professional TA is needed.  Since AAP's historic role is to facilitate rather than implement training programs, PEBI should now be institutionalized within its own NGO and have a Board of Directors composed of both AAP private sector members and development professionals. The following lessons were learned.  (1) While the project's rationale of developing a private-sector led, post-literacy training program in conjunction with CONALFA was sound, the project suffered from several design problems.  Because it was not designed in accordance with the usual A.I.D. sequence (concept paper, PID, and Project Paper), it lacked detailed analyses, being in fact modeled after the successful Colombian Cultural Action program (ACPO) without adaptation to the Guatemalan situation.  (2) PEBI tried to encourage farm owners to purchase literacy packages for their workers as a way of fulfilling their requirements under the 1986 Literacy Law. However, when the farm owners realized the Literacy Law would not be applied, most abandoned the program.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","6/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Literacy|New literates|Illiterates|Literacy instruction|Rural areas|Indigenous private voluntary organizations|Domestic government programs|Adult education","Guatemala","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABJ081.pdf","238 KB","008550 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (1985-6/93) to provide U.S. training to individuals from public and private sector institutions in Ecuador. The project has successfully trained future policymakers, managers, and technical specialists, including the Mayor of Quito and a Pichincha Council member; and numerous professors, rectors, and vice-rectors from private and public universities, including the Rector of Central University. In most instances the project exceeded its quantitative goals because of a combined USAID/USIA effort under which the Fulbright Commission co-sponsored 25% of training expenses.  As a result, 152 (vs. a target of 104) short-term technical courses were completed, 1 (vs. 0) long-term technical course was completed, and 28 (vs. 21) long-term academic programs (at the undergraduate, graduate, and doctorate levels) were completed. Training was provided in the areas of journalism, computerized information systems, scientific environmental issues, ecology, educational technologies, international trade, project design and management, agriculture (including agribusiness and dairy cattle), marketing, childhood education, and in sector administration (e.g., business, education, housing, and engineering, and human resources). All planned activities were successfully completed, except the grant agreement with Fundacion Privada Ecuatoriana, which was canceled because the Foundation did not provide the required counterpart contribution. Women comprised 50% of long-term training participants, and 19% of short-term training participants.  Gender targets were set only for Fulbright grants (32% were intended for women); 62% of the long-term grants and 19% of the short-term were awarded to women. The following lessons were learned.  (1) Future participant training projects in which candidates have difficulty meeting the English-language requirement should consider the use of third-country training.  (2) Targets for female participation should be clearly specified to ensure substantial female participation.  (3) The cost of pre-departure expenses (e.g., passports, taxes, international tickets) are usually paid by the host country or other non-A.I.D. funding. However, because of economic constraints Ecuadorian counterparts were unable to cover these expenses and the Mission often covered them.  To reduce its costs the Mission negotiated with the Ecuadorian Ministry of Finance to use local currency to finance international travel for public employees.  Similar arrangements should be made for future training of public employees.  (4) The project allowed the Mission to train outstanding professionals who otherwise would not have qualified for project-related training because they were not employed by institutions supported by A.I.D. projects.  It is recommended that the proposed Training for Development Project (scheduled for FY96) also target candidates who do not qualify for training under bilateral projects.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","3/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Technical training|Education for development|Participants|Disadvantaged groups|Private sector|Public sector|Higher education","Ecuador","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABJ082.pdf","118 KB","002290 - USAID.

"PACR of a subproject (8/87-9/93) to improve economic infrastructure, especially farm-to-market roads, in Saint Vincent.  The subproject was implemented by the Ministry of Communications and Works (MCW) and the Central Water and Sewerage Authority. The subproject improved 10.3 of a targeted 15 miles of road, including much of the island's feeder road distribution network, some of which had been become impassible to all but 4-wheel drive vehicles.  As a result, farmers are now able to more quickly transport their produce to market.  In addition, the project provided a water supply to the CIDA-funded Diamond Industrial Estate; the site is now ready for the construction of factory shells, scheduled to begin in 1995. The Government of Saint Vincent (GOSV) did not implement the project's road maintenance plan; instead, the GOSV obtained non-A.I.D. funding and engaged a consultant to prepare a comprehensive maintenance management system for the MCW; the system will cover roads that were rehabilitated under the subproject. The following lessons were learned.  (1) The continuity of the supervision provided by an MCW technical team was an important factor in the success of the road rehabilitation effort.  (2) The design of physical infrastructure improvement projects should provide for the procurement of and dedication of construction equipment, lest the project be forced to wait for the use of shared equipment.  (3) Construction equipment should be accompanied by spare parts, and, wherever possible, training in equipment maintenance.  (4) Where the Fixed Amount Reimbursement (FAR) method is used to fund construction works, each activity should be covered by a separate FAR agreement in order to preclude cash flow problems.  (5) Wherever possible, a financial audit should be performed at the project's midpoint.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Transportation infrastructure|Road construction|Farm to market roads","Saint Vincent and the Grenadines","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABJ083.pdf","234 KB","001757 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (7/82-7/94) to increase the impact and sustainability of family planning (FP) programs in the Eastern Caribbean. The project made progress towards meeting most targets, though generally to a lesser extent than planned.  The following lessons were learned.  (1) A shortage of highly qualified personnel at all levels due to ""brain drain"" has put a disproportionate management burden on those in political and civil service leadership positions.  Project designers should, where possible, designate lower level staff to serve on task forces in order to reduce the pressure on those at the Permanent Secretary level. (2) Consultation prior to project design with those who will actually implement a project is crucial.  The Management Information System failed because the public health nurses resented the additional data-gathering responsibility required of them. (3) The community-based delivery systems that have worked so well in Africa and Asia may not be sustainable in the Caribbean, which is already fairly well served by polyclinics, private doctors, and pharmacists.  Project attempts at employer-based delivery programs in industrial parks also met with disappointing results, though possibly because of economic problems in the parks themselves.  In any event, it is important to continue to push for a change in public policy and promote the concept that the general public must help bear the cost of some social and medical services.  The private sector must also be encouraged to carry its share of responsibility. (4) Since nurses continue to be the front-line FP workers in the Caribbean, continuing attention to their training is necessary. Doctors, on the other hand, have shown themselves unwilling to attend local training programs if this conflicts with surgery times or income opportunities, though they are willing to attend training courses abroad if expenses are paid and the training leads to certification.  (5) Sex and youth will continue to be a recurring theme.  This project was partially successful in establishing youth clinics and providing youth counseling.  Much persistence is necessary to incorporate sex education into school curricula. (6) Both this project and the Basic Needs Trust Fund project (5380103) allocated funds for specific public works necessary for the project, e.g., refurbishing FP clinics.  Unfortunately, this was done, as usual, through Public Works Departments, thereby ensuring that not all of the works approved would be finished. Some other way of accomplishing this work must be found. (7) By project end, the Caribbean Family Planning Affiliation (CFPA) had evolved into a strong regional institution capable, with continued support, of carrying on the work of the project, thereby showing the wisdom of sticking with a grantee through thick and thin.  (8) It is wise to build on the successes of other projects.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","7/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Family planning services|Family planning promotion programs|Family planning policy","Eastern Caribbean","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABJ084.pdf","220 KB","001757 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to maintain forest cover in the buffer zone surrounding Corcovado National Park in the Osa Peninsula in Costa Rica by providing local people with education and alternative economic opportunities (BOSCOSA project).  Evaluation focuses on activities from the 1992 evaluation (PD-ABF-158) through 3/1/94. BOSCOSA has reached a crisis point from which it has neither the funding nor the staff to recover.  The crisis began at the end of 1992, when Cerro Brujo, the environmental association, split into two groups, and confrontation in the Rancho Quemado pilot area caused BOSCOSA to withdraw.  These events disheartened BOSCOSA staff, some of whom left the program altogether, while others were transferred to new regional projects of the Neotropica Foundation, BOSCOSA's implementing agency. Throughout 1993, a large-scale turnover of staff, including long-time personnel, reduced BOSCOSA's ability to deal with these events and to meet the expectations it had raised in 1991-1992 by overambitiously expanding its operations from 4 to 8 communities.  These problems, which were exacerbated by the uncertain level of A.I.D. funding, were capped by the failure of COOPEAGROMUEBLES, BOSCOSA's showcase project, at the end of 1993.  As a result of this crisis, BOSCOSA is held in low esteem by the communities it serves, which associate it with failed activities (Rancho Quemado, COOPEAGROMUEBLES, failed pejibaye and guanabana initiatives), inability to generate significant incomes (some people have even lost money), inadequate delivery of reforestation and forest incentives, the unreliability of its technicians, and an influx of unfamiliar staff members as a result of turnover. It is recommended that BOSCOSA and Neotropica attempt to salvage the remains of the activities that are under the most public scrutiny; continued assistance would demonstrate that BOSCOSA is committed to its projects, and dispel the impression that it was ""run out of town."" Thus, BOSCOSA should continue activities with ASOPRAQ and COOPEAGROMUEBLES; secure markets for the pejibaye plantations in Rancho Quemado; help to resolve AGROMUEBLES' legal problems, and encourage any members who wish to reactivate activities or form a new group. BOSCOSA also needs to better communicate its strategies to beneficiary communities and to show more sensitivity to community interests; addition of a social scientist to the staff, which is composed almost exclusively of technicians, is advised. In the area of evaluation, BOSCOSA needs to assess the ecological and social impacts of its activities and not simply whether they achieve quantitative production goals.  Indicators should be established for each project component and for the project as a whole, and information maintained for comparison over time. Special attention should be paid to failed activities, perhaps with the help of more objective external sources. Finally, given the reductions in staff and the level of available funding, BOSCOSA must prioritize its activities (rather than try to be ""all things to all people"") and secure funding based on those priorities.  In cases where this entails abandoning efforts already begun, BOSCOSA should, in order to reduce expectations and avoid resentments, inform the communities in question of its new policy and make provisions for other organizations to provide similar services to those communities.","Attached to PD-ABJ-128","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","3/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Natural resource management|Natural resource conservation|Natural resource utilization|Protected environmental areas|Local groups","Costa Rica","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDABJ128A.pdf","1,703 KB","008226 - Neotropica Foundation","","008533 - USAID.

"The Democracy Initiatives Project ($15 million) is a major USAID effort to capitalize on the momentum toward democratic process in Cambodia begun with the elections of 1993.  The project is centered on four grantees:  The Asia Foundation, the National Democratic Institute, the International Republican Institute, and the Asian-American Free Labor Institute (AAFLI).  All but the first are associated with the National Endowment for Democracy. This evaluation is a collaborative one that effectively focuses on the period since the elections of 5/93. The Foundation programs, after a very troubled first year, have received extensive respect.  The Institutes, widely noted as having a very productive period before the elections, have not been as active as their administrative costs would warrant. AAFLI is too new to evaluate. The Foundation has programs in the fields of law, human rights, governance, the legislature, the press, nongovernmental pluralism, and economic liberalization; the Institutes have programs with the political parties; and AAFLI with labor.  The evaluation notes that concepts of democracy and law represent core values or aspirations related to power, its organization, and distribution.  Foreign aid's possible effects on these fields are limited, although programs are important and should continue. The evaluation cautions that the Cambodian political situation is highly volatile, that power is personalized and hierarchical, and that progress toward democracy is not irreversible.  Expectations should not be inflated, progress is likely to be slow, and USAID support needs to continue over a long period.  Perhaps the most important avenue toward pluralism, and eventually democracy, is through the NGO community. The evaluation recommends that the project be extended, but that USAID administrative control over all grantees, which has been restrictive, should be liberalized.  It recommends that the funding for both Institutes be allowed to run out over the next 6 months and a resident program not be renewed, but reconsidered at an appropriate period before the next election.  The evaluation makes specific suggestions for improvement of the operations of USAID and each of the grantees, and draws some general lessons concerning the need for country knowledge and clear administrative authority, together with improved USAID contracting procedures. Noting the importance of the American presence in Cambodia at this time, it warns against complacence in view of the uncertain prospects. It suggests negotiations with the Cambodian government on official recognition of Foundation-supported education programs, and with the French on programmatic rivalries.

"Final evaluation of a matching grant (9/89-9/94) to the YMCA to strengthen YMCA National Movements and their local associations in the Third World, especially in Africa.  The main activity was provision of a block grant to the Africa Alliance of YMCAs, a consortium of 26 African YMCA movements. Under the block grant, National Movements in 13 African countries received project and institutional support through grants of $25,000 or under, workshops in development and strategic planning, and/or visits by Alliance staff.  The Alliance's administration of the grant improved considerably after the mid-term evaluation in such areas as project approval and financial management, the latter due to the recruitment of an accountant as recommended in the evaluation.  There was also a steady improvement in communications between the Alliance and the National Movements, as well as fewer and shorter delays in the disbursement of funds.  Additionally, increased dialogue within the Africa Alliance and between the Alliance and the YMCA's International Division has resulted in better, clearer projects with improved transparency, communication, and accountability. The block grant (which broke with the YMCA's past practice of providing project-specific funds) has strengthened the institutional role of the Africa Alliance, moving it from a fragile advocacy and clearinghouse organization to that of grant maker and training provider. The Alliance has also taken inspired institution-building measures of its own, e.g., the adoption of strategic planning and a recent ""think tank"" forum to examine its mandate.  Nonetheless, the Alliance has not found it easy to make the transition from a general service provider to a development assistance organization.  It is still struggling with issues of institutional development, YMCA structure, training methodology, and partnership. Specific practical training in project management has not yet been implemented, and as a result, Movements are having difficulty in establishing project criteria, planning projects, sequencing activities, identifying local project leaders, transferring skills, mobilizing resources, monitoring and evaluation, and reporting. Alliance members are in particular need of training in basic community development.  To date, the training provided by the Alliance in this area has been largely through workshops and seminars.  However, these have mostly been one-time affairs, with little or no follow up. Also, while the Alliance recently developed 14 manuals for a Consolidated Leadership Development Program, the manuals have been criticized as being too theoretical. A more fundamental problem is that the YMCA has no clear definition of what a developed institution looks like.  Its leadership largely consists of those versed in the values of a traditional service organization rather than in development matters as understood today. The African YMCAs, for their part, seem to be struggling to establish their identities.  Some seem unable to move beyond the traditional service provider model, overstretching themselves trying to serve everyone in every way. Others seem compelled to attain financial self-sufficiency through income-generation schemes (some at cross-purposes with development goals) before moving to nonprofit, community-based efforts.  Some appear as nascent community development organizations working to find their niche in the communities they serve. Other institutional deficiencies are that:  (1) the YMCA's worldwide network (which would likely be greatly envied by many PVOs) is largely underutilized in promoting meaningful collaboration; (2) many YMCA staff and lay leaders seem unaware of the benefits of collaboration with non-YMCA donors and partners; and (3) lack of coordination between the YMCA's International Division in Chicago (which handles the matching grant) and its Africa Desk in Pittsburgh (which handles the YMCA's Africa affairs) has lessened the impact of the matching grant.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","OTR-0158-A-00-9077-00","","6/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Community development|Institution building|Grants|Networks|Associations|Private voluntary organizations|Indigenous private voluntary organizations|Workshops","Africa|Togo|Kenya|Israel|Uganda","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABJ143.pdf","1,042 KB","","","007746 - USAID.

"This mid-term evaluation of the Zimbabwe Family Planning (FP) Project (6130230) was carried in March and April 1994.  This is a forward-looking evaluation because USAlD/Z plans to prepare a Project Paper Supplement and Grant Amendment which will add funds and extend the project by 2 years, until 1998. The project, implemented by the Zimbabwe National FP Council (ZNFPC), is progressing satisfactorily and is predicted to meet or exceed most of its objectives by the extended project end date. The project's goals -- to reduce the total fertility rate (TFR) and increase sustainability -- were examined and found to remain sound. Environmental factors, including the economic structural adjustment program, the 1991-92 drought, the AIDS epidemic, upcoming elections and related political factors, and the economic recession, have affected Government of Zimbabwe (GOZ) priorities and have had an impact on timely implementation of the project.  Despite these constraints, the project remains essentially on track. Progress is being made on the first two end-of-project indicators -- increased use of modern contraceptive methods and ensuring the availability of a wider variety of methods -- and the evaluation team feels these are achievable within the extended life of the project. Achievement of the latter two -- increased services provided and/or financed by the private sector and reduced net government costs for FP services -- appear less certain. Three project indicators -- reduced TFR, increased use of modern methods, and increased private sector participation --were revised to more conservative levels in the 1993 USAID Country Program Strategic Plan (CPSP).  The team does not feel the reductions in the first two are necessary, especially in light of the proposed time extension.  The third indicator should remain at its reduced level or be further moderated unless the report recommendations aimed at strengthening private sector FP financing are included in the project amendment. Method diversification activities are proceeding as expected, with only slight delays.  Suggestions and recommendations are made for enhanced use of TA and local currency funding to address some of these delays. Program sustainability is being affected by a number of policies and other factors which are beyond the direct control of ZNFPC and its parent body, the Ministry of Health and Child Welfare (MOH).  At the same time, ZNFPC is making significant progress in working toward cost recovery. Much needs to be done to enhance progress in the private sector activity area.  The team recommends integrating the activities in this area into a comprehensive, limited-term private sector FP financing initiative.  This initiative would be coordinated by ZNFPC and subcontracted to an external entity experienced in health care financing and in working with the private sector. Use of local currency support appears to be lagging; however, the team was unable to obtain a complete picture of local currency expenditures by program area.  Recommendations are made as to possible activities and items to be funded under this budgetary component in the project amendment, including the financing initiative noted above.  An additional recommendation advises using the existing local currency budget to contract for assistance in the development of financial reporting systems. The role of Cooperating Agencies (CAs) was examined and found to be acceptable.  TA from USAID-funded CAs is generally appreciated by ZNFPC. The team recommends continued use of this mechanism along with local contracts to assist with implementation of the amended project.  The team did not find evidence of extensive duplication or project complications due to the lack of regular or formal coordination among FP donors. A number of possible topics for research are noted with the suggestion that ZNFPC create a database of experienced individuals and research firms that can assist in undertaking some of the research. Adolescent reproductive health is a new area of interest to ZNFPC and a new priority for the MOH.  Suggestions are given for specific ways USAID funding can assist with the recommendation that this area be included in the amended PP. A number of specific policy issues, which constrain full achievement of GOZ program and USAID project objectives, were identified during this evaluation.  These are listed and discussed in some detail as background for USAlD's upcoming nonproject assistance program planning exercise.

"Evaluates project to expand family planning (FP) information and services in Rwanda.  Mid-term evaluation covers the period 1989-4/94. The project faced formidable obstacles, most notably the civil conflict which began in earnest in 1990 and continued with varying intensity throughout the life of the project.  Escalating fighting during the evaluation's data collection phase forced the evacuation of the evaluation team and the entire U.S. Mission. However, the evaluation does provide a fairly accurate assessment of progress made, and includes suggestions for future programming. As might be expected under the circumstances, institutional development of FP organizations was very difficult.  While the skills of individual ONAPO (National Population Office) staff and Ministry of Health service providers were upgraded through training, turnover and vacancies made any continuity unlikely. Overall, the project had little impact on the development of ONAPO's management capabilities, nor did it have much impact upon the development of the private sector. However, the project did have significant success, through its IEC, training, and FP service delivery components, in increasing knowledge of FP (to 97%), improving attitudes toward FP (93% favoring), lowering desired family size (to 4.4), and increasing the prevalence of modern contraceptive use (to 13%), as measured by the 1992 Demographic and Health Survey.  These data indicate a substantial reduction in fertility and the natural rate of population growth in Rwanda; nevertheless, rates remain high enough to be a serious constraint to Rwanda's socioeconomic development. Lessons learned included the following.  (1) The structure of FP programs need to be flexible enough to adapt to changing circumstances; in particular, programs need to guard against becoming too closely identified with a particular political party.  (2) Although the private sector can play an important role in providing FP services, more support is required than this project provided; further, the involvement of the public sector in private initiatives should be viewed with caution.  (3) The development of computerized management information systems must be prioritized carefully with respect to other requirements of programmatic monitoring and other means of gaining management information through field observation. There will continue to be a population problem in Rwanda; it must be addressed with attention to policy development, IEC, and training, but increasing access to quality FP services will be of paramount importance.","Project title: Population technical assistance (POPTECH)","Special Evaluation","Documents","CCP-3024-Q-00-3012-00","","7/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Family planning services|Family planning promotion programs|Institution building","Rwanda","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABJ155.pdf","7,584 KB","008485 - Basic Health Management International (BHM)|001131 - The Futures Group International, Inc.

"The socioeconomic, technological, and institutional impacts of research conducted through the food commodity networks of the Semi-Arid Food Grain And Development (SAFGRAD) Project are assessed in this report.  (1) The socioeconomic impact of maize and cowpea research has been substantial in West Africa, with estimated annual benefits ranging between $4.8-$84 million for maize and $0.8-$12.3 million for cowpeas. Achieving similar success with sorghum and millet will require much more applied agronomic research (and less emphasis on breeding).  (2) SAFGRAD networks have been a major mover of technologies between national agricultural research systems (NARS), increasing the availability of new technology, improving research collaboration among countries, and allowing national programs to increase their responsibility for the networks.  In the countries examined for this study, about half of the maize and sorghum varieties and almost three-fourths of the released cowpea varieties had been in SAFGRAD trials; a similar trend exists for maize.  (3) By training researchers (30 to the M.Sc. or Ph.D. level, 400 via specialized courses) and using networks to pool research talents, SAFGRAD has significantly expanded the research capacities of the NARS and helped them to attain a critical mass of scientists. Observational tours for researchers and the biennial SAFGRAD conference have also boosted institutional capacity.  Future prospects are conditioned on the availability of finances to sustain achieved gains and the need for attention to maintenance of the natural resource base.","Earlier ed.: PN-ABP-430","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Semiarid zone|Agricultural research|Institution building|Research collaboration","Africa south of Sahara","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNABS311.pdf","3,175 KB","005019 - Organization of African Unity.

"As a result of the decline of The Gambia's natural resource base, USAID supported three major sustainable agricultural development activities -- soil and water management, mixed farming and range management, and agricultural research and diversification -- totaling $30.3 million between 1978 and 1992.  Of these, the $4.96 million Soil and Water Management (SWM) project had the most direct and dramatic results in environmental, economic, and social terms.  The SWM program rehabilitated lowland rice soils and protected them from salinization, while also protecting upland slopes from erosion and nearby villages from flooding.  As a result, saline soils that were gradually becoming uncultivable could be cultivated again; crop yields (primarily rice) increased significantly (often doubling in the first year after protective measures were applied); water tables rose; and soil and gully erosion was reduced.  Because women are typically the rice growers in The Gambia, they were among the major beneficiaries. The program was also effective in that it reached its target population, provided equal opportunity to all potential beneficiaries, and is expected to return $5 for every $1 spent between 1992 and 2006.  SWM success can be attributed to four main factors.  (1) The conservation technologies that USAID introduced produced significant results in a short time and thus led to high adoption rates.  (2) The demand for technologies originated with beneficiaries, not with donors or government. (3) Institution building at the national level and participation at the local level were emphasized.  (4) The new technologies were simple to implement, easy to maintain, and required few changes in farmers' existing practices.  The SWM Unit which A.I.D. created and sustained over 13 years is a strong institution that is sustainable as long as it receives adequate budgetary support.  The project is replicable given continued access to the technical design expertise currently provided by the Unit, although there remains a critical shortage of management skills on the part of senior and mid-level Gambian officials.","Evaluation highlights: PN-ABG-043","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","3/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Sustainable agriculture|Agricultural water management|Soil management|Institution building|Agricultural technology|Technology transfer","Gambia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNABS469.pdf","6,570 KB","008058 - USAID.

"Interim evaluation of a grant to the African-American Labor Center (AALC) to expand its efforts to develop self-sufficient democratic trade unions in sub-Saharan African countries (exclusive of South Africa). The evaluation covers the period 9/91-7/94. This has been a particularly important time for USAID to be supporting sub-Saharan African trade unions.  The unions have deserved support because of their efforts on behalf of democracy, and they have needed it both because of government retaliation (in some countries) for these efforts, and because of the fall-out from economic restructuring. Increasing efforts to scale back civil service employment and restructure or privatize government enterprises have hit union membership, influence, and financing particularly hard, since civil servants' and public employees' unions have historically been the core of unionism in African countries.  Economic and political turmoil have also strained government-industry-trade union relations.  The tripartite committee system and the industrial courts, both designed to deal with industrial relations, are not performing well; additional institutions and/or processes are needed to reduce the level of labor-management conflict. USAID objectives in sub-Saharan Africa during this critical period have been well served by the grant to AALC.  Although the political situation has at times precluded AALC activity, where it could operate AALC has responded effectively to trade union needs.  It has increased the number of its country programs from 23 in 1991 to 29 in 1993, with over 70% of the direct costs of the grant going to country programs, i.e., to support individual trade union centers.  The grant also funds rapid assistance to trade union federations; initial activities where a full-scale program is not yet called for; activities by U.S. unions with counterpart African unions under the auspices of International Trade Secretariats; and collaborative activities with regional and sub-regional trade union organizations.  Due in significant measure to AALC support, trade union leaders appear to understand and accept the need for economic restructuring, even though they think that the process could be carried out more humanely and with trade union participation. Given the increasing number of countries eligible for participation in the program, the speed of political developments in the region, and the fact that AALC is already stretched thin, especially in terms of field representation, it is recommended that AALC expand its activities and infrastructure.  Among the specific recommendations are for AALC to: (1) increase its monitoring capability in the field, hiring additional local staff and specialists, and establishing an additional regional office (possibly two when the turmoil in a number of countries ceases); (2) undertake more research for, and information sharing with, trade union federations on such subjects as institution building, conflict resolution, project development, and comparative labor codes; and (3) increase contacts with other donors, USAID Missions, trade union representatives, etc.  It is also recommended that A.I.D. fund a resumption of the Department of Labor's tripartite visitors program, which brought representatives of Ministries of Labor, employer associations, and labor unions together in the United States.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-0085-I-00-6098-00","","7/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Trade unions|Institution building|Economic development|Political development|Private voluntary organizations","Africa south of Sahara|Ghana|Kenya|Senegal|Sierra Leone|Zambia|Zimbabwe","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABJ186.pdf","5,486 KB","000436 - Development Associates, Inc.|000230 - African-American Labor Center (AALC)","","001554 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (8/86-3/94) to provide educational humanitarian assistance in resistance-controlled areas of Afghanistan. In its early years, the project, working through the Education Center for Afghanistan (ECA), a unit formed under the resistance's Seven Party Alliance, focused on opening schools, paying teachers' salaries, and delivering instructional materials.  ECA schools were established in all the provinces of Afghanistan during the Soviet occupation, and most of these are still operating.  With this solid foundation, the project's focus shifted in 1992 from relief-oriented assistance to ensuring quality education and equitable access. The project developed an integrated, coherent, politically and culturally acceptable primary school curriculum and 87 accompanying textbooks in each of the two national languages, Dari and Pushto. Approval of these texts by the Afghan Interim Government in Peshawar and later by the Ministry of Education in Kabul as the official texts for the country was a significant accomplishment.  Some 15 million textbooks were distributed to over 1,600 primary schools and 446,000 students in all 29 provinces of Afghanistan and to 1,031 primary schools and 167,022 students in refugee camps in Pakistan.  The project's Instructional Materials Development Center (IMDC), staffed entirely by Afghans, produced many durable, cost-effective instructional aids to supplement the textbooks, and itself produced the equipment needed to publish these materials.  In all, IMDC designed, produced, and distributed more than 450,000 silk-screened instructional charts, maps, storybooks, teaching aids, and slate boards. The project included an extensive teacher training program, in which 123 teacher trainers were trained, and in turn, provided in-service training to 3,690 teachers.  Since 1992, the project has emphasized the training of female teachers.  In addition, teaching guides for grades 1-9 were developed to accompany the new textbooks. Literacy training focused first on mujahideen in winter camps along the border, using the ""Alphabet of Jihad Literacy"" books prepared by the project.  A Home/Family Learning to Read and Write literacy textbook, a teaching guide, and reading pamphlets, as well as a general literacy book for adults and one specifically for farmers, were developed.  The project also prepared instructional materials on health and nutrition and distributed 12,000 copies.  In 1993, a decision was made to focus only on women, and 10 pilot adult literacy home/based schools for older girls and women were established in Peshawar and Quetta. Experience has shown that after 9 months of classes meeting 2 hours a day, women can be brought to a fourth grade reading level.  Literacy home schools were extremely well received by the communities and appear to be a culturally acceptable means of providing female literacy training. The project's Research and Planning Unit initiated a comprehensive Education Management Information System and collected school data from 28 provinces (2,589 schools and 722,400 students).  Special studies were also completed, making baseline data needed for educational planning and assessment available. In the participant training component, the Afghanistan Scholarship program and the Weber Scholarship program sent 105 persons for U.S. study; 56 have completed their degrees and returned, 10 are out of status, and 39 are still in school. Lastly, the project established four vocational training centers in Afghanistan, developed a curriculum, and prepared 24 textbooks; from 1989 to 1992, 942 students passed the final exam, of 1,367 enrolled. The primary lesson is the importance of mutual support and cooperation between USAID and the contractor.  The enthusiasm and dynamism of the first A.I.D. representative, along with the cultural expertise concerning Afghanistan of the contractor, the University of Nebraska, enabled the project to mobilize rapidly. Other lessons are as follows.  (1) USAID wanted to have a long-term impact, not just to provide emergency relief; it succeeded because it effectively responded to Afghanistan's religious and cultural environment, e.g., through use of Afghan staff at all levels and the establishment of the Alliance-based ECA as a counterpart agency.  (2) The importance of monitoring in a cross-border program cannot be overstated.  Numerous difficulties could have been avoided if a monitoring plan had been devised early on.  (3) Decentralization of the educational system through regional education centers was an effective strategy, helping to ensure sustainability.  (4) The wisdom of paying teachers' salaries (the single largest line item in this project) needs to be assessed; it is an administrative and monitoring nightmare and seems to increase dependency.  (5) Afghans would send girls to school if there were improved access, more female teachers, and culturally appropriate facilities.  (6) The mid-project shift of the vocational and participant training components to another project and to a contractor lacking strong ties to the Afghan community had a negative effect.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","6/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Primary education|War relief|Institution building|Curriculum design|Textbooks|Educational materials|Literacy instruction|Teacher training|Educational research|Educational planning|Participants","Afghanistan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABJ201.pdf","1,030 KB","008505 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (8/86-6/94) to support basic health care delivery in Afghanistan.  The project was implemented by Management Sciences for Health (MSH). The project made many significant achievements, but their sustainability is doubtful.  Under the Training Component, MSH worked with the Afghan Alliance Health Committee, later to become the Ministry of Public Health (MOPH), and established a very competent and professional training department within the MOPH: the Institute of Public Health (IPH).  MSH and MOPH/IPH developed training programs for a variety of medical/health workers, including basic health workers, rural health officers, provincial public health officers, maternal/child health (MCH) officers, volunteer health sisters, traditional birth attendants, and field microscopists.  MSH also developed refresher courses and medical certification programs, a management training program, and a program to standardize the skill levels of mid-level health workers.  In addition, first aid training was provided to more than 37,000 mujahhidin for military reasons; this program, which MSH continued until 7/91, should have ceased years earlier as it detracted from more productive training. Under the Health Services Development Component, MSH designed a computer-assisted health planning model, SUSPLAN; facilitated the development of Regional Health Administrations (RHAs), primarily in northern and central Afghanistan; and provided input into a 5-year Health Plan for Afghanistan, which was developed under WHO's aegis. At its height, the Health Services Implementation component supported 5,363 health/medical workers at 2,271 basic health posts and 328 other facilities.  At the project's end, only 982 basic health posts and 1,905 personnel remained.  Unfortunately, many health facilities, including those of other donors and especially in the east and north, served the same communities. MSH was well aware of this problem but had the attitude ""we were there first,"" and nothing was done about serious waste of resources until USAID, after studying the problem, canceled the redundant clinics.  More positively, the strengthening of RHAs in northern and central Afghanistan was a major accomplishment, and the RHAs have identified funding sources so that some of their facilities may outlive the project.  MSH also developed an effective system to warehouse and transport medicines and supplies, and established an elaborate monitoring system. In the MCH component, MSH quickly established 41 MCH health centers and 22 health posts, and used village-level providers to deliver basic services, including family planning services. However, when USAID in early 1992 decided not to approve any new non-MCH facility or the hiring of any new male health workers, MSH focused on expanding MCH facilities and rapidly staffing them with women from urban areas who had been poorly trained under the communist system.  Quality suffered as a result. Under the Child Survival and Disease Control Component, MSH achieved perhaps its most significant accomplishment -- establishment of an Expanded Program of Immunization system responsible for providing 40% of the immunizations during the project timeframe.  This component also established 5 pilot tuberculosis centers, 1 of which was canceled for poor performance. Under the Procurement and Supply Management component, MSH procured a prodigious amount of materials, and trained 39 supply management personnel.  MSH, with the only pharmaceutical quality assurance system in place, also played a lead role in procuring standardized supply kits for all USAID-supported health implementing entities. MSH also trained Afghans in fiscal responsibility so that very little money was lost during the project, a major accomplishment during a time of civil unrest. The overriding problem is sustainability.  USAID's mandate to MSH -- to ""aggressively implement"" health/medical assistance (presumably, to win the war) -- was too broad.  A more narrowly focused program could have left more to show for an 8-year $52 million effort.  For example, the successful IPH, for lack of financial resources, will probably not outlive the project, and basic health workers (2,225 were trained by MSH) probably will not be supported by any donor or government agency (although some may be supported by their communities).  Also, SUSPLAN is too academic a tool to contribute to the solution of the sustainability problem. Other lessons learned were as follows.  (1) Extensive medical services can be rapidly and effectively delivered to most populated areas of Afghanistan from across the border in time of war.  (2) The conventional belief that during a war most medical needs will be war-related proved untrue.  Injury-related deaths were far outweighed by deaths due to diseases preventable through public health measures.  (3) USAID should insist on coordination with other donors.  Two examples of errors in this project are: (a) gross wastage of efforts and assets in the immunization program -- in some areas many groups were active, leading to upwards of 100% of more expensive vaccines being administered than were needed; (b) there was no standardization of training courses among the many groups working in the country, and as a result the disparate varieties of health workers and quality of training they have received will be a nightmare for future health planners.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","5/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Primary health care|War relief|Emergency medical care|Project sustainability","Afghanistan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABJ202.pdf","592 KB","008505 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (4/87-6/94) to provide humanitarian assistance related to agriculture to people in Afghanistan, and later, to rehabilitate small-scale agricultural infrastructure and ensure the provision of essential agricultural inputs.  The project was implemented by Development Alternatives, Inc. (DAI) and Volunteers in Technical Assistance (VITA). Due to a U.S. prohibition on expatriate travel inside Afghanistan, information on project achievements is limited to that provided by the contractors themselves.  With this caveat, achievements were as follows. In the rural rehabilitation component, VITA:  cleaned and repaired 762 irrigation ditches and canals (juis); restored almost 2,896 underground wells (karezes); completed 226 projects involving the repair or reconstruction of retaining walls, flumes, and springs; and completed 28 road rehabilitation projects, including 14 new roads and construction or repair of 32 bridges.  Training courses, workshops, and seminars were provided to 450 participants. In the agricultural development and training component, DAI distributed 23,600 MT of DAP fertilizer, 5,500 MT of urea fertilizer, and almost 3,000 MT of improved wheat seed.  Because the DAI contract was terminated early, 600 MT of the fertilizer and 900 MT of the wheat seed was distributed by Mercy Corps International under the PVO Support Project.  Additionally, DAI:  established 7 nurseries for fruit tree propagation (these were transferred to private ownership), and 1,677 orchards, supplying the latter with 287,701 trees; conducted 28 agricultural training programs equivalent to 23,000 person-days of training and 276 demonstrations of apricot drying techniques for 4,140 apricot growers; and supplied agricultural extension agents with instruction manuals in farm machinery operation and corn cultivation. Various types of high-value crops, improved vegetables, and root fuels were tested and demonstrated. Nangarhar province was provided with 4,300 8-week old chickens. In the planning, programming, and analysis component, DAI: developed a computer-based Geographic Information System; analyzed the changes in land under cultivation near the Helmand-Argandab irrigation system and on infrastructure; and published a quarterly commodity price and currency exchange rate bulletin, a monthly project newsletter, and reports on land area under cultivation, land use, and wheat yields. The following lessons were learned.  (1) The U.S. ban on expatriate travel made the project more vulnerable to fraud, theft, and abuse. This ban, barely defensible during the Soviet occupation, should have been lifted, or at least substantially eased, following the collapse of the Najibullah regime.  Through most of the war and afterwards, UN agencies and most NGOs routinely monitored and supervised their projects in Afghanistan. (2) Failure on the part of USAID and the contractors to appreciate the complexity of security conditions inside Afghanistan led to overambitious planning of activities and lack of attention to the intricacies of negotiating safe passage of valuable agricultural commodities and vehicles (which were in great demand and easily convertible to cash).  Moreover, the usual modus operandi of VITA and DAI was to leave equipment in the hands of locals for long periods while rehabilitation was being carried out, which over time created a sense of ownership. As a result, the local commanders prevented the removal of much of the equipment when the project was closed out.  It is doubtful whether the Mission's attempt to solve this problem by granting the equipment to VITA for subgranting to international organizations and NGOs working in areas in which the equipment is located will result in relinquishment of the equipment.  (3) Initially, the project was oriented toward small, unsupervised, works-related activities (e.g., cleaning of karezes), which, because of their low visibility, were least likely to invite Soviet attack, and needs assessments were basically delegated to the local level.  This resulted in occasional embarrassments -- e.g., a road was built to transport timber from forested public lands for commercial sale, and another was built solely to improve access to the house of a prominent commander.  Further, when USAID's strategy shifted from relief to development, the contractors were unable to impose accountability.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","5/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Disaster rehabilitation|War relief|Economic infrastructure|Agriculture|Agricultural inputs|Agricultural development|Beneficiary count","Afghanistan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABJ203.pdf","1,157 KB","008505 - USAID.

"PACR of a Commodity Export Program (CEP) (8/86-6/94) to help meet urgent humanitarian and rehabilitation needs during the civil war in Afghanistan.  The report covers three of the four program components: procurement and logistics; mine detection; and transportation and infrastructure. Under the procurement and logistics component, the contractor (initially American Manufacturers Export Group, later RONCO), provided food, clothing, and other relief commodities for distribution under the CEP itself and also provided procurement services for all the other projects in the Afghanistan portfolio -- at the height of the CEP, the contractors supported 23 separate entities.  In all, 3,888 purchase contracts worth almost $77 million were processed, including Bailey bridges, automobiles, tractors, trucks, computer systems, medical equipment, pharmaceuticals, fertilizer, wheat seed, fruit trees, mine detection dogs, mules, and farrier equipment.  The contractors: operated 17 different warehouses, including 3 inside Afghanistan; handled 128 air and 9 sea shipments under the Defense Department humanitarian aid (McCollum) program; facilitated movement of USAID commodities for international donors, USAID projects, and other relief organizations, using every conceivable mode of transportation, including mules, rafts, and human labor; monitored more than 113,000 MT of commodities and food and more than 223,000 MT of wheat involving 12,000 truck sorties; and assumed responsibility for excess equipment and commodities as other projects were phased out, including the conduct of 14 auctions of equipment. A major success of the program was the establishment of the Mine Detection Dog Center (MDC) at two facilities in Pakistan (Pabbi and Quetta).  The program evolved out of the familiarity of an AMEG veterinarian with the use of dogs to detect mines in Thailand, and 14 trained German Shepherds were donated by the Thai government.  The MDC has cleared 9,360 sq km, detected and destroyed over 36,000 mines or other unexploded ordnance, and checked over 366,000 suspicious objects. RONCO undertook an extensive program to prepare the MDC to continue as an independent NGO.  As of 2/94, the MDC operated with 93 dogs, 277 dog handlers, plus support personnel, and served 10-15 provinces inside Afghanistan at any given time; funding through 1996 has been provided through a USAID grant to the UN Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Assistance. Under the transportation and infrastructure component, the Afghan Construction and Logistics Unit (ACLU) was created in 1988 (when it appeared that a peace settlement was imminent) to supply commodities for returning refugees and to repair transportation infrastructure. However, because (1) repatriation proceeded more slowly than expected, (2) the commercial private sector proved capable of meeting commodity distribution needs, and (3) the transport wing of the ACLU was made up almost entirely of a faction of Afghans who had become strongly anti-American by 1991 and were responsible for several hijackings, the transportation function was ended in Summer 1991 and the ACLU shifted its emphasis to repair and construction of road and bridges inside Afghanistan.  Its major accomplishments were to:  repair 800 km of roads and repair, construct 33 reinforced concrete bridges, and erect 7 Bailey bridges; survey 14,000 roads and bridges in all 29 provinces of Afghanistan; and train 1,174 ACLU employees in construction techniques and equipment operation.  The ACLU was registered as a legal entity and in 3/94 became an independent construction firm, equipped with 455 pieces of construction or maintenance equipment, vehicles worth $12 million, nearly $1 million in spare parts inventory, and a cadre of 80 highly skilled core employees. Lessons learned are as follows.  (1) The CEP provided the capability of responding quickly to the ever-changing operational environment inside Afghanistan, and enabled the Mission to response to victims of natural disasters as well as of war.  (2) Its flexibility allowed it to serve as an incubator for innovative pilot programs such as the MDC and the ACLU.  (3) The advantages of a centralized procurement contractor are substantial, and RONCO generally got high marks for its performance. However, at times other contractors complained that the procurement process was cumbersome or the items procured did not meet their needs. Better modalities for resolving differences between contractors should have been established. (4) When a program is closing out, the logistics contractor should be the last to go.  (5) Efforts to make the Afghan institutions formed under the program more sustainable should have been initiated from the beginning of the program through last minute crash courses.  Nonetheless, prospects for the sustainability of the MDC and the ACLU are good.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","5/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Imports|Commodities|Refugee relief|Humanitarian assistance|War relief|Procurement|Logistics|Supply management|Transportation system maintenance","Afghanistan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABJ204.pdf","1,572 KB","008505 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (12/89-1/92) to increase narcotics awareness and control in Afghanistan. The project, part of A.I.D.'s cross-border assistance program implemented from Pakistan during Afghanistan's civil war, was plagued by problems.  Expatriate staff were evacuated from Pakistan from 1/91-4/91 due to the Gulf War; in 8/91 the Mission placed an embargo on commodity provision to Afghanistan in response to the kidnapping of U.S. citizens; and in 9/91 the TA contractor was directed to move its field headquarters from Peshawar to Islamabad because of security concerns. Moreover, the project was subjected to intense Congressional scrutiny, which made it necessary to delete the poppy elimination (crop substitution) component, the heart of the project, as being beyond the scope of A.I.D.'s humanitarian goals in Afghanistan. As result, the original Narcotics Awareness and Control Project was redesigned as the Afghanistan Narcotics Research and Awareness Project.  However, when Congressional opposition was still encountered the Mission decided to abort the project, effective 1/92.  It appears that Congressional concern was triggered by a newspaper article about the Mission's alleged offer of aid to an Afghan leader reputed to control opium production in the upper Helmand valley. As a result of these problems, the project made only very limited progress.  Some of its narcotics awareness activities may have minimal lasting effects.  The project hosted 6 community awareness seminars, produced over 2,000 posters, 12 pamphlets, 2 radio broadcasts, and a video, and commissioned 2 anti-drug songs by popular singers.  The project also developed a prototype video, which targeted women in purdah who could not be reached through public seminars, and contributed to library acquisitions of narcotics awareness materials. Under the Information and Research Component, the project developed (and began testing in Afghan refugee camps) a KAP survey regarding poppy production and heroin use; collected data on poppy producing areas in Afghanistan; and collected and analyzed farming data on 5 key crops and poppy.  Some of these data were used as reference materials for two later, comprehensive studies of opium in Afghanistan. The following lessons were learned.  (1) Because of the close Congressional oversight of A.I.D.'s operations, the divergent views of various members of Congress may make it virtually impossible to reach a consensus on A.I.D.'s role in the anti-narcotics field, particularly in a region as sensitive as Afghanistan.  In the future, full Congressional and A.I.D. approval should be secured before any contractual commitments are made for TA, and certainly before contractor or grantee field mobilization.  (2) Guidelines on compliance with Section 487 of the Foreign Assistance Act (which prohibits the provision of assistance to anyone involved in narcotics-related crime) are ambiguous; this contributed significantly to the discomfort of Congress and A.I.D./W with the project.  (3) When undertaking anti-narcotics activities, A.I.D. should closely coordinate with the Bureau of International Narcotics Matters/Narcotics Affairs Section of the Department of State and the Drug Enforcement Agency, since enforcement is a key component of any anti-narcotic initiative.  (4) The Koran, which proscribes drug use, can be an important tool in the fight against drugs in Muslim Afghanistan.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","5/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Narcotics|Public awareness|Internal conflict|Kidnapping|Security|Poppies|Crop eradication programs","Afghanistan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABJ205.pdf","483 KB","008505 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (12/91-7/94) of a project to support training programs to address development and war rehabilitation needs in Afghanistan. The project was drastically downsized due to budget constraints. What had been envisioned as a broad-based human resources development project was reduced to the management of 3 existing training programs by the Academy for Educational Development (AED) -- the Basic Trade Skills Program (BTS), Construction Related Training for Afghanistan (CRTA), and the Participant Training Program. The BTS Program, which was transferred from the University of Nebraska at Omaha (UNO) to AED in Fall 1992, completed 3 training cycles, produced 1,320 graduates, and improved the trainee completion rate from 70% to 75%, possibly because of shorter training courses and because fewer refugee families were leaving Pakistan. The CRTA program was subsumed under the project in 4/93, with the International Rescue Committee (IRC) continuing as the direct implementing agency under a subcontract with AED.  Under CRTA, the Construction Engineering Program graduated 44 students with the equivalent of a university-level civil engineering degree; a follow-up study of 24 students found that 22 had gained employment in the construction field.  Ten new research laboratories were developed for program students and faculty. Under the CRTA Construction Supervision Program, 205 students completed the 9-month Construction Supervisor Course (as of 4/93 88% of these had found employment), and 93 students completed the Assistance Engineer Course (as of 4/93, 65% of these had found employment). Finally, the CRTA Refresher and Professional Development Program updated the technical knowledge of 211 engineers. However, budget constraints led to this program's termination in Fall 1992. The Participant Training Program, also transferred from UNO to AED, accepted no new trainees, and was only responsible for monitoring 39 scholars already in training in the United States. A.I.D. should have carefully explored the option of continuing the three programs under their original implementing agencies before deciding to restructure the project under AED.  For example, the CRTA Program continued to be implemented by IRC, but with additional overhead and an additional administrative layer; and the transfer of the BTS program between contractors was neither easy nor noticeably beneficial. Further, all three programs experienced setbacks when transferred from an experienced contractor to one with little cultural experience of or expertise in Afghanistan.  Most notably, the return rate of participants from the Participant Training Program decreased from 85% to 21% when AED took over the activity from UNO.  AED reported that scholars were dissuaded by their families in Peshawar from returning to an unstable political environment and certain unemployment.  However, conditions to which scholars were returning were scarcely less difficult when the return rate was higher under UNO.  The decrease might be explained by UNO's strong links to the Afghan community in the United States and in Pakistan and its strong Afghan staff, which was able to influence the scholars to honor their commitment.  AED had minimal to no contacts within the Afghan community. The CRTA Construction Engineering and Supervision Programs will be sustained because their quality, integrity, and Afghan staff have earned the support of other donors, increasing the potential that these programs will be successfully transferred back to the Faculty of Engineering, University of Kabul, once Afghanistan stabilizes.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","6/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Personnel development|Participants|Technical training|Vocational training|Higher education|War recovery|Engineering education|Contractors|Career development","Afghanistan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABJ206.pdf","881 KB","008505 - USAID.

"PACR of a Commodity Import Program (CIP -- 1982-92) to provide balance of payment support for Pakistan's agricultural sector, while promoting policy dialogue. The CIP was a success.  Its first component provided imported equipment and machinery to 6 USAID projects.  (1) A total of $12.9 million worth of equipment enhanced the ability of target organizations of the Irrigation System Management Project.  The equipment provided valuable, timely assistance during the heavy floods of 1990 and 1992 and helped in restoring extensively damaged irrigation infrastructure.  (2) The $1.5 million in farm equipment provided to the Forestry Planning and Development Project strengthened the capacity of forest agencies to carry out their activities extensively and efficiently.  (3) For the Transformation and Integration of the Provincial Agricultural Network Project, the CIP financed $3.2 million in research and instructional equipment for the agricultural university in the Northwest Frontier Province.  The upgrading of laboratories has improved the standard of research both on campus and at 13 provincial research stations.  CIP equipment has also been useful in agricultural demonstrations and outreach efforts.  (4) The Management of Agricultural Research and Technology Project received $5.7 million worth of research, educational, and computer equipment.  Improved research facilities resulted in the development of several crop varieties, improved breeds of animals, and products to boost agricultural production.  The private sector is marketing 14 products developed by the National Agricultural Center, a CIP recipient, and CIP-financed computers were used to automate 17 agricultural libraries.  (5) The CIP financed $4.2 million in construction and engineering equipment for the Balochistan Area Development Project.  Benefits have included construction of the Ketch River Bridge, improvement and maintenance of 1,575 km of road, and construction of 59 drainage structures.  (6) For the Food Security Management project, CIP financing of 52 computers greatly improved the research and training capability of the Ministry of Food and Agriculture and the Pakistan Institute of Statistical Training and Research.  The CIP also financed $9 million in equipment and commodities for public entities, including the Federal Bureau of Statistics, the agricultural universities of Faisalabad and Tando Jam, the Pakistan Agricultural Research Council, and the Center for Advanced Molecular Biology. Pesticides and equipment for locust control were also procured. In the commodities component, fertilizer imports of 695,000 MTs of DAP and 10.4 MTs of TSP have boosted wheat production and generated significant local currency proceeds which have been used to finance development activities in agriculture, social sectors, water, and power. In addition, 1.225 million MTs of wheat were imported at a cost of $232.4 million, the sale of which has generated Rs. 1.3 billion in budgetary support for Government of Pakistan (GOP) development plans. In response to a severe shortfall in cotton production, 56,600 bales of cotton were also imported; sales proceeds were used on development activities. Private sector imports of $67.1 million worth of harvesters, juice concentrate equipment, generators for textiles, vegetable seeds, and organic fertilizer plants, and other commodities helped to alleviate foreign exchange problems facing the agribusiness sector. Studies were carried out on fertilizer policy, the edible oilseed industry, agricultural mechanization, privatization of fertilizer marketing, and agricultural policy.  As a result of policy dialogue based on these and other studies:  (1) the distribution share of the imported fertilizers was increased from 34% to 60% over a period of 3 years; (2) allowable marketing costs for imported fertilizers were made uniform for public and private sector distributors; (3) the private sector is allowed to obtain deliveries of imported fertilizers directly from the importing agency; and (4) the GOP agreed to take into account the requirements of the private sector distributors before finalizing its procurement plans. Lesson learned are as follows.  (1) Projects focused on policy changes generally take longer to mature and achieve results.  (2) Project design should permit flexibility to divert resources to meet unexpected demand.  (3) Early agreement on the specification of CIP commodities (in the present case, DAP fertilizer) is necessary when USAID has its own standards.  USAID should be willing to accommodate changes on technical grounds, but all issues should be settled at the design stage.  (4) Procurement of equipment is a long process.  On the one hand, the objective of rapid disbursements for balance of payment support can be better achieved through procurement of commodities.  On the other, the long-run development effects of machinery and equipment cannot be ignored.  Perhaps it is best to procure equipment under individual projects.  (5) Effective implementation of a CIP for the private sector requires knowledge of development, international banking, alternative competitive foreign exchange resources, the competitiveness of U.S. products, domestic markets, and USAID's CIP regulations.  (6) The success of the CIP in linking fertilizer imports with fertilizer policy reform shows that, to the extent possible, policy reforms should be in the same area where assistance is provided.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","4/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Commodity import programs|Agricultural policy|Agricultural equipment|Agricultural inputs|Private sector|Policy analysis|Policy reform","Pakistan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABJ207.pdf","458 KB","008588 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (6/89-3/94) to upgrade the teaching and research capabilities of selected departments of Pakistani universities and institutions in areas of science and technology. Originally intended as a 10-year, 2-phase effort, the project was curtailed in 1991 following termination of aid to Pakistan.  The planned Phase II was eliminated, and efforts for the remainder of Phase I focused on collaborative applied research projects between Pakistani industries and the six department/centers that had already been selected to participate in the project:  (1) National Center of Excellence in Geology, University of Peshawar; (2) HEJ Institute of Chemistry, University of Karachi; (3) Center for Advanced Molecular Biology, University of Punjab; (4) Department of Biological Sciences, Quaid-i-Azam University; (5) Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Engineering and Technology; and (6) Department of Chemistry, Gomal University. Beginning in May and June, 1992, a total of 16 projects between these 6 centers and 14 cooperating industrial companies, all but 2 of them in the private sector, were initiated at a cost of slightly more than $1.1 million.  The projects included, inter alia:  identification and characterization of silica sand for glassmaking; bating enzymes from animal sources; microbial control of insect pests in cotton; uninterrupted power supply; commercial exploitation of taxol anti-cancer drug; and medicinal plants for antidiabetic activity. These efforts, which involved 26 faculty members as well as a number of research associates and graduate students, proved successful.  Of the 13 completed projects, 7-9 led to marketable products.  In addition, a systematic procedure for cooperative applied research between industry and university researchers has been tested via the project and an manual which summarizes the system and process has been given wide distribution. The project was given strong endorsement by industrial participants, and steps are being taken by the Ministry of Education, the Federation of Chambers of Commerce and Industry, and the University Grants Commission to sustain and enlarge cooperative research activities. There is a critical need for follow-up by USAID to provide advice based on its experience with this project. Lessons learned are as follows.  (1) Defined and required output, not funding input, should be the basis for developing Pakistani higher education institutions.  Specific objectives need to be identified at the earliest stages of the project.  (2) Selection of participating departments and centers should depend on two criteria:  relevance of a unit's area of expertise to technological economic goals, and a demonstrated effort towards achieving professional excellence. Possession of entrepreneurial qualities by the university departments proved necessary to project success.  (3) Competition for support should be an integral part of projects to strengthen educational institutions. (4) Changes in incentives, promotion criteria, and financial and research management must accompany efforts in any departmental development project.  In this project, serious delays were encountered due to university policies and procedures. Structured arrangements for cooperative efforts between educational and other research institutions are also essential.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","6/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Technical cooperation|Scientific cooperation|Institution building|Universities and colleges|Technological innovations|Applied research|Research collaboration|Industrial research","Pakistan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABJ208.pdf","831 KB","008588 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (8/86-12/93) to develop an integrated, national-level agricultural policy analysis and planning system in Sri Lanka.  The project was implemented by the Ministry of Agricultural Development and Research with TA from Abt Associates through a host country contract. The project's greatest asset was timing; as it progressed, the policy environment in Sri Lanka brightened and the Government of Sri Lanka (GSL) accelerated the pace of reform in the early 1990's, enabling the project to take a more active role in economic reform than had been planned.  The long-term advisor was able to present sound, prioritized policy alternatives on short notice to GSL decisionmakers. Training and commodity procurement supported the project's institution-building and policy analysis objectives, although the procurement component experienced delays related to A.I.D. regulations. The project supported long-term, academic training for 37 M.Sc.s or Ph.D.s, over 75 short-term and diploma courses, and numerous study tours; this part of the project was felt by many to be the most important, although A.I.D. requirements for English-language testing slowed implementation.  The project funded extensive computer installation and training, which improved the manner in which GSL policy and planning units operate. The main project output changed from production of a National Agricultural Growth and Restructuring Strategy to the formulation of Provincial Agricultural Development Strategies.  This may appear to have narrowed the scope, but in reality made all the difference between a document to be shelved and a document to be carried to full implementation, because the Provincial Strategies have been incorporated into the GSL's annual Public Investment Program, whereas implementation of a national strategy would depend on the resolution of political issues. Chances for sustainability appear to be strong:  planning units are functioning as integral parts of each participating ministry, the GSL budget supports these units, project-funded commodities are being used appropriately, and, perhaps, most importantly, a network of well-trained and motivated technical officers and policy analysts are situated in key ministries.  In addition, eight provincial development strategies are complete, and background analysis is complete for a national strategy to be finalized in early 1995.  Twenty major policy and institutional reforms have been implemented with project support and several more are still underway or under consideration. The following lessons were learned.  (1) Projects to develop planning systems must include all agencies involved in the system.  All these agencies must be given enough support to attract them to the system, but they do not all need to be given equal amounts of support.  (2) Policy analysis with on the job training in mind means a slower pace, as most of the responsibility is placed on the planning staff of the participating agencies.  A compromise on technical rigor has to be accepted with the understanding that this is a small price to pay for ensuring sustainability of the analytic effort.  (3) TA is a highly personalized activity and is most effective when providers are competent within their discipline and have country experience and cultural sensitivity.  (4) Host country contracts create administrative headaches and are no longer encouraged by the Agency, but they can provide the basis for relationships that are programmatically effective.  (5) Agricultural and rural sector projects should be considered within the context of the broad political economy, not in economic isolation.  (6) Policy reforms will take place when governments perceive them as being in their own interests; donors must be prepared, administratively and conceptually, to respond quickly.  (7) It is usually impossible to pinpoint the genesis of policy change and assign credit to any one donor.  (8) Despite its management-intensive nature, training is an important investment in long-term, sustainable policy and development change, and one that the United States does well.  Because of the increasing complexity of A.I.D. and USG regulations, project modifications, training, and commodity procurement are becoming more and more difficult to implement. At the time of PACR preparation, the Mission was still considering how to best structure and fund a policy analysis activity to build on the success of this project. A lessons learned report by the long-term Abt Associates advisor is appended.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","7/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","National level|Agricultural policy|Policy making|Strategic planning|Institution building|Policy reform|Beneficiary count","Sri Lanka","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABJ358.pdf","3,451 KB","008606 - USAID.

"Interim evaluation of a twinning project to match Thai and U.S. cities to help the Thai cities to solve problems involving environmental infrastructure.  The project, which is implemented through a cooperative agreement with the World Environmental Center (WEC) finances visits by Thai municipal planners to their U.S. twin cities and return visits by U.S. municipal development expert.  The evaluation covers the first year of activities. The project is achieving its aims.  Five Thai cities and one municipal water authority have been matched with comparable-size jurisdictions in the United States:  Samut Prakarn with Corpus Christi; Chiang Mai with Knoxville; Pattaya with Savannah; Nakorn Sawan with Louisville; Songkhla with Orlando; and the Bangkok Metropolitan Waterworks Authority (MWA) with Oakland's East Bay Municipal Utility Division (EBMUD).  The arrangement between Pattaya and Savannah was found to be inappropriate and was canceled; the other relationships are in various stages.  Among the criteria applied in selecting Thai cities was whether actual projects that could use TA from a U.S. city or that could potentially be financed in part by loans under the Urban Environmental Infrastructure Support Project's Guaranty Facility were in the design stage. city's progressive thinking and willingness to give priority to environmental problems. Projects currently being assisted or considered include design of a sanitary landfill, a water treatment plant, and a wastewater treatment system; a feasibility study for a constructed wetland; internships; creation of a solid waste management consortium; and training in Geographic Information System (GIS) applications. The twinning program has proven to be a relatively inexpensive way of providing TA.  A traditional 1-person, 2-week consultancy costs about $15,000, while the average cost of a 6-person team under the twinning exchange was around $26,000.  Ideally, after assistance has been given in one area, the Thai city will take the initiative to continue the relationship and pursue assistance in other areas.  In this regard, several activities, including information exchange, participation in workshops, and new connections between universities, have occurred. The effects of these efforts has been positive.  The project has: raised the profile of environmental infrastructure needs in Thailand and has introduced Thai municipal officials to a range of environmental technologies; acquainted Thai officials with U.S. practices; introduced the U.S. private sector to potential projects in Thailand (the Chiang Mai project and the Songkhla wetlands proposal); familiarized RHUDO/Bangkok with municipal counterparts in Thailand; and shown U.S. municipal officials the Thailand's need for their assistance. Relationships other than city to city, similar to the MWA-EBMUD twinning, should also continue to be considered.  Teams from both sides should be composed of individuals that can ""make a difference"" and establish a lasting relationship; the Thai teams should include a technical person, one elected official with the power to make or influence decisions, and the City Manager.  All the U.S. teams have included private sector representatives; the program could lead to further opportunities for the U.S. private sector to bid on Thai infrastructure projects.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","9/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Urban development|Municipal level|Public services|Public works|Environmental management|Technical assistance|Cities and towns","Thailand","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABJ364.pdf","569 KB","004966 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to provide TA in privatization to USAID's client governments.  Mid-term evaluation covers 5/91-12/93. The project has contributed significantly to restructuring efforts in many countries; its level of activity far exceeds that of its predecessor (Center for Privatization project) as well as that foreseen for this project.  USAID and the prime contractor, the Price Waterhouse International Privatization Group (PW/IPG), have shown great flexibility in adapting to changing needs; this has been of particular value in the face of the post-1989 opportunities for privatization arising in Eastern Europe, which led PW/IPG to shift from research and information dissemination towards the development of instruments and methods and from pre-privatization activities towards transactions. PW/IPG's highly qualified staff have delivered TA effectively and helped to bring about important innovations.  In Poland, for example, PW/IPG was a leader in testing sectoral approaches to privatization; in Russia, it was at the forefront in implementing voucher auctions; in Nicaragua, it was the principal source of TA for a successful privatization program; in Morocco, it provided sustained analytic services that kept the privatization program alive when government interest flagged; in the Philippines, Bolivia, and Morocco, it initiated new thinking on private provision of public services. Although changing priorities negated the project's original emphasis on research, PW/IPG recently undertook a series of studies of experiences with mass privatization, pension fund privatization, industrial sector analysis, and hotel privatization in the Caribbean. It has also expanded its privatization databases and publications distribution to meet the objective to gather and disseminate lessons learned. Not all objectives have been achieved, however.  PW/IPG has not been effective in capacity building; its consultants have tended to work by themselves, apart from local counterparts.  In addition, relations between PW/IPG and subcontractors have been uneven; subcontractors have complained of insufficient work assignments, lack of information flow, and a lack of team-building by PW/IPG.  Also, while PW/IPG's relationship to USAID/W and Missions has generally been cooperative (buy-ins have abounded), several Missions have registered dissatisfaction and even specific complaints, such as being ignored by the consultants. Lessons learned are as follows.  (1) Due to the length and difficulty of privatization transactions (only 25-30 have been effected with project help) and the numerous problems that arise after divestiture, more emphasis should be put on pre- and post-privatization activities. (2) More policy research is needed to bolster intellectual commitment to privatization.  (3) Since alternative sources of information about privatization have expanded, some information dissemination activities should be dropped.  (4) Capacity building tends to be neglected unless it is given explicit priority.  (5) Upfront costs of preparing public enterprises for sale often seem excessive; more cost-effective approaches should be explored.  (6) Financial considerations sometimes seem to dominate pre-sale analyses; more attention should be given to economic analysis.  (7) There is unexploited scope for nondivestiture initiatives, among them private provision of public services.  (8) The sectoral approach has not proven cost-effective in transitional economies; its use should be reviewed.  (9) More attention -- and budget support -- should be given to USAID/W monitoring. The report includes country studies of project efforts in Bolivia, Burundi, Ecuador, The Gambia, Indonesia, Morocco, Nicaragua, Philippines, Poland, and Zambia.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","AEP-0085-I-00-3002-00","","9/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Privatization|Technical assistance|Privatization techniques|Divestiture|Public enterprises|Economic reform","Bolivia|Burundi|Ecuador|Gambia|Indonesia|Morocco|Nicaragua|Philippines|Poland|Zambia|Caribbean","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABJ368.pdf","6,821 KB","006727 - Development Alternatives, Inc.

"Mid-term evaluation of a project to promote forestry and agroforestry in the Area of Conservation for the Cordillera Volcanic Central (ACCVC) in Costa Rica.  The project has been implemented by the Foundation for the Development of the Central Volcanic Cordillera (FUNDECOR).  The evaluation covers the period 6/91-10/94. The project has established FUNDECOR as a strong and respected institution.  FUNDECOR's performance has been impressive; despite major challenges, the Foundation has implemented innovative, professional, and cost-effective activities in the ACCVC. The project's most impressive achievement has been the promotion of sustainable management of a large amount of the country's natural forest through the preparation of logging guidelines, streamlining of forest management plans, and the sale of timber through an innovative auction system.  In addition, the project has improved national park management through the improvement of visitor facilities and services.  Parks are now moving toward self-financing, a rare achievement, through a system of user fees and concessions for park facilities and services.  The project is also developing a native species planting program, providing technical and financial support to fledgling nursery businesses, and has been highly successful in organizing landowners and other residents to develop the native species reforestation program, although a systematic program activity is needed to facilitate broader conservation and improved land use practices. FUNDECOR's excellent performance is attributed to a well-trained and highly qualified staff, and a high level of executive leadership, which resonates throughout the organization.  The new Costa Rican government is already learning much from FUNDECOR as it pursues its aggressive pro-conservation agenda. Additionally, FUNDECOR has brought outstanding creativity to the task of linking conservation and development, particularly in the areas of project design and problem solving.  In fact, the methods FUNDECOR has used to manage natural forests for production are among the most innovative observed in tropical forestry, its methodology for defining ""critical ecological areas"" indicates its skill and intellectual rigor, and its ""Eco-Camps"" proposal, which will ensure that large forests remain intact and that local forest landowners will benefit, is an innovative form of ecotourism that has not been observed elsewhere. However, financially, FUNDECOR is still a somewhat fragile structure with limited time to strengthen itself; unfortunately, examples of successful institution-building projects of less than five years are rare.  If it is to survive, FUNDECOR must quickly take steps to generate a financial base beyond the endowment, which will establish an important core structure, but be insufficient to fulfill the project's objectives or to meet daunting challenges within the ACCVC.","Delivery order no. 12|Companion evaluation summary: PD-ABM-898|Spanish ed.: PD-ABN-178|Project title: Development strategies for fragile lands (DESFIL)","Special Evaluation","Documents","DHR-5438-Q-00-1091-00","","10/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Forestry|Agroforestry|Natural resource conservation|Natural resource management|Institution building|Sustainable agriculture","Costa Rica","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABJ393.pdf","8,381 KB","001335 - Chemonics International Consulting Div.","","008355 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to raise awareness of the relation between population growth and economic development and to increase commitment to family planning (FP) programs and policies in developing countries worldwide (RAPID IV project).  Mid-term evaluation covers the period 1991-10/94. Overall, achievements of the project, which has operated in 19 countries with 2 more soon to be added, have been impressive. The project has been effective in raising awareness among national leaders about the relationships between population growth and development, strengthening the commitment of national leaders and managers to implementing voluntary family planning programs and allocating resources to increase access to services, and developing a consensus for population policies at different management and technical levels of government and in the private sector.  Moreover, the project is substantially engaged in several other key policy issues, such as FP program decentralization, AIDS, program cost effectiveness, and placing FP service delivery in the context of reproductive health and child spacing. The project has been weaker in institutionalizing capability to conceive, plan, and implement population policy, focusing rather on training in the use of RAPID models and presentation techniques, though even here documentation of the training process, including needs assessments, curriculum development, and evaluation, has been weak. Additionally, the evaluation of the project in general has only recently been a focus. USAID Missions value the project very highly and indicate that the project is either extremely or very responsive to Mission needs, the project approach has been very appropriate, and project staff are very skilled.  Major recommendations are to transfer to host country counterparts the ability to develop and not merely to present RAPID models, increase emphasis on building host country institutional capability, establish an evaluation framework for the project, and form a technical advisory group.","Project title: Population technical assistance (POPTECH)|Project title: Demographic data initiatives","Special Evaluation","Documents","CCP-3024-C-00-3011-00","","10/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Population growth|Population planning|Population impact|Family planning policy|Population economics|Population policy|Family planning promotion programs","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABJ516.pdf","226 KB","008485 - Basic Health Management International (BHM)|006243 - Dual & Associates, Inc.","","008234 - USAID.

"Mid-term evaluation of the Options for Population Policy (OPTIONS) II project, a 5-year follow-on to the OPTIONS I project.  OPTIONS is being implemented by The Futures Group and four subcontractors: Population Reference Bureau, Urban Institute, Development Group, Inc., and Carolina Population Center.  Evaluation covers the period 9/90-9/94. The project has carried out activities in 21 countries and three regional areas (Central Asian Republics, the Near East, and the Sahel). The strong demand for the project's involvement is evident by the rate of expenditure and the level of buy-ins (75% above what was anticipated).  Both USAID Missions and local agencies in developing countries have given high marks to the caliber of OPTIONS staff, the quality of the project's technical analysis, the project's flexibility and responsiveness, and its collaborative style in working with local counterparts. OPTIONS has worked in five mandate areas:  (1) building consensus on national population and family planning issues; (2) strategic planning; (3) public sector resource commitment; (4) reforming laws and regulations; and (5) private sector resource commitment. The project's activities are concentrated in two of the five mandate areas -- building consensus and strategic planning -- although activities have been undertaken in all areas. In those countries where project efforts have been intensive and of relatively prolonged duration, there is good or promising evidence of impact.  In other cases, either because project activities are fairly recent or relatively modest efforts have been undertaken, impact cannot be assessed.  In several countries (Ghana, Guatemala, Indonesia, and Jamaica) there has been a combination of interventions, including those classified as planning, over an extended period of time that has led to apparent impact.  There are specific examples of positive effects on public sector budgeting and programs in Morocco, the Philippines, Guatemala, and Jamaica and of likely effect in Egypt.  Although OPTIONS' work in reforming laws and regulations has been carried out in few countries, the results in Egypt, Guatemala, and Senegal look very promising.  The project's work in stimulating private sector resource commitments has had positive impacts in India, Jamaica, and Peru.  In the area of consensus building, OPTIONS has contributed to policy development and implementation in many countries and in the Sahel region (by working with the Center for Applied Research on Population and Development) through assistance in formulating policies and laws, assistance in developing communication strategies and/or carrying out specific dissemination activities, observational travel, and assistance in preparing for the 1994 International Conference on Population and Development. In addition to these efforts, a number of USAID Missions cited specific examples of the important contribution OPTIONS has made to the critical thinking of USAID Mission staff, particularly in the areas of estimating the costs of family planning and strategic planning, as well as in the design of future population assistance (Egypt, Ghana, Guatemala, Jamaica, and Peru). Among the policy analysis tools that have been developed by OPTIONS is a series of five policy papers.  Four of these address project mandate areas and serve as a useful introduction to the particular topic.  While these papers have been in demand and generally well received, there is little evidence of their use in the field.  The work of OPTIONS on models has largely involved elaboration and application of existing models (e.g., target-cost, contraceptive market model, and QUIPUS). Commendably, project staff has used Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) data in numerous settings, although efforts to transfer data analysis skills to local counterparts, including the completion of a data analysis manual, have been has less extensive.  OPTIONS has conducted various regional and country-specific training activities. The country training was directed to use of the policy models and DHS data and desk-top publishing.  There is some evidence of the effectiveness of training in some policy models and in desk-top publishing. OPTIONS' work in the area of policy communication and information dissemination is related to consensus building activities.  The development of policy communication strategies as an integral part of OPTIONS' work has occurred in a few settings, and this more comprehensive approach appears to enhance the impact of the project's assistance.  OPTIONS has also sponsored numerous presentations to international leadership groups as well as to USAID Missions, the Office of Population, and other U.S. audiences. The computer-assisted presentations, a hallmark of The Futures Group, are widely considered a strength of both OPTIONS and the Resources for the Awareness of Population Impact on Development (RAPID) project. Long-term advisors have been placed by the project in four countries (Egypt, India, Niger, and Peru) and in all cases these advisors have received the enthusiastic support of the USAID Missions.  Two activities of the OPTIONS project, the policy files and the fellows program, which will be shifted to a different policy project in the Office of Population, are considered to have been useful components of the work scope. OPTIONS staff has addressed several policy issues, including sustainability and medical barriers, which are logical extensions of the project's ongoing work.  Given the particular relevance for USAID's population assistance of these two topics, OPTIONS' work is or will be making an important contribution.

"Evaluates project to provide logistics management assistance to family planning (FP) programs worldwide.  Interim evaluation covers the period 1990-9/94.  John Snow Inc. (JSI) is the principal contractor. The project has grown considerably since start-up and its activities have become increasingly diverse within the general scope of work. Committed to a service orientation and responsiveness to field needs, the project has operated successfully in a highly unstable environment, subject to changing USAID interests and priorities and the shifting landscapes of host countries.  Clients are generally satisfied with project services, and project staff constantly strive to deliver quality products and services.  The project engages in vigorous outreach to the donor and Cooperating Agency community, involving the community in many of its activities.  It has been less vigorous in outreach to the commercial private sector, generally limiting its efforts to tracking technologies that have little application in countries in which the project operates. At the management level, JSI's commitment to delegation, teamwork, and participatory management, a commitment embodied in eight permanent, cross-disciplinary Function Groups and ad hoc work teams, has generally served the project well, although there is no clear locus of quality or cost control and it remains unclear whether USAID's interests and priorities are reflected in Function Group decisions. JSI has provided virtually the full range of training and TA support services and has met or expects to meet major contract deliverables. Each county's assistance package is based on needs, the priority of the country as determined by JSI and USAID's Commodity and Logistics Management (CLM) Division, the nature of the request for services, and available resources. There is a strong emphasis on collaboration at the local level, both with recipient institutions and other Cooperating Agencies. The project regularly reviews its services and products, constantly upgrading them in the light of field experience. On the negative side, both CLM and JSI lack strategic focus on logistics assistance services, making it difficult to assess choices on resource allocation and to determine if project assistance is a cohesive whole which promises long-term benefit to the recipient country.  Also, both CLM and JSI tend to focus on quantitative outputs (e.g., number trained) rather than impact.  As a result, neither has any way of measuring the ultimate usefulness of project services.  Additionally, JSI does not avail itself of private sector, developing country commercial experience; only 3 of 52 local hires have this kind of experience, and there is no outreach to such individuals at the local level, even though knowledgeable input on how to estimate needs for, purchase, store, and deliver products effectively and efficiently under difficult circumstances would promote local sustainability. Recommendations are to:  expand the project's mandate to include other logistics-related assistance (such as facilities improvement and transportation infrastructure); introduce measures to assess impact and promote sustainability; allow the project more flexibility to work with integrated health deliver systems (where appropriate); and increase staff commercial expertise.

"Evaluates the first 5-year phase of a 10-year project to strengthen the managerial and institutional capabilities of family planning organizations in developing countries.  The evaluation covers the period 1990-1994. In general, the project has been very responsive to USAID Mission needs and requests.  In the few cases where it has not been seen as fully responsive -- Nigeria, REDSO/ESA, and Bangladesh -- problems arose from the Missions' misunderstanding of either the basic nature of the project, or of what it was technically and legally capable of doing. REDSO/ESA and Bangladesh are now very pleased with the project; the Nigeria case is complex and has yet to be resolved. Progress by the contractor, Management Sciences for Health (MSH), towards meeting contractual requirements is highly satisfactory. Thirty-seven subprojects have been developed in 16 countries, five of which have been completed; in addition, the project has worked with four regional organizations in Africa.  The project's flexible approach and high-quality TA and publications have won it wide appreciation and respect.  There is a growing recognition of the important of management interventions in improving FP services. In its early years the project developed a reputation as a ""troubled"" project.  The blame for this is shared between MSH and USAID.  On MSH's side, there have been uneven and somewhat disruptive leadership, staffing, and management patterns and practices.  On USAID's side, problems have stemmed from the contracting mechanism (i.e., a combination of a Core and a Requirements contract); from shifts in policy and monitoring approaches within the Office of Population; and from frequent changes in monitoring personnel, both in Washington and in the field.  However, the impact of these problems at the field level has been less than the impact in Boston and Washington.  That the project managed to accomplish as much as it has can be attributed to herculean efforts by MSH and the Office of Population to make the best of a sometimes uncomfortable situation. The project has also been impeded by its limited ability to choose or influence the selection of subprojects; a tendency toward micromanagement on the part of both USAID/W (largely the result of the contracting mechanism) and MSH (attributable to its highly centralized decision making structure); USAID's occasional use of the project to ""fill gaps"" rather than as a strategic tool; and the Gulf War and attendant disruptions on travel. In Phase II, the overall project goal and purpose should be preserved; however, certain strategies need revision. Specifically, the project should engage in more proactive selection of its client organizations, and focus more on building collaborative partnerships and empowering local TA capacity, as has been done in Bangladesh.  Also needed is a broadening of targeted levels and activities in client organizations to all levels of management and service delivery.  The reorientation must include strategic materials development and dissemination, and will require a modest but critical change in overall management style from a highly centralized one to an approach more supportive of distributed decisionmaking.","Project title: Population technical assistance (POPTECH)","Special Evaluation","Documents","CCP-3024-C-00-3011-00","","9/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Health care administration|Family planning services|Technical assistance|Management development","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABJ520.pdf","3,619 KB","008485 - Basic Health Management International (BHM)|006243 - Dual & Associates, Inc.","","008234 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of a project component (8/88-9/94) to help to develop Kenya's capital markets, in particular the Kenyan Capital Markets Authority (CMA) and the Nairobi Stock Exchange (NSE). Accomplishments have been remarkable given the project's relatively short life and the adverse economic, financial, and political context within which it has had to operate.  A reasonably well-formed and functioning, though embryonic, capital market is in place.  The CMA and NSE have essentially been built from the ground up and are firmly established; the CMA has developed and is enforcing rules and regulations governing capital markets and the NSE, and the NSE has demonstrated impressive growth in terms of outstanding shares, trading volume, and market index.  The Government of Kenya has lived up to its part by enacting the Securities Act and taking other steps to facilitate the expansion of capital markets.  The outlook for sustainable, steady growth in the Kenyan capital market is good. However, it would be prudent to think of the Kenyan capital market as still being in its infancy and in need of nurturing, rather than on the verge of joining strong emerging markets such as Thailand and Indonesia. A number of concerns remain, however.  (1) Capital markets revolve around three core institutions:  the regulatory authority, stock exchange, and clearing and settlement facility. While the first two have been addressed under the project, clearing and settlement seem to be the ""forgotten child.""  The CMA and USAID advisors need to turn their attention to development of a formal system for clearing, settlement, and registration.  (2) While the growth of the NSE has been promising, liquidity (an overall measure of trading activity) is still quite low. Stepped up efforts are needed to attract more listed companies to the market and to promote the stock exchange among investors.  (3) Political factors are a concern:  local political conflicts have the potential to spill over into and slow the capital markets development process; and the roles and responsibilities of the CMA vis-a-vis the NSE, and of these two newer institutions vis-a-vis existing government agencies, are still in flux, causing considerable organizational conflict.  The project can continue to assist the CMA and NSE by improving their organizational structures, the Securities Act and particular regulations, and market liquidity. The project has shown that (1) capital markets can be developed under adverse economic and political circumstances, and the process can be quite rapid, (2) even embryonic, relatively unstructured markets can play an effective role in mobilizing savings and allocating capital, (3) transfer of knowledge and expertise is feasible in the field of capital markets development, and (4) an effective capital markets assistance program does not have to be particularly expensive or comprehensive. The project has also confirmed a number of negative findings from other, similar efforts:  (1) establishing effective capital markets regulation and a culture of compliance can take quite a while, (2) during their emerging phase, capital markets are subject to local political conflicts which can slow progress or arrest it altogether, and (3) clearing and settlement is often the ""forgotten orphan"" in capital markets development programs.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","9/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Private sector|Capital markets|Market economy|Financial institutions|Institution building|Supervision|Stock exchanges|Regulatory reform|Political aspects|Securities|Economic legislation|Investment promotion","Kenya","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABJ521.pdf","3,132 KB","008122 - USAID.

"Evaluates USAID assistance to Ugandan children orphaned by war or the AIDS epidemic.  Mid-term evaluation covers the period 1989-3/94 and focuses on an umbrella grant to World Learning Inc. (WLI) and a grant to Save the Children Fund of the United Kingdom (SCF). WLI used the umbrella grant to provide subgrants to five Ugandan NGOs:  the Uganda Women's Effort to Save Orphans (UWESO), Nsambya Hospital's AIDS Widows and Orphans Family Support Program (AWOFS), the Lira District Development Agency (LIDDA), the Church of Uganda's Diocese of Northern Uganda (DNU), and the Uganda Community Based Association for Child Welfare (UCOBAC). LIDDA and DNU, working in northern Uganda, have paid school expenses for orphans, provided agricultural inputs to families caring for orphans, and facilitated AIDS awareness and legal training; DNU has also provided small grants to help HIV-positive parents to start small businesses.  DNU has done a good job of helping to get orphans into school, but urgently needs TA with income generation activities.  LIDDA is progressing well. AWOFS, which has raised 46% of its budget from non-A.I.D. sources, has provided families having at least 4 children, and in which one parent attends an AIDS clinic, with income-generating assistance, counseling, and vocational training for children; AWOFS would benefit from technical support. UWESO, through its wide-reaching network, has paid the primary school expenses of 1,100 children in 24 districts, and vocational training expenses of 152 adolescents in 15 districts.  It has also implemented a vocational program in fishing, which has been fairly expensive on a per capita basis. UCOBAC has extended 15 small grants to grassroots organizations for income generation and vocational training for orphans and the families caring for them.  The grants, which have leveraged significant community resources, are the best examples seen so far of strengthening communities' capacities to support children whose families cannot. Overall, WLI funding has been equally divided between the payment of school fees and income generation.  The evaluation team feels the emphasis should be on income-generation in order to build family and community capacity to pay for schooling and other basic needs.  It is also recommended that revolving credit schemes be introduced; vocational training stress areas most likely to lead to employment and provide tools or equipment needed by graduates; and AIDS and legal training components be expanded. WLI's grant management was facilitated by its use of the structure already in place for USAID's AIDS Prevention and Control Program.  WLI has effectively built subgrantees' financial management capacities; its weakness have included insufficient TA for income-generating activities, and poorly designed baseline surveys.  Also, the dual administrative structure inherent in the umbrella grant mechanism, though advantageous in this type of project, is expensive. SCF has supported 3 main interventions:  an exceptional program to resettle 1,418 children from residential institutions to families; establishment of an open and distance learning program, which has trained 220 personnel in over 40 children's homes; and increasing the capacity of the Ministry of Labor and Social Affair's department to protect vulnerable children.  Weaknesses include inadequate preparation and follow-up of both children and families in the resettlement program and, in the distance training component, high turnover among orphanage personnel and lack of a mechanism for ongoing training. The following lessons were learned.  (1) Given the growth of the AIDS epidemic, future efforts should focus on (a) strengthening the capacity of families to care for their children; (b) building community capacity to assist children whose families cannot meet their needs, including the development of child protection interventions; and (c) helping adolescent orphans to begin supporting themselves.  Child protection interventions and relief measures will also be needed.  (2) Income-generating initiatives must be economically sound.  (3) Where needs and expectations are high, NGOs should make communities aware from the outset that resources are limited and should request community input in selecting beneficiaries.  NGOs should also keep local government informed and involved.  (4) A network of NGOs linked with government child welfare authorities can be a powerful vehicle for supporting child advocacy and protection.  (5) The existence of cultural traditions for the care of orphaned children within the extended family does not ensure that children whose parents die will automatically receive adequate care.  (6) Government child welfare authorities, provided with TA, can improve the situation of vulnerable children.  (7) Laws and regulations governing children's institutions (including time limits for institutionalization) are critically important; regular compliance monitoring is essential.  (8) Resettling children from institutions into new families can work, but should be accompanied by documentation for tracing, pre-resettlement counseling, and follow-up.  (9) Distance learning for child care workers can be flexible and cost-effective, although participants need encouragement and support during their studies.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","DPE-5929-C-00-0049-00","","3/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Humanitarian assistance|War victims|HIV/AIDS|Children|Disadvantaged groups|Orphans|Youth|Private voluntary organizations|Indigenous private voluntary organizations","Uganda","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABJ522.pdf","3,508 KB","006404 - Atlantic Resources Corp.","","008291 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of a project (1986-94) to provide municipal management training in Cote d'Ivoire and other countries in West and Central Africa. The project clearly met its objectives.  All told, 54 training activities were conducted in 12 countries for 1,127 participants. The Training in Decentralization and Privatization component, which drew on the Government of Cote d'Ivoire's decentralization program and its pathbreaking municipal elections in 1980, 1985 and 1990, included regional and national conferences to discuss issues of decentralization and democratization; study tours around Cote d'Ivoire and elsewhere in West Africa to reinforce ideas presented at the national and regional conferences; and local activities.  The latter, especially local resource mobilization seminars, appear to have been the most successful portion of the project.  The substance of the training was clearly excellent, with a hands-on orientation in which actual procedures for collecting market taxes were discussed in detail. The broad-based participation of local elected and traditional authorities and business groups also played a role in the seminars' success. The objective to build a capacity for municipal management training in public and private training institutions was only partially met; it is a time-consuming and expensive task which seems best achieved through joint training exercises with other donor participation. The objective of meeting USAID Missions' training needs was met, as evidenced by cabled messages of satisfaction from Mali, Guinea, and Burkina Faso. The objective of preparing courses and manuals for municipal management was partially met.  Many of the subject areas listed in the Project Paper -- management of shelter, community facilities, and urban community development -- were beyond the means of a regional project with a minimal training budget. The project's effectiveness was hampered by several unforeseen events.  Political unrest in Guinea, Togo, and Niger curtailed otherwise promising activities in those countries.  The closing of the Regional Housing and Urban development Office for West and Central Africa (RHUDO) in Abidjan deprived the project of the extensive benefits of the close relationship between the contractor and RHUDO cited in the 1990 evaluation.  Even more, the sudden closing of the Mission in Cote d'Ivoire has affected the project, and will prevent the kind of direct follow-up activities envisioned in the original design.  This is particularly distressing since Cote d'Ivoire is widely acknowledged in the region as a leader in decentralization and democratization.  Thus, USAID has cut itself out of the very successful regional coordination and exchange mechanisms that it pioneered through this project. Lessons learned are as follows.  (1) The project's innovative development of an interconnected network of international, national and local experts to stimulate practical, hands-on discussion effectively promoted dialogue and exchange.  It is unlikely that the more theoretical training favored by other donors can achieve the same results.  (2) Decentralized municipal development is the ""cutting edge"" of democratization.  Failure to sustain municipal institutions poses the greatest threat to democratic gains.  (3) One of the most effective elements of the local seminars was the inclusion of participants from a variety of agencies and local organizations in an effort to build support for local leaders and for the idea that local projects must be financed through local taxes.  (4) The regional approach pioneered by this project appears to be an effective vehicle for innovative concepts that are not widely accepted or understood by more traditionally oriented Missions.  (5) Follow-up is key to the effectiveness of training.  Municipal officials should be provided TA in setting up the new procedures they learned about in training.","French ed.: PD-ABJ-526","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","PDC-1008-C-00-9091-00","","8/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Municipal level|Local level|Decentralization|Democratization|Regional development|Management training|National level|Public administration|Urban development|Urban planning","West Africa|Central Africa|Ivory Coast","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABJ525.pdf","1,365 KB","007625 - International City/County Management Association (ICMA)","","004517 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of a project to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of local government operations in the Cote d'Ivoire.  The Research Triangle Institute managed the project's management training component, while A.I.D. managed the revenue enhancement and facilities construction components.  Evaluation covers the period 9/90-12/94. Project results were generally positive; training activities and the revenue collection component, which improved property tax collection, were clearly successful A.I.D. investments.  The evaluation concludes the following.  (1) The project contributed importantly to development of a more democratic society through improved local government.  Those who have been involved with the Municipal Development Support Project, nationally, regionally, and locally, will approach their work more productively in the future.  (2)  The project reinforced the tie between sanitation and health and improved environmental quality, primarily through a more effective approach to garbage collection and treatment of medical waste.  (3)  The decision to terminate the bilateral assistance program with Cote d'Ivoire has eliminated the possibility of some of the follow-up activities envisioned in the original project design.  A.I.D. has lost its ability to monitor progress in decentralization and communal development at the local level, important because many other countries in the region have come to look at the achievements of the Cote d'Ivoire as a model for their own development strategies.  (4) A great deal of management time, both that of A.I.D. and the principal contractor, was devoted to resolving contracting and procurement problems.  Possibly, more direct involvement of A.I.D. contract experts in project design and contracting would have been productive.

"Evaluates project to increase private sector investment and employment in the large rural resettlement areas in the dry zone of Sri Lanka.  The project has been implemented by the Employment, Investment and Enterprise Development (EIED) Division of the Mahaweli Authority. Evaluation covers the period 1988-3/94. The project has found that opportunities to create employment and raise incomes lie much more in the areas of microenterprise and contract farming than in large agribusinesses.  In a stunning reversal of the project targets, only 15% of the jobs have been created by medium and large investments, while the remainder have been generated by microenterprises, small enterprises, and contract outgrower farmer arrangements. This reorientation has implications for sustainability.  The Project Paper predicted that private sector activity, especially with these large and active investors, would reach such a critical mass that further investment and economic development would be self-generating; the project considered its role to be one of start-up support  for large profitable enterprises. However, with most of the employment and income gains coming from large numbers of smaller enterprises, enterprises that typically start up and fail at a rate of 15%-20% per year, there is a continued need for services that support the start-up of new enterprises, and the growth of micro and small enterprises.  This need to institutionalize services for micro and small enterprise development was foreseen in the project design, but assumed to be at a much lower level than has evolved. Between now and the end of the project, activities should (1) support the continuing emergence and growth of rural micro and small enterprises; (2) develop a network of strong and effective rural credit institutions; and (3) establish a framework for linking Mahaweli smallholder farmers to outside investors and markets through contract farming or outgrower arrangements.  The task is largely an institutional development effort focused on sustaining the 12 Field Business Centers, the network of 66 Savings and Credit Societies, and some institutionalized capacity to facilitate outgrower arrangements.

"PACR of a project (8/84-8/93) to strengthen the capability of Sri Lanka's Department of Agriculture (DOA) to generate and transfer technologies and seed for small farm production of subsidiary food crop. The project has been effective and beneficial.  It has: increased the DOA's research capability through improved research planning, overseas training of 448 staff (65 long-term, 383 short-term), technical input to programs, and improved facilities and equipment; appreciably increased research trials on diversified crops; and assisted the DOA in adapting to a mass media strategy from the ineffective and costly field extension method.  In addition, project support for institutional and policy development facilitated a move from a fully public sector seed trade to private sector seed import and a growing local seed production industry and led to a complete restructuring of the DOA and the formation of a Horticultural Research Institute. Most importantly, though difficult to quantify, the project effected a widespread change in attitude and orientation of the agricultural establishment, leading to the acceptance of (1) a policy of food self-reliance rather than self-sufficiency, (2) the importance of the private sector, (3) the need for agricultural commercialization and diversification to increase incomes for the rural poor, and (4) the need for government research and technical services to be responsible to clients. The impact of agricultural research could potentially be substantial, although considerable time is required to disseminate and yield benefits.  Thus far, annual production of chilies and onions increased by 1,160 MT and 5,739 MT, respectively, between 1981 and 1992, for an annual net gain of US $4.5 million. The success of the project can be largely attributed to a shift in emphasis, beginning in 1990, from subsidiary food crops to high-value horticultural crops, from public sector control and import substitution goals to market and demand-driven priorities, and from food to farm incomes and employment -- all within a client-centered context.  These changes accompanied and reinforced a shift in government policies toward a market economy, private sector development, and export promotion. Thus, the project and the government made changes supported by the USAID Strategic Framework, which calls for expanding opportunities through a new private-public partnership and agriculturally led industrialization. Several of the project's design assumptions appear not to have held true:  (1) that emphasis on rice was preventing attention to other crops -- the DOA was able to continue an extensive rice program, while expanding work on other food crops and horticulture; (2) that lack of technology was the major factor inhibiting subsidiary food crops -- in fact, low profitability due to poor market organization was an equal constraint; (3) that the Training and visit (T&V) extension system would be adequate -- T&V was initially effective, but proved costly and unsustainable. The following lessons were taught.  (1) Flexibility is crucial -- the project evolved appropriately to align itself with changing host government policy and USAID ideology.  (2) Externally funded projects tend to help organizations set their own agenda without having to compete for scarce government funds.  Unless adequate emphasis is placed on the needs of ultimate clients, small farmer and commercial farmer projects may not address real needs.  (3) Very ambitious baseline surveys are overly complicated and time consuming, analysis comes late, and follow-up is not done; simpler periodic appraisals seem more useful.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","6/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Institution building|Government departments|Crop diversification|Agricultural research|Agricultural production|Beneficiary count","Sri Lanka","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABJ552.pdf","5,334 KB","008606 - USAID.

"Interest on the part of U.S. exporters, the Congress, and the Executive Branch in the use of capital assistance projects to promote both economic development and U.S. commercial interests has been growing.  This synthesis evaluation analyzes seven key questions to assess how and under what conditions capital projects can support both objectives, drawing on data from an examination of USAID capital projects experience along with that of U.S. exporters, the World Bank, and other donors, and from an in-depth case study of Egypt, the largest capital projects program in USAID's portfolio.  Key findings are as follows.  (1) Capital projects have rarely leveraged other donor or private investor participation in USAID projects.  (2) USAID capital projects have not been very successful in generating commercial follow-on sales for U.S. exporters.  (3) There are examples of well-designed capital projects, operating in a favorable policy environment, providing a good economic rate of return (ERR) -- but all too many have had low ERRs, due to developing country institutional and policy problems.  (4) Capital projects have definitely provided important benefits to developing countries' private sectors, and most have contributed to alleviating poverty or meeting basic needs of the poor.  (5) Sustainability of capital projects depends upon appropriate host country institutional reform.  (6) While the policy issues critical to the success of capital projects are well understood, it has proven difficult to use capital projects as a vehicle for policy reform.  (7) Commercial concerns have not adversely affected the development impacts of USAID projects, mainly because USAID has made sure that projects first and foremost address the developmental needs of recipient countries.  In general then, while capital projects are important for development, in most instances they have not helped to increase U.S. exports beyond what the projects need. However, it is unrealistic to expect aid programs to build markets in countries where economic policies restrict growth and the demand for imports; the best opportunities for U.S. exporters are in developing countries possessing a favorable policy environment and an expanding economy, such as Korea and Taiwan. For their part, U.S. exporters should focus on making sure that their products are competitive in their own right.","Cover date: September 1994|Cover title: Capital projects : a synthesis of findings","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","10/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Capital projects|Exports|Economic impact|Return on investments|Policy reform|Project sustainability|Economic policy","USA|Egypt","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAX294.pdf","47 KB","008058 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to strengthen the performance of Indonesian PVOs/NGOs in areas of direct concern to the USAID Mission. Mid-term evaluation covers the period 1991-94. In comparison to its predecessors, this project has put more emphasis on strengthening fewer PVOs/NGOs in fewer, more carefully selected program areas.  The project has awarded 41 grants to 13 U.S. and 12 Indonesian NGOs/PVOs in Mission priority areas such as democratic pluralism/community participation, environment, HIV/AIDS prevention, advocacy, maternal and child survival, and urban informal sector/micro-enterprises.  However, while there has been success in reducing the total number of grant transactions to about 10 a year, there has been less success in shifting to the more focused approach envisaged in the original design.  Nor has the use of umbrella grants significantly reduced the Mission's management burden. Specific problems have included, inter alia:  a poorly designed logframe which has negatively affected subproject design, implementation, and monitoring; an overly complex management information system; failure to include specific institutional strengthening objectives in subproject designs; insufficient staff training; and inadequate dialogue between USAID/I and Indonesia's PVO/NGO community. Also, earlier grants directed a large proportion of resources to sectoral rather than institutional development activities. Despite these problems, progress is being made.  The project has already helped grantees and sub-grantees to:  implement strategic planning for the first time; restructure staff to achieve more effective and efficient operations; initiate and revise internal policy/reporting and control systems; increase the proportion of internally generated funds; and upgrade staff skills in general and in financial management. In addition, project management and the Mission's newly formed Office of Community and Civic Participation (OC2P), which took over the project in 1993, have recently introduced a number of management changes and new initiatives, including:  (1) matching the logframe to standardized reporting forms; (2) increased attention to gender sensitivity and Women In Development issues in grant selection; (3) increased decentralization of authority to project officers; (4) correction of the imbalance of project funds allocated to Indonesian NGOs/PVOs; (5) an increase in the number of advocacy and democracy projects; and (6) research to identify more NGOs/PVOs active in advocacy and democracy. As a non-bilaterally funded project, delivering assistance through PVOs/NGOs, the project is uniquely poised to help the Mission achieve its strategic objectives by the year 2000.  The principal recommendation is that it be extended to that year at the current level of financial assistance.","Companion evaluation summary: PD-ABK-847|Delivery order no. 15","Special Evaluation","Documents","AEP-0085-I-00-3001-00","","7/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Institution building|Private voluntary organizations|Indigenous private voluntary organizations|Development projects","Indonesia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABJ690.pdf","4,701 KB","003970 - Management Systems International, Inc.

"Mid-term evaluation of a project to develop improved quality assurance (QA) programs for child survival services.  The evaluation covers a period ending 6/94. As originally conceived, the project emphasized research aimed at adapting QA and total quality management (TQM) methods to developing country settings.  As the project evolved, however, implementation of QA became the major activities. Five long-term institution building projects were carried out, including national efforts in Chile, Nigeria, and Jordan and pilot efforts in Niger (a single district) and Egypt (a single hospital).  In general, these projects -- which have adopted a more participatory, ""bottom up"" approach than is customary in the standard TQM and PRICOR ""systems analysis"" approaches -- have been dramatically successful in implanting QA approaches into the thinking of health systems managers. Less positively, however, nongovernment health services and facilities have been largely ignored (except in Niger), and more work is needed in such areas as establishing linkages with donor agencies. Nine short- and medium-term TA activities were undertaken:  (1) in Guatemala, work with 5 hospitals on issues of client satisfaction and cost effectiveness; (2) in Costa Rica, a national QA course in preparation for a national program; (3) in Guatemala, Ecuador, and El Salvador, development of QA activities in relationship to cholera control; (4) in Malawi, work to improve the quality of child survival activities being carried out by community health workers; (6) in Burkina Faso, Kenya, and Niger, collaboration with two other USAID central projects in improving measles control; (7) in the Philippines, improving child weighing in collaboration with vitamin A work; (8) in Egypt, improving micronutrient related activities; and (9) in the Philippines, improving TB treatment compliance.  While these activities were generally effective and useful (except for the measles control effort in Niger, where lack of coordination interfered with effectiveness), there is some concern that project resources might be better applied to more extensive QA efforts. There are numerous examples of QA activities generating concrete improvements in service quality, including:  (1) an increase from 9% to 100% of case records showing correct assessment of respiratory rates in acute respiratory patients in Chile; (2) a reduction from 25% to 11% of the rate of infection following Caesarean sections in a Guatemalan hospital; (3) improvement in the stocking of operating room supplies in a hospital in Egypt; (4) a reduction in waiting lines and a concomitant increase in fee revenue in a hospital in Egypt. Training has been a core element in almost all activities and a key to success.  Visits by project staff as a routine follow-up to initial workshop training have also been critical to success, and should be given greater emphasis.  In addition, given that training curricula and materials require extensive local adaptation to be effective, the project should shift curriculum adaptation largely to the field where collaboration with local staff can be maximized.  Other training efforts included a course at Johns Hopkins University (JHU) and development by JHU and the Academy for Educational Development of an interpersonal communication course in Honduras and two computer-assisted training packages. While no longer the focus of the project, methodology development is still an important and appropriate component, especially since the project's TQM approach is substantially different than the systems analysis approach of its predecessors.  Activities in this category have included the preparation of seven monographs or manuals and nine field studies.  The publications have been of mixed quality; some are quite good, but as a group they seem to address different audiences and would benefit from greater systemization.  The studies which were chosen covered appropriate topics, but health economics issues might have received greater emphasis.  Tension between implementation of QA versus the research agenda, with its additional demands, has interfered with research. For the remainder of the project, documentation of the project's activities, dissemination of results and syntheses, and activities to market the project and its successes to donor organizations and country officials should receive greater attention.","Project title: Health technical services (HTS)","Special Evaluation","Documents","HRN-5974-C-00-3001-00|HRN-C-00-93-00001-00","","8/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Health research|Applied research|Primary health care|Child survival activities|Quality control|Operations research|Health care administration|Child health care","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABJ702.pdf","4,839 KB","003366 - TvT Associates|000981 - Pragma Corp.","","008291 - USAID.

"Lessons learned from a project to support agricultural policy reform in Africa are synthesized in this study.  A review of project efforts in Cameroon, Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, Madagascar, Mali, Malawi, and Zambia resulted in lessons under four headings. Analysis, Strategy, and Tactics.  (1) While economic analysis is the basis for the design of agricultural marketing reforms, political analysis is crucial to assessing the prospects of reform success and developing appropriate implementation strategies. (2) Seizing political opportunity can be crucial to the successful initiation of reforms.  (3) Risks of failure are heightened when policy reform results in the displacement of entrenched political patronage systems and the suppression of politically driven rents.  (4) ""Sweeteners"" -- strategies designed to defuse or co-opt opposition through compensation -- raise the cost, but lower the political risk of reform failure. Initiation.  (1) Political leaders' control over bureaucratic appointments and government structures gives them enormous power to mobilize elite support behind reform and to distance reform opponents. (2) It is essential that donors build consensus among themselves before negotiating with the host government.  (3) Foreign technical advisors play an important role in identifying and establishing support for host country policy champions. (4) Close donor contact with host country technocrats leads to more successful implementation. Implementation.  (1) Policymakers' lack of understanding of market reform and weak intellectual commitment to liberalization inhibits implementation.  (2) Reform is most likely to succeed when implemented by a strong and committed central authority. (3) Donor conditionality is an imperfect tool in reform implementation.  (4) Complementary public policies that strengthen the environment in which rural markets operate improve implementation capacity.  (5) Contingency planning should be a key element of implementation strategy. Sustaining Reform.  (1) It is not sufficient to assume that political support will coalesce among the beneficiaries of reform.  Policymakers and political leaders must work to mobilize stakeholders to promote and defend the reform process.  (2) Donor commitment to supporting reform should extend to the medium term.

"Evaluates USAID/Cameroon's health and population program for the period 1987-3/94 in light of the planned termination of USAID bilateral assistance. Remarkable progress has been made in developing innovative approaches in health and population development, especially given Cameroon's declining economic situation.  USAID's key accomplishment was to help the Ministry of Public Health (MOPH) to shift from selective primary care to a new strategy, entitled Reorientation of Primary Health Care (RPHC), emphasizing decentralized planning and community co-management and co-financing.  By 1990, USAID began to reformulate all of its health projects in line with RPHC and its integrated, systems development approach.  Projects like Maternal Child Health/Child Survival (MCH/CS) I and II and Reform of Health Delivery System also helped to provide a policy framework for RPHC. USAID projects following the RPHC strategy supported: cost-effective delivery of immunizations and other child survival interventions; rapid expansion of access to family planning and other key services; a model for integrating public and private health care; and mechanisms for financing the recurrent costs of non-salaried health services and for addressing longstanding problems such as the funding of control measures in the early phases of epidemics.  These projects also:  (1) developed high-quality training materials, adopted by other donors, for RPHC; (2) further developed important aspects of RPHC (e.g., delimitation of health areas, provincial health management information systems [MISs], and a model for health supervision); (3) integrated onchocerciasis and schistosomiasis control programs into PHC; (4) developed a provincial medical supply system; (5) decentralized medical supply logistics, health information, health care budgeting, and training to the provincial level, and deconcentrated supervision to the health district level; (6) established functioning community co-managed and co-financed health centers providing basic health services, and achieved the coverage objective of 30%; and (7) helped to establish a pilot health district in Meiganga. The capstone of USAID's health and population portfolio was the MCH/CS II project (also known as SESA II), begun in 1992. Unfortunately, this project will be discontinued with the close of the Mission. Implementation of SESA II through USAID or other donor support in the future would permit achievement of an integrated, sustainable health system for Cameroon before the year 2000. The following lessons were learned.  (1) The integrated health systems approach had a much greater, wider, and more permanent impact than a selective approach would have had.  It also facilitated donor coordination.  (2) Even with a clear national policy for RPHC, there is a continuing need to market the concept of integrated health systems to donor/partner agencies.  (3) Decentralization should begin at a level of the health system that has the capacity to plan, manage, and supervise the functions to be decentralized.  (4) A lack of functional health districts to serve as replicable models can constrain decentralization. (5) The potential of NGOs to manage district referral hospitals and district health services should be actively explored.  (6) Vertical national health intervention programs are important in launching specific disease control programs, but decentralization should be pursued as soon as possible.  (7) Integrated disease control programs can be an entry point for increasing access to limited services, establishing principles of co-management and co-financing, and creating community enthusiasm for PHC.  (8) It is necessary to determine costs (including marginal and recurrent costs) before initiating a drug supply and cost recovery system.  (9) Delivery of endemic and epidemic disease control commodities can be effectively achieved as part of an integrated drug supply system. (10) Development of a national health MIS needs to be a consensus-building process.  A national MIS should place more emphasis on non-computerized local feedback than on computerized feedback from a provincial or national level.  (11) Supervision requires a strong training component that promotes and rewards problem solving at the health center level.  (12) Coordination of supervision of NGO health services as part of a health district should be negotiated at the district and provincial levels, with administrative supervision being the responsibility of the NGO, and technical supervision of the health district supervisor. (13) Community development is a continuous process which requires training, which in turn requires increased resources and compensation. Other lessons learned show the need to:  find mechanisms other than health committees to involve women in health care planning and management; link IEC to all support components and program interventions; give priority to counseling in family planning programs; and complement social marketing with counseling and targeted IEC.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","3/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Maternal child health care|Family planning services|Integrated health care|Health care administration|Primary health care|Decentralization|Community health care","Cameroon","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABJ737.pdf","2,360 KB","008524 - USAID.

"This paper reviews the experiences of the Combatting Child Communicable Disease (CCCD) project with routine epidemiologic surveillance in 13 sub-Saharan African countries from 1981 to 1993, and presents lessons learned.  After briefly reviewing the historical aspects of epidemiologic surveillance in sub-Saharan Africa, the paper discusses the key attributes and issues facing epidemiologic surveillance systems and describes three types of facility-based reporting systems (single site, sentinel, and universal).  Several examples of each type of surveillance system are cited, and the structure of CCCD's approach to surveillance is placed within the context of development of overall health information systems.  Lessons learned from this review include the following.  (1) Routine epidemiological surveillance provides an important segment of information needed to support public and child survival programs. (2) These systems must be supplemented by or include management and health service delivery information, special surveys, applied research, outbreak investigations, and program monitoring and evaluation activities.  They work best when they are integrated with other elements of the health information system.  (3) Support of surveillance systems is best assured if the Ministry of Health (MOH) creates a budget line item and allocates specific resources for their maintenance.  (4) Every effort to should be made to ensure the quality of the data collected, reported, analyzed, communicated, and used as the basis of decisions. Pertinent concerns include the development of standardized case definitions, simplification of data collection, and development of supervisory systems.  (5) MOH staff should receive training in areas relevant to surveillance -- epidemiology, data management, and communication.

"Special evaluation of the Coffee Revitalization project (5210216) in Haiti, which was suspended in September 1991, and resumed in February 1993 under a Project Paper Supplement.  The project has been implemented by the Inter-American Institute for Cooperation on Agriculture (IICA). Evaluation covers the period 2/93-4/94. There were several changes to the original project design, the most important of which was to use a cropping systems approach instead of working only with coffee.  This approach is working well. The project appears to be achieving its objectives in terms of numbers of participants (8,800 farmers in 745 groupements and 15 associations), seedlings in nurseries, and improved coffee trees planted.  There will be very little production from the new varieties by the current PACD; however, when they produce, the yields should be higher than for cafe indigene. Coffee seedlings continue to be subsidized by the project.  These subsidies should be phased out gradually, by asking farmers to pay more for seedlings as they begin to receive income from improved coffee trees and cultural practices.  While all the new varieties will give greater yields than cafe indigene, only the catimor is truly rust-resistant. About one third of the new trees being planted are of the catimor variety. Training and technology transfer are proceeding well.  Production of seedlings and cultivation of coffee trees are being done adequately, although some areas for improvement are mentioned in this report. Fourteen small processing plants have been constructed and should be in operation during the next harvest.  These plants can produce high quality coffee if they are operated properly.  Their capacity is limited by the size of their drying areas. The project has not yet developed a coherent marketing strategy and should put more emphasis on this activity.  The coffee now in stock should be sold to Cooperation Haitio-Neerlandaise (COHAN), and the project should work to set up a marketing system for the 1994-95 crop. The financing mechanism and the agricultural input stores are beginning to function and show considerable promise. Availability of fertilizer has improved where stores are located. The project is serving only about 3% of the country's coffee farmers. There has been some project outreach to indirect beneficiaries.  This effort should be increased in the future, in coordination with the Ministry of Agriculture and the PLUS project.  The groupements and associations are grass roots democratic organizations.  They must be nurtured through continued training, support, and information in organization management as well as coffee production and marketing. Project staff appear to have very good relations with farmers, rural authorities, and Ministry of Agriculture officials in areas where the project operates.  The monitoring and evaluation system is extensive and seems likely to be effective.  However, the first monitoring reports have not yet been received. This project is having a beneficial effect on soil and water conservation.  If project activities were to end, planting of coffee would decrease and soil and water conservation would be jeopardized. The trade embargo is very harmful to the project.  It affects travel to project areas, input supply, transportation of parchment coffee, and markets for the product. By PACD, the project will have achieved the goal and purpose as stated in the Project Modification Document of 1993.  However, sustainability of key components will not be assured.  The project clearly is economically viable when potential income from increased non-coffee crops and from higher prices for washed coffee are taken into account. The evaluation recommends that the project be continued largely as it is now for at least one and a half years beyond the current PACD.  After that, the input supply and processing parts should be redesigned as a Rural Enterprise Development Project, executed by a grantee.  Other components, notably the coffee extension system and seedling production, should be absorbed by merging these activities with those of the PLUS Project in a larger sectoral program.  The project should analyze production of and markets for organically grown coffee and consider experimenting with it in at least one growing area.

"PACR of a grant (7/92-9/93) to International Medical Corps (IMC) to implement emergency health services in rural areas of civil-war-torn Angola while initiating the restoration of local health delivery systems. IMC efforts focused on training village health workers (VHWs) and vaccinators for the Expanded Program of Immunization (EPI).  IMC designed a 16-week training program for VHWs, which, in a historic first, incorporated health workers politically affiliated with both MPLA (Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola) and UNITA (National Union for the Total Independence of Angola).  The program was implemented in Luena and Menongue and included both classroom instruction and practical exercises at local health posts.  A total of 95 students participated. Unfortunately, the program was interrupted when renewed civil unrest following the September 1992 election forced IMC expatriate staff to evacuate.  However, despite the absence of expatriate staff, IMC-trained health workers continued a variety of primary health operations, including patient diagnosis and referral, growth monitoring, and promotion of preventive care through community fora on such topics as breastfeeding and water and sanitation. Training of EPI vaccinators was also implemented in Luena and Menongue and was provided to 46 individuals associated with MPLA and UNITA.  This program also was interrupted by civil unrest. Nonetheless, between July and December 1992 several vaccination campaigns were carried out, reaching 6,395 women and children in Luena (July-September), 5,600 women and children (including 4,800 children under age 6) in Menongue (October), and another 894 women and children in Luena (October, December). By November 4, 1992, all expatriate staff had been evacuated to Namibia, but they were able to maintain daily radio contact with Angolan staff in Luena (until January 11, 1993) and sporadic contact with staff in Menongue (until early December 1992). Even after the loss of radio contact, IMC-trained Ministry of Health (MOH) vaccination teams used vaccines and syringes provided by the Angolan Red Cross to continue EPI activities among the estimated 70,000 displaced persons in Luena.  The forced evacuation provided IMC staff a unique opportunity to meet as a group, share ideas, and discuss technical issues; establishment of a standardized primary health care curriculum was a significant outcome of these meetings. In January 1993, UNDP officials tried to visit Luena, but their plane was fired upon during descent and rushed when it departed an hour later. IMC expatriate staff finally revisited Luena on March 1, 1993 and found all equipment at the IMC compound safely under lock and key; the cold chain had evidently not been compromised -- reflecting the value of IMC's training and the high degree of self-sustainability incorporated into project design.  Plans to visit Menongue (where drug supplies had been exhausted at the time of evacuation) were thwarted because the town was reportedly under siege. In March 1993, the Mission asked its grantees to submit proposals detailing what activities could still be completed under their grants. Since IMC had already begun efforts to redevelop Angola's health infrastructure, it submitted a proposal to evaluate MOH health systems and provide support and training to national and provincial EPI administrators.  However, USAID decided that the civil crisis made reprogramming of funds infeasible.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","AOT-0003-G-00-2077-00","","1/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Emergency medical care|Primary health care|Maternal child health care|Immunizations|Paramedical education|Community health workers|War victims|Civil war|Private voluntary organizations|Beneficiary count","Angola","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABJ805.pdf","202 KB","007968 - International Medical Corps","","008507 - USAID.

"Evaluates Phase IV of the Low Income Shelter Program (LISP) in Sri Lanka, which combines Housing Guaranty (HG) and TA funding. Mid-term evaluation covers the period 1987-7/94. In late 1988, prior to any borrowing under Phase IV, USAID/SL suspended the program after the Government of Sri Lanka (GOSL) announced that it would repay housing loans that had been made to low-income borrowers on food stamp assistance from a philanthropic government account, an announcement which was misinterpreted by borrowers in other income categories, who almost universally ceased repaying their loans. After discussions with the GOSL, the Mission concluded that the GOSL's action was a short-term political move rather than a change in policy, and Phase IV was reactivated in March, 1991. Since then, a number of impressive accomplishments have been achieved.  The Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL), which is the implementing agency for the loan component, has approved 42,196 loans, all originated by the eight lending institutions participating in the program, for a value of Rs 420 million. Borrowers have uniformly been below median wage, as required.  In addition, the National Housing Development Authority (NHDA), which is implementing the grant component, has made 76,055 grants totaling Rs 213 million.  These figures exceed targets for both loans and grants. On the institutional and policy front, the objective of developing market rate lending policies and programs has been achieved; all the institutions participating in the program are making only market rate loans and (except for NHDA) are achieving virtually full loan recovery rates.  The objective of rationalizing the public sector has been partially achieved.  On the positive side, the public sector is now making grants or providing subsidies only to families who are too poor to borrow; all others must obtain financing at market rates.  On the negative side, the NHDA is still making housing loans (at market rates), instead of just providing grants and involving itself in policy matters. Finally, little progress has been made in developing housing finance instruments and procedures.  These instruments must be in place before the end of 1995, as both USAID and the Asian Development Bank -- the two principal sources of external financing -- will probably wind up their programs by that time. One of the major problems encountered by the project has been the inability of the GOSL to allocate sufficient funds to the CBSL to make disbursements for the approved loans; to date, only RS 150 million has been reimbursed to lending institutions, leaving unmet disbursements of Rs 270 million.  The other major problem is the bureaucratic process through which the loans must be approved.  The present CBSL procedure increases loan administration costs and discourages many private sector borrowers from increasing their participation.  However, since the CBSL must comply with the Monetary Act, it is unlikely that this problem can be mitigated significantly. Lessons learned are as follows.  (1) USAID housing programs, using HG funds, are capable of reaching large numbers of poor (especially rural) families by granting very small loans to creditworthy borrowers as well as grants to families at the subsistence level.  (2) Low-income families are able to borrow for housing at market rates and repay those loans if the lender is a profit-oriented institution that enforces repayment. (3) Rural families, including those in small towns, are just as capable in carrying debt successfully for housing purposes as are urban families.  (4) Private sector financial institutions are unlikely to play more than a token role in the granting of housing loans for low-income families unless loan origination and loan administration costs are lowered.  (5) Since high loan origination and administration costs in Sri lanka will prevent some lenders from making mortgage loans for low-income families, the ability of lenders to tap outside sources for long-term housing finance will be limited.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","9/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Housing investment guaranty|Low cost housing|Housing administration|Housing finance|Housing needs|Housing credit|Housing policy|Policy reform","Sri Lanka","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABJ809.pdf","1,767 KB","000968 - Planning and Development Collaborative International, Inc.

"PACR on a project (8/84-8/94) to modernize agricultural research and extension in Pakistan's Northwest Frontier Province (NWFP) by upgrading curricula, research, and outreach at the Agricultural University at Peshawar (AU). AU has made excellent progress in improving educational quality, and more limited progress in the areas of research system integration, agricultural outreach, and organizational development. AU established a Directorate of Teaching; reformed its admission policy, which now reserves seats for members of various ethnic, geographic, and social groups, and women; converted its old external examination system into a two-term system with an internal examination and a grade point average system; and improved curricula, which now meet international standards and include math, science, entrepreneurship, and English courses.  AU also developed a Learning Resource Center and established a placement office for students.  One hundred and thirty faculty and research staff received degree training.  Moreover, cheating during exams, a common problem in Pakistani universities, has been completely eliminated at AU.  AU will have to resist the urge to inflate the performance of its students -- a practice common among Pakistani universities trying to help students to compete for a common pool of federal jobs -- if it is to establish a reputation as a quality educational institution. Integration of NWFP's research system under the aegis of AU was incomplete.  While the research system's budget, physical facilities, and staff were transferred to AU, an amendment to the merger act -- lobbied for by research staff who feared their professional opportunities would be limited if they were drawn under AU's wing -- allowed research staff to remain under the control of the provincial civil service.  While this situation was resisted by the first 3 Vice Chancellors, the fourth has yielded to the Provincial Agriculture Department (PAD), which now handles all research staff transfers.  While the incomplete merger has constrained research progress, improvements have been made to the extent possible through personnel development, provision of laboratory equipment, and development of a Master Research Plan.  Research highlights include the discovery that oats produce 3 times as much fodder as wheat, and a study of the use of various herbicides on wild oats. Despite lack of commitment by AU administrators to the concept of outreach, AU did establish an Outreach Directorate, comprised of outreach, a communications services center, and a Division of Continuing Education, which is gradually being accepted both at AU and by provincial leaders.  Efforts have included a variety of training for farmers, extension agents, field assistants, and women.  A continuing constraint stems the exclusion of the Provincial Agricultural Extension Service from the merger with AU. There have also been other difficulties in integrating teaching, research, and outreach functions, as the plan to give faculty and research staff split-assignments has been accepted by very few faculty. As for organizational development, many planned administrative reforms never took place at all, including decentralization of administration, development of a unified personnel system, merit- rather than seniority-based promotion, and planning for sustainability. Networking was more successful.  AU strengthened linkages with Faisalabad and Tandojam, Gomal, and Barani Agricultural Universities; has firm working relationships with the Pakistan Agricultural Research Council (PARC) and the National Agricultural Research Center (NARC); and has established linkages with U.S. universities and international research centers such as CIMMYT and ICARDA. Finally, the project funded the construction of 13 major academic buildings and 11 small farm center buildings and related infrastructure. The following lessons were learned.  (1) AU should pursue efforts to integrate its agricultural education, research, and extension programs with those of the PAD.  (2) Construction of the AU campus could have been more economical through the use of local contractors, and should have been implemented in multiple phases rather than as a single large project.  (3) Development, on the pattern of the U.S. Land Grant System, of a sustainable institution which will have impact on the economic life of the rural poor takes perhaps 15-20 years.  In the case of the AU, the early termination of TA (after 10 years) may jeopardize the huge investment already made.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","10/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural research|Agricultural extension|Institution building|Agricultural colleges|Provinces","Pakistan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABJ829.pdf","550 KB","008588 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (8/84-8/94) to strengthen the ability of Pakistan's agricultural research system to develop and extend improved and marketable technologies to farmers (MART project). Pakistan's agricultural research system, which MART supported, is now well-established and productive.  Its main components are 4 provincial research institutes, 3 provincial universities, a national center (NARC) and an outlying federal institute (AZRI -- the Arid Zone Research Institute), coordinated by a national research council (PARC).  These major institutions are also responsible for a large number of subcenters, field stations, and experimental farms.  The system is well staffed and trained, with a core of extraordinary scientists in key disciplines supported by competent scientists in virtually all subjects. MART's performance was mixed.  The more straightforward areas (farming systems research [FSR], information transfer) were more successful than areas dealing with research management and training. Key accomplishments included:  a master research plan for 1988-2000; a successful strategy to improve wheat production through intensified use of inputs; introduction of FSR in each province and establishment of a national FSR coordinating unit; a successful economic and social science program to monitor farmers' acceptance of research results and to keep research geared toward increasing productivity; good progress in arid zone research; support (since the 1990 amendment) to PARC efforts to establish linkages between research and private agribusinesses; commercialization of 15 technologies developed at PARC; the beginnings of private sector dissemination of research information; a successful competitive research grants program jointly coordinated by PARC and BOSTID; development at NARC and the provincial institutes of modern multi-media facilities for disseminating research results; establishment at the provincial level (though not sustainably at the national level) of committees of agricultural information communicators; and establishment at NARC of a Training Institute which has trained more than 7,000 agricultural scientists, research managers, extensionists, educators, farmers, and agribusinesspersons in the last 10 years. Lessons learned were as follows.  (1) The centerpiece of the MART project was management, yet management of research received far less attention than technological aspects.  (2) The implementing agency and the donor organization should agree beforehand on project objectives and implementing strategy.  For example, the MART Project Paper called for PARC to add 14 staff to the NARC Training Institute and to conduct various indepth analyses of PARC systems, both of which PARC management declined to do. (3) The difficulty of effecting changes in the management of a large federal research system, and in developing the consensus needed for those changes, was not adequately addressed. Within a highly structured system, management is generally improved by liberating creative energies at the margin.  (4) The critical nature of time lags becomes apparent when a long-term program nears completion with little probability of being extended.  In this case, half of the long-term participants never returned to the project in time to contribute to it during its life.  (5) Host country personnel must want to accomplish project tasks and believe that they can be accomplished. Some Pakistani personnel felt they were conducting research for USAID rather than for Pakistan with USAID help.  Also, most of the proposed management interventions, especially those pertaining to financial and personnel management, were perceived as impossible to effect.  The implementing agency should secure the concurrence of its senior and mid-level managers before embarking on new projects.  (6) High-quality and seasoned expatriate consultants who refuse to get bogged down by the indifference of their host country counterparts are critical for the success of development projects, the advisor who developed the audiovisual facility at NARC being a case in point.  Weak advisors, by contrast, get manipulated by shrewd counterparts and are reduced to the level of technical staff officers. Key recommendations for sustaining Pakistan's agricultural research system with the cessation of USAID funding are to:  (1) establish a precise role for NARC that supports provincial research without competing with it; (2) assure adequate resources for agricultural research (fortunately, the loss of USAID funding is being offset by the World Bank's $80 million Second Agricultural Research Project); (3) develop a system-wide sharing of facilities and resources; (4) encourage the scientific excellence fostered by the 25 years of USAID training and other assistance to Pakistani research; and (5) encourage the research system's responsiveness to farmers and agribusinesses.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","10/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural research|Agricultural technology|Agricultural extension|Research centers|Universities and colleges|Research management|Institution building","Pakistan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABJ830.pdf","554 KB","008588 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of a project to establish a Center for Sight in Sofia, Bulgaria.  The evaluation covers the period 1991-3/94. The project succeeded in establishing a Center for Sight, which provides out-patient ophthalmologic care and surgical services of the highest quality in a well-equipped facility.  The Center has provided excellent training to ophthalmologists and residents in ophthalmology through the provision of 6 visiting professors annually since the program's inception 3 years ago. A survey of the prevalence of blindness and of visual impairment in Sofia District and the city of Sofia has been conducted according to the most exacting scientific standards by the Center with the able assistance of personnel from Johns Hopkins University.  The data will be extremely useful in planning for unmet needs for eye care in the area. Personnel for the Center for Sight have established Sight for All, the Bulgarian Eye Foundation.  The private organization has great potential for preventing blindness in Bulgaria. An important objective of this program -- to establish a National Committee for the Prevention of Blindness -- has not been achieved due to the determined and irresponsible opposition of one academic Chair of Ophthalmology, who is a powerful political figure in Sofia. The Center for Sight will undoubtedly continue to introduce new initiatives to further eye care and disease prevention in Bulgaria if it can obtain even minimal additional resources for the next several years.

"Evaluates a project to create a professional civilian police force respectful of human rights in Panama.  The project, implemented by the U.S. Department of Justice's International Criminal Investigative Training Assistance Program (ICITAP), is providing training and other assistance to the Panama National Police (PNP), the Judicial Technical Police (PTJ), and the Panama Department of Corrections (DNC) in the aftermath of the U.S. military invasion of 1989, which effectively destroyed the Panamanian police along with the Panamanian Defense Force (PDF) of which it was a part.  The evaluation covers the period 1990-8/94. The police component of the PDF has been rehabilitated by sorting out known participants in corruption and rights' abuses, including virtually all senior officers and many junior officers. The remaining fraction of the officers combined with most of the enlisted ranks were incorporated into the uniformed PNP and the investigative PTJ. The PNP has received the most attention and has made impressive progress with its vitally important training academy, which faces the major challenge of replacing most of the officer corps which is retiring within the next few years.  The PNP's quality of service and professional attitude have earned relatively high and steadily rising approval ratings from the public, although many Panamanians are still apprehensive of the PNP due to memories of its predecessor, the dreaded PDF.  Also, accustomed to the old military's first call on revenues, the PNP has been slow to develop the budgeting and planning capacity it needs to compete for funds with other government agencies. Neither in fact nor in public perception has the PTJ progressed as far as the PNP, although a relatively good forensic laboratory has been established, professionalism is on the rise, ICITAP training has emphasized the use of evidence other than confessions (the staple of criminal investigation under past practice), and the ""Integration Project"" for prosecutors and investigative police which seeks to improve working relationships through on-the-job TA in the field has also been very successful. However, the forensic laboratory is still not being used properly, and the PTJ training program (which most personnel are in much need of) is very weak. The prison component started relatively late in dealing with a bad situation that included inhuman overcrowding of a prison population vastly exceeding the capacity of the facilities.  The DNC is now completing a large new facility at La Joya.  It is also, with the help of well-planned and -implemented TA, addressing prison management and policy concerns as well as training new professional prison guard forces to take the place of the present PNP details. Despite the need for field follow-up to its training and advisory services and its initial lack of adaptation to local working conditions and the Panamanian legal system, ICITAP has worked hard.  Planning has been severely criticized for lack of systematic analysis of needs and priorities, loose definition of objectives, and lack of verifiable indicators of project accomplishment.  Planning has focused on inputs rather than outputs, making it difficult to ascertain the extent to which project purposes have been accomplished.  There is still no overall project plan as distinct from an annual plan.  ICITAP planning has consisted of expending funds for the current year after they have been allocated rather than preparing a plan to provide a basis for allocating the funds necessary to complete the project.  ICITAP has been improving with respect to planning, but is still notably weak.  A critical problem has been lack of a genuine bilateral project agreement incorporating mutual definition of the project and specific commitments toward achieving project objectives. The major lesson learned is that, while simplified planning may be justifiable in emergencies, a long term institution building project should be subjected to rigorous project planning, design, and implementation discipline as soon as reasonably feasible. Failure to do so makes it impossible to define host country participation in project financing, which, by diminishing the host government's proprietorship of the project and prolonging its dependence on the donor, threatens project sustainability.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","LAC-0669-Q-09-1041-00|LAC-0669-Q-00-1041-00","","8/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Criminal investigations|Institution building|Criminal law|Police|Police services|Correctional institutions|Human rights","Panama","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABJ855.pdf","3,768 KB","007927 - National Center for State Courts (NCSC)","","002881 - USAID.

"The International Eye Foundation (IEF) Vitamin A for Child Survival project in Malawi, a 32-month, $1,095,727 project, was completed on August 31, 1994.  The USAID/Bureau for Humanitarian Response Child Survival(CS)/Office of Private and Voluntary Cooperation (PVC) program provided $823,107 for the project, which was implemented in the Chikwawa District of the Lower Shire Valley in Malawi's Southern Region.  The CS interventions provided include Vitamin A supplementation, nutrition and AIDS education, condom distribution and promotion of oral rehydration therapy (ORT) and immunizations.  A 3-year extension of funding has recently been granted to the project through 1997. The area is densely populated, with high infant (136/1000) and child mortality rates (240/1000) and a high prevalence of chronic malnutrition (49% of children were less than 90% height for age in a recent survey). The population is only now recovering from the 1991-1992 drought and is further burdened by the integration of persons displaced by the political strife in adjacent Mozambique.  HIV infection is highly prevalent, especially in trade centers and among workers at the valley's sugar plantation. The project served an estimated 77,000 children under six and 74,000 women of childbearing age.  The major causes of death among children under five are malnutrition, pneumonia, measles, malaria, and diarrhea. Trachoma, Vitamin A deficiency, and cataracts are the leading causes of blindness, affecting 1.55% of the population.  AIDS is increasingly a cause of mortality in children and adults. Since it began its work in the Lower Shire Valley in the early 1980's, IEF has shifted its emphasis from tertiary eye care to more community-based approaches to child health and prevention of blindness. Since 1985, IEF has helped to expand and develop community infrastructure for delivery of CS interventions.  The most recent project shifted and expanded project activities from 45 villages in Chikwawa and the adjacent Nsanje District to provide services to 474 villages in Chikwawa district. Highlights among project achievements include the development of new health infrastructure in more than 470 additional villages. Despite the demands of the ambitious efforts to expand geographically, the project also achieved impressive improvements in indicators of immunization knowledge and coverage, ORT use, vitamin A supplementation coverage, and practice of exclusive breastfeeding.  The project's leadership role in national awareness and policy reform regarding infant feeding practices has undoubtedly had a far-reaching impact beyond the project area. Project activities also led to expansion of regional AIDS control programs and influenced the development of strategies for the CS project implemented by Adventist Relief and Development Agency (ADRA) in an area south of IEF's project area.  IEF's efforts to integrate vitamin A distribution in under-fives' clinics has led to nationwide use of a simple health card-based system to remind providers to provide semi-annual supplements. The project staff has also provided leadership in coordinating PVO efforts in support of the drought relief and national AIDS prevention programs. The extension of this project for a final 3 years beginning in September will offer an opportunity to consolidate these impressive gains and assure sustainability.  USAID and World Bank funding will provide ongoing training and salaries for the Health Surveillance Assistants (HSAs) to continue their work through the Ministry of Health (MOH).  The next 3 years must be used to work with the district's health facilities and the beneficiary communities to assure continued support and supervision of these HSAs and the network of Village Health Volunteers (VHVs) with whom they work.

"PACR of a project (9/92-2/94) to assist the Government of Grenada (GOG) in privatizing state-owned enterprises.  The project was implemented by the Price Waterhouse International Privatization Group (PW/IPG). Accomplishments were as follows.  (1) Meetings with various ministries, GOG agencies, private sector organizations, and labor representatives resulted in an assessment of Grenada's privatization and liquidation opportunities, as well as a privatization strategy which included phased divestiture plans for eleven enterprises.  (2) Detailed valuation reports on Grenada Electricity services Ltd. (GRENLEC) and the Gravel, Concrete and Emulsion Production Corporation (GCEPC) were produced to show the GOG the various factors that affect enterprise value and to provide a systematic approach for evaluating privatization options based upon enterprise conditions.  (3) Marketing and execution of privatization offerings were completed for both GRENLEC and GCEPC and drew a variety of bids.  By the PACD, the sale of GRENLEC had been completed, but that of GCEPC remained to be finalized.  (4) A public information program targeting the general public, potential investors in specific enterprises to be privatized, and the workforces of the enterprises in question was implemented, along with a special program to generate investor demand in GRENLEC.  (5) Formal and on-the job training and capacity building were provided to GOG officials. The lesson learned is that for specialized TA, it is essential that renowned and proven expertise be obtained both in the selection of the firm and the composition of the implementation team.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","11/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Privatization|Privatization techniques|Public enterprises|Divestiture","Grenada","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABJ884.pdf","279 KB","001757 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (1986-7/93) to support Agricultural Venture Trust (AVT), a venture capital fund which provides equity investments to non-traditional agricultural enterprises in the Eastern Caribbean. Over the course of the project, the AVT invested in 31 enterprises, including production, processing, and marketing enterprises in aloe vera, meat products, tropical flowers, fruit preserves and drinks, etc., with project selection largely based on local or export market potential.  A 6/93 appraisal of 28 of the 31 AVT enterprises found that 13 were fully operational, 9 were in the evaluation or early investment stages, and 6 were defunct.  AVT enterprises were frequently plagued by cost overruns in both the construction and implementation phases, resulting in working capital difficulties which made the enterprises overly reliant on bank overdrafts and contributed to strained relations with commercial banks. The objective that the AVT equity fund not decline over the life of the project was not achieved.  With the present value of AVT's investments at approximately $2.055 million, it can be inferred that the value of the fund has declined by that amount.  On the other hand, AVT has leveraged considerable loans from other investors -- over $8 million.  In the institution-building component, about 20 AVT staff members received on-the-job training.  However, while staff became adept at analysis and systems, they remain limited in agribusiness management and operations. In the last year of the project, AVT considerably reduced its dependency on A.I.D. financing by reducing the number of staff and operational costs.  Since the PACD, AVT administration has been supported completely by investment fees and dividends, and administrative costs are projected at manageable levels. However, with USAID support at an end (and with no other donor forthcoming), overall sustainability will require restructuring the AVT to (1) permit it to offer short-term financial services, such as loans, and diversify the types of financial services it offers its clients; (2) expand the areas of investment beyond agribusiness; and (3) support a productive administrative staff on a cost-effective basis. Lessons learned are as follows.  (1) The gestation periods for agricultural projects in the region, and the time required for returns on the investments, are longer than expected. Implementation and financing schedules need to be critically reviewed, as well as assumptions regarding availability of inputs, access to markets, dependability of supporting infrastructure, and the capabilities of enterprise management. (2) The problem of cost overruns indicates a need for close monitoring of investments, and the provision of technical, financial, managerial and marketing advice throughout the life of the investments.  (3) Working capital requirements need careful assessment and monitoring.  Disbursements must be controlled to ensure that funds are used for the purpose intended.  (4) Excessive dependence on single markets and or single products is risky.  Different markets and ways to reduce risk through product diversification need to be carefully assessed.  (5) Above all, a financial institution encumbered with limitations on where and how to invest for the sake of development goals may be constrained in achieving the commercial orientation required for sustainability.  Directed credit projects worldwide have demonstrated this lesson time and time again.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","11/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural enterprises|Agribusiness|Venture capital|Investment","Eastern Caribbean","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABJ885.pdf","384 KB","001757 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (1985-93) to provide Central American rural leaders with technical and academic training in the United States and at the Central American Institute for Business Administration (INCAE) in Costa Rica and the Agricultural Panamerican School (Zamorano) in Honduras. The project exceeded its targets, providing training to a total of 718 participants, 60% of whom were socially and economically disadvantaged and 28% of whom were women.  Training included: (1) long-term (i.e., 6 months-3 years) training in Honduras and the United States for 40 participants on topics such as general agriculture, management control systems, farm machinery, business management, horticulture, and animal science; and (2) short-term (less than 6 months) training for 678 participants (cooperative and small business owners [PYME-COOP], agricultural teachers, and public auditors) in Costa Rica, Honduras, and the United States. The project also published and distributed a newsletter to all returnees, U.S. Mission staff, and other interested parties throughout the region and the United States. Of the three main groups trained under the project, PYME-COOP has been the most active, and has formed the ""Fundacion Centroamericana PYME-COOP y Sector Informal,"" which is in the process of being registered as a private nonprofit organization. Returned public auditor trainees have held several regional meetings and are taking steps to form regional and national-level associations; several international institutions have offered the prospective regional association financial assistance for seminars, conferences, and workshops.  The group of agricultural teachers has been less active, although they have maintained close contact with each other, including the sharing of experiences through several workshops.  Several of the participating Central American countries expressed an interest in incorporating project participants into their national follow-on programs under the Caribbean and Latin American Scholarships Program (CLASP). Audits of INCAE (8/92 and 8/93) and  Zamorano (8/90) resulted in the suspension of disbursements to both institutions for over a year. Disbursements to Zamorano were resumed after the school assured compliance with the Mission.  Plans to install a financial management system by 6/94 will be implemented by the RENARM project (5960150). INCAE overhauled its financial management system with help from a ROCAP-financed financial analyst.  However, issues with INCAE were not cleared during the active life of the project, and disbursements and several follow-on activities planned for FY 93 were suspended. The following lessons were learned.  (1) Problems dealing with advance reimbursement would have been avoided if the criteria being used now were established at the time the project started. (2) Overhead methodology should be established from the beginning and certified by the Mission soon after the project is started.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","9/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Regional development|Education for development|Participants|Technical training|Personnel development|Leadership training|Rural areas|Beneficiary count","Central America","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABJ886.pdf","162 KB","001373 - USAID.

"PACR of the Belize component of the Central America Peace Scholarship (CAPS) project (1/85-9/93).  The purpose of CAPS was to increase the number of U.S.-trained public and private sector individuals, especially the disadvantaged, at the planning, implementation, technical, and administrative levels. All outputs, as amended, were essentially met, and available data indicate that the training was of overall high quality and responsive to Belize's development needs.  Specifically, the project financed training for a total of 297 participants (63 long-term, 234 short-term), all but two of whom completed their training; 44% of trainees (131) were female. The project was particularly successful in participant selection, and training sites were widely distributed throughout the United States. Returnees were highly satisfied with their training and as a result formed positive images of the United States.  In addition, the project promoted socioeconomic ties between Belize and the United States.  The project also implemented a Follow-On Program for returnees. However, there were some constraints to implementation.  USAID/W, overly anxious to begin the project because of its political significance, did not issue complete instructions for the core Country Training Program (CTP) until the project's second year. Likewise, the Follow-On Program was added with no clear implementation instructions from the Agency.  Simultaneously, cost-containment measures were added while Missions continued to grapple with Experience America, CTPs, and the Follow-On Program. Fortunately, USAID/Belize adapted and there were no delays in training. Additionally, this was a mandated project which USAID had to fund out of its Operating Year Budgets (OYBs), resulting in at least the perception that ""regular"" USAID projects were suffering budget cuts to fund CAPS.  Better planning and guidance, and greater collaboration between the field and USAID/W could have prevented this perception. While the Follow-On Program was innovative and successful under the Belize Chamber of Commerce and Industry for the first five quarters, difficulties arose during the contract's final months due to staffing changes and lack of commitment.  As a result, a hiatus occurred in the Follow-On Program in early 1992 and lasted until 9/92 when Georgetown University signed a contract to implement a joint Follow-On Program. The need for program eligibility requirements is understandable, but the lack of flexibility in training duration prevented the CAPS program from participating in the Entrepreneurs International (EI) program (which established a 28-day minimum) and which would have been an excellent means of establishing lasting links/friendships with U.S. businesses/individuals while promoting trade between the United States and Belize. The following lessons were learned.  (1) Participants were more likely to keep in touch with USAID and be active in the Follow-On Program when site visits were made by Mission staff, an easy task given the 2-hour flight between Belize and the United States. (2) Anecdotal evidence suggests that long-term impact may be greater with long-term training.  However, there is no empirical evidence to support or contradict this hypothesis.  (3) Follow-on programs need to complete the difficult task of providing just the right amount of assistance to their returnees.  Too much assistance will make returnees dependent on the program, whereas too little will lead to failure.  In addition, a follow-on program has to compete with a returnee's other responsibilities, including familial and professional obligations, once he/she returns home.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","2/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Education for development|Leadership training|Disadvantaged groups|Participants|Personnel development|Scholarships","Belize|USA","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABJ887.pdf","1,104 KB","001373 - USAID.

"PACR of the private sector component of a project (1986-9/93) to promote exports and tourism in Belize.  The component was implemented through a Cooperative Agreement with the Belize Chamber of Commerce and Industry/Belize Export and Investment Promotion Unit (BCCI/BEIPU) and a grant to the International Executive Services Corps (IESC). Project achievements have been impressive.  (1) BCCI and BEIPU have merged into a dynamic organization effectively representing the interest of its members and successfully promoting Belize's private sector at home and abroad.  Membership has increased from 98, when the project started, to 532 at the end of the project. A Trade and Policy Unit was established and played a key role in policy dialogue with government and the private sector.  (2) A Handicraft Center was established to organize the handicraft industry.  This provided jobs for Belizeans in rural areas, especially women, and promoted management and conservation of indigenous materials.  (4) Services were provided to 3,400 investors, and 17 Belizeans received U.S. on-the-job training in such fields as agro-processing and tourism.  (5) A national Lotto was launched by BCCI/BEIPU in an effort towards sustainability. (6) A Tourism Marketing and  Public Relations Plan was developed. (7) Caracol and other key archaeological sites have been developed. Lessons learned are as follows.  (1) Sustainability of the organization assisted should be an integral part of project design.  (2) Concentrating on sustainability issues most of the time will cause the organization to lose its focus on its major objectives and prevent it from achieving project goals.  (3) Income-generating projects undertaken in a small country are perceived by the private sector as direct competition, provoking serious criticism which damages the image of the sponsoring organization.  (4) Organizations should not be involved in numerous income-generating activities, but should concentrate on one or two.  (5) It is difficult to quantify the impact of export and investment promotion efforts in relation to investments generated.  For example, an organization which received information on Belize in 1984 at the World Fair did not invest in the country until 1991.  (6) Export and investment promotion activities are ""public good services"" and costs are not recoverable. When these tasks are given to a private organization, the assistance should be for a specific period and sustainability should not be a goal.  (7) A strong private-sector-led organization has great influence in policy design and development through dialogue with both the public and private sectors.  (8) In a small country like Belize where several private organizations are aggressively looking for sustainability through membership, the chances of any one organization achieving that goal is minimal. PVOs cannot achieve sustainability through membership alone.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","3/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Export promotion|Tourist industry|Private sector|Business enterprises|Business associations|Investment promotion","Belize","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABJ888.pdf","2,910 KB","008513 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (9/85-9/93) to strengthen private enterprise training in Belize, in both the public and private sectors. Under the private sector component, organizational objectives for the Belize Institution of Management (BIM) were largely achieved. Key administrative and support positions were filled (despite a lack of experienced Belizean managers), a management and business training center was constructed, and U.S. and on-the-job training were provided to develop a cadre of part-time instructors who collectively deliver some 42 seminars annually, mostly in general management.  In recent years, declining attendance at the seminars led BIM's Board of Directors to develop a strategic plan which bases seminar delivery on needs assessment.  These efforts have yet to bear fruit, however, and BIM has failed to develop significant profit centers.  Quantitatively, BIM exceeded its training targets for private sector and small/medium enterprise managers by 411% and for public officers by 444%.  Female participation in private sector management training was slightly less than planned at 45%, while female participation in the public sector was 52%. In the Belize Tourism Industry Association (BTIA) subcomponent, the project helped the BTIA to establish an office and develop administrative systems and a comprehensive 5-year strategic plan. In addition, members of the BTIA's executive board received participant and in-country training, and a long-term advisor was provided.  The extent to which these organizational gains are sustainable will have to be determined under the Tourism Management project (5050004), to which BTIA development has been transferred.  Under the present project, the BTIA delivered 18 short-term training seminars in such areas as hotel and hospitality management, pricing of tourist services, and catering and food preparation, at 9 major geographic travel destinations. In the public sector component, the Ministry of Education's (MOE) ability to deliver short-term vocational training was developed and strengthened.  The Centre for Employment Training (CET) became operational and delivered short-term skills training to early school leavers and individuals from private businesses and industry, and long-term skills training to students of former junior professional schools; also, two new programs, construction trades and auto mechanics, were added.  CET instructors, who were largely drawn from the private sector, received upgrading through U.S. and in-country training in competency-based instruction, technical fields, and CET's vocational training philosophy.  On the management side, CET personnel were trained in the management of vocational schools, management information systems, counseling and job training, and educational remediation.  CET staff were employed under contract to the CET (rather than as permanent MOE appointments) and their salaries were higher than usual for vocational instructors.  Finally, a coordinating and advisory committee composed of representatives from business, industry, the MOE, and the general community was established to manage the CET.  This structure has proven successful, providing the CET relative autonomy from the MOE, increased input from the labor market, and better job placement services and resource identification. Finally, the subcomponent to improve the Government of Belize's (GOB) capacity to implement its enterprise and tourism development strategy through training in public administration was achieved, with 1,776 public officers (52% of them female) trained against a target of only 400.  Trainees have given their training high marks, though many have reported difficulty in utilizing their training due to a restrictive and unenlightened management environment. Lessons learned are as follows.  (1) Sustainability, which is a critical factor in organizational development and the core of program and activities planning, must be deliberately planned for at the project design stages.  (2) Management training and development is successfully achieved only when strategic management is regularly used, clients participate in determining training needs, and there exist true leadership, a professional staff, sound financial planning, faculty development, regular program evaluation, and organizational autonomy. (3) Vocational education projects require a complete assessment of all pertinent policy and economic conditions, rather than just identification of needs for skills training in technical fields.  Also, vocational training policy is more likely to be successful if it provides for development of youth and unskilled workers, as well as linkages between employers and training schools.  Multiple funding sources increase the chances of sustaining vocational educational development.  (4) To be effective, public sector management training needs to be combined with a supportive management and policy environment.  (5) Project assistance for tourism industry development in Belize should be determined by a more holistic analysis of needs, conditions for implementation, and fit with other interventions.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","2/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Business enterprises|Private sector|Public sector|Small scale enterprises|Medium scale enterprises|Tourist industry|Management training|Vocational training|Employment|Government departments|Public administration|Training centers|Institution building","Belize","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABJ889.pdf","446 KB","008513 - USAID.

"PACR of a grant (9/91-9/93) to World Share to improve social services for street children and orphans in Guatemala. World Share made subgrants to eleven small local NGOs to provide child feeding programs, primary health care, clothing, shelter (especially small group homes), formal and nonformal education, and counseling for some 1,200 children.  Due to financial management problems identified during a 7/92 mid-project evaluation, the grant to World Share was limited to the amount already obligated ($368,000 vs. a planned $475,000) and no further subgrants were made. Although the mid-term evaluation also found that the project was too geographically diffuse to have a demonstrable impact, and, most particularly, that insufficient efforts were made by NGOs to provide de-institutionalized and community-based services, the project's final evaluation concluded that the project was largely successful.  The evaluation concluded that all subgrantees had benefited from the project; abetted by training and TA from World Share, some had strengthened their administrative capacity and several had improved their infrastructure, thereby enhancing their capabilities to care for disadvantaged children. Ten of the eleven subgrants increased the beneficiaries' level of formal primary education.  Two of the most important educational interventions provided the children with sex education and an awareness of their legal rights.  Many subgrant activities were income-generating efforts such as vegetable gardening or clothing microenterprises. Additionally, most of the subgrantees had community-level impacts, e.g., by offering training or microenterprise opportunities to single mothers, adolescents, or other community members. The sheer numbers of street, working, and abused children exceeded the service capacity of the NGOs.  The key lesson learned is that such projects require a limited programmatic and geographic focus.  Realizing this, the Mission incorporated findings from this project into the design of the new Street Children Support project, which focuses much more closely on children living or working on the street and on abused children, particularly in Guatemala City. Other lessons learned are as follows.  (1) Guatemalan NGOs involved in service delivery to street and working children have limited exposure to innovative models developed in other settings.  In addition, they often have limited financial and management capabilities and need strengthening in these areas. (2) Insufficient understanding of the nature and scope of the problems of street and working children in Guatemala limits the capacity of both NGOs and international donors to respond adequately to the problem.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","8/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Child welfare services|Disadvantaged groups|Orphans|Street children|Indigenous private voluntary organizations|Private voluntary organizations","Guatemala","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABJ890.pdf","193 KB","001373 - USAID.

"PACR of the Small Projects Assistance Fund (SPAF), a project (3/88-9/94) to finance small self-help development projects in rural communities assisted by Peace Corps volunteers in Guatemala.  Because the Peace Corps did not have the administrative support resources needed to manage project funds efficiently, it requested that management responsibility be transferred to CARE in 10/91. The project served to maintain the presence of Peace Corps volunteers, CARE, and USAID in rural communities where other-donor assistance was usually nonexistent.  After taking over, CARE administered the SPAF well and expeditiously.  During its tenure, a total of 53 projects costing $46,585 were completed.  Most frequently, these projects involved building latrines and training health promoters and midwives, particularly in remote or inaccessible villages.  Smaller latrine projects (i.e., those with 30 or fewer latrines) were more successful than larger ones.  Up to 40% of Peace Corps volunteers in health and nutrition projects made use of SPAF funds at some point during their 2 years of service.  Although onsite supervision of the individual projects lagged from about mid-way through the life of the project, all projects received some level of supervision, as well as an evaluation of final results by Peace Corps volunteers. Lessons learned:  (1) Through volunteers' relationship with local groups, the project can continue to build community capacity to manage project resources -- a major task in strengthening local democratic initiatives.  (2) For training programs to be successful, it is important to involve the health center or post directly, specifically, to involve the rural health technician in the training of health promoters and the professional nurse in the training of midwives.  (3) During training, payment of per diem was vital for the continued attendance of health promoters and midwives.  To avoid conflicts in the future, it is very important to make sure that the amount of per diem agrees with the amount paid by the Ministry of Health.  (4) Involving the community in implementation of the projects was critical to success.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","9/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Development projects|Community self help|Rural areas|Private voluntary organizations|Outdoor toilet facilities|Paramedical education|Health workers|Traditional birth attendants","Guatemala","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABJ891.pdf","111 KB","001373 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (6/86-12/91) to implement a program of higher education for indigenous Mayan-speaking students at the Universidad Rafael Landivar's (URL) Quetzaltenango Campus in Guatemala. The project was a success.  Accomplishments include an academic program that encompasses a wide range of courses in such fields as bilingual education, legal interpretations, and phytotechnology, as well as traditional fields of study; a student development program and a student development center (CENDE) which includes community outreach, tutoring and job placement services, Mayan language training programs, and a student financial aid program; and a strengthening of the Quetzaltenango Campus through the purchase of textbooks, laboratory equipment, and computers.  In addition, a permanent Linguistic Institute was established and has conducted studies of Mayan cultures and gender issues, the results of which are disseminated within the government and to indigenous organizations and universities.  The URL has established a fundraising program (almost 80% complete), which will provide scholarships for 107 indigenous and disadvantaged students from the Highlands. The project had a positive impact on program graduates, who have included 280 technicians receiving associate degrees and 82 receiving licenciatura degrees.  A number of URL graduates occupy important positions in NGOs and private businesses.  The project has also had an impact at the community level, where social work graduates are designing development projects.  In general, local employers have been satisfied with the performance of the URL graduates whom they have hired. The following lessons were learned.  (1) Projects with private entities are more efficiently and effectively implemented than projects implemented with the local government.  (2) Private entities with a focus on disadvantaged populations are better prepared and committed to implement social development projects than are those lacking this approach.  (3) To avoid paternalism or overprotection, scholarship students should be required to pay part of their fees.  (4) A fundraising program should be implemented from the beginning of the project to help insure program sustainability.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","9/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Educational development|Universities and colleges|Higher education|Private education|Indigenous populations|Disadvantaged groups|Beneficiary count","Guatemala","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABJ892.pdf","110 KB","008550 - USAID.

"This report assesses the legacy and the impact of USAID's agricultural and natural resources management programs undertaken in Cameroon since 1987.  The need for this assessment came about following the Agency's decision in November 1993 to close the USAID Mission in Cameroon. The study takes the term legacy to mean any accomplishment that remains after a program has ended.  Impact is taken to mean the measurement of change, usually the number of years after a program has ended.  However, for the special purpose of this assessment, attempts are made to detect such change even while most of the programs are still ongoing.  For a few of the programs it is too early to attempt an impact assessment. During the period of observation, the 1980s, the bulk of USAID's agriculture and natural resource portfolio, reflecting food security and productivity concerns, was in research and institution building.  This focus was consistent with USAID's Strategic Objectives (1982) and also those of the Development Fund for Africa (DFA).  The DFA objectives are particularly appropriate for judging impact for this group of projects. In their totality, the research, education, and cooperative programs leave behind a strong legacy of increased capacity for research, management, and networking.  Impressive facilities for education and research are also part of the USAID legacy, although the difficult economic position of the country raises serious questions about the sustainability of this legacy.  Cursory observations would indicate that sustainability appears to be excellent for the cooperatives, good for the university, and fair to poor for the research capacity.  However, even for the latter, in recognition of its impressive capacity, forces are at work in the United Nations, the World Bank, and other donors to address its sustainability.  If this effort is successful, the sustainability of the research capacity would improve dramatically. Looking at the impact of these USAID activities, there can be no doubt as to very substantive and far-reaching contributions to Cameroon. The success of USAID's research, education, and cooperative work is indisputable.  Yet the good news is still to come.  The benefit stream of U.S. investment in Cameroon is only in its infancy.  The research results, already changing the food scene in Cameroon, are continuing to show effects at an increasing rate.  One USAID-assisted farmer, for example, was extending her knowledge to fifty other farmers.  A handful of national and international organizations are using USAID-generated research to extend it to local farmers and to Tchad, Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger, Senegal, and the Central African Republic. On the educational front, USAID's contribution leaves behind a greatly improved national philosophy of education, and a more manageable system.  The reforms replace a decrepit system based on rote learning that had compromised the potential of young minds since the beginning of formal educational systems in Cameroon.  A statist perspective of education cut off interaction, and was oblivious to issues of relevance. The United States leaves behind an appropriate capacity for self education and technical innovation in the food system, agriculture, and natural resources. The cooperative assisted by USAID is an important economic player in Cameroon.  It is an important intermediary in the financial market and has provided an important cushion to its members during Cameroon's economic decline.  Over 75,000 people belong to this cooperative.  It is a self-sustaining operation.

"After the closing of the USAID Mission to Cameroon in 11/93, four impact assessments were conducted to document the achievements and the legacy of more than 30 years of USAID development assistance in the areas of health and population, economic policy reform, agriculture and natural resources, and participant training.  This report synthesizes the impact assessments, detailing specific achievements and highlighting more than 30 lessons learned. In summary, the report finds that thousands of Cameroonians -- farmers, students, professionals, women, and children -- have benefited from USAID projects to promote private sector-led markets, improve health care, finance long- and short-term training, and support agricultural and environmental research and education. Mores specifically, USAID made substantial headway in liberalizing the arabica coffee market and introducing a marketing information system for arabica farmers; coffee farmers have been rewarded with significant income gains.  In the health arena, USAID helped to reorient primary health care by promoting (1) the decentralization of planning and management to the district level, (2) co-management and co-financing, and (3) the full integration of preventive with curative care and of family planning into public and private health facilities.  USAID also supported a model program in HIV prevention through social marketing of condoms.  In agriculture, USAID's longstanding commitment to research in staple crops resulted in improved varieties and production increases; USAID was also instrumental in training hundreds of personnel in agriculture and other sectors.  To support the environment, USAID fostered local NGO environmental policy advocacy and helped to fund research in Korup National Park, one of the oldest rainforest ecosystems in the world.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","7/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Participants|Agricultural development|Environmental policy|Primary health care|Agricultural policy|Economic policy|Policy reform|Natural resource management","Cameroon","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNABT364.pdf","1,132 KB","008524 - USAID.

"PACR of a pilot project (2/87-6/94) to establish a maintainable rural road system in Pakistan's Sindh Province.  The project was implemented by the Ministry of Local Government and Rural Development (MLGRD) of the Government of Pakistan (GOP) and the Local Government and Rural Development Department of the Government of Sindh (GOS). Despite ethnic strife and lawlessness in Sindh, the GOS's dissolution of district councils (which to be the main vehicle for ensuring ongoing road maintenance) at the height of the project in anticipation of new council elections, substantial cuts in planned construction due to the Pressler amendment, and finally, termination of the project 6 months early due to growing uncertainty about future funding, significant progress was made. The road rehabilitation/construction component left a substantially improved paved road network (172 km or approximately 80% of the post-Pressler target) which could be economically maintained by the Sindh districts; established procedures for selecting roads for improvement; improved standards for engineering design and preparation of bid documents; and significantly improved construction quality by improving contractor supervision, in the process increasing the number of experienced local contractors. The road maintenance management component established a rural road policy in Sindh which emphasizes maintenance over expansion; improved awareness within district, provincial, and federal agencies about the importance of road maintenance through seminars and workshops; created Road Maintenance Units in district councils; provided training for engineering staff; helped to develop a highly successful maintenance management program at the Asian Institute for Technology (AIT), Thailand, which is still offered by AIT; and instituted mechanisms to allow district councils to contract out road maintenance. The financial management component prepared two pioneering studies of district councils' finances, and disseminated recommendations drawn from the studies.  The GOS created a committee to examine the recommendations and propose systems for implementing them. Finally, under the highway policy reform component, the project provided short-term training to senior officials of the National Highway Authority (NHA) and the provincial-level Communications and Works Department and MLGRD in highway planning and policy development, and conducted two important policy studies, one of which led to reorganization of the National Highway Board and creation of the NHA. The following lessons were learned.  (1) A rural road program requires a really long-term (up to 20-year) commitment, with short- and medium-term benchmarks to demonstrate progress.  (2) Institution building projects are extremely sensitive to changes in donor commitments.  In this project, USAID's unilateral termination resulted in loss of interest by the implementing agencies.  (3) There is a need for close coordination and open communication between donors involved in road development in Pakistan. (4) GOP/GOS ownership and commitment are critical to the sustainability of an institution building project.  (5) The role of GOP/GOS provincial and federal road agencies was neglected in the project design.  Also neglected at the design stage was the involvement of local communities in the maintenance of rural roads; it became apparent during implementation that this aspect should be further explored.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","11/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Road construction|Road maintenance|Transportation policy","Pakistan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABJ929.pdf","475 KB","008588 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (8/90-6/94) to link certain remote areas of Khuzdar Division in Balochistan Province, Pakistan, to the national highway network. The project was scaled back significantly from the original plan, which was to link Makran Division in Balochistan Province to the national highway network and to privatize certain road maintenance functions.  First, as a result of the Pressler Amendment, the project purpose was revised to completing 56 km of road in Khuzdar Division which had been left unfinished by a defaulting local contractor under the Balochistan Area Development (BALAD) project (3910479). Construction work under the revision commenced in July 1993.  However, as a result of USAID/W's mandate that USAID/P rescind $56.2 million, the Mission terminated the project early, and only 44.8% of the work contracted was completed. Due to the early termination, only two of six planned bridges were completed; the third was 50% completed; the fourth was partially completed; and only foundation work was completed on the fifth and sixth.  Other accomplishments included:  completion of 37 pipe culverts and 6 box-culverts; grading of 5 km of road bed; and rehabilitation of the engineer's base camp at Jhal-Jhao. Several important lessons were learned.  (1) When a road project is terminated before it is completed, the portion partially constructed has little or no value and USAID's investment is lost.  The incomplete structures stand as a monument to USAID's abandonment of assistance to the area.  (2) A construction contract terminated due to contractor default should never be reinstated with the same contractor.  NASA, the contractor that defaulted under BALAD, was recontracted with the stipulation that it mobilize an expatriate management team.  This was done, but still NASA could not complete even half the project within the contract period.  (3) Evaluation of a local firm should be based on that firm's own experience and resources.  NASA won approval on the basis of its association with an established Greek contractor which had agreed to provide backup.  But when the agreement did not work out, the Greek contractor withdrew within a month.  (4) USAID should advance mobilization payments to the local construction contractor; this is the usual practice in Pakistan, where construction financing at reasonable rates is often not available.  Lack of such payments places the local contractor in a difficult financial bind.  (5) The A/E resident engineer should participate in evaluating construction proposals and choosing contractors.  If the engineer is an expatriate, knowledge of English should be required of all construction contractor personnel, at least down to the foreman level.  Many onsite problems could have been avoided if these criteria had been followed.  (6) In this project, USAID/P placed the onsite materials testing laboratory under the control of the A/E resident engineer rather than the local contractor -- with excellent results. It is recommended that future projects adopt the same practice.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","10/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Road construction|Contractors|Construction industry|Local level|Supervision|Contract management","Pakistan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABJ930.pdf","219 KB","008588 - USAID.

"PACR of the Private Investment Expansion program/project (8/90-12/93) in Pakistan.  As a result of the close-out of U.S. assistance to Pakistan mandated in the Pressler amendment (which took effect in 1991), The project's's scope was reduced and its PACD advanced from 8/97. Despite the Pressler cuts, the program continued to be highly effective.  About the same time as the cuts, the new Pakistan government of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif announced a major effort to liberalize the economy through deregulation and privatization, providing fertile ground for the program, which served as one of USAID's main points of access to the government in conducting private sector policy dialogue. Later, however, toward the end of the program, Pakistan's confrontational politics began to divert attention from the private sector and momentum waned.  Still, most planned objectives were achieved in the program's three areas of emphasis:  investment promotion; capital markets; and privatization. In the area of investment promotion, a new organization, the Pakistan Investment Board (PIB), was established in 10/92.  USAID consultants assisted and advised the PIB on all aspects of investment promotion. Other achievements under this component included development of about 30 U.S.-Pakistani business linkages (e.g., joint ventures, licensing arrangements); a successful revolving fund which provided pre-investment feasibility loans to local businesses; and financial support for the multi-donor First International Private Investment Conference, held in 1991. The project also made good progress in strengthening Pakistan's capital markets through its assistance to the Karachi Stock Exchange (KSE) and the Corporate Law Authority (CLA).  KSE computerized its settlement and clearing process and introduced several other modernizing improvements that have enabled it to increase its operations, attract significantly more foreign investors, and double its market capitalization.  In addition, a Central Depository Company is being developed, which will eventually result in paperless trading at KSE. Other project efforts included four seminars in capital market development and market intermediation for KSE and CLA, development of a formal curriculum for a soon-to-be-initiated KSE Institute of Business Administration program to certify brokers, training programs at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the New York Institute of Finance, and a visit to Pacific Rim exchanges and regulatory agencies. The major effort under the privatization component, privatization of the Pakistan Telecommunications Corporation (PTC), was derailed after a complaint from a competing TA contractor led USAID/W to instruct the Mission to cease assistance to the PTC. Despite this decision, the initial privatization report received wide recognition.  With assistance from other donors, PTC's privatization is now imminent. Prospects for sustainability of program achievements are good in all three areas.  Several other donors are involved in further assisting some of the entities helped by this program.  Persons trained under the program continue to move to more responsible positions. Lessons learned included the following.  (1) The Government of Pakistan's (GOP's) insistence that it approve private sector candidates for training was inappropriate and counterproductive; it was finally eliminated at the insistence of the Mission.  (2) New implementation approaches require a great deal of time and management attention.  The process of setting up a feasibility fund involving private sector firms as partners took nearly 2 years.  (3) Time and nurturing are required to cultivate business alliances.  Some 275 U.S. and Pakistani companies were interviewed to produce the 30 linkages that emerged from the program.  (4) If momentum is not to be lost, fast-track contracting is required when providing TA to the private sector. (5) Time spent reshaping the program in light of Pressler restrictions could have been better spent in implementing program activities.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","10/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Private enterprises|Investment promotion|Foreign investment|Capital markets|Institution building|Management training|Privatization","Pakistan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABJ931.pdf","780 KB","008588 - USAID.

"Evaluates the small-scale enterprise (SSE) component of the Mahaweli Enterprise Development project in Sri Lanka.  Final evaluation covers the period 1989-11/94. The SSE component has been the project's most successful.  The component has achieved its targets and has moved the Mahaweli Authority of Sri Lanka (MASL) toward providing more assistance to help develop the Mahaweli's economic base.  Although small and microenterprises are only one part of the economy, they are a critical first step in the process of diversifying sources of income in the Mahaweli.  Through June 1994, the project had generated 3,266 full-time and 1,697 part-time SSE jobs against a target of 1,250 by 1995. The jewel in the component's crown has been the development of the Mahaweli Business Centers (MBCs), which have served as focal points for the private sector and are viewed as friendly to business (a significant achievement for a government agency). MBC staff seem to be well-qualified and trained for their jobs. MBCs provide TA, training, and help in obtaining credit and land. Although some service improvements are needed, basic activities are functioning well. Assistance to MBC clients for direct loans from banks is well-established and would continue without much further assistance. However, other credit programs which are tied to the Mahaweli Venture Capital Company and the Savings and Credit Societies require further definition and development. The management information system for tracking client services and impacts is sound, although data need to be made more accessible, gender disaggregated data need to be increased, and current efforts to decentralize data entry and verification should be hastened and strengthened. Although the project has not directly targeted women entrepreneurs, project staff have made diligent efforts to include women in all of their programs, efforts which should be reinforced (the current study on women trained by the project might provide direction on what more could be done in this area). The concentration on the family as the locus of enterprise development is the proper approach to take in reaching women and helping them to develop other income bases. Efforts made by the Head Office of the Employment, Investment, and Enterprise Development Division (EIED) and by the MBCs to facilitate outgrower arrangements in the Mahaweli have generated employment and fostered crop diversification.  Although it may be necessary to transfer the investor promotional activities to other agencies and donor-assisted projects, the facilitation role of the MBCs should be continued and be expanded. An 18-21 month extension of the project is recommended.

"The Family Planning Logistics Management buy-in in Mali has, since its start in March 1993, made considerable achievements in developing the logistics management information system; training field personnel (region and district) in family planning (FP) logistics management; tracking contraceptive procurement and supplies through management of the contraceptive procurement tables (CPTs); coordinating with other FP programs and donor agencies; and assessing the storage and distribution (including transportation) needs of the current program, and its future expansion. As a consequence of the above, there is an observed improvement in FP logistics management skills and, in most cases, stock levels of the most-used contraceptives, at least down to the district level.  The program is therefore perceived to be making a significant contribution to the overall objective of the national family planning program to make contraceptives of the right type and quality always available to existing and potential FP acceptors. However, there are indications that there are some weaknesses in the current system that still need attention during the life of the current buy-in and beyond.

"Evaluates project to provide mid- to senior-level technical experts to USAID offices and Missions and cooperating country institutions to plan, implement, and evaluate child survival (CS), HIV/AIDS, and family planning (FP) activities (TAACS project).  Interim evaluation covers the period 1988-11/94. TAACS has fulfilled its mandate by expanding USAID's capacity to carry out CS activities as well as AIDS research, treatment, and control activities.  Since the addition of FP activities to the project in 1993, the project has recruited eight FP advisors. Although the project design lent priority to the 22 countries designated as ""CS emphasis countries,"" 15 of the 31 CS advisors who have completed their assignments were assigned in Washington, where they helped to design or manage regional or global projects that require centralized management.  All told, 58 advisors have been assigned to 63 positions at the Center for Population, Health, and Nutrition, the regional Bureaus, and 24 countries overseas. Advisors have been provided under the Intergovernmental Personnel Act, the PASA with the U.S. Public Health Service through the Office of International Health of the Department of Health and Human Services, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), and through two NGOs -- the Centre for Development and Population Activities (CEDPA) and the American National Red Cross (ANRC). The NGOs have proven their ability to recruit TAACS candidates and have developed a pool of future candidates.  All current institutional sponsors are interested in continuing to provide USAID with TAACS advisors. The use of non-direct hire advisors to manage major parts of the Agency's CS, family planning, and HIV/AIDS programs is a second-best solution to an acute staffing problem.  However, until direct hire staff can be expanded, or an operating expense-funded limited career appointment system is established, the TAACS advisors offer a very high level of performance.  Fear that the use of TAACS advisors would lead to the elimination of direct hire positions in Population, Health, and Nutrition (PHN) has proved unfounded; while there have been a few instances of cuts in deputy PHN chief positions, no Missions to which TAACS advisors have been assigned have eliminated all direct-hire health/population positions. The following conclusions are offered.  (1) USAID Missions and offices have not been adequately informed either of the special mandate by which TAACS advisors are to serve under conditions comparable to those of U.S. direct hire staff, or of their status within their sponsoring institutions.  (2) CEDPA should improve its orientation course for its advisors, specifically as regards USAID procurement procedures and financial systems.  (3) It is less cumbersome for the USAID Mission, rather than the sponsoring institution, to provide TAACS advisors with local support (e.g., travel and living expenses).  (4) Some advisors filled positions that could have been filled under personal services contracts. (5) A.I.D. has no system for consolidating and assessing the effectiveness of individual advisors.  (6) Except for placements by CEDPA, for which the USAID Office of Procurement has not yet established an off-site overhead rate, the cost of a person-year of technical service under the TAACS activity is less than that of similar services procured by USAID under personal services or institutional contracts.  It is not possible, in the absence of information on the costs of in-house supervisory and support functions and the fringe benefits and allowances covered by USAID, to compare the costs of a TAACS advisor to those of a direct-hire employee.","Project title: Population technical assistance (POPTECH)","Special Evaluation","Documents","CCP-3024-C-00-3011-00","","11/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Child survival activities|Personnel|Technical assistance|Experts|HIV/AIDS|Family planning services","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABJ963.pdf","173 KB","008485 - Basic Health Management International (BHM)|001131 - The Futures Group International, Inc.

"Evaluates project to expand agro-industrial enterprises and support the diversification and commercialization of Sri Lanka's agricultural sector. Mid-term evaluation covers the period 5/92-11/94. The project has set appropriate output targets and annual work plans, which have led to the introduction of new technologies and the development of markets and new financial mechanisms.  Although the rate of investment has been only about one-half of the cumulative output targets, the client base is expanding rapidly and past investments are building momentum within existing client firms and their competitors. The project has been highly effective in improving the entrepreneurial behavior of its clients (who include micro, small, and medium-sized firms, and female and non-English speaking entrepreneurs), who are demonstrating the capacity to exploit project assistance well beyond the project's planned life.  Cost-sharing investments in innovative technologies with clients are stimulating client confidence and fostering prudent financial management behavior.  In addition, client competitors are benefiting from the knowledge generated by client technology adoption programs.  Training has been localized in order to focus on country-specific enterprise development issues and save overseas training costs. While significant headway has been made in collaborative training and market development activities with key host country institutions, progress has been slow in improving public sector support for agro-enterprises, so that there is no assurance of the project's impact beyond its life.  Currently, there is no private or public organization that is a viable candidate to assume the project's advisory role. The project is using an efficient monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system, which would be strengthened by refinement of the project's purpose-level indicators.  It has also developed an effective procedure for detecting possible adverse environmental effects of its activities; so far, none have been found, although the use of pesticides/fungicides in crop production trials should be evaluated to see if more comprehensive environmental compliance procedures are warranted. The following are lessons learned.  (1) The project's advisory board is staffed mainly by progressive agro-entrepreneurs from the private sector, whose perspectives provide effective guidance on strategic implementation issues and who have created a platform for stimulating public sector support for agricultural development.  (2) The advisory team's aggressive promotion campaign has secured a solid client base and established the level of momentum necessary to achieve the project's performance targets.  (3) The decision to initially concentrate on selecting clients from established, rather than new, firms has allowed the project to identify highly productive investment and technology transfer opportunities and avoid a high rate of business failures.","Delivery order no. 18|Companion evaluation summary: PD-ABL-078","Special Evaluation","Documents","PCE-0001-I-00-2051-00","","11/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Private sector|Agribusiness|Agricultural enterprises|Agricultural markets|Entrepreneurs|Business support services","Sri Lanka","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABJ964.pdf","3,915 KB","001335 - Chemonics International Consulting Div.","","008606 - USAID.

"USAID's early support for agricultural commercialization in Thailand through funding for a succession of demonstration projects at the Lam Nan Oon (LNO) site was an important factor in the stunning growth of agribusiness in that country, which now ranks fifth among world exporters of value-added processed foods. This document relates the development of contract farming at the LNO site, explains the strategies employed by USAID and the Royal Thai Government, reviews the significant outcomes and impacts of the growth of managed arrangements (i.e., contract farming), and recommends improvements in project design for strengthening the agribusiness sector in developing countries.  Lessons learned from the LNO experience include the following.  (1) Government officials have a crucial role to play in engendering trust between farmers and agribusiness firms.  (2) Contract farming is not by its nature biased towards any one group; in the LNO case, contract farming produced clear benefits to both small farmers and the firms to which they sold their produce, and it opened avenues for women to become technicians and managers.  (3) A core working unit should be established on-site to troubleshoot problems as they arise, rather than relying on multiple committees.  (4) Institutional strengthening is crucial in fostering the government's role, particularly its ability to negotiate with the private sector; training can best be accomplished through direct contact with specialists possessing relevant firsthand experience.  (5) It is important to set realistic time horizons for the accomplishment of goals.  (6) Crop testing should be performed on-site, and be guided by market considerations.  (7) Water control will always be a leading concern of the private sector.  (8) A monitoring unit should be set up in the post-project period to help farmers and firms to keep abreast of new crops and opportunities and to maintain competitive advantage.  (9) Measures to protect against the hazards of pesticide spraying, particularly training of farmers in safe spraying practices, should always be incorporated into project design.

"Final evaluation of a project (6/84-9/94) to strengthen the capabilities of Ugandan financial institutions to provide intermediate credit for productive agricultural enterprises.  The project was implemented by the Bank of Uganda and various intermediate credit institutions (ICIs). Due to the civil war in Uganda, the project did not get underway until 5/86, at which time several bad or questionable decisions were made because the Mission was under great pressure to get the project going; for example, it was decided to substantially reduce TA on the assumption that the targeted beneficiaries, commercial farmers, would not need much help.  Particularly damaging was the failure to select an institutional contractor to coordinate the project.  As a result of these decisions, the ICIs never received dedicated TA and they were denied a chance to participate in project design, while the Mission was often unable to deliver the specialized TA that was needed.  Each of the three participating ICIs (the Uganda Commercial Bank, the Uganda Development Bank, and the Bank of Baroda) operated under its own credit norms, and the operating manual that was to be developed by the institutional contractor of course never materialized. In all, 256 loans were approved, 226 under the commodity import facility and 30 in local currency.  The repayment rate, including principal and interest, accrued at the rate payable by the ICI to the Bank of Uganda, was only 22% (at the rate charged farmers, repayment would be lower).  The interest rate charged to farmers contributed to the low repayment rate.  While these rates were negative compared to inflation, production did not increase as much as predicted because farmers were not used to mechanized farming and did not receive TA. Also, many of the animals imported under the project died (almost 50%). There were also more usual problems such as low crop prices and drought. In addition, loan supervision and collection were poor to spotty. The project did had some positive impacts, however.  Poultry and agribusiness enterprises appeared to have fared pretty well and did not experience the multitude of problems encountered by dairy and crop farmers.  Women constitute 80% of the agricultural labor force, so increased production of maize and other crops did affect demand for their labor and this has implications for increased incomes.  Farmers and ICIs have both gained experience with medium-term credit. Lessons learned include the following.  (1) In the case of complex projects, especially when institution building is a key objective, Mission management should be supplemented by a comprehensive and long-term management mechanism, e.g., an institutional contractor.  (2) All possible recourses that lending institutions can use to increase repayment rates should be examined and incorporated into the project design.  (3) Meaningful capacity building can only occur when the parties involved share the same perspective on the goals to be achieved, the priorities among these goals, and the means by which they will be achieved.  (4) Depending on how a project is designed and managed, the goal of increasing the capacity of commercial banks to administer intermediate term credit using donor funds may not necessarily contribute to (and may decrease) their capacity to effectively function in their primary role, which is financial intermediation.  (5) Donor intervention can actually weaken the already difficult situation between financial intermediation and agricultural development if it causes commercial banks to substitute donor support for locally mobilized savings.  (6) Credit driven solutions that fail to adequately consider problems in marketing, infrastructure, extension services, research, the macroeconomic environment, and agricultural policy may exacerbate farmers' problems rather than provide sustainable long-term solutions.","Attached to PD-ABJ-983","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","6/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural credit|Financial institutions|Agricultural investments|Private enterprises|Commercial farming|Loan administration|Commercial banks|Central banks|Institution building","Uganda","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDABJ983A.pdf","7,280 KB","003970 - Management Systems International, Inc.

"Evaluates a component of a project to improve health care in the New Independent States (NIS).  The component focuses on establishing partnerships between U.S. hospitals and health care organizations and NIS counterparts to transfer U.S. medical knowledge/technology, and is implemented by the American International Health Alliance (AIHA), a consortium of U.S. hospital associations.  The evaluation covers the period 6/92-7/94. The partnership program is a well-conceived effort, and exceptionally aggressive implementation has produced significant results rapidly.  In less than 2 years, 21 partnerships have been established:  U.S. participants now include 47 hospitals and health systems and 18 medical schools in 18 cities and 15 states; NIS participants include 42 hospitals and health systems and 12 medical universities in 17 cities and 10 countries. The partnerships have already been able to achieve significant transfer of clinical skills among physicians, provide useful models for continuing education and hospital administration, and expand impact by dissemination through seminars, conferences, publications, and electronic communication.  The program has also been highly successful in mobilizing private resources for assistance to the NIS, and partnerships have built grassroots support for U.S. economic assistance programs and enhanced international understanding and goodwill.  Thus far, however, the program has responded primarily to institutions and individuals at the local level, and consequently, its impact has been limited. The program is now at a stage where USAID needs to be more selective about the partnerships and activities it supports in order to maximize the impact of its investments and achieve broader developmental impacts by extending beyond local communities to respond to regional and national priorities.  The experiences of the past 2 years point to programmatic areas of greatest need where investment will yield the highest dividends. Most partnerships are already sharpening their focus on these areas, which include institutional management, infection control, emergency medical services, and reproductive health.  NIS and U.S. partners willing to work in such areas should continue to receive support. Another important requirement for continued funding should be institutions' willingness and capability for effective dissemination in the NIS of the knowledge and expertise gained through the partnerships. Ideally, NIS partners would be recognized lead institutions within their respective regions or countries; however, some smaller, lesser known NIS partners, such as the Dubna group, may be capable of comparable impact due to their exceptional innovation and dynamism.  Also important are the ability and willingness of the U.S. partner to mobilize institutional and community resources in support of their partnership. Partnerships unable or unwilling to meet these criteria should be phased out from USAID/AIHA, but would of course be free to continue with their own or other resources. Recommendations are that AIHA:  (1) continue, even strengthen, its support for NIS efforts to improve efficiency through training in administration and management; (2) encourage increased participation of nurses, administrators, and other non-physician health care professionals, and assist NIS partners in improving teamwork among physicians, nurses, and administrators; (3) reconsider the emphasis on neonatal resuscitation within the program; (4) consider lengthening the stays of NIS visitors in the U.S.; (5) expand support for the development of information dissemination systems within the NIS; (6) consider strengthening the medical technical competence of its home office; (7) as funding permits, fill the geographic holes in the program, both in the United States, which has few partners in the western part of the country, and especially in Russia, for the vast region from the Urals to the Pacific Coast; (8) discontinue funding for U.S. partner resident coordinators, who can be placed in a paternalistic role, undermining the partnership concept; and (9) consider the advisability of financing, on a limited scale, high-tech equipment which offers a high return on investment, e.g., ultrasound, endoscopy, and laparoscopy equipment.","Project title: Health technical services (HTS)","Special Evaluation","Documents","HRN-5974-Q-00-3002-00","","10/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Institutional linkages|Health delivery|Health care administration|Technology transfer|Health professionals|Educational exchanges|Medical education|Health professional education|Partnerships","New Independent States|USA","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABJ988.pdf","6,007 KB","000981 - Pragma Corp.|003366 - TvT Associates","","008291 - USAID.

"This document assesses the performance and impacts of USAID agribusiness programs in Sri Lanka to determine their relative costs and benefits, and derive policy and programmatic lessons for future programs.  The first chapter provides a brief description of the economic and social landscape of Sri Lanka and explains the nature of the five projects which constitute the agribusiness program in the country -- Mahaweli Agricultural and Rural development Project (MARD), Mahaweli Enterprise Development Project (MED), Agroenterprise Project (AgEnt), Enterprise Development Training Program (EDTP), and Commercial Small-Farm Development Program (CSFDP).  The second chapter critically examines the contribution of the program in generating and/or strengthening agribusiness enterprises, commercial farms, and farmer organizations.  The third chapter explores the program's impacts on employment and income generation, the status of women, and the promotion of a climate conductive to the growth of agribusiness sector.  It seeks to determine the benefit small farmers receive from the program.  The fourth chapter presents economic analyses of the MED and MARD programs, the two major components for which adequate economic data were available. Finally, the last section identifies major lessons learned. (1) It is more realistic to promote limited technology transfer and marketing arrangements between international firms and local entrepreneurs than to attract direct foreign investment.  (2) Contract farming emerged as an effective way to link small farmers with agribusiness firms that process and export high value agricultural exports -- as seen in the case of gherkins. (3) Microenterprises can play a significant role in stimulating and expanding the agribusiness sector.  (4) Program designers should consider how the growth of agribusiness will affect women, with special attention to women's ownership of agribusinesses. (5) In economies where domestic markets for commercial crops or value-added processing are not developed, agribusiness programs should try to remove constraints on the domestic market.  (6) The agribusiness program has benefited small farmers and landless laborers, as well as large landowners.  (7) Projects designed to introduce new crops, technologies, and marketing channels can be very costly.  If adoption rates are low and benefits are small, the economic rate of return will be low.","Evaluation highlights: PN-ABG-048","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Agribusiness|Microenterprises|Contract farming","Sri Lanka","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNABT414.pdf","6,854 KB","006727 - Development Alternatives, Inc.

"PACR of a project (7/83-7/93) to develop Pakistan's indigenous energy resources and increase the efficiency of energy use. The project was generally successful.  Major institution-building outputs have been achieved, and many project activities are being sustained by the newly created or enhanced institutions.  The Energy Policy, Planning, and Manpower Development component established an Energy Wing in the Ministry of Planning and Development.  The functions of the Energy Wing have been clearly spelled out, staff have been well-trained (more than 30 candidates were sent to the United States for M.S. training and more than 150 for short-term training), and computers have been installed and an energy database established.  The Wing has already completed a number of important studies and has taken the lead in preparing Pakistan's Five Year Energy Plans. In the area of Indigenous Resource Assessment and Development, the most important accomplishment was the discovery of a major coal deposit in the Thar desert, estimated to contain about 80 billion tons of coal -- 8 times the size of previously known resources and sufficient to support several thousand MW of power generation.  Additionally, the institutional capabilities of the Geological Survey of Pakistan (GSP) were enhanced through U.S. training of 30 personnel and substantive additions of equipment. In other areas, detailed technical and economic feasibility studies for the Lakhra coal mine were completed, but the financial feasibility of coal extraction remained disputed and there was no further significant involvement in the Lakhra project.  Coal briquetting was also developed and tested for household cooking and heating, and proved to be an inexpensive, safe alternative to kerosene and firewood.  Provision of state of the art computers, development of a major mapping data base, and extensive TA and on-the-job training considerably enhanced the capabilities of the Directorate General of Petroleum Concessions (DGPC). The Energy Conservation component provided training in energy audit and conservation technologies, economics, and energy conservation policies.  Energy conservation equipment was supplied to various industries.  The National Energy Conservation Center (ENERCON) was established.  Over 3,000 engineers and 11,000 housewives and working women have attended ENERCON workshops, and the Center's efforts have identified $50 million worth of energy savings in industry.  No significant efforts were undertaken in the area of renewable energy due to lack of consensus between USAID and the Government of Pakistan (GOP). The following lessons were learned.  (1) Considerable difficulty was observed in getting the GOP to issue legislation creating ENERCON and the Energy Wing, and then there were unanticipated delays in the hiring process.  Adequate time for legislation to be issued and staff to be hired should have been  established in the project schedule.  (2) In commodity procurements, full payment should be made only after equipment is received successfully and in order.  (3) USAID should not directly lease space for GOP offices, but provide funds so that the GOP can lease space on its own.  (USAID had considerable difficulty getting the GOP to vacate space USAID had leased.)  (4) A complex construction activity (the ENERCON building) should not have been undertaken so close to the end of the project.  (5) More training in the financial analysis should have been provided to the Energy Wing.  (6) In the coal resources assessment activity, more emphasis should have been given to field drilling.  (7) If the Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA) had bid the Lakhra project as a combined coal mine/power plant project with power plant size open, it would probably have received serious proposals for developing this site.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","12/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Energy conservation|Energy resource development|Energy needs|Energy supply|Energy planning|Energy exploration|Energy policy","Pakistan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABK008.pdf","492 KB","008588 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (8/83-9/94) to eradicate poppy in the Gadoon Amazai area of Northwest Frontier Province (NWFP) in Pakistan. The project was implemented by the Government of NWFP's Planning and Development Department, the United Nations Drug Abuse Control Program, and the Ministry of Narcotics Control. The project was successful in eradicating poppy production in the targeted area, but not without great financial expense (heavily subsidized interventions) and the loss of 13 lives when the Government of Pakistan (GOP) began to destroy the poppy crop and was met with armed resistance from the local population. The project made only minimal progress in the first 3 years as the GOP wanted to wait for visible benefits (in terms of alternative income generation for farmers) before it committed to the project.  After the GOP did commit to the project by enforcing the poppy ban, residents accepted the project, and the project areas have been relatively free of poppy production ever since. However, poppy has appeared in surrounding, less accessible areas, in both Pakistan and Afghanistan.  To counter this trend, project activities were extended into Kala Dhaka in 1990. Prior to the project, Gadoon Amazai was a net food deficit area, with more than 80% of its dietary requirement met through imported grains (the price of which consumed most of the income from opium sales); now the food deficit has been reduced to 15%-20%.  However, the overall value of agricultural production decreased from Rs 216.69 million in 1984-87 (prior to opium suppression) to Rs 166.57 million in 1992-93 (following suppression), a decrease which was partially offset by a 36% increase in the acreage under cultivation, and by the fact that less food imports are needed now. While the project achieved its goal of poppy eradication in targeted areas, there are concerns regarding sustainability now that development initiatives in Gadoon Amazai have ceased. Without forced crop eradication and removal of drug traffickers, poppy will continue to be grown.  While it is promising that the GOP became motivated to enforce a poppy ban, many areas where poppy cropping has spread are beyond its enforcement capabilities.  However, many project initiatives are likely sustainable, e.g., (1) extensive infrastructure construction, including 116 km of roads, 6 clinics, 142 schools (103 for boys, 39 for girls), 30 nonformal education centers for women, 513 surface irrigation schemes and 12 tubewells, electrification of 52 villages, and development of the Gadoon Industrial Estate; (2) an increase in female literacy; (3) a cadre of village social organizers trained under the project and employed in agencies/NGOs; and (4) establishment of a drug abuse prevention resource center. The following lessons were learned.  (1) The combination of development, enforcement, and demand reduction interventions was critical to project success.  (2) NGOs require as long as 4 years to mature and become sustainable.  (3) The standard practice of integrating advisors and GOP counterpart staff creates rather than prevents bottlenecks.  (4) Local professionals may be more effective than long-term expatriate advisors in projects of this kind.  (5) The GOP's lengthy process of transferring funds to the implementing agencies impeded implementation, especially at the outset.  (6) The Project Coordination Units were successful and should be replicated.  (7) The shift from a soft (subsidy-based) approach to a hard (disciplined development) approach in Gadoon, originally perceived as a ""mission impossible,"" was successful and can be replicated.  (8) Audits and reviews of host government implementing agencies should be conducted at least annually during a project.  (9) Identification of Key Performance Indicators is crucial to monitoring.  (10) Host government line agencies and target communities should participate in project design.  (11) Once broad guidelines are agreed on, day-to-day implementation decisions should be made in the field.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","12/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Poppies|Narcotics control|Crop eradication programs|Internal conflict|Law enforcement","Pakistan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABK009.pdf","2,247 KB","008588 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (5/82-6/93) to support the Government of Pakistan's (GOP) Population Welfare Program (PWP), aimed at increasing family planning (FP) service provision. The project proved that contraceptive prevalence rates can be greatly increased in Pakistan, but the financial and institutional commitment of the GOP is not sufficient to sustain this achievement without assistance. The contraceptive procurement component, on which nearly two-thirds of project funds were spent, met the PWP's entire need for contraceptives up until the early 1990s and ensured the availability of at least a 1-year supply of contraceptives at all times.  Other notable achievements included institutionalization of a contraceptive logistics management system, establishment of a central warehouse, nationwide distribution of a contraceptive logistics manual and training in its use, and in-country training and third country study tours for mid- to senior-level managers. The institution-building component strengthened Pakistani research capacity by establishing the semi-autonomous National Institute of Population Studies, which produced a number of important studies, including the State of the Population in Pakistan (1987) and the Pakistan Demographic and Health Survey 1990/91.  This component also supported efforts of the National Research Institute for Fertility Control and operations research for program monitoring and evaluation. Training efforts had mixed results.  On the positive side, the training of over 8,000 health workers in 1,800 facilities helped to integrate FP service delivery into the national health care system, and helped 3 women's NGOs to establish a national NGO training organization which strengthened women's managerial and technical skills.  On the negative side, professional training, especially graduate training, lagged severely, due more to the project's design than to its implementation. In addition, the NGO Coordinating Council (NGOCC), which had been initiated with project assistance and which during the project increased its members from 9 to 126 and its service delivery outlets from 93 to 563, foundered when project funding was withdrawn. The IEC component helped the GOP to launch a FP communication strategy and plan of action which spurred an unprecedented partnership between population planners and media professionals, resulting in ""Aahat,"" the nation's first FP social drama, as well as radio, TV, and newspaper spots, and seminars for policymakers and media professionals. These efforts increased positive attitudes toward FP from 65% to 75% and affected the FP behaviors of about 10% of those who watched the series. Finally, the service delivery component supported the efforts of 77 NGOs which operated over 200 service outlets providing about 650,000 couple-years of protection annually.  It also successfully tested 30 community-based distribution models which have led to the most dramatic results of any FP project in Pakistan, increasing contraceptive prevalence rates in 6 pilot areas from 11.5% to 39%.  Training of 349 doctors and nurses in voluntary surgical contraception (VSC) and counseling significantly increased provision of VSC. The following lessons were learned.  (1) Strong and unwavering political commitment is a prerequisite to a successful FP program.  (2) The PWP's highly centralized and politicized infrastructure greatly reduced its efficiency and effectiveness. (3) NGOs will continue to play a vital role in FP in Pakistan. (4) To be effective, an NGO coordinating body must become a legally constituted organization, independent of government interference.  This was not the case with the NGOCC.  (5) Well-planned and well-implemented community-based programs can be as successful in Pakistan as elsewhere in South Asia; in this project they raised the contraceptive prevalence rate to about 40%, a level nearing that of Bangladesh, in under 2 years' time. (6) Integration of FP into primary health care through the existing health network is critical because it increases FP acceptability.  (7) A woman-to-woman approach increases the accessibility and acceptability of FP services in restricted societies.  (8) The allocation of so much funding for contraceptive procurement left little for institution building, management training, IEC, and counseling.  (9) The method mix remained much too weighted toward condoms and other less effective methods.  In this connection, it is noteworthy that, apart from voluntary surgical contraception (VSC), which is unavailable at most MOH health units, clients who attended these units appeared to select more effective contraceptive methods (e.g., injectables, IUDs, and orals) than those attending FP centers.  (10) Operations research (OR) is a quick, flexible tool for resolving program barriers.  In this project, small OR studies produced results that led to changes in target setting, method mix, staffing for service facilities, and training of village workers. As for sustainability, while the project contributed in some areas, it failed in others, principally in developing the public sector's capacity to provide effective clinical methods, conduct IEC, and implement training programs.  The project also failed in two areas important to financial sustainability -- development of cost recovery strategies and of a plan to free the GOP from reliance on donated contraceptives.  This was evident from the severe cutbacks NGOs were forced to take when USAID funding ceased.  However, NGOs now report that they have learned their lesson:  they have been somewhat successful in diversifying their resource base; they have been creative in getting corporate commitments for services or products; and they have accepted the concept of fee for service.  Likewise, the GOP has developed its tender procedures for procuring contraceptives and has recognized that revenues generated from contraceptive sales can be used for refilling supplies.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","12/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Population programs|Family planning promotion programs|Family planning services|Family planning education|Contraceptive prevalence|Beneficiary count","Pakistan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABK010.pdf","833 KB","008588 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (5/83-6/93) to increase the efficient, reliable, and equitable distribution of irrigation water in Pakistan. The project met most of its objectives, though its sustainability is in question.  More specifically, it:  (1) rehabilitated 1,581 km of canals and 5,500 km of drains; (2) provided the four Provincial Irrigation Departments (PIDs) the institutional capability to collect hydraulic and sedimentation data and perform computer-aided designs, thus simplifying future redesigns and potentially saving substantial amounts in operation and maintenance (O&M) for the enormous Indus Basin irrigation system; (3) upgraded O&M by preparing manuals and cost guidelines, ensuring that PIDs received adequate O&M funds, and developing a plan for full O&M cost recovery by 1997 (although it is doubtful the plan will be implemented in its entirety); and (4) improved the institutional capabilities of PIDs and central line agencies via computerization, improved information and personnel management, extensive TA and training, and provision of equipment to improve mechanical engineering.  The project trained 13 Ph.D.'s, 78 M.S.'s, and 91 B.S.'s, and held short courses overseas for 549 persons and in Pakistan for 2,590. In the command water management component, the project:  (1) completed extensive civil works, rehabilitating 1,351 watercourses, establishing over 1,000 demonstration plots, precision leveling of 20,000 acres, setting up 8 weather stations and 48 water-level recording stations, and constructing demonstration field drains; (2) established more than 1,000 water users associations; (3) supported numerous technical interventions and innovations; and (4) solved the politically destabilizing water shortage in North West Frontier Province by replacing pumps and electric motors in the Warsak Life Canal Pump House. Research accomplishments included, inter alia, 8 water management studies and a vast program of very successful research conducted under an agreement with International Irrigation Management Institute, including 22 studies by Pakistani entities. The following lessons were learned.  (1) Achievement of sustainable development in Pakistan will require extensive institutional and political reform.  Not only are the private sector, community groups, farmers, and individuals at the mercy of an unsympathetic government which regulates every activity in the country, but the huge, unwieldy, and inefficient bureaucracy consumes most of the already scarce funds in salaries and administrative costs, leading to dependence on donor support to restore facilities that are constantly deteriorating.  The key lesson here is the need to carry out assessments of a country's institutional capability before undertaking a development project.  (2) While rehabilitation of irrigation infrastructure was a suitable project objective, the effect will be lost in 3-5 years unless sustainability is assured.  (3) Expatriate TA is not needed in Pakistan for projects like this, as there is a wide base of indigenous expertise.  (4) U.S. training should be limited to graduate and postgraduate levels; U.S. short courses had little to offer, and the nominating process for these was abused by the GOP.  (5) It is more efficient to procure commodities through the GOP under USAID supervision rather than through procurement service agents.  Also, donors should emphasize use of the private sector in providing construction equipment and workshop support to PIDs. The project has only limited sustainability due in part to the Pressler amendment, which curtailed project efforts at a crucial stage of policy dialogue.  Although the project did bring about a significant change in the attitudes of GOP policy makers toward irrigation and the entire agricultural sector, there are still vested interests standing in the way of efforts to privatize, democratize, and modernize the sector. Adequate future GOP funding for O&M and for computer and irrigation equipment needs is by no means assured, while water user associations need more power so they can levy taxes themselves and be less dependent on the Pakistani bureaucracy.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","10/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural water management|Irrigation system construction|Institution building|Government departments|Personnel development|Agricultural research|Participants|Water supply structure maintenance","Pakistan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABK011.pdf","845 KB","008588 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to reduce the intensity of onchocercal infections in the Suchitepequez Province in Guatemala. Evaluation covers the period 1992-12/94. Overall, the Suchitepequez Ivermectin Distribution Program and its successor, the National Plan for the Elimination of Onchocerciasis, were a success.  In 4 rounds of treatment, the program distributed 130,289 doses of ivermectin to persons living in isolated locations where onchocerciasis is hyperendemic.  It demonstrated that a collaborative program, supported by organizations very different in nature, can work. In addition, the program showed that ivermectin can be distributed in Guatemala without fear of serious adverse physical reactions. Community-based distributors were effective agents for a public health mass-distribution program.  This experience could be applied to other health activities, such as tuberculosis or helminth control. The program documented the prevalence and intensity of onchocerciasis in a variety of geographic areas through an extensive epidemiology and health information system. Perhaps the program's most important accomplishment is that it stimulated the development of a National Plan for the Elimination of Onchocerciasis in Guatemala (NPEO).  At the end of the second year, the Suchitepequez project became the basis for the National Plan, using its basic infrastructure.  Lessons learned from the first 2 years helped in the subsequent reorganization of the program. However, the project did have significant problems.  Leadership difficulties impaired the efficiency of the project and reduced its effectiveness.  Communication between participating organizations was universally identified as the weakest area, and prevented effective team work. Another problem involved the health information system, which collected too much information.  Much of this information was not processed or communicated in a way that was useful for project decision-making.  The problem lay in both the form of its dissemination and the capacity of managers to interpret and use it. Other difficulties included the following.  (1) The full potential of community-based distributors was not realized.  (2) Supervision and in-service training for the brigadistas was difficult.  (3) Training materials for community-based distributors were insufficient.  (4) Ivermectin delivery was overly centralized; many treatment personnel were not living near or in the treatment area and the project had to depend on brigadistas.  In addition, the integration of diagnostic, motivation, and treatment elements was slow.  (5) Quality control measures were instituted late and incompletely.  (6) Community mobilization and awareness about onchocerciasis could have been stronger; only minimal educational materials were available, and attempts to sensitize finca (agricultural estate) managers and owners about onchocerciasis seemed weak. Had funds allowed, an entomological component to study the effects of a mass-distribution program on transmission of infection would have been most instructive. At the conclusion of this report, various recommendations are made concerning approaches to strengthening the National Plan, which will begin functioning in a new structure shortly.

"Final evaluation of a grant (1992-94) to the Business Management Extension Program (BMEP) to support small business development in Swaziland.  A financial sustainability plan for BMEP is included in the evaluation. The BMEP provides small enterprise training and extension services, and also has a small credit component.  In the first two areas, BMEP largely met the requirements of the 1992 revised Cooperative Agreement with USAID.  Between 10/1/92 and 8/26/94 BMEP conducted 7 full-time training programs for 104 people (65 men and 39 women), 44 of whom were active extension clients of BMEP.  In addition, BMEP's three extension officers each attained the required 20 clients, and it is estimated that 100 clients were reached over a 2-year period.  On the negative side, BMEP's credit portfolio was unable to meet the standards established for its performance as to either size or quality, and BMEP's training program is not performing in a satisfactory manner and is grossly underutilized, even though training is considered a key element of the program. A financial sustainability study suggests that by 1997 BMEP could support a little more than 50% of its recurrent expenses out of internally generated income.  As a result, BMEP will require a subsidy of 40-45% over the long term. Although BMEP faces a severe challenge in attaining institutional sustainability, the organization starts from a solid base.  It has a well-respected director, an energetic board of directors, and a reputation of providing quality business advisory and training services to a distinct market segment.  It is also capable of generating significant revenues even though it has not previously provided services strictly on a fee-for-service basis. In addition, the fact that BMEP will continue to rely on donor funds should not pose a problem, since BMEP is serving a market that is of interest to local, regional, and international donors. Increasing board size and sectoral diversity coupled with training and deep involvement in the strategic and marketing planning processes will be a major step toward BMEP's attainment of its goals.  The organization's market and financial sustainability will be possible with staff realignment, further development of technical skills, along with slight modifications to product content and delivery, and a new attitude toward attracting clients.","Delivery order no. 8|Final version|Earlier version: PD-ABJ-834","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","PCE-0026-Q-00-3031-00","","11/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Business enterprises|Small scale enterprises|Entrepreneurs|Business support services|Management training|Extension services|Credit|Institution building|Economic self sufficiency","Swaziland","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABK084.pdf","3,308 KB","006727 - Development Alternatives, Inc.

"Evaluates a project to help the Government of Cape Verde (GOCV) to establish a national Center for Investment and Export Promotion (PROMEX) to promote export-led growth.  The evaluation focuses on project compliance with Section 547 of Public Law 103-87, which prohibits funding of activities that might cause loss of U.S. jobs, and with USAID's related Policy Determination 20 (PD-20). The primary focus of the project has been institution building; PROMEX is fully staffed, with 17 employees, and functions well as an investment and export promotion agency.  Institution building has been supplemented by studies and specialized TA in areas which required expertise not available in-house.  In coming years, PROMEX will continue institutional strengthening while increasing direct promotional activities.  PROMEX has identified three target sectors -- light manufacturing, tourism, and fisheries -- and two target regions, Europe (primarily Portugal) and Asia (primarily Hong Kong).  PROMEX will also continue efforts to raise awareness among local businesses, and provide training to local entrepreneurs in such areas as joint ventures, investment appraisal, and other basic techniques to encourage export development. Section 547 prohibits the use of U.S. funds to (1) provide financial incentives to U.S. enterprises to relocate abroad, (2) establish or develop export processing zones (EPZs), if such activities are likely to result in the loss of U.S. jobs, or (3) provide assistance which would contribute to the violation of internationally recognized workers' rights.  PD-20 expands on Section 547 by making it USAID policy to terminate any activity that would lead to the loss of U.S. jobs through any action, not only through financial incentives. The evaluation found that there is no reasonable likelihood of relocation of U.S. jobs as a result of the project.  The EPZ feasibility study originally planned would have violated Section 547 and PD-20; however, as the EPZ study component has already been canceled to avoid conflict with other U.S. laws, this is no longer an issue.  Also, internationally recognized workers rights are guaranteed by the Cape Verdean Labor Code and the project does not support any activity that would violate those rights. In fact, Cape Verde does not present an attractive investment location for U.S. enterprises due to poor international transportation capacities (e.g., shipping and air freight connections), lack of adequate industrial space, high cost of basic utilities, and distance from the United States.  Further, historical investment patterns indicate that there is no interest from U.S. investors at this time. Lastly, PROMEX's planned promotional efforts do not include any promotion to U.S. investors. It is recommended that USAID/Cape Verde (1) reiterate that support for EPZ development is not allowed under the project, (2) inform PROMEX and the institutional contractor of the relevant provisions of Section 547 and the contents of PD-20, (3) develop a monitoring system that periodically reviews the project in light of Section 547, and (4) prepare a compliance report stating that the project is not in violation of 547 and PD-20.","Delivery order no.

"USAID's Mahaweli Environmental Project (MEP) responded to donor concerns about the omission of environmental concerns and the rapid destruction of dwindling natural forest habitats under the Government Sri Lanka's (GOSL) Accelerated Mahaweli Development Program (AMDP). This assessment of USAID's approach under the MEP groups findings in three sections:  outcomes of the strategies employed; overall impacts; and effectiveness, sustainability, and replicability.  (1) Development of protected areas, institutional capacities, and policies to support biodiversity conservation has had some success, but has proceeded slowly.  The MEP helped the GOSL to establish and demarcate seven new protected areas and institutional capacity to manage protected areas has been expanded.  However, the GOSL has yet to develop a viable forest habitat protection system or a scientifically-based national land use policy to guide forest habitat protection and wildlife conservation; a key weakness has been a lack of coordination among GOSL agencies. Finally, the strategy of creating a private environmental trust to support public education and awareness has had limited results.  (2) The most visible impact of support for habitat protection under the MEP has been a halt in human settlement and agricultural cultivation within the new protected areas; however, the establishment of national parks and protected areas has been accompanied by the fragmentation of remaining forests into ""island habitats"", surrounded by commercial agriculture and population settlements, which may not be adequate in the long run to sustain wildlife biodiversity.  The immediate socioeconomic effect of resettlement of park dwellers to areas outside the park is positive. However, land allocation schemes are providing too small a land base to support more than one generation through agricultural production, laying the foundation for future encroachment on protected forest areas.  The impact of park creation on households bordering the parks is slightly negative. There has been no apparent increase in tourism in the main parks as a result of the project.  (3) Among households formerly residing within the new park areas, those resettled into the new irrigation schemes of the Mahaweli system appear to do better than those displaced to areas bordering parks and wildlife sanctuaries.  In regard to sustainability, the survival of many wildlife species in the Mahaweli system is unlikely without assisting regeneration of degraded forest habitats and consolidating these habitats into biologically viable units. Finally, the experiences and lessons learned in protected area creation and management have not been replicated elsewhere in the country or by other public or private agencies.  Lessons learned included:  (1) spreading investments in forest habitat protection among several organizations/institutions may be preferable to fully subscribing to any one entity; and (2) efforts must be made to insulate environmental trusts or foundations from political manipulation, which sows confusion and leads to mismanagement.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","3/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Environmental protection|Forests|Genetic resource conservation|Wildlife resources|Protected wildlife areas","Sri Lanka","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNABT449.pdf","1,846 KB","008058 - USAID.

"From 1987 to 1990, USAID supported a community conservation and development effort, called The Environmental Awareness and Mobilization (TEAM) project, in 47 villages in buffer zones around Thailand's Khao Yai National Park.  The project, implemented by Wildlife Fund of Thailand, included an environmental education program in all 47 villages; the creation of Environmental Protection Societies (EPS) in 10 villages; and the introduction in EPS villages of improved farming methods and new household enterprises (e.g., fruit tree cultivation, livestock raising).  Results have been mixed.  On the positive side, environmental awareness efforts were very successful, even among villagers with low literacy and income levels; illegal logging, hunting, and farming have declined in all TEAM villages; the introduction of new technologies has helped to raise community living standards; and participating Thai environmental NGOs have sharpened their awareness of and capacity for forest habitat protection.  On the other hand, evidence of regeneration of forest and wildlife resources remains spotty; EPS activities, while continuing at a relatively high level in 7 of the 10 villages, still need assistance from Thai NGOs; environmental awareness at the governmental level is only beginning; and external pressures from land development and increased tourism places the long-term viability of Khao Yai National Park seriously in doubt.  Also, while TEAM correctly selected a low-income area as a target population, its strict eligibility requirements put project loans beyond the reach of the most important target households (the landless and wage earners). Appendices include a discussion of protected areas in Thailand, profiles of Khao Yai Park and of TEAM villages, and a bibliography.","Evaluation highlights: PN-ABG-046","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","3/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Biological diversity|Protected wildlife areas|Natural resource management|Environmental education|Natural resource utilization|Environmental protection|Buffer zones","Thailand","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNABT450.pdf","1,549 KB","008058 - USAID.

"USAID support for Royal Chitwan National Park in Nepal has focused on promoting a partnership between government and local communities in the protection and management of precious biodiversity resources.  This case study assesses the various interventions supported by USAID and identifies lessons learned and unresolved issues.  Major USAID interventions have included TA and training to strengthen public and local institutions, use of NGOs to test options for protected area management and to develop alternative livelihood activities, support for management-related scientific research, promotion of environmental education, and support for policy reform. According to the report, these interventions have paid off.  The strategy of making local communities part of the conservation solution rather than part of the problem has resulted in spontaneous rehabilitation of degraded buffer areas (especially for thatch grasses), enthusiastic local participation in controlling poaching, villager willingness to relocate from areas of wildlife protection, and an increase in the populations of the park's endangered species.  Support for Chitwan has also increased tourism (now the major source of park revenue as well as a benefit to the local economy) and established the value of scientific research to park planning and management.  Several lessons emerge from this experience. (1) An authoritarian approach does not help to conserve biologically rich areas on which local people depend.  (2) Understanding the status and management requirements of endangered species both inside and outside the park is critical to the sustainable protection of biological resources.  (3) Umbrella grants to NGOs can be a highly effective means of promoting biodiversity conservation. Much more needs to be done, however.  The environmental and economic impact of increased tourism remains decidedly unclear, and the continuance of illegal hunting, livestock grazing, and fuelwood collection indicates that the search for alternative sources of livelihood must continue.  Several appendices and a bibliography expand material presented in the body of the report. Of particular importance is an exploration of recent policy changes promoting greater involvement of local populations in managing protected areas and surrounding buffer zones.","Evaluation highlights: PN-ABG-049","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","3/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Natural resource conservation|Natural resource management|Protected environmental areas|Community participation|Environmental protection|Biological diversity","Nepal","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNABT451.pdf","2,072 KB","008058 - USAID.

"Madagascar represents USAID's largest recipient of support for the conservation of biodiversity.  This assessment examines the changes introduced by USAID's assistance, especially that provided via its ""SAVEM"" (Sustainable Approaches to Viable Environmental Management) and ""KEPEM"" (Knowledge and Effective Policies for Environmental Management) projects. approach includes institutional support financed through a debt-for-nature swap and conservation activities in specific protected areas financed through development grants.  Major findings are as follows.  (1) USAID has played a central role in launching the National Association for Management of Protected Areas (ANGAP), a quasi NGO which has assumed day to day coordination of Madagascar's protected areas program, but creation of ANGAP has thus far made little difference at the field level.  (2) USAID's plan reserves a predominant role for international and indigenous NGOs, however support to local NGOS from international NGOs has been limited.  (3) Including women staff members apparently increases the likelihood of success. (4) Debt swaps can provide a cushion from which programs can develop financial sustainability.  (5) The potential of ecotourism to enhance financial sustainability requires a longer lead time than expected.  (6) Protected area management should provide latitude for experimentation; the functions of coordination and control must not constrain individual protected areas' efforts to test specific approaches.  (7) For peripheral zone development to be successful, technical inputs need to be well planned and well explained to villagers.  (8) Incorporation of local stakeholders into the design and management of protected areas is important to the long-term acceptance of a protected area by local residents.  (9) Recruitment of local forest outreach agents provides a cost-effective means of encouraging local participation in conservation and development programs.","Summary highlights: PN-ABS-508","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","10/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Biological diversity|Protected wildlife areas|Natural resource management|Community participation|Human encroachment|Natural resource development","Madagascar","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNABT452.pdf","1,648 KB","008058 - USAID.

"The Forest Resources for a Stable Environment (FORESTA) project, initiated in 1990 to improve management of Costa Rica's Central ""Cordillera"" Volcanic Conservation Area (ACCVC), is evaluated in this report.  FORESTA's primary achievements include support for creation of a Costa Rican NGO -- the ACCVC Development Foundation (FUNDECOR) -- to coordinate management of the ACCVC; provision of physical facilities; support for the National Park Services' (SPN's) Protection Program to track logging, hunting, and farming within the ACCVC's boundaries; introduction of geographic information system (GIS) tools for land management; initiation of a revenue management system allowing parks to retain and use 75% of revenues generated from park use; and development of contracting procedures for local vendors to work within the ACCVC. Less positively, FUNDECOR and SON have yet to develop arrangements for monitoring habitat conditions and wildlife populations; public environmental education has been sporadic and is in need of greater staff and resources; and FUNDECOR has not taken advantage of TA and training opportunities available from and the U.S. National Park Service.  In terms of impact, the project has made local populations more supportive of SPN efforts, and forest habitats are being regenerated and restored. Nonetheless, there is no firm evidence of a positive impact on park encroachment or visitor behavior; the ACCVC's biological integrity continues to be threatened by private landholdings; and the benefits of increased tourism have yet to accrue to local communities in any significant way.  Overall sustainability remains uncertain both economically, due to the ACCVC's heavy dependence on income from tourism, and politically, since FUNDECOR has not yet secured a clear mandate from either the public or the private sector. Objectives of this uniquely Costa Rican project would be advanced by an unambiguous land tenure policy facilitating land consolidation, as well as by regulation to ensure environmentally sound nature tourism. Appendices include background on the Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve and on Costa Rican biodiversity in general.","Evaluation highlights: PN-ABS-502","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","6/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Protected environmental areas|Forest resources|Natural resource management|Natural resource conservation|Biological diversity|Volcanic soils","Costa Rica","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNABT453.pdf","1,480 KB","008058 - USAID.

"From 1989-1993, USAID implemented the Protected Areas Resource Conservation Project (PARC) project, aimed at providing Jamaica with the legal, institutional, and financial foundations for a national park system.  This report reviews the achievements, impact, and effectiveness of the project.  Key achievements of PARC included:  creating Jamaica's first system of national parks under the aegis of the newly established Natural Resources Conservation Authority (NRCA); creating two pilot parks -- Montego Bay Marine Park (MBMP) and Blue and John Crow Mountain National Park (BJCMNP); helping to establish an endowment fund for conservation efforts, as well as a Conservation Data Center; fostering the involvement of national and local NGOs in biological conservation and of local participation in pilot park planning and management; introducing rapid ecological assessment techniques; introducing boat mooring buoys to protect coral reefs in MBMP; heightening public awareness of the importance of biodiversity conservation; and generating employment.  The impacts of these interventions have been mixed, however.  While PARC has generally reduced illegal fishing, farming, and logging by local populations, it has had only a limited effect on reducing practices of polluters outside the parks:  coral reef and forest habitat degradation persist in the new national parks. In addition, the economic opportunities provided by increased tourism must be balanced against negative impacts on local spear and trap fishers. All in all, PARC has not yet proven to be a cost-effective way to protect and restore Jamaica's biological resources, and neither the NRCA, nor the politically dominated local committees, nor the endowment fund, as currently constituted, provide for the park system's long-term sustainability.  PARC demonstrates the need for (1) clear goals and visions and a long-term commitment to biological diversity conservation programs, and (2) complementing the establishment of parks with measures to address external threats to park resources.  Appendices include profiles of the new parks, indicators for monitoring the impact of park management, and a bibliography.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","11/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Natural resource conservation|Biological diversity|Protected environmental areas","Jamaica","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNABT454.pdf","6,419 KB","008058 - USAID.

"In 1983, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development's Development Assistance Committee (DAC) developed ""Guiding Principles to Aid Agencies for Supporting the Role of Women in Development (WID),"" which were updated in 1989. This evaluation of the success of DAC members in institutionalizing these principles into their development activities is based on a desk review of DAC/WID monitoring reports, a survey of 21 member countries (Canada and Australia also made available assessments of WID policies by their own country agencies), and case studies of 5 DAC member organizations.  Chapter 2 makes a comparative analysis of the success of each DAC member organization in incorporating the WID principles into its mandates and policies, administrative measures, and implementation procedures, as well as in coordinating and sharing WID information with other development organizations. Chapter 3 identifies factors that were enabling to the adoption and implementation of the principles, and those which were constraining.  Chapter 4 draws conclusions.  In general, DAC's WID principles have been institutionalized within all DAC member agencies, and resulting WID policies and measures have succeeded in increasing women's participation in development; institutionalization of WID has been enabled by the inclusion of WID as a development priority, support from high-level management, the development of an operationally feasible WID policy, and action plans that included useful administrative measures, collaborative, professional relationships among WID and other agency staff, adequate funding and staffing, and international networking.  Two factors outside DAC's purview also had a positive influence on institutionalization:  a strong domestic WID lobby, and a strong national policy on gender equality.  The paucity of data on WID projects is due to the fact that donors have not yet established quantitative and qualitative measures by which to track the progress of WID achievements. The chapter includes recommendations.","Related French document: PN-ABX-438","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","11/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Women in development|Development organizations|Institutional aspects|Donor coordination|Development policy|Development planning","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAX296.pdf","2,027 KB","005718 - Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).

"PACR of a pilot project (7/92-9/94) to support community-based drug abuse prevention and education activities in the Eastern Caribbean.  The National Association of the Partners of the Americas, Inc. (NAPA) and the Florida Association of Voluntary Agencies for Caribbean Action (FAVA/CA) implemented the project. Through the project, information on drug abuse prevention and education was disseminated widely at the grass roots level, with parents and youth in the target communities participating in workshops and outreach programs.  In Grenada and Dominica, the project was particularly successful in augmenting government programs funded by the UN Drug Control Program.  Quantitative achievements included:  needs assessments in all participating countries; 44 small grants for innovative. community-based drug and alcohol abuse programs; 25 short-term TA missions by NAPA and FAVA/CA volunteers; attendance of 12 persons from the Caribbean at U.S. training programs and conferences; and 5 regional workshops, including 3 training workshops (in peer counseling, community mobilization, and drug abuse prevention through sports), attended by 94 people, and 1 planning and 1 evaluation workshop. The following lessons were learned.  (1) Local NAPA partnerships need to be strengthened.  The project could have achieved more if it had addressed the institutional weaknesses which constrain the local NAPA partnerships.  Despite their good intentions, these strictly volunteer organizations lack the support staff needed to execute development programs of any magnitude.  (2) Adequate funds must be provided for project staff (in this case, the regional substance abuse advisor) to travel to participating islands.  There also seemed to be a lack of clarity regarding the respective roles of the regional advisor, who was based in Montserrat, and the Washington-based project manager.  (3) NAPA and FAVA/CA volunteers provided excellent and cost-effective TA. If the project had had to acquire this TA through other means, the number of TA missions would have been significantly reduced. (4) The project's use of NGOs proved an effective means of reaching people at the grassroots level, especially as many Eastern Caribbean governments do not have the mechanisms in place to mount a sustained drug education program. While the project was intended to be the first phase of a long-term effort, funding cuts and the subsequent decision to close RDO/C precluded a follow-on effort.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","9/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Private voluntary organizations|Drug abuse education|Community based delivery|Local groups|Institutional aspects","Eastern Caribbean","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABK121.pdf","154 KB","007707 - USAID.

"Evaluates umbrella project to support the efforts of indigenous NGOs to test improved methods for providing basic education to disadvantaged blacks in South Africa (ESAT project).  Interim evaluation covers the period 1986-93. This largely successful, well-managed project is on target in meeting its purposes and planned outputs.  The greatest portion of project funds (86%) have been invested in 81 NGOs working in the project's seven focus areas (models for decentralized education, curriculum development and educational planning, professional teachers' skills upgrading, expanded access to secondary education, post-secondary school remediation, applied adult literacy training, and preparation for schooling and primary education), with a very small portion invested in TA buy-ins and service contracts. Based on a sample of 30 grantees, impact of service provision has been substantial, far exceeding the project paper's modest expectations. According to grantee reports, tens of thousands of South Africans have received direct or indirect benefits as a result of education providers trained, teachers whose skills have been upgraded, materials which have been developed to help students pass examinations, and lessons from adult educators trained through literacy programs.  Unfortnately, the project reached only an insignificant portion of beneficiaries in any given focus area, and while some pilot projects have developed useful models adoptable by the government, these models have not yet been tested to scale, the stage at which promising pilot projects often fail; the success of the pilot projects is largely due to the efforts of an enthusiastic staff concerned less with remuneration than with reaching their goal.  As the pilots are taken over by the government and civil servants, they may lose momentum; it is thus not yet safe to say that a particular model or approach will be effective at scale. No additional grantees should be added to the portfolio.  The project may have already funded most of the organizations that qualify for and have the capacity to absorb USAID funds, and the grantee-to-management staff ratio is already so high that adding to the portfolio could compromise program quality.  On a positive note, the project should consolidate activities in areas where NGOs are likely to continue playing a major role in direct service provision (i.e., adult basic education and pre-school education), as governments tend to retain matters such as curriculum development and teacher education for themselves. Support for NGO participation in the educational policy debates also should be continued, as it is a new niche for NGOs and one in which they have valuable experiences to share with policymakers. Finally, the project should increase efforts at systematic reflection and in building grantee organizational, project evaluation, and curriculum review capacities. Lessons learned are as follows.  (1) ESAT has provided financial and technical support to NGOs in an increasingly cost-effective manner and provides a potential model for USAID-NGO collaboration in other countries even apart from success factors unique to the South African context. Transferable factors include the absence of institutional contractors, high levels of funding, strong project staff, clear mission strategies and policies, use of centrally funded buy-ins for technical support, creative use of market forces, and built-in quality control and improvement mechanisms.  (2) ESAT has demonstrated that an aggressive strategy against the inequities of apartheid, as opposed to business-as-usual, constructive engagement policy advocated in the U.S. administration in 1986, was justified and productive. In short, Congress was right, and given powerful backing underwritten by substantial appropriations, USAID/SA was able to both fulfill the political agenda of Congress and actively engage in helping South Africa's education sector reform itself.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","3/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Basic education|Racial groups|Disadvantaged groups|Educational development|Indigenous private voluntary organizations","South Africa","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABK123.pdf","4,056 KB","000461 - Education Development Center, Inc.

"Since 1991, USAID has supported a major post-civil war recovery project in El Salvador.  This report, prepared by USAID/El Salvador, documents the following lessons learned during the project's first 3 years.  (1) War recovery initiatives should include expert training for USAID management and staff in conflict resolution/consensus building as well as a reconciliation and consensus building component involving the two belligerent parties and USAID.  These initiatives should also include beneficiaries in program design and implementation and avoid the compulsion to meet all the needs that are bound to arise, making certain, however, that humanitarian needs are met immediately after the conflict has ceased.  (2) Adding war recovery components to existing projects or utilizing available host country owned local currency (HCOLC) can be very effective in ensuring fast start-up of implementation.  (3) The Mission must retain the freedom to use some funds for politically unpopular purposes.  It should also make sure that all organizations, public and private, being considered for an implementation role understand and support project objectives (and should not assume that institutions that have worked well with USAID in other areas will necessarily work well in a war recovery project).  (4) TA will be required in dealing with activities for the war-wounded such as surgery, prosthetic devices, and post-war traumatic disorders.  (5) Either the host government or the donor will have to support ex-combatants until they start earning income.  (6) If a project is designed without consideration of the special needs of women, they may not be able to benefit equitably from the project.  (7) The structure and timing of assistance to the agricultural sector are critical. (8) War recovery projects require a flexible structure capable of multisectoral implementation, participation of NGOs, local coordination with other donors, and, where there is unusual interest in Washington in the project, a sophisticated management information system.","Informal series title: Rebuilding societies emerging from conflict","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","10/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","War recovery|Civil war|Development project design|Conflict resolution|Post conflict societies","El Salvador","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNABT659.pdf","3,178 KB","008540 - USAID.

"This report evaluates the impact of four water and sanitation projects in Bolivia that are sponsored either by USAID or other agencies:  CARE; Community and Child Health (CCH); pilot Project Yacupaj under United Nations Development Program/World Bank (UNDP); and UNICEF. The projects generally use output indicators to monitor their progress in terms of number of systems constructed.  Only one project, CARE, routinely monitors impacts by collecting nutritional and diarrheal disease data every 3 to 6 months.  CCH did gather baseline diarrhea incidence data and is slated to conduct another follow-up survey later this year.  No project measures infant mortality according to the Family Health Strategic Objective of improving child survival. Quantitative data from CARE projects indicated a positive impact on child health as related to nutritional status and diarrheal disease incidence.  The projects in the Altiplano were able to demonstrate a decrease in 2-week diarrheal incidence from 27% in 1993 to 7% in 1994 and in Chuquibamba from 27% to 21% over the same time period.  Among children 12-23 months old in the Altiplano/Valle areas, the prevalence of moderate malnutrition decreased from 66% to 53%, while severe malnutrition declined from about 24% to about 14%.  In Chuquisaca/Cochabamba, the data show that children 1-2 years old experienced the most improvement in nutritional status:  from 78% prevalence to 55% among the moderately malnourished group and 32% to 19% in the severely malnourished group. Since 1991, the Subsistema Nacional de Informacion en Salud (SNIS) system has included national data on diarrheal disease and nutritional status.  If one uses 1992 as a baseline, there has been a consistent drop in the incidence of disease in 9 out of the 12 reporting areas. The most significant decrease was demonstrated in Pando (248 to 136 cases/1,000).  For the country as a whole, there was a 16% decrease from 1992 to 1993. Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) data for children under 6 months of age show that the prevalence of diarrhea decreased from 25% in 1989 to 17% in 1994. The linkages among water supply projects are provided through Direccion Nacional de Saneamiento Basico (DINASBA), which has initiated activities aimed at ensuring coordination among the various technical and financial cooperation agencies and institutions through technical meetings with representatives from the government, NGOs, and PVOs. The coordination of other donors involved in water supply activities comes, in part, through DINASBA.  Through a UNDP initiative, an operational matrix was established that lists and defines the role and objectives of each project and program with a view toward providing clear guidelines for the participation of international agencies. Project sustainability is mainly achieved through community participation in system administration.  It is not clear if the Government of Bolivia (GOB) has attained increased institutional capacity to finance and provide support for these communities once the donors depart.  The bulk of funding comes from the donors, with the communities investing on average 30% of the capital start-up costs. The overriding community selection criteria common to all projects appear to be the community's willingness to participate in administration, operation, and maintenance, plus its ability to pay recurrent costs.  The availability of good quality water is another selection criterion all projects use.  All projects do not use the criteria of need for services due to lack of resources (i.e., poverty, lack of access to services) and health status (mortality rates, diarrheal disease burden, or malnutrition). Projects use a similar process to choose the design of their systems. Considerations include population requirements, water resources, operation and maintenance, and the community's capacity to administer the system.  The actual engineering components (materials and specifications), although not assessed in depth due to limited evaluation time, show some variation. CCH and CARE Programs have health components. While the projects may not necessarily have strengthened GOB water and sanitation directly, they have had a powerful impact on community development and democratization.  This is demonstrated by the sustained activities of the water committees, the involvement of women, and the additional improvements in the systems which many communities have made on their own.  For example, one community organized itself and paid an extraordinary amount to hire a lawyer to claim its water rights.  The projects have had a profound impact on women's time, generating multiple social and child health benefits. It was not possible to determine true cost-effectiveness, due to the paucity of health impact data.  Two cost-utility estimates were made, based on a mix of a qualitative and quantitative data and expected health impacts derived from project inputs and outcome measures.  The analysis yielded results that generally favor lower cost programs (due to economies of scale) which use simpler technologies and include health education, sanitation, community participation, and emphasis on the concept of the user as a client.

"The Sector Policy Reform Program (SPR) has proved itself an effective substitute for the unconditioned cash transfers of the past two decades. It has succeeded in pushing forward the Government of Egypt's (GOE's) Economic Reform and Structural Adjustment Program (ERSAP), while accommodating the constraints imposed on policy lending by the special political circumstances of U.S. aid to Egypt.  Despite the earmark and its implications for the credibility of conditionality, the GOE/World Bank/IMF program for reforms has been strengthened by USAID backup, and USAID itself has become a more significant and effective partner in policy dialogue. In the past decade, and especially the past 3 years, the GOE has stabilized the economy and has made extraordinary progress toward economic liberalization and the reduction of distortionary economic policies.  Following the wide-ranging reforms in agricultural policy that began in the mid-1980s, macroeconomic and broad sectoral reforms were introduced in 1991 with Bank-Fund support, under the ERSAP.  Since 1991, exchange rates have been unified and exchange controls dismantled, real interest rates have become positive, the trade regime has become more open, and financial markets have been made more open and competitive.  A beginning has been made in privatization. USAID has contributed to this movement toward freer markets and increased efficiency of resource use.  USAID was the chief sponsor, along with GOE, of the agriculture sector reforms. Through the SPR, it has provided support for ERSAP by reinforcing its conditionalities and complementing them by sponsoring new or related policy measures. The SPR policy measures were generally well-designed to meet the targets of the program.  Compliance has been good though uneven. The most consistent compliance has been in the financial and fiscal areas. The biggest gap between commitments and performance has been in privatization.  Compliance was cosmetic in some cases; most notably, the GOE invented a way to comply formally with ERSAP conditionality by shifting state-owned enterprise (SOE) shares to so-called Employee Shareholder Associations while leaving unaffected SOE control and introducing no management changes. The SPR will have special priority in the post-debt relief years (after 1994).  The promise of substantial Paris Club debt and debt service relief has been the main incentive for GOE adherence to the reform program.  But this will be gone once the Bank and Fund certify compliance with ERSAP policy conditionalities, probably in a few months. An additional peril for policy reform is the comfortable budget and balance of payments posture of GOE. The temptation to pursue more expansionist, less prudent, macroeconomic and sectoral policies will surely increase.  The relative importance of USAID's SPR program will thus increase substantially, because it will be the only cash-backed multi-sectoral policy reform program. Implementation of SPR has been extremely demanding. Conditionality could not be pushed so hard that it became ""burdensome,"" given the large reform agenda that was already on the table.  Nor could it be based entirely on the Bank-Fund policy matrix without risking the charge that the same reforms were being ""paid for twice.""  Decision-making is centralized, policy analysts few, the flow of information sluggish, and habits of open debate and policy dialogue embryonic.  Some ministries are uninterested, even hostile, to policy discussion with donors. Despite all this, and by dint of persistence and ingenuity, the Economic Analysis and Policy Directorate has succeeded in tracking compliance with the policy measures of SPR.  In the process, they have learned a great deal about the Egyptian economy and about obstacles to reform, and have nudged the policy reform process forward.

"Evaluates the program activities of the Financial Services Volunteer Corps (FSVC) in Central and Eastern Europe and Mongolia from 1990-94. Through its assistance to the commercial banking and capital markets sectors, FSVC has contributed positively to the formulation and adoption of key policy and procedural changes which are enhancing the development of modern financial systems in the countries reviewed.  Most beneficiaries interviewed indicated that their participation in FSVC-sponsored projects has significantly increased their professional knowledge and abilities. In addition, FSVC-sponsored assistance has, in many cases, helped to produce benefits extending beyond the initial recipient.  This has been demonstrated, for example, in the replication of FSVC-sponsored training efforts within the commercial banks, central banks, and educational institutions where training participants work.  Also, the various laws and policies that have been adopted with the assistance of FSVC volunteers are benefitting the financial sector as a whole.  Thirdly, many beneficiaries have established and are maintaining valuable professional relationships with colleagues in the U.S. and Hong Kong which began during their participation in FSVC-sponsored training. Interviewees consistently remarked that FSVC's major strength is the highly qualified cadre of volunteers who are able to provide assistance on a wide range of topics and working situations.  In addition, FSVC has often shown its ability to respond within short time periods to host country questions.  Also, the voluntary nature of FSVC's assistance has added credibility in the eyes of beneficiaries. FSVC has met or exceeded its planned outputs for the first and third grant periods (first quarter 1991 and second quarter 1992, respectively).  For the second grant period (fourth quarter 1991), FSVC fell short of its expected outputs; however this was due mainly to the setting of goals that the team feels were overly ambitious, and to the need for more time to establish an in-country presence abroad than FSVC originally anticipated. This was addressed in 1992 with the introduction of Country Directors. The organization is taking steps to enhance its institutional sustainability for the future.  For example, it is undertaking new project development activities in Central and Eastern Europe and Asia, while pursuing non-A.I.D. sources of funding.  FSVC's new public relations activities include tapping the institutions of its volunteer ""alumni"" for contributions, and a newsletter targeted to potential funding sources such as foundations.  With an experienced staff and new consolidated office space, FSVC is well-positioned for future institutional growth. Despite these achievements, the evaluation team noted the need for FSVC to implement several improvements.  For example, there is a need for more consistent, regular follow-up and monitoring of assistance projects in all countries visited.  More follow-up is needed on a periodic basis at established intervals such as every 6 or 9 months. FSVC also needs to consider developing long-term, country-specific strategies in order to better meet local needs and more efficiently target its resources in the future. In summary, FSVC has demonstrated the consistent provision of highly qualified technical assistance to the transitional economies of Central and Eastern Europe and Mongolia in a timely, and efficient manner.  This has been achieved even amid FSVC's considerable growth and expansion of activities from 1990 to the present.

"Mid-term evaluation of a project to support efforts of the Haitian Development Foundation (HDF) to promote entrepreneurial capacity through the provision of credit, information, and institutional support.  The evaluation covers the period 6/91-12/94; the project was suspended a few months after its inception and reactivated in 7/92. The HDF is operating branches in four provincial centers, and a fifth provincial office is being launched; satellite offices are being set up to improve outreach.  HDF made approximately 294 loans in 1992/93, of which 121 were made by provincial offices. In 1993/94, the number of loans increased to 375, of which 271 were made by the provincial offices.  The loans, which ranged from $200 to $3,570, supported small and micro enterprises such as bakeries, grocery stores, soft drink and food distributors, restaurants, furniture makers, tailors, and auto repair shops; 30% of HDF's clients have been women.  The quality of HDF's portfolio has improved from a year ago, with the number of performing loans and their aggregate value improving from 60% of the total to 75%, and the number and value of both non-performing and un-collectible loans decreasing significantly.  In addition, 5 baseline studies have been completed and 3 are planned for the coming year. On the negative side, losses on loans are still high and represent one-tenth of the portfolio value.  The rate of recovery and rate of return have been uneconomically low.  The target of 10,000 new jobs has proven unrealistic.  Most of HDF's administrative procedural files have gradually become obsolete. The organization now functions informally, without official documentation of specifically defined roles and responsibilities and clear organizational structure.  Nonetheless, long-term planning is important to HDF, and a new 5-year strategic plan is being contemplated. Considering the weakness of the Haitian economy and the country's political and social crises, the performance of HDF's staff has been impressive.  HDF is still unquestionably the primary microlending institution in Haiti.  A 2-year extension is recommended to make up for the time lost during the project suspension.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","521-0000-C-00-5005-00","","12/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Business enterprises|Small scale enterprises|Microenterprises|Credit","Haiti","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABK171.pdf","2,104 KB","001690 - Development Assistance Corp.","","008554 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (2/85-9/94) to provide U.S training to public and private sector individuals, especially the disadvantaged, at the planning, implementation, technical and administrative levels in Latin America and the Caribbean. Under the Latin American and Caribbean Training Initiatives II (LAC II) Program, 5 persons received scholarships, 2 for undergraduate degrees and 3 for graduate degrees, and 101 received short-term technical training.  The Presidential Training Initiative for the Island Caribbean (PTIIC) Program trained 731 persons (including 339 women) against a target of 622.  This included:  long-term training for 225 persons, including 87 women, short-term technical training for 242 persons, and specialized teacher training for 264 teachers.  All minimum target areas established by A.I.D./W were exceeded.  The training covered such areas as agriculture, business, economics, education, public administration, agribusiness management, entrepreneurial management, hospitality education, farm management, women in development, democratization and leadership, and public budgeting and financial management. Lessons learned are as follows.  (1) Beneficiaries should be involved in project design.  PTIIC contained very stringent selection criteria which were not discussed with host countries; also, host countries were opposed to the specific targets established by A.I.D./W regarding percentage of women trainees, placements at Historically Black Colleges and Universities, etc. Although creative programming and sensitivity by the Mission made the program a success, participation by host governments would have made it much more successful.  (2) Cost containment can be achieved, as it was in PTIIC, through careful selection, screening, and monitoring of trainees and through negotiation with training institutions.  (3) It is better to avoid buy-ins to central contracts where the Mission has no control.  In PTIIC, which was implemented through a buy-in to A.I.D./W's main contract with the Small Business Administration, RDO/C was charged overhead for both the prime contractor and the subcontractor; all told, administrative costs amounted to 28% of the $4 million expended by RDO/C.  RDO/C also found it extremely difficult, at times impossible, to obtain information on trainees from the subcontractor, who insisted they had no contractual obligation to RDO/C.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Scholarships|Education for development|Beneficiary count","Latin America|Caribbean|Eastern Caribbean","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABK202.pdf","174 KB","001757 - USAID.

"Mid-term evaluation of a project to increase contraceptive prevalence in Tanzania.  Evaluation covers the period 8/90-12/94. The project has made exceptional progress.  Notable project contributions include solid improvements in contraceptive logistics and availability; the proportion of facilities offering injectibles, IUDs, and contraceptive foams has more than doubled, and almost 100% of facilities offer oral contraceptives and condoms.  As a result modern contraceptive prevalence has more than doubled, there has been a 46% increase in the number of first attendances for family planning services, the number of resupply client visits has increased 40-50%, and 79% of women and 90% of men have knowledge of at least one modern contraceptive method.  In addition, the project has assisted the Family Planning Unit within the Ministry of Health in assuming unquestioned leadership of the National Family Planning Programme (NFPP).  A wide variety of training has been supported. USAID/Tanzania, working in close partnership with the Tanzanian government, cooperating agencies (CAs), and other donors, has been flexible in responding to the country's changing needs.  In order to continue and increases momentum, additional USAID and other resources will be needed through the project completion date.","Project title: Population technical assistance (POPTECH)","Special Evaluation","Documents","CCP-3024-Q-00-3012-00","","12/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Contraceptive prevalence|Contraceptive distribution|Family planning services","Tanzania","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABK211.pdf","2,663 KB","008485 - Basic Health Management International (BHM)","","008612 - USAID.

"PACR of a program (6/89-9/94) to increase access to primary education (grades 1-5) in Balochistan and North West Frontier Provinces (NWFP) in Pakistan and improve educational equity, quality, and efficiency. The program was notably impeded by the severe Pressler cuts in regard to time (the original PACD was 6/99) and funding (sector grants were reduced from $240 million to $59 million and TA from $40 million to $18 million).  Other constraints included delays in USAID's release of grants (particularly deleterious for construction activities) and changes of Pakistani and TA personnel.  Despite these drawbacks, the program achieved much of long-term significance. Institution-building accomplishments were substantial.  Both provinces not only maintained but increased (NWFP to a substantial degree) their budget allocations for primary education, and both established fully staffed and operational Directorates for Primary Education, as well as educational management information systems, systems for monitoring and evaluating teacher performance, and Instructional Materials Development Cells.  A Construction Advisory Unit (CAU) for primary education was established in NWFP, and a private firm was retained in Balochistan for this purpose.  In addition, a total of 131 government officials received training abroad. Access to education also improved:  primary school enrollment rose from 1.575 million to 1.6 million in NWFP and from 434,000 492,000 in Balochistan; construction capacity in Balochistan increased from 50 to nearly 600 schools a year (NWFP's construction capacity should increase after the CAU becomes full operational); and the school siting process is now need-based. Equity has also improved.  (1) Boys'-to-girls' enrollment ratio have shown a consistent levelling trend, from 3 and 4.9 to 2.2 and 2.9 in NWFP and Balochistan, respectively.  (2) Class III completion rates for girls increased from 60% to 82% in NWFP and from 28% to 39% in Balochistan.  (3) Girls' schools now receive very high priority in the establishment of new schools and the training and appointment of teachers.  (4) Senior administrative positions in primary education are now open to and in many cases filled by women.  (5) Because of the new needs-based construction criteria, rural areas are now receiving more schools. The quality of education has improved substantially with increases in the numbers of teachers, schools with sufficient teachers, and trained teachers, along with declines in drop-out rates. Private sector participation has been enhanced through establishment of foundations in both provinces to assist in setting up private educational institutions.  The private sector's role in managing construction has also increased. Finally, a very successful pilot activity has been followed by a full-scale effort to mobilize community participation in establishing and monitoring primary schools for girls. A number of lessons were learned.  (1) Use of the program rather than project mode freed senior managers from day to day implementation issues, allowing them to focus on policy and institutional issues with long-term impact.  It also enabled implementors to sidestep the serious institutional bottlenecks often encountered in large and complex project-type activities. (2) Direct interaction with the provinces greatly facilitated implementation.  (3) To gauge the extent of a problem and the efficacy of proposed solutions, it is crucial that up-to-date, reliable information about the general population, the school-age population, and enrollments in various classes be readily available.  (4) Coordination among donors is very important.  (5) Both donors and host governments find it more convenient to focus on ""hardware,"" e.g., buildings and equipment, rather than ""software"" issues such as participation and drop-rates, equity, etc.  Software issues are more complicated and time-consuming, and politicians and donors are seldom disposed to wait for the results.  (6) Given some guidance, limited TA, and a rational approach, communities can make a tremendous contribution to the development process. In Balochistan, village communities accepted the idea of parents' committees, and the so-called influentials (chiefs, elders, politicians, etc.) were thus relegated to secondary importance. (7) Implementation proved many pieces of conventional wisdom -- that parents do not want education or co-education for their children, or that males cannot teach females -- to be myths.  (8) Sustainability is not achieved through continuous donor support for the same activities, but through a program that addresses the most fundamental issues and is supported by all policy and decisionmaking bodies.  Sustainability of this program is virtually assured -- program initiatives are being continued in practically the same manner by the World Bank and other donors; institutions such as the Steering Committees and Primary Education Directorates continue to function; and, most importantly, program initiatives have wide support among the politicians and the bureaucracy.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","12/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Primary education|Access to education|Equity|Women in development|Nonproject assistance|Institution building|Educational reform|Teacher training|Educational administration|Community participation|Private sector|Beneficiary count","Pakistan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABK219.pdf","1,724 KB","008588 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (9/82-9/94) to support economic development in Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATAs) in Pakistan and in socioeconomically lagging areas of Northwest Frontier Province (NWFP). Despite the adverse impacts of the Pressler amendment, the project was generally a success.  Infrastructural improvements included construction of 109 km of roads, which opened inaccessible areas up for development and linked farms with markets and towns; irrigation schemes, which increased crop acreage and benefited over 11,000 farm families; and a variety of small infrastructure projects, including 35 boys' schools, 13 girls' schools, 15 drinking water schemes, 3 buildings for health units, 6 flood protection wall schemes to protect 195 acres of land, and 11 teachers' quarters. Community-based interventions included training of FATA Agriculture Directorate staff and farmers in horticultural techniques.  In addition, the project operated model orchards and a small-scale enterprise program for tribal farmers, introduced seed packages to increase growing of off-season vegetables, renovated the government-owned Robert Garden at Parachinar and three government nurseries, and trained farmers in woodlot plantation and nursery raising.  The project also strengthened women in development/nonformal education (NFE) centers through training and the development (for the first time ever) of a NFE curriculum, and helped to establish an NGO in the Kurram Agency (one of 7 tribal agencies). The capacities of the FATA Development Corporation were strengthened in water resources development, and the Communications and Works Department of the NWFP Government was provided with short-term TA, equipment, and a computer center. In addition, computer centers were established in both the Planning, Environment and Development Department and the Local Government and Rural Development Department.  Finally, the project prepared socioeconomic profiles for the seven Tribal Agencies; these can be considered preliminary reference documents for project planners and designers. The following lessons were learned.  (1) The requirement of a Government of Pakistan funding document for each activity reduced the project's flexibility in contracting for commodities, services, and construction.  (2) Despite a great deal of talk about decentralization, little has been done to make it a reality at the field level.  (3) Success depends on a well thought-out design.  Many activities added later in the project should have been included in the original design. (4) An institutional home within the host government, a must for an area development project, was lacking for most of this project, as was an efficient host government system for advance funds.  (5) Regular monitoring helps to ensure good quality construction work.  (6) Progress may be hindered by local tribal problems and by frequent transfer of host country counterparts.  (7) School buildings should only be constructed if the host government is committed to providing basic needs (e.g., water, electricity) and trained teachers. (8) Absence of a private agricultural input delivery system affects the development of the green sector within a tribal area.  (9) Tribal men monitor women's access to project information; in this project, the men, after listening privately to project health messages, had them broadcast publicly to all over local loudspeakers.  (10) Flexible class times can increase attendance of NFE students.  (11) A top down approach for creating an NGO succeeds only when there are commitments from donors, locals, and the host government.  (12) Up to 4-5 years is required for an NGO to achieve sustainability in a difficult environment.  (13) Local experts rather than expatriates should be employed for inaccessible areas.  (14) Participation of line agencies and the host government institutional home in project activities is needed for skills transfer.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","12/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Community development|Tribal groups|Integrated rural development","Pakistan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABK220.pdf","2,042 KB","008588 - USAID.

Nine subgrants are discussed:  health programs of International Medical Corps (IMC), Mercy Corps International (MCI), International Rescue Committee (IRC), and Freedom Medicine (FM); rural assistance by CARE, MCI, and IRC; The Asia Foundation's (TAF's) democratic pluralism initiative; and IRC's female education program. The PVOs have proven cost-effective, innovative, and, unlike contractors, able to leverage USAID funds to attract other support. While it is difficult to predict what their role will be in the postwar period, many have moved their operations inside Afghanistan, where they have formed working relationships with commanders and shuras (local consultative bodies), and more hope to do so. IMC's program began as a relief operation, and had problems adapting as the war wound down.  USAID had to more or less force IMC to coordinate with Afghan entities, streamline its operations, and charge user fees.  In the end, IMC performed well. Lessons:  (1) USAID should respond quickly and decisively to implementation problems; in this project, it converted grants to cooperative agreements, which allowed for more coordinated planning in a situation of flux.  (2) Changeover of expatriate staff led to inconsistent implementation; IMC and USAID should have spent more time reviewing candidates for the senior field position.  (3) Although IMC thought it impossible, revenue generation at clinics was viable and relatively painless. MCI's medical program in some ways parallels IMC's experience -- the NGO wished to remain autonomous in the field and resisted cost reductions.  It is doubtful that many MCI facilities will be sustained, and is sad to note the PVO's diminished interest in southwest Afghanistan after USAID gave MCI almost $11 million to work there. Lessons:  (1) Independent monitoring is the only way to verify a program's status, but this was very difficult under the conditions in Afghanistan (USAID found that 9 of 14 clinics which MCI said were active after USAID funding ceased were in fact inactive).  (2) The greatest barrier to maternal/child health (MCH) care in rural Afghanistan is lack of trained female health workers; MCH success also depends on community make-up and local support. IRC provided subgrants to 12 international and Afghan NGOs, including grants for an emergency medical center, an amputee bicyclist group, providers of prosthetics, medical training organizations, an ob/gyn center, and a psychiatric hospital. There was little attempt to coordinate, promote sustainability, or focus grantee efforts, but USAID did find that NGOs can provide good service at the village level. FM trained/retrained mid-level health workers.  It was able to transfer most of its program over to the Afghan Interim Government's Ministry of Public Health, an admirable achievement given the myriad of problems encountered.  Lessons:  (1) It is better to use existing systems and resources than to duplicate them.  (2) Transitioning is a learning process in itself.  (3) Thailand was an excellent training ground, because conditions there were similar to Afghanistan's.  For a country like Afghanistan, providing medical training in a sophisticated setting with sophisticated equipment is unnecessary and may be counterproductive. CARE's village assistance program furthered resettlement by using Food for Work (FFW) labor to build/rebuild rural infrastructure; most activities are probably sustainable because they provide cash payoffs to villagers.  FFW did not adversely affect local food production. Lessons:  (1) At first there was no time for planning, but implementation improved noticeably when plans were carefully made.  (2) A better security system should have been devised for food shipments, which were hijacked several times. (3) Video reporting, showing field activities and food distribution, was a tremendous aid to USAID's understanding of program implementation.  (5) Cooperative agreements should be written in such a way that USAID can veto a poor chief of party. MCI's agriculture program increased wheat production and supported orchard/vineyard rehabilitation, including infrastructure for a thriving raisin industry.  Lessons:  (1) MCI should have involved farmers in planning.  (2) USAID provided detailed instructions on how MCI should distribute wheat and fertilizer but not on how it should spend the proceeds from sales of these commodities.  (3) Unlike CARE, which had detailed technical plans, MCI left the planning and construction of FFW activities totally up to farmers, and as a result commitment was very high and outcomes were superb.  (4) Farmers should have been allowed to make their own arrangements for transporting commodities. IRC's model farm program included integrated forestry, animal husbandry, and multicropping activities.  The program experienced a low survival rate for seedlings planted along canal banks, hillsides, and other deforested areas, and found that provision of expensive equipment was an invitation to theft and misuse. Beekeeping proved popular.  IRC plans to privatize program activities.  Lessons:  (1) Curriculum standardization and the use of flipcharts to stress key messages were effective in farmer training.  (2) IRC probably gave the best value of any PVO, due to low overhead (5.4%), relatively low-cost expatriate personnel, and extensive use of Afghan professionals, plus its own wealth of experience in the country. IRC's rural assistance program awarded 99 subgrants to 7 international and 17 Afghan subgrantees.  Between 1988 and 1990, more than half the grants were for emergency and survival assistance, mostly food aid.  From 1991 to 1992, almost 92% were for rural rehabilitation projects.  The program (which continues with European Union funding) made a significant contribution, especially through training of Afghan NGOs -- which are now well-positioned for sustainability.  Lessons:  (1) Train subgrantees early, instruct primary grantees in the need to prepare timely  reports, define monitoring responsibilities clearly, and keep the cooperative agreement under one project (this program has been funded under 4 different projects, adding confusion). TAF's multidonor democratic pluralism program provided grants to Afghan institutions and international PVOs to increase opportunities for the disenfranchised and improve information flow and respect for human rights.  Most activities exceeded targets. Afghanistan's political instability, however, makes the long-term financial viability of many of the grantees uncertain. Lessons learned show the need to upgrade the management capacity of Afghan NGOs, promote community participation, and avoid bureaucratic delays.  Because USAID (unlike UN agencies and most NGOs) monitored activities from Pakistan, its decisions were not based on first-hand knowledge, perhaps to the program's detriment. For IRC's female education program, see abstract of PD-ABK-266.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","6/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Women in development|Refugees|Project sustainability|Private voluntary organizations|War relief|Indigenous private voluntary organizations|Co-financing|Donor coordination|Primary health care|Maternal child health care|Disaster rehabilitation|Agricultural production|Agricultural storage facilities|Public works|Irrigation system construction|Democratization|Cost recovery|Development project monitoring|Internal conflict|Medical education","Pakistan|Afghanistan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABK221.pdf","4,210 KB","008505 - USAID.

"Mid-term evaluation of a project to provide the Government of Bangladesh (BDG) with technical resources to support key development areas.  The project has been implemented by the Ministry of Panning's External Resources Division (ERD). Evaluation covers the period 1988-9/94. Project TA has supported capacity building in several forms: policy reforms and institution building in BDG and USAID priority areas; introduction of modern Management Information Systems and analytical methods in BDG institutions; improvements in policy analysis and research capacity in agriculture and food sectors in BDG institutions; and transfer of modern skills through training. However, frequent rotations and loss of trained personnel in client institutions, and insufficient progress on required policy reforms on the part of the BDG may threaten sustainability. The project's umbrella financing mechanism implies that USAID and BDG share equally in selecting activities for funding.  However, as there is no formal structure that fosters coordination, activities have been selected on an ad hoc basis, and it appears that the use of project TA and training has been supply- rather than demand-driven.  Many of the activities receiving funding are carryovers from the project's predecessor (TR I), belong to other donors, or are unilateral (USAID) initiatives.  It is recommended that the project adopt public administration as an overall framework for its future operations, and undertake collaborative planning so that the activities chosen for funding are those that will help the project to meet its goals.  Along the same lines, the project should create an on-the-job training program for ministerial personnel. ERD should select participants for short-term overseas training based on merit primarily (women display relatively higher motivation and take an active interest in applying acquired skills and hence deserve special attention), and improve the design of programs, attempting to use regional training institutions to the maximum extent possible to reduce costs and improve relevance of training, and to foster institutional linkages.  Closer linkages need to be made between overseas and in-country training activities.  Similarly, activities under the Development Management Training component are formulated in isolation and should be integrated to ensure relevancy of each to the other. ERD has strengthened its coordination and consultative capacities and its relationship with USAID is satisfactory, although it is understaffed and could benefit from a stronger management information system.","Delivery order no. 08","Special Evaluation","Documents","AEP-5451-I-00-2050-00","","9/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Technical assistance|Technical training|Institution building","Bangladesh","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABK224.pdf","195 KB","000356 - Checchi and Co.

"Interim evaluation of a project to improve Moroccan managerial and technical skills for economic and private sector development. The project is being implemented by USAID/M, the Direction de la Formation des Cadres (DFC), and AmidEast.  The evaluation covers the period 8/92-4/94. Component one, aimed at strengthening Morocco's training infrastructure, is shifting toward a sharper focus on institutional development.  However, many of the institution-building activities have not yet begun or have just begun, largely because AmidEast had to spend about 8 months selecting 14 Moroccan partner institutions.  TA (in curriculum and faculty development, management, and marketing) will be provided to these partner institutions beginning in mid-1994. The U.S. training component is not making good progress toward its goals; the Moroccan private sector does not consider U.S. Master's training worth the cost, and the short-term U.S. training being provided is spread thinly across sectors and institutions, and thus is not creating core groups of trained individuals.  Targets for private sector trainees and for women are not being met.  It is recommended that U.S. Master's training and short-term training for mid-level cadres be replaced with equivalent programs, tailored to their specific needs, in some of the 14 Moroccan partner institutions.  However, high-level personnel in Morocco's training industry and in selected sectors should be exposed to their U.S. industries in the United States through customized study tours, attendance at conferences, etc. Overall, the project has been well-managed by USAID/M and AmidEast. Although there have been significant delays in scheduled activities, these are generally due to interorganizational structural and communication problems rather than to internal management inefficiency. In the case of DFC, project management appears to be less efficient. Indicators for measuring project progress and impact are inadequate. There is a particular need to define impact indicators more precisely at all three levels of project activity -- individual, institutional, the sectoral.","Project title: Human and educational resources network support|(HERNS)","Special Evaluation","Documents","FAO-0071-I-00-3070-00|FAO-I-00-93-00070-00","","7/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Personnel development|Education for development|Management training|Technical training|Training centers|Institution building|Participants","Morocco","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABK225.pdf","1,375 KB","012322 - Aguirre International","","008230 - USAID.

"Evaluates activities in Asia and the Near East in a project to provide TA in operations research (OR) to improve family planning (FP) services.  Evaluation covers the period 7/90-8/94 and is based in part on interviews with over 100 persons. Project performance in terms of quality and impact was generally weak during the first three years, but strong during the fourth year, and the fifth year looks highly promising.  All contract deliverables will be completed by project end, with 18 subprojects already completed, and 26 underway vs. a target of 30-35; 20 workshops have been held vs. a target of only 8.  The project's emphasis on providing TA outside of the context of formal OR studies appears to have increased the perceived value of the OR program to USAID Missions and has made easier for OR advisors to assist service providers and policy makers. The broadness and flexibility of the contract scope of work made it important to develop both a clear overall strategy and specific country strategies.  The former is still lacking, but country strategies were in place by the time of the evaluation. In the three most populous South Asian countries (Pakistan, India, and Bangladesh), it appears that the project is now strategically positioned to have a major impact. While the project has succeeded in providing well-focused TA to researchers in at least two countries, in other cases TA and training have been more scattered and seem to have been less effective.  More researchers could have been given opportunities for participatory OR training if this had been made an explicit goal.  Dissemination of research findings have been limited, but should increase dramatically under a new and thoughtful dissemination plan. Given the time frame of the project and the nature of the subprojects, the impact of the project can only be measured by intermediate indicators, not by measures such as change in contraceptive prevalence.  More often than not, the subprojects have generated findings that provide decisionmakers with information about what not to do, rather than what to do, although this information has affected significant decisions.  In several countries, the project seems to have been quite effective in imparting the concept of OR to program managers and decision makers.  While its documentable impact has been modest, the project has the potential to achieve a substantial positive impact on FP services, particularly since the contractor has developed an institutional presence in the area and has gained host government clearances and opened field offices.","Project title: Population technical assistance (POPTECH)","Special Evaluation","Documents","CCP-3024-C-00-3011-00","","12/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Operations research|Technical assistance|Family planning services","Asia|South Asia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABK239.pdf","1,886 KB","008485 - Basic Health Management International (BHM)","","008291 - USAID.

"Mid-term evaluation of a project to increase the use of data for informed decision making by the health sector.  Evaluation covers the period 10/91-8/94. The project has tremendous potential to make an impact in countries where there is interest in, and the climate is conducive to, health sector reform.  The sub-projects are on schedule to meet the anticipated level of outputs outlined in the design logical framework. While there is great potential for impact during the life of the project, with definite indications that an impact is already being made (particularly in Bolivia), the current implementation period of less than 3 years does not allow for appropriate measurement of this impact. In fact, the project's time horizon is probably too short and it will take more than the 5-year limit of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) PASA and the Harvard Consortium (HC) Cooperative Agreement to measure impact.  A.I.D. needs to be prepared to extend these agreements beyond 9/96, assuming progress is still as positive in 2 years as it is today. While the project does not need to be redesigned, it is worth noting that the design should be reviewed in 2 years when the work in Bolivia, Egypt, and the Philippines can be further assessed.  What seems to be of primary importance today is the flexibility of the current project design to respond to specific and timely issues of interest to A.I.D. (e.g., privatization of health care, cost efficiency/effectiveness, child survival, HIV/AIDS). The current scope of activities has fully absorbed the staff of both sub-projects.  The HC and CDC have reached the limits of their human resources capacity and will find it difficult to take on additional work under the project.  Project implementors should consolidate the work they are doing in their present countries before additional countries are added.  If more countries are desired by A.I.D., the following actions will be necessary:  (1) Additional funding resources will need to be secured; (2) CDC will need to solve its full-time equivalent (FTE) dilemma; and (3) Harvard will need to hire additional people (and amend the cooperative agreement) or A.I.D. will be required to bring in additional institutions (if assistance can be found for the Cognizant Technical Officer (CTO) to take on the additional management burden, the latter is recommended). The main criticism of the project is the lack of communication between the HC and the CDC.  While the original project design envisioned HC and CDC jointly implementing activities in three to five emphasis countries, it quickly became evident that mission interests, needs, and funding did not always allow for both ""top down"" and ""bottom up"" approaches being offered by the two implementors.  Missions have therefore not looked at the project as a whole, but instead have chosen only those elements (sub-projects) that fit and are responsive to specific problems in a particular country.  As of this writing there are joint activities only in Bolivia, with little communication between HC and CDC.  Consequently, these institutions, A.I.D., and the countries are not benefiting from the full impact of the combined work.  While the Missions cannot be directed to buy into both sub-projects, the implementors must communicate and collaborate with one another regarding the project inputs, outputs, and common goals.  The convening of a Technical Advisory Group meeting might present one option for beginning to work toward a long-term solution to this problem.

"The Regional Potato Improvement Program for Central Africa (PRAPAC), a USAID-supported program of the International Potato Center (CIP), supports collaborative potato research among the national agricultural research systems (NARS) in Burundi, Rwanda, Uganda, and Zaire.  This evaluation of PRAPAC focuses on its progress in:  developing improved varieties and other potato technologies; strengthening member national programs and their institutional partners, as well as linkages between research programs and extension development agencies; and developing a self-sustaining potato research network.  Also addressed are management issues such as the CIP's backstopping of PRAPAC, financial management and the use of donor resources, and PRAPAC monitoring and evaluation systems.  According to the report, PRAPAC has made positive progress towards its goals, most notably by linking four independent NARS into a coordinated system of research planning and execution at the regional level.  This collaboration has led to the development of new varieties more resistant to late blight and bacterial wilt, as well as promising developments in true potato seed technology and the development of an efficient basic seed production scheme.  There has also been considerable progress towards self-sustainability, although much room for improvement remains.  Recommendations fall into three broad categories -- regional coordination, strengthening member national programs, and technical issues, with the need for member governments to develop a critical mass of researchers, provide adequate research infrastructure, and increase funding among the urgent concerns. Appendices include profiles of the four PRAPAC countries and a list of PRAPAC publications.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","AOT-0478-C-00-3168-00","","12/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural research|Potatoes|Research collaboration|Institutional linkages|Networks","Central Africa|Rwanda|Burundi|Uganda|Congo DR","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNABT891.pdf","305 KB","000671 - International Potato Center (CIP)|006007 - AMEX International, Inc.","","008308 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (1987-9/93) to improve the capacity of local governments (LGs) in Egypt to provide basic services for low-income residents and to mobilize local resources. Basic services provided in provincial governorates included: provision of clean, piped water to 22 million people in 1,473 villages; construction of 3,250 km of roads; addition of 2,793 classrooms to schools, providing space for 107,000 students; construction of wastewater treatment plants in 25 villages; and 1,059 small environmental projects, largely for solid waste and sewage disposal, benefiting more than 7.5 million citizens. In the urban governorates the project helped to:  pave 2,354 km of streets and install 634 km of street lighting; install 58,946 linear meters of water distribution lines and 44,422 linear meters of sewer installations; provide 1,047 garbage collection carts, trucks, and tools; construct 100 public toilets and renovate 1,500 others.  In addition, markets, bakeries, and abattoirs were constructed and/or renovated, and 2,106 classrooms were constructed and 40,470 pieces of school equipment were procured. All told, more than 16,000 small projects were funded under the project, vs. a target of only 3,600.  Training goals were also far surpassed, with over 98,000 LG and PVO personnel receiving training in technical and non-technical subjects vs. a target of 63,550 in technical subjects. However, fiscal decentralization did not occur, due to the lack of supportive national policies and coordinating mechanisms (wrongly assumed to exist in the project design).  The project shows how difficult local fiscal autonomy is to achieve in terms of organizational assignments, staffing, and defined functions. Future efforts to assist local governance should not adopt comprehensive institutional development objectives without confirming that supportive policy foundations are in place on the part of both the recipient country and the donor agency.  Unless in a position to exert maximum and sustained leverage, a donor should avoid seeking to alter Egypt's policies on local resource mobilization. Basing sustainability of local services on a major policy change at the central level was an unrealistic assumption.  Local projects are most likely to be sustained with local initiatives. The project clearly demonstrated that Egyptian LGs are capable of planning, implementing, and monitoring block grants, and the project system for financing infrastructure proved an efficient and effective means of funding basic services on a massive scale. Paradoxically, the system of operating outside the normal Egyptian administrative structure was the project's greatest strength.  Through provision of block grants, governorates and localities were given the flexibility to move funds between sectors as well as between projects.  At the same time, however, future achievements are at risk precisely because its system has not been adopted by the government. The project also showed the value of infrastructural development, which has an immediate impact on large numbers of people, as an incentive for innovations in administration and governance projects.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","5/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Public administration|Decentralization|Local level|Municipal level|Public services|Economic infrastructure|Institution building|Rural areas|Urban areas","Egypt","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABK364.pdf","433 KB","008539 - USAID.

"Evaluates Commodity Import Program (CIP) assistance to Egypt. Evaluation covers the period 1975-91 for the program's public sector component (PUCIP), and 1986-12/94 for its private sector component (PRCIP). Together, PUCIP and PRCIP have accounted for $5.3 billion in aid since 1975, or about one-fourth of the total amount of Economic Support Fund (ESF) assistance provided to Egypt.  PUCIP expenditures have totaled $4 billion, with capital goods accounting for one-third of total expenditures, and bulk goods for one-quarter.  PUCIP was terminated in 1991, although an existing pipeline is still being drawn down.  PRCIP expenditures have totaled nearly $1.3 billion, with capital goods and bulk grains each accounting for about one-fifth of total expenditures. USAID paperwork and procedural requirements are a major headache for private importers, but they utilize the PRCIP due to its long grace period, coverage of the foreign exchange risk, and the quality of U.S. goods.  Financial incentives to induce banks to participate in the program, on the other hand, are inadequate under current economic conditions.  There has also been little effective publicity for the PRCIP, with some importers unaware of the grace period allowed and some thinking the program had been discontinued.  The Project Finance Facility (PFF), which provides medium-term import credits related to plant modernization and/or expansion, is underused. Egypt's stabilization and structural adjustment programs have had considerable impact on the CIP.  Unification of the exchange rate in 1991 and the related build up of foreign exchange reserves eliminated the foreign exchange support justification for the CIP.  The country's restructuring process is continuing and could have further unforeseen impacts on the program.  There is also growing competition to the PRCIP, due to a wider selection of import finance sources in Europe that offer goods comparable to the U.S. goods, at lower prices, with faster delivery. Congressional earmarking is also inhibiting effective use of PRCIP resources.  The annual earmarking has led in recent years to imports of grain commodities, which are basically used as commercial rather than developmental goods. Despite its problems, the PRCIP remains politically and, due to the interest-free grace period, economically relevant, although it has had a limited impact on the economy due to its relatively modest scale. Still, PRCIP funding accounts for about 10% of total imports by Egypt's private sector, and funds are mainly destined towards the growth sectors of the economy.  The program is not adequately addressing the need to accelerate development of the private sector to spur increased economic growth.  The PRCIP could be appreciably enhanced if it were aggressively marketed.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","AEP-0085-I-00-3002-00","","12/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Balance of payments|Commodity import programs|Public sector|Private sector|Financial incentives","Egypt","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABK483.pdf","2,376 KB","000436 - Development Associates, Inc.","","008539 - USAID.

"Evaluates the Cooperative Association of States for Scholarships (CASS) program to recruit socioeconomically disadvantaged youth from Central America and the Caribbean for technical training in U.S. community colleges. Evaluation covers the period 1990-11/94 and is based on five community colleges and four representative countries (Dominican Republic, Cost Rica, Honduras and Eastern Caribbean). The program has been successful in achieving its stated purpose and, coincidentally, has supported the LAC Bureau's Strategic Objectives, although these were established after the program began. CASS has fostered trainees as change agents, i.e., individuals who have the capacity and motivation to initiate or support sustainable development through their own actions and their influence on others. A large majority appear prepared to take on leadership roles beyond their own communities. Program administration in general is efficient and performing well. However, student recruitment from rural areas is far below the goal of 80%, and some students were poorly prepared to complete the academic program and had poor Spanish skills. Over 80% of trainees were satisfied with course offerings, faculty, host family experiences, and other Experience America activities. English-language training was very successful, as was leadership development. Over 91% of trainees believe CASS improved their self-esteem, and 75% felt they learned something about the U.S. political system that might be useful to them as leaders in the future. The average rate of employment in fields of study and related fields is 79%, and only about 7% are unemployed after returning to their home country. In addition, nearly 85% of trainees report increased responsibilities on the job, 93% have improved income, and 56% have been promoted. The more economically disadvantaged the home country, the more likely trainees are to assess CASS training's importance highly. Some 92% of participants maintain contact with U.S. friends, and 94% maintain communication with other trainees. Their relative success in the workplace and promise of future political activity should have an impact on the democratization of their country and in the maintenance of strong ties with the United States.","Project title: Central American scholarship program (CASP)|Related evaluation: Evaluation of LAC higher education scholarships program (PD-ACX-232)|Related evaluation: An evaluation of the Cooperative Association of States for Scholarships [CASS] program (1994-2001) (PD-ABZ-325)","Special Evaluation","Documents","LAC-0661-A-00-0039-00|LAC-0661-C-00-0046-00","","11/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Leadership training|Technical training|Participants|Community colleges|Youth|Disadvantaged groups","Central America|Dominican Republic|Costa Rica|Honduras|Eastern Caribbean","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABK526.pdf","19,492 KB","012322 - Aguirre International|008730 - Georgetown University.

"Evaluates USAID's fertilizer distribution improvement (FDI) program, comprised of FDI-I (1978-85) and its follow-on FDI-II (1984-94), in Bangladesh. USAID's FDI program in Bangladesh is considered by some to be its most significant privatization effort:  (1) the fertilizer market has been fully privatized and liberalized, including price decontrol, the removal of government subsidies, and the disengagement of the Bangladesh Agricultural Development Corporation; (2) the private sector response to the changed environment has been strong, competitive, and effective -- fertilizer supplies have more than doubled, and all government costs associated with the distribution of fertilizer have been completely eliminated; and (3) fertilizer use has increased, resulting in increased agricultural production, increased rural incomes, and food self-sufficiency.  In addition, the national economy is significantly and measurably stronger, and the large majority of Bangladeshi, urban as well as rural, are significantly better off. FDI's success can be attributed to the following four key factors, two of which were within the control of the program and two of which were not.  (1) The vision underlying the program was simple, consistent, and strongly felt.  (2) The program was well conceived and has been implemented effectively.  (3) The overall policy framework has been supportive of the program's privatization objectives.  (4) The liberalization and privatization of fertilizer distribution have had a major and far-reaching economic impact.  This has been due to the existence of an economically viable, technical package that made fertilizer use profitable and greatly increased agricultural production, particularly rice. The following lessons were learned.  (1) It is important to build support within the government and affected institutions before bringing about policy changes that significantly affect the private and parastatal sectors and imply basic changes in government social, and economic agendas.  As changes occurred in the project, impacts were monitored and discussed with all interested parties.  These consultations provided the basis for further changes that eventually led to the full privatization of fertilizer distribution.  (2) Changing government policies affecting agribusiness require highly qualified technical assistance which can effectively deal with the government and private sector.  The key to the program's success has been the availability of highly competent fertilizer marketing experts. (3) The project provides strong evidence that the private sector responds efficiently and effectively to undistorted open markets. At every step of the fertilizer privatization process, private businesses have expeditiously replaced the Bangladesh Agricultural Development Corporation (BADC).  This has resulted in cuts in distribution costs and more timely delivery to farmers.  (4) The program also reconfirms the difficulty of bringing about institutional change in the public sector, even in the context of highly successful policy change.  The greatest resistance to privatization of Bangladesh's fertilizer distribution system has come from the implementing agency, the BADC.  (5) Finally, privatization efforts are greatly facilitated when they are implemented in the context of overall economic liberalization.  The difficulty of overcoming BADC and political resistance to privatization indicates that the effort probably would have failed had there not been high-level government and widespread donor support for economic liberalization.","Summary: PN-ABS-524","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","7/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural development|Fertilizers|Fertilizer distribution|Private sector|Marketing|Privatization","Bangladesh","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNABU208.pdf","1,115 KB","008058 - USAID.

"The Project Concern International (PCI) Title II program resulted in a number of achievements in Santa Cruz during 1993 including street repairs, cleaning and openings of drainage canals, construction of sports fields, clean-up of green areas, maintenance of plazas and parks, planting of trees, garbage collection and school refurbishing.  Food for Work (FFW) laborers also renovated a cultural center, a market and a medical post and constructed an industrial oven, four canal bridges, school rest rooms and 14 homes. PCI also established a monitoring system to provide socioeconomic and nutritional information on about 2,700 FFW laborers and their families. Preliminary data provided by PCI shows a decrease from 45% to 32% in the number of malnourished children after 3 months in the program.  In addition to food, the laborers and their families received basic medical care, vitamin A supplementation, antiparasitic treatment for children under 5 years of age and iron supplementation for women.  The nutritional project also conducted educational events for community leaders, trainees, and FFW laborers. During the year, PCI strengthened its staff and facilities. Building on the recognized food aid expertise of the PCI Executive Director, an Institutional Support Grant was obtained from A.I.D. to strengthen management capacity.  With these funds, Headquarters hired an expert Title II Food Aid Manager to monitor and analyze the Bolivia program to ensure compliance with terms and conditions of the program agreement and Title II regulations. The Food Aid Manager has prepared numerous high quality materials to help program implementation such as guidance for performing end-use inspections and a PCI Title II Handbook. Headquarters has scheduled training for Headquarters and Country staff in 1994 to help transfer this expertise to the Bolivian program. In addition, Headquarters was in the process of analyzing its policy on monitoring and accounting for commodity resources, monetization funds and participant contributions. These analyses will result in further strengthening control systems. In addition, USAID's December 1993 inspection of the Santa Cruz Office concluded that PCI had established better controls over the distribution of food.  To discourage resale of rations by workers, PCI developed an effective system for repackaging food in smaller containers for distribution to individual FFW workers. PCI management believes that the continued growth and success of the Title II program in Bolivia carries with it a need for strengthened management and control activities.  Accordingly, PCI is planning on adding staff resources where necessary.  The relationship between the Headquarters and Bolivia offices of PCI is excellent and helped facilitate program implementation.

"This report evaluates the impact of four water and sanitation projects in Bolivia that are sponsored either by USAID or other agencies:  CARE; Community and Child Health (CCH); pilot Project Yacupaj under United Nations Development Program/World Bank (UNDP), and UNICEF. The projects generally use output indicators to monitor their progress in terms of number of systems constructed.  Only one project, CARE, routinely monitors impacts by collecting nutritional and diarrheal disease data every 3 to 6 months.  CCH did gather baseline diarrhea incidence data and is slated to conduct another follow-up survey later this year.  No project measures infant mortality according to the Family Health Strategic Objective of improving child survival. Quantitative data from CARE projects indicated a positive impact on child health as related to nutritional status and diarrheal disease incidence.  The projects in the Altiplano were able to demonstrate a decrease in 2-week diarrheal incidence from 27% in 1993 to 7% in 1994 and in Chuquibamba from 27% to 21% over the same time period.  Among children 12-23 months old in the Altiplano/Valle areas, the prevalence of moderate malnutrition decreased from 66% to 53%, while severe malnutrition declined from about 24% to about 14%.  In Chuquisaca/Cochabamba, the data show that children 1-2 years old experienced the most improvement in nutritional status:  from 78% prevalence to 55% among the moderately malnourished group and 32% to 19% in the severely malnourished group. Since 1991, the Subsistema Nacional de Informacion en Salud (SNIS) system has included national data on diarrheal disease and nutritional status.  If one uses 1992 as a baseline, there has been a consistent drop in the incidence of disease in 9 out of the 12 reporting areas. The most significant decrease was demonstrated in Pando (248 to 136 cases/1,000).  For the country as a whole, there was a 16% decrease from 1992 to 1993. Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) data for children under 6 months of age show that the prevalence of diarrhea decreased from 25% in 1989 to 17% in 1994. The linkages among water supply projects are provided through Direccion Nacional de Saneamiento Basico (DINASBA), which has initiated activities aimed at ensuring coordination among the various technical and financial cooperation agencies and institutions through technical meetings with representatives from the government, NGOs, and PVOs. The coordination of other donors involved in water supply activities comes, in part, through DINASBA.  Through a UNDP initiative, an operational matrix was established that lists and defines the role and objectives of each project and program with a view toward providing clear guidelines for the participation of international agencies. Project sustainability is mainly achieved through community participation in system administration.  It is not clear if the Government of Bolivia (GOB) has attained increased institutional capacity to finance and provide support for these communities once the donors depart.  The bulk of funding comes from the donors, with the communities investing on average 30% of the capital start-up costs. The overriding community selection criteria common to all projects appear to be the community's willingness to participate in administration, operation, and maintenance, plus its ability to pay recurrent costs.  The availability of good quality water is another selection criterion all projects use.  All projects do not use the criteria of need for services due to lack of resources (i.e., poverty, lack of access to services) and health status (mortality rates, diarrheal disease burden, or malnutrition). Projects use a similar process to choose the design of their systems. Considerations include population requirements, water resources, operation and maintenance, and the community's capacity to administer the system.  The actual engineering components (materials and specifications), although not assessed in depth due to limited evaluation time, show some variation. CCH and CARE Programs have health components. While the projects may not necessarily have strengthened GOB water and sanitation directly, they have had a powerful impact on community development and democratization.  This is demonstrated by the sustained activities of the water committees, the involvement of women, and the additional improvements in the systems which many communities have made on their own.  For example, one community organized and paid an extraordinary amount to hire a lawyer to claim its water rights.  The projects have had a profound impact on women's time, generating multiple social and child health benefits. It was not possible to determine true cost-effectiveness, due to the paucity of health impact data.  Two cost-utility estimates were made, based on a mix of a qualitative and quantitative data and expected health impacts derived from project inputs and outcome measures.  The analysis yielded results that generally favor lower cost programs (due to economies of scale) which use simpler technologies and include health education, sanitation, community participation, and emphasis on the concept of the user as a client.

"Final (internal) evaluation of a Save the Children Federation (SCF) child survival project (10/91-12/94) in Nepal's Siraha District.  The project focused on strengthening the Ministry of Health's (MOH) service delivery system and improving knowledge and practice of protective health behaviors at the household level. Despite its short duration, the project had a substantial impact on the community at large.  Thanks to a clear identification of health priorities at the start of the program, notable success was achieved in mobilizing the communities and establishing community-based management structures.  Another commendable success was the strong link that developed between nonformal education activities, community health, and the empowerment of women.  Attainment of literacy has contributed to a rise in the status of women through income generation activities and increased self-reliance.  There has been a substantial improvement in antenatal care and higher utilization of traditional birth attendants. Management of diarrheal diseases, which are quite prevalent in the project area, was greatly enhanced, and improvements were noted in the areas of tetanus toxoid coverage, acute respiratory infection and treatment, and awareness of the expanded immunization program.  The project also incorporated a phasing-over strategy by revitalizing health post and outreach clinic management committees as a vehicle for continuing project services on a cost recovery basis. On the negative side, most of the measures recommended by the midterm evaluation were not incorporated into the project, resulting in the persistence of the problems which arose during the first half of the project.  Another weakness was the project's length; 3 years is far too short a time frame to accommodate the complexity of this project and does not allow the flexibility needed to adjust to unanticipated events. Additionally, because the MOH -- which was to work closely with SCF on project implementation -- was involved in the government planning standstill (a result of the political transition that lasted until 1992/3), many project objectives could not be achieved.  Thus, it is important to consider the host country's political scenario and to clearly define the host country's responsibilities regarding project implementation during project planning.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","PDC-0500-G-00-1077-00","","12/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Child survival activities|Community participation|Community based delivery|Institution building|Public health care|Health delivery","Nepal","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABK689.pdf","3,965 KB","001407 - Save the Children (U.S.)","","007746 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (6/89-6/94) to assist the Government of Pakistan (GOP) in creating a favorable policy environment for establishing a market-oriented housing finance system.  The project was implemented by the Ministry of Finance. The project accomplished its purpose.  Private housing lenders are now operating, and the GOP is supporting lower-income housing programs. In the policy component, the project established a legal framework and a licensing process for private housing finance companies, developed a capacity at the State Bank to regulate housing finance institutions, and drafted a rational housing finance policy.  The GOP has promised to stop funding the technically bankrupt and ineptly managed Housing Building Finance Corporation, the traditional purveyor of low-interest housing loans, as of 6/94. Under the institutional development component, three private firms were licensed as housing finance lenders and went into operation; housing finance companies prepared business plans and automated management information systems for loan administration; and housing finance managerial capabilities were enhanced through training of senior staff, primarily from the private sector. Under the system development component, the State Bank of Pakistan was established as the apex public housing finance institution, including a housing loan refinance facility; and a constituency for market-oriented housing finance was created through promotional activities and establishment of a trade association. The training component included seminars and courses for about 100 public and private participants, more than 90% of whom returned to and remained in positions directly related to housing finance or other shelter programs. While the above achievements augur well for sustainability, the environment for housing finance is not friendly.  Some issues, such as Pakistan's inadequate land tenure and transfer systems and its inadequate urban development policies and practices are exceedingly complex.  Others, such as the high cost of land transfers and mortgage registration, and inadequate foreclosure and debt recovery practices, generally restrict housing finance to middle and upper income families. Public distrust of financial institutions in the wake of recent financial scandals and high interest rates further constrain lending. The following lessons were learned.  (1) Projects need a clear implementation strategy; this project lacked focus in its early periods, due to uncertainty as to whether it was a shelter project or a finance project.  (2) Once you have momentum, don't ""drop the ball.""  This project ""dropped the ball"" twice -- at the outset, when GOP enthusiasm for the project was high, by failing to provide strong leadership, and at the conclusion, when momentum had been regained, by cutting funding for activities aimed at ensuring sustainability.  (3) Don't say it's impossible. The project, perhaps inaccurately, identified foreclosure as a constraint that virtually prohibited housing finance development in Pakistan (even though the foreclosure situation is virtually the same in India, where housing finance is thriving).  Staff spent a great deal of time overcoming the initial notion on this issue, and even at the end of the project GOP officials identified foreclosure as the single greatest obstacle facing housing finance.  (4) The nature of the project should determine the implementation vehicle.  The project was implemented using two Personal Services Contractors rather than an institutional contractor, which would have ensured a more orderly and consistent implementation.  (5) USAID's lack of a clear implementation strategy and a consequent late start jeopardized the project's success, with focused activity occurring in only 3 of the project's 5 years.  When a project combines resources from internal entities as diverse as USAID/W (in this case, the Office of Housing), a Mission, and a RHUDO, the authorization process should clearly define the roles of each and establish a plan of action so that the project starts promptly.  (6) Considerable effort and time were spent trying to get GOP approval for TA. USAID should prepare flexible funding documents to be signed by counterparts at the same time as the Project Agreement.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","7/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Policy reform|Housing finance|Housing policy|Regulatory agencies","Pakistan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABK735.pdf","1,107 KB","008588 - USAID.

"Evaluates a project to demonstrate practical methods for sustainable utilization and conservation of natural resources in Zimbabwe.  Mid-term evaluation covers the period 8/89-1/94 and is based in part on interviews with wildlife experts and project beneficiaries. The project is providing meaningful benefits to residents of the project area, but suffers from several errors in design and from misunderstandings concerning the Grant Agreement.  Key problems are as follows. (1) Divisions have arisen between USAID managers, based in Harare, who are concerned with administration and accounting, and host country agencies, based in Bulawayo, who are concerned with resource management and rural livelihoods. (2) The project is isolated from Zimbabwe's CAMPFIRE movement, which tends to ignore the project area on the grounds that it is already serviced by USAID.  USAID's view that the project area has a geographical integrity of its own reinforces this isolation.  (3) Although the project is part of a larger regional project, it has failed to achieve progress in important regional wildlife issues.  (4) A superficial Environmental Impact Assessment, together with a lack of engineering review, have made the sustainability of infrastructure development questionable and exposed the project to unknown quantities of risk.  (5) Project implementation is rarely from the bottom up, leading some communities to mistrust the project.  The problem becomes particularly acute when it diminishes the financial benefits which households regard as their due or excludes some wards from investment. Lessons learned include the following.  (1) Inadequate scrutiny of design documents increases the likelihood of difficulties during implementation.  (2) Before entering into agreements with USAID, participating agencies need to understand the restrictions they will encounter. (3) Difficulties between USAID and its implementing partners are unlikely to vanish as a result of workshops and meetings. Sympathy and understanding are also important.  (4) When problems owe their source to specific individuals within the USAID hierarchy, those individuals should be given counsel.  (5) Regarding this evaluation, 36 pages of terms of reference are excessive for an effort lasting only several weeks.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Natural resource management|Wildlife resources","Zimbabwe","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABK749.pdf","454 KB","008772 - ULG Consultants Ltd.","","008628 - USAID.

"Evaluates a project to support PVOs in assisting the growing numbers of the poor in Mozambique, particularly those displaced by the insurgency of the late 1980s and early 1990s.  Mid-term evaluation covers the period 6/90-6/94. The project has to some extent achieved its objectives of improving the food security and well-being of those most seriously affected by the insurgency, reducing vulnerability to absolute poverty within targeted population groups, and facilitating the transition from emergency relief to rehabilitation.  However, the degree of attainment of these objectives cannot be determined since output targets were not stated precisely and quantitatively in many Cooperative Agreements; nor has the project's monitoring system produced accurate and cumulative statements of actual outputs despite the frequent reports demanded of PVO recipients.  What can be said is that the project had significant impact in alleviating and averting widespread suffering. Only within the last year, as peace has begun to return, has the project been able to begin addressing the underlying causes of poverty, and thus begin the transition from a purely relief program to a longer-term more developmental approach. The PVO grantees have performed competently and professionally in managing and executing grant activities, although costs seem relatively high.  Poor transportation infrastructure, and dangers associated with mined roads, raised costs considerably and were a major factor in the delays associated with grant start-up and implementation.  Another reason for the high cost is the use of a large number of expatriates, which seems to be the norm for Mozambique.  There are simply too few Mozambicans with the skills and expertise required to manage large scale relief and rehabilitation efforts.  In addition, working with the poor who are socially marginalized and geographically isolated has always been an expensive undertaking. The project management team has been severely understaffed and undersupported despite the fact that adequate resources have existed to address this fundamental problem.  The grant development and approval process has overridden all other project management responsibilities. Nonetheless, the team has accomplished a herculean task in keeping the project on track while obligating some $60 million in project funds, and it has been praised by PVOs and USAID/Mozambique alike for creating an open, supportive, and professional environment in a situation of great stress. The remainder of the project should be looked on as a transition to a follow-on project and as an opportunity to re-institute ""best practices"" within project and PVO management. Lessons learned are as follows.  (1) Project management is highly labor-intensive in PVO projects even when providing grants to ""grant worthy"" PVOs.  This is even more pronounced in development (as distinct from relief and rehabilitation) activities, in which capacity building becomes a major objective.  (2) While current thought within donor circles posits a ""relief-to-development"" continuum, there seems to be no way to distinguish, either conceptually or practically, between relief and rehabilitation on one hand and rehabilitation and development on the other hand.  A distinction can be made between relief and development, however, and projects should promote one or the other; if not, experience has shown that development objectives are usually subjugated to relief imperatives.  (3) While issues of sustainability and participation are essential to development activities, relief and rehabilitation programs should not be conditioned by the same standards.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","6/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Private voluntary organizations|Humanitarian assistance|Poverty|Refugee relief|Disaster relief|Disaster rehabilitation|War victims|Food security|Rural areas|Complex emergency","Mozambique","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABK748.pdf","8,074 KB","003970 - Management Systems International, Inc.

"Evaluates project to form cadres of U.S. volunteer farmers to transfer technical and management skills to farmers, those involved in the food processing industry, and agricultural associations in the New Independent States (NIS) (Farmer-To-Farmer [FTF] program).  Midterm evaluation covers the period 10/92-5/94. The project has met most of its objectives.  Farmer volunteers have been of high quality, and the project, as it matures and gains management experience, seems to be getting more effective. The project has transferred technological and management practices to farms and agricultural enterprises, which has contributed to the privatization and development of the NIS agricultural sector, although the project's modest level precludes major impacts. People-to-people exchange objectives are also being met; almost all organizations and volunteers are enthusiastic about the benefits of the relationships that the project has fostered. The project could assist more farmers and enterprise managers by assigning volunteers to educational and training institutions and to projects which are directly providing technology and private management training to farmers and enterprise managers. The project would also be more useful if it were operating in the context of a NIS agricultural strategy. Lessons learned are as follows.  (1) The FTF concept is a simple one that should not be complicated by layers of bureaucracy.  (2) FTF projects must be demand-driven to succeed.  If implementors push too hard to meet volunteer quotas, they will inevitably select individuals who are not yet ready to be volunteers.  (3) Best results are obtained by focus rather than dispersion; sustainable development impact will come from targeting specific regions and particular agricultural sectors and institutions.  (4) People-to-people exchanges utilizing high-quality volunteers are worthwhile and produce models of technology transfer and management practices.","Delivery order no. 16","Special Evaluation","Documents","AEP-0085-I-00-3002-00","","5/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural development|Farmer training|Technology transfer|Agricultural technology|Volunteers|Interpersonal communication|Management development|Business enterprises|Farmers|Managers|Privatization|Associations|Institution building","New Independent States","","","000436 - Development Associates, Inc.","","007746 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of the Farmer-to-Farmer (FTF) Program, which uses person-to-person relationships between U.S. agriculturalists and developing country counterparts as a means of promoting agricultural development and international understanding. The evaluation covers the period since the program's inception in 1985. Currently operating in more than 60 countries in Asia, Africa, Latin America, and Europe, the FTF program utilizes the voluntary services of U.S. farmers, agriculturalists, land grant universities, private businesses, and non-profit farm organizations to meet the needs of host country farmers and farmer organizations in a wide variety of areas, including animal health, field crop cultivation, fruit and vegetable growing, food processing, honeybee and honey production, marketing, agricultural inputs, agricultural extension, and cooperative and farm group management.  Implementing agencies include Volunteers in Overseas Cooperative Assistance (VOCA), the National Association of the Partners of the Americas, Winrock International Institute for Agricultural Development, and the National Farmers Union. First and foremost, FTF is a good use of USAID resources.  The program provides an important link between the agricultural and agribusiness community in the United States and counterparts in USAID client countries.  The evaluation's recommendations for improving the program presuppose that it is fundamentally sound and that it should be continued. The majority of returned volunteers believe in the FTF program and are satisfied with it.  They like the direct, person-to-person approach, free of bureaucratic layers between themselves and their clients, whose overall comments on them were complimentary.  The volunteers themselves felt that, given the time and resources available, they had adequately addressed the problems put to them.  A great majority felt that their work had been useful or even very useful for the client, with most able to cite specific changes for which they had been responsible. On the negative side, despite the complimentary comments made on their work, the volunteers, regardless of the geographic region of their assignment, almost universally complained of a lack of follow-up and feedback.  Additionally, some of the implementing agencies are seeking to expand the program beyond their present staff and monitoring capabilities, justifying this by saying that the program is demand driven.  With this expansion grows the danger that the program will become another unwieldy and unmanageable operation, more form than substance. Major lessons learned and recommendations are as follows.  (1) The core of the FTF program lies in its volunteers.  Dedicated, enthusiastic, and highly motivated, these skilled professionals need to feel that their recommendations are acted on or at least followed up on. Implementors must thus take care in choosing counterpart organizations with the capacity to absorb and act upon the TA they receive.  (2) With the annual budget standing at $3-4 million, the maximum number of implementors should not be increased and should probably be reduced. Moreover, in light of the undue management burden caused by having the program spread over 60 countries, the number of participating countries should also be substantially reduced.  (3) Active Mission support for the program increases the success ratio and sustainability of the in-country projects and the impact of the volunteer's TA.  (4) Consecutive visits to a project by the same volunteer increases that project's chances of success.  (5) Prospects for sustainability are enhanced by structured short-term, hands-on U.S. training.  It is recommended that the implementors establish a Reverse FTF program for training promising host country candidates identified by the volunteers. (6) The project should establish universal impact indicators for inclusion in all contracts and agreements.  In a related area, the implementors and USAID should assume greater responsibility in monitoring the impact of FTF-funded projects.","Delivery order no. 16","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","AEP-0085-I-00-3002-00","","4/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Interpersonal communication|Farmers|Agricultural extension|Agricultural technology|Technology transfer|Volunteers|Private voluntary organizations|Technology adoption|Absorptive capacity","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABK754.pdf","1,287 KB","000436 - Development Associates, Inc.","","007746 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (8/85-6/90) to improve the primary education system in Jamaica. The project was successful.  It distributed 12 million books to 1.75 million children vs. targets of 2.7 million books and 350,000 children. Additionally, 8,000 teacher's kits were distributed to all teachers in 784 schools.  The textbooks effected some measure of change in the teachers' methodology, students' performance and even parents' reading habits, but their cost was too high.  The Ministry of Education (MOE) intends to address the cost problem by expanding competitive procurement. Meeting the project goal, a total of 66 schools were renovated, 10 of them through community participation.  This participation resulted in a marked improvement in areas such as class comfort, teaching aids, and student and teacher morale.  All schools involved reported a marked decrease in vandalism.  Most importantly, for every dollar spent on community participation, volunteerism yielded eight dollars. Training in community maintenance of the schools was provided to 375 persons vs. a target of 150, and approximately 75% of those trained were women.  Trainees were influential in setting up the School/Community Outreach Program for Education (SCOPE). The success of SCOPE efforts made it possible for the MOE to initiate the Community Maintenance Program whereby 794 primary schools islandwide were given a cash grant to implement maintenance programs.  This program will be evaluated early in 1991 under the follow-on project (5320155).","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","11/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Primary education|Primary schools|Community participation|Community self help|Textbooks|Educational materials|Beneficiary count","Jamaica","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABK776.pdf","135 KB","008563 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (3/84-8/89) to help establish the National Development Foundation of Jamaica (NDF/J) and support the expansion of its credit, TA, and training programs to small-scale non-farming enterprises.  Due to the changing of Mission personnel, the report, written 5 years after the PACD, was prepared by NDF/J. The project purpose and objectives were accomplished.  (1) An Executive Director as well as other staff were recruited.  (2) The Montego Bay branch was established in November of 1984.  (3) Officers of the NDF/J traveled abroad as well as to sister foundations to be trained and to obtain experience in the operations of similar credit institutions. (4) Commodities such as a security vault, motor vehicles, and typewriters were acquired.  (5) External TA for recruitment of staff, establishment of NDF/J, and design of mechanisms for credit and portfolio management was provided.  (6) A fund for extending loans to clients was established. Lessons learned were as follows.  (1) The provision of credit and TA to the small business sector is a specialized and costly undertaking which requires developmental assistance.  NDF/J would not be what it is today without the kinds of assistance provided by the project.  (2) Organizational sustainability must be seen as a long-term objective, and becomes an even greater challenge when the organization operates in an inflationary economy.  (3) Assistance should be programmed to conclude when the organization attains sustainability.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","10/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Institution building|Foundations|Business support services|Technical assistance|Management training|Commercial credit|Small scale enterprises|Revolving fund|Personnel","Jamaica","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABK772.pdf","170 KB","008797 - National Development Foundation of Jamaica","","008563 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (6/83-3/92) to assist the Government of Jamaica (GOJ) in reforming its tax system. The project was generally successful.  The tax system was simplified and made more equitable, the base of many taxes was significantly broadened, applicable tax rates were lowered, and a system of incentives conducive to export-oriented growth was put in place.  As a result of the reduced rates and the introduction of the exemption threshold of J$8,580 per annum for individuals, tax savings were available to individuals and companies, but even so, there was no revenue loss; in fact, tax revenues, as a share of GDP, rose after the reform.  The broadening of the tax base was achieved as a consequence of the introduction of the General Consumption Tax. Other accomplishments include establishment of the Revenue Board's Training Center, training of 100 Revenue Agents, and skills upgrading of over 4,000 Revenue Services staff. Additionally, efficiency has improved due to computerization and modernization of procedures. On the negative side, reform of company and property taxes was less successful due to persistent structural problems; payroll taxation has not been reformed; tax compliance rates are still very low; and the computerization program fell short of expectation. Key lessons learned are follows.  (1) With help from local experts, the GOJ is capable of fulfilling Revenue Services' training needs.  (2) In order for a project to be successfully implemented, the required resources must not only be committed but should be available on demand. (3) In order to effectively implement far-reaching tax policy and tax structure changes, administrative capability should be simultaneously developed.","Loan no. 532-V-023","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","10/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Tax collection|Tax rates|Tax reforms|Taxes|Income taxes|Tax incentives|Institution building|Technical training","Jamaica","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABK773.pdf","393 KB","008798 - Jamaica.

"PACR of a project (1986-90), implemented by Trafalgar Development Bank (TDB), to promote and finance both new and expanding privately owned, sustainable economic ventures.  The PACR was prepared by TDB at USAID/J's request because due to the age of the project no one in the Mission was familiar enough with the project to write a PACR. TDB has been successful in achieving project goals and objectives. It has:  (1) contributed to the mobilization of capital and the financing of businesses, resulting in economic development and employment generation, the creation of value added, earnings and savings of foreign exchange, and technology transfer; (2) played a pioneering role in long-term foreign exchange loans and contributed to export promotion, resulting in a diversification of the economy's product base; (3) promoted high-risk sectors (agriculture, information processing) and the nontraditional sector (including agroprocessing and the mining of nonmetallic minerals); and (4) demonstrated ability to effectively channel funds that might be available for development purposes under an appropriate interest rate policy. In terms of quantitative achievements, TDB successfully mobilized U.S.$30.1 million and J$64.6 million in long-term funds from a variety of sources, and used USAID funds to finance 65 projects which have: directly created some 2,892 jobs; generated an average annual turnover level of $J31.5 million; and generated an estimated US$336.5 million in earnings and US$95.2 million in savings. Project experience indicates the importance of:  (1) an appropriate portfolio mix; (2) astute risk management; (3) adequacy of security; (4) proper monitoring; (5) flexibility in financing and refinancing; (6) collaboration with other financial institutions locally and overseas; (6) and the need to respond quickly and appropriately to economic changes both local and international.","Attachment: XD-ABK-774-A|PACR was prepared by the contractor at USAID/J'S request","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","8/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Development banks|Private sector|Economic development|International trade|Commercial credit|Business enterprises|Capital assistance|Employment|Technology transfer|Foreign exchange","Jamaica","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABK774.pdf","817 KB","008799 - Trafalgar Development Bank Ltd.","","008563 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (8/88-2/94) to improve the effectiveness of agricultural and rural development projects in Latin American countries by providing technology and information in high-priority technical areas (LAC TECH I project). The project greatly exceeded the targets set for its principal area of focus, the provision of TA to LAC missions. Specifically, the project provided 1,935 person-days of TDY (285% of target), conducted 20 seminars and workshops (125% of target), and produced 50 technical papers and analyses (238% of target). The quality and rapid delivery of this TA has been a key factor in the project's success.  Project advisors helped the LAC Bureau produce an Agriculture and Natural Resource Management Strategy and synthesized lessons learned into technical bulletins and papers which are distributed throughout the missions. Lessons learned are as follows.  (1) Faced with a significant cut in funding, the follow-on project (LAC TECH II) may not be able to afford the same level of TA that was provided by LAC TECH I. However, the follow-on should maintain a focus on mission needs to the extent possible.  (2) There has been a good audience for the technical bulletins and papers; the emphasis on the production of these will continue under LAC TECH II.  The follow-on will also continue to emphasize the use of advisory services for sector assessments and strategic planning rather than for project design and evaluation.","Related documents: PD-ABK-842 (final report -- USDA/OICD/IIP RSSA)|and PD-ABJ-268 (final report -- Chemonics International)|Project title: Latin America and Caribbean agriculture and rural|development technical services II (LAC TECH II)","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","9/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Technical assistance|Agricultural development|Rural development|Technology transfer|Development strategies|Information dissemination|Technical information","Latin America","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABK841.pdf","57 KB","007275 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (8/88-2/94) to provide services in high-priority technical areas affecting agriculture and rural development in Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) countries (LAC-TECH I project). The amount and impact of the TA provided by U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) advisors under the RSSA surpassed project targets. USDA advisors provided 28 person-months of TA to as many as 14 LAC missions, delivered 4 workshops, and produced 24 technical papers and cross-cutting analyses as well as an educational video in the areas of food policy, forestry and natural resources policy, and plant protection and quarantine. Analyses and recommendations were widely distributed in the field and throughout USAID/W and contributed significantly to the USAID/LAC's programming in agriculture and natural resources.  In addition, a significant amount of information services were provided by the Technical Inquiries Staff of USDA's Office of International Cooperation and Development (OICD) and by USDA's Miami Market News Service. Lessons learned are as follows.  (1) USDA advisors became key players in articulating agriculture and natural resources strategy for the LAC Bureau.  The series of cross-cutting analyses and lessons learned-type bulletins should be continued under LAC-TECH II.  Where possible, USDA workspace within LAC Bureau offices should be retained.  (2) The efficiency and effectiveness of implementation was greatly increased by assigning a full-time coordinator to RSSA administration.  (3) While the management of activities of several advisors under one umbrella RSSA was not smooth early on, financial monitoring units set up by OICD and the RSSA coordinator make it feasible and desirable to consolidate RSSA activities under LAC TECH II.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","8/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Development project planning|Agricultural development|Agricultural planning|Natural resource development|Technical assistance|Development strategies|Rural development","Latin America|Caribbean","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABK842.pdf","376 KB","001203 - U.S. Dept. of Agriculture.

"Evaluates Wellstart International's (WS's) Expanded Promotion of Breastfeeding program, a subproject of the Breastfeeding and Maternal and Neonatal Health Project.  Mid-term evaluation covers the period 9/91-9/94. The program is making an important positive contribution to promoting breastfeeding in the developing world and has been successful in getting ""optimal"" breastfeeding included in national health policies.  The direct benefits of optimal breastfeeding in the first 4-6 months have been conclusively demonstrated in many developing countries.  Moreover, WS has achieved considerable expertise, contacts, and institutional capacity to achieve continued impact on worldwide breastfeeding patterns.  Priority over the next 2 years should be given to social marketing and community outreach and, most urgently, to evaluating the effects of breastfeeding promotion efforts on targeted beneficiaries. WS has done very well is in the international policy arena, working closely with WHO and PAHO to disseminate global and national breastfeeding statements.  It has been particularly successful in negotiating language for two international policy documents:  the 1992 International Conference on Nutrition in Rome, and the 1994 International Conference on Population and Development in Cairo. Long-term programs have been initiated in nine countries under a variety of conditions, with Honduras and Cameroon having the most comprehensive programs.  The programs are highly collaborative at the planning and implementation stages, and great attention is paid to the training of professionals and to policy interventions.  There is concern, however, that the programs will not have been fully and successfully implemented by the PACD. Additionally, greater emphasis needs to be placed on reaching women more directly, and on finding ways to sustain optimal breastfeeding practices.  WS should also begin documenting approaches and quantifying the outputs of the programs and assessing their progress. Short-term TA has been used in 16 countries, in a number of them very successfully.  WS should leave open the potential for short-term assistance, but should carefully limit its use as the need to focus resources becomes increasingly important. Regarding research, there is a need for WS to focus and initiate applied research in areas affecting the practical expansion of optimal breastfeeding in developing countries.","Project title: MotherCare|Project title: Health technical services (HTS)","Special Evaluation","Documents","HRN-5974-C-00-3001-00|HRN-C-00-93-00001-00","","9/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Breastfeeding|Maternal child health care|Private voluntary organizations|Health policy|International organizations|Health professional education","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABK845.pdf","4,209 KB","003366 - TvT Associates|000981 - Pragma Corp.","","008291 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (7/86-12/93) to establish an autonomous Research Advisory Council (RAC) to sponsor research on problems constraining the production of priority crops in Jamaica.  The project was implemented by the Jamaica Agricultural Development Foundation (JADF). The research efforts sponsored by the project have contributed valuable information for improving the efficiency of Jamaican agriculture.  While not all have produced results that can be immediately transferred, they have identified limitations or other research activities that could lead to the solution of problems now limiting productivity.  Specific accomplishments include, inter alia: (1) significant increases in production and export of ornamental flowers and orchard crops, including anthurium and papaya; (2) adoption and commercial export development for blast freezing and vacuum packing of breadfruit and ackee; (3) introduction of new water aeration techniques in fish ponds to increase stock densities; (4) adoption of micro-irrigation systems on small-scale vegetable farms in the Rio Cobre Basin; (5) research on the forage value of African Stargrass, which is now being used by one of Jamaica's largest dairy producers; and (6) creation in St. Thomas of 10 orchid farms which have become a cooperative and have launched a self-financed second phase of the project. Postgraduate training of 50 persons, 37 of them Jamaicans, contributed to the pool of skilled personnel needed for an effective research system.  Unfortunately, due to Jamaica's lack of a long-term agricultural research program, there are few employment opportunities for these trainees, although at least 10 have been hired by successor research programs in which JADF is involved.  Also, JADF has set up an endowment of J$10 million to support commercial agricultural production and research. The following lessons were learned.  (1) The sustainability of the project was compromised by its neglect of the Ministry of Agriculture and other public sector agricultural research resources.  Agricultural research sustainability should have been a prime concern from the outset.  (2) Although training emerged as a critical element, it was not adequately addressed at the outset.  In a country like Jamaica, lack of a large and well-trained agricultural research community is a preeminent constraint. (4) A grantee institution must not delegate full fiscal responsibility for a foreign donor grant to a subsidiary NGO.  (5) If agricultural research is to continue in Jamaica, it will require initiatives in two general areas.  For simple adaptive research questions, key factors include a strong public sector role combined with extension from commodity groups such as the parastatal commodity boards. For more technical and complex research questions, a strong partnership between government and food processors, large agricultural estates, and even foreign private agribusiness will probably be key.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","6/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural research|Private sector|Research management|Research priorities|Exports|Food processing|Fruit|Vegetables|Flowers|Agricultural development|Agricultural training|Crop diseases|Irrigated farming|Project sustainability|Institutional linkages|Fish ponds|Forage grasses","Jamaica","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABK849.pdf","142 KB","008563 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (8/84-8/93) to upgrade agricultural education in Jamaica by expanding/improving the College of Agriculture (COA) at Passley Gardens and Knockalva Agricultural School. When the project began, COA, Jamaica's only center for tertiary agricultural training, was in disarray.  With the project's assistance COA has been revitalized:  the College has developed strong and enduring ties to Louisiana State University (the primary TA contractor), launched a Foundation Trust Fund for lasting financial support, doubled dorm space, financed U.S. faculty training, and increased enrollment from a pre-project maximum of 240 to nearly 400.  COA graduates are having a significant impact on the sector, with nearly 100% of graduating students receiving and accepting offers of employment within 90 days of graduation.  Administrative improvements included preparation of a precise mission statement, modification of the COA's administrative cost structure, and development of a comprehensive set of administrative policy statements.  In the Knockalva Agricultural School, new and renovated classrooms and laboratories have increased student capacity to 190, and the farm complex was centralized adjacent to the dairy facility. Training was the project's most successful component, with 29 individuals sent for U.S. degree training, and 33 academic degrees earned so far.  Major staff limitations have been overcome as a result of this component, and a stable and well-trained teaching force has evolved.  Detailed achievements under the construction component are included in the report. Lessons learned are as follows.  (1) Because the project failed to train those responsible for following USAID procurement requirements, the procurement of equipment was poorly planned and executed.  (2) Passage of the COA Act and the autonomy it provides, as well as the creation of the COA-Jamaica Foundation, will have significant impact on COA's long-term viability and sustainability.  (3) Training in institutional management and administration is an important area that should be included in future programs.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","6/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural schools|Agricultural education|Universities and colleges|Institution building|Personnel development|Participants|Faculty|Building construction|Financial resources|Economic self sufficiency","Jamaica","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABK850.pdf","191 KB","008563 - USAID.

"PACR of a project to implement a typhoid prevention and control program in Savanna la Mar, Westmoreland, Jamaica.  U.S. assistance was funded under a Section 416 (b) commodity monetization agreement, which was signed in 4/91; the project was completed in 3/94. Accomplishments were as follows.  (1) Clinical and epidemiological surveillance were upgraded.  Regional medical authorities established a functioning epidemiological surveillance unit which will provide fast response to future disease outbreaks in the area.  In addition, improvements to the Savanna la Mar Hospital laboratory provide a capability for testing and treating suspected typhoid sufferers which did not previously exist in Westmoreland. (2) There is anecdotal evidence that project health education activities significantly increased awareness of the causes, symptoms, and treatment of typhoid.  However, a series of focus group seminars indicates that behavior patterns have not changed accordingly. (3) The project improved the original treatment plant facility for the Roaring River water Distribution System, including education and monitoring of operators, strengthening of operational controls, and improved monitoring of water quality. Moreover, project construction, when completed in 7/94, will double the capacity for treated water output to 5 million gallons/day, thereby addressing the prime factor suspected of leading to recent typhoid outbreaks.  The project also has been able to provide metered potable water to several squatter settlements which previously lacked access to clean water. However, required general improvements to the Savanna la Mar area distribution system proved too extensive and beyond the project's financing capability. A major pipe replacement is needed to control leaks. (4) Finally, completion of over 1,000 pit latrines in and around Savanna la Mar met the original target and will improve sanitary conditions.  Five public sanitary conveniences built under the project will also improve sanitation.  However, at least another 1,000 pit latrines are still needed, and the project could not bring any of the improvements initiated on waste treatment plants to completion, largely due to customs difficulties.  Due to a conflict with an ongoing cholera prevention project of the Ministry of Health, work on the treatment plant at Savanna la Mar Hospital never even began. Lessons learned are as follows.  (1) In commodity monetizations, USAID should first identify other donor plans as well as the demand for the commodity.  In this project, butteroil imported under the U.S. program competed with parallel butteroil imports of the World Health Program in a highly inflationary environment; as a result, the U.S.-provided butteroil took over a year to sell off.  (2) The implementing entity should be made the reporting entity from the beginning, and reporting requirements and format should be clearly established up front.  In the present case, the Planning Institute of Jamaica (PIOJ), tasked with reporting, was completely dependent on the implementing agency, the UN Development Program, for information.  As a consequence, PIOJ relinquished the reporting function, except for commodity sales data, to UNDP, which, however, proved highly resistant to USAID reporting needs and failed to provide useful data on progress. (3) Construction activities always take longer than expected. Given the high rate of inflation in Jamaica, additional time means significant increases in Jamaican dollar costs. Consequently, budget estimates need to factor in expectations for significant cost increases.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","7/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Disease prevention and control|Typhoid|Epidemiology","Jamaica","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABK851.pdf","199 KB","008563 - USAID.

"Evaluates five USAID-assisted NGO projects to stimulate small-scale agro-enterprise in Sri Lanka:  Agri-Dev Commercial Small Farm Development (Agricultural Cooperative Development International -- ACDI); Women Entrepreneur Training and Development (Agromart Foundation Societies); Tea Cultivators Assistance (TEACUP) and Private Seed Industry Development and Support (SID) (sponsored by CARE); and Socio-Economic Upliftment of Small Farmers in North Western Province (Nation Builders Association).  The evaluation included interviews with participating farmers/entrepreneurs. Earnings from NGO-induced enterprises have generally been modest, in the range of Rs 20,000-50,000 ($400-1,000) per year for participating farm families.  However, the gains, though modest, are very meaningful to these families, who may live at the edge of subsistence. Financing requirements for new enterprises, which range from Rs 5,000 to 10,000 or more, were identified as the largest hurdle to business start-ups.  Current financing avenues, which include small group revolving funds and seasonal loans from contract buyers, are not adequate to meet needs; ways must be found to get banks involved in lending to small farmers.  In this regard, land titling procedures, group guarantees, and other procedural requirements were identified as the major obstacles to greater bank involvement.  However, once beyond the start-up hurdle, innovative groups and individuals seem to find ways to expand on their own. The following were identified by beneficiaries as particularly valuable aspects of the NGO programs:  (1) NGOs' key role in inspiring and energizing new enterprise formation by small farmers and their families; (2) the entrepreneurship, business, and financial management training, as well as the technical training and field staff provided; (3) NGOs role in forming and reinforcing local farmer groups; (4) assistance in arranging start-up financing; and (5) the ""intangible"" growth of local self-confidence and initiative that the NGO programs are promoting. Areas where the NGO programs fell short or need strengthening are as follows.  (1) Local entrepreneurs' access to information about national and overseas markets is poor.  (2) NGOs tend to rely too heavily on the success of single enterprises, and too often continue to focus on enterprises that are doing well (and that are examples of success) while neglecting to stimulate new start-ups and/or assist enterprises that are struggling.  (3) Only limited attention is given to environmental concerns, the growth of farm worker capabilities, and financial and legal arrangements for intergenerational transitions of agro-enterprises.  (4) The spread effects of innovations to nearby areas have been limited.  (5) The NGOs seem to lack clear strategies or aims in regard to their role in supporting enterprises which are ready to move, or have moved, into the commercial expansion phase.  (6) Planning for post-project sustainability and growth has been inadequate. A key lesson to be drawn from the projects is that considerable latent agro-entrepreneurial talent and interest exists among both men and women in Sri Lanka's rural and semirural areas. Furthermore, there are numerous skilled, motivated people in Sri Lanka -- government employees, retired agriculturalists and managers, and others -- who are interested in assisting small farmers and who represent a resource which has been essentially untapped by the NGOs.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","11/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Agribusiness|Small scale enterprises|Agricultural enterprises","Sri Lanka","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABK992.pdf","1,202 KB","","","008606 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (5/90-2/94) to provide rehabilitation services to noncombatant victims of civil strife in Honduras.  The project has been implemented by the World Rehabilitation Fund (WRF) and its newly created Honduran affiliate, the Honduran Rehabilitation Association (HRA). The project has exceeded its initial objectives; a total of 2,031 persons received rehabilitation services, such as fitting with prosthetic or orthotic devices, physical training, and family support training; 56% of the beneficiaries were under age 17. HRA is not only working with the disabled, it is one of the largest, if not the largest employer of disabled workers in Honduras.  The approach used by WRF/HRA was the costly community-based rehabilitation (CBR) approach.  The quality of service was judged good by most recipients, although response time (about 3 months) was considered too long; this was due in part to the geographic distances that made delivery in the community setting difficult.  It should also be noted that WRF/HRA were helping to fill a huge need. WRF/HRA requested additional support in 4/93 which was denied because USAID felt that the CBR approach would always need external funding. Instead, USAID/H provided HRA with TA in management, marketing, and cost accounting through 8/94.  A new highly qualified HRA manager is restructuring the production, administration, and accounting units of HRA and a marketing plan is being developed.  HRA has already received small orders from El Salvador and local sales are rising steadily. The following lessons were learned.  (1) Inclusion of a business component in the original design aimed at gradual self-sufficiency of the local implementing PVO (HRA) could have ensured development, as well as humanitarian impact.  (2) A CBR program is labor-intensive and costly; the majority of HRA's 53 employees were more involved in rehabilitation services than in the production of prosthetic/orthotic devices for sale -- the key to the Association's sustainability.  (3) Future CBR initiatives in Honduras should focus on developing the ability of the existing communities to locate external funding sources where needed, even if this means going outside the community and results in ""primary or secondary"" integration.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","OTR-0000-A-00-8120-00","","9/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","War victims|Children|Rehabilitative medicine","Honduras","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABL068.pdf","147 KB","008555 - USAID.

"This report evaluates the pilot project on asset and property management in Szolnok, Hungary, to strengthen the municipality's capacity to monitor housing stock; transform the relationship between the municipal Housing Office and Szolnok (previously known as IKV, the former state-owned property management company); improve the level of property management services provided to the municipally owned rental units; and introduce competition in the provision of property management services. This evaluation of the project is composed of four components: an analysis of the project's expenses for 1992 and 1993; an analysis of a survey of the inhabitants of the project units; (3) results of an interview with the President of Tiszaber, the company which manages the project units; (4) and the opinions of the Asset Management staff members and an evaluation of their performance.  The objectives of the project were reached in varying degrees.  Furthermore, the financial data generated for the project units demonstrate that costs to operate these units were in line with predictions, and the data itself is more accurate and useful than that produced by IKV.  The tenants of these units believe that management services have improved somewhat under Tiszaber.  Tiszaber considers the project to have been worthwhile, as do members of the Asset Management branch of the Office of Housing.  In order for the project to enjoy continued success, the authority and responsibilities of the Asset Managers must be more clearly defined.

"Over the past 15 years, A.I.D. assistance for forestry development in Nepal has focused on developing the capability of the Nepalese government to implement its community forestry program to provide local groups with user rights to state-owned forests, along with accompanying TA from the forest service and NGOs.  The impact, effectiveness, sustainability, and replicability of those efforts are reviewed in this report.  The staff of Nepal's Department of Forests has improved its capacity to extend community forestry; user groups have improved their ability to prepare and implement forestry operational plans and increased their collective savings and local development investments; and community-managed forests and those under formal protection have experienced a measurable increase in tree growth and regeneration, ground cover, and soil moisture retention, a reduction in soil erosion, and improvement in wildlife habitats. In addition, particularly through NGO projects, the participation of women and disadvantaged groups in decision-making about natural resource management has improved. Overall, empowering of community user groups has been effective in promoting sustainable natural resource use in Nepal.  What is more, the community forestry model is rapidly spreading throughout project areas. The following lessons were learned.  (1) Once policy is set, the most efficient method for extending community forestry practices is through the use of NGOs.  (2) Forestry projects can provide a vehicle for A.I.D. to influence policy in a cost-effective manner.  (3) Targeting women for training and extension can improve the effectiveness and sustainability of community-based resource management.","Summary highlights: PN-ABS-509","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","4/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Social forestry|Community participation|Natural resource management|Development programs|Impact assessment","Nepal","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNABU995.pdf","1,490 KB","008058 - USAID.

"The Gambia Forestry Project (1979-86) aimed at reversing natural resource depletion by developing plantations and community woodlots, and improving sawmills and woodstoves.  This study finds that the project was largely unsuccessful for the following reasons.  (1) The concept of community woodlots proved unworkable in practice; there was no easy way to assign responsibility for offtake and management, and no clear incentive for community participation.  (2) In the case of plantations, it was determined by 1985 that they were not economically efficient and should not be used for firewood.  An alternative approach stressing management of the natural forest (which had been destroyed in order to establish the woodlots) proved manageable as well as beneficial in the short-term.  (3) Gmelina was an inappropriate species for both plantations and woodlots, and assumptions about its growth and survival rates were overly optimistic for The Gambia, especially during the severe drought of 1984-86. (4) Community woodlots require substantial labor, labor which is also needed to plant food crops.  Long-term forestry benefits could not compete with the basic short-term needs that agricultural activities fulfill.  (5) Although deforestation is a growing problem, there are still ample supplies of wood in the forests that people can cut and use for fuelwood; community woodlots, while environmentally sound woodlots, were not the only alternative for securing firewood.  (6) Even fast-growing species, such as Gmelina, usually require 10 years before they can be coppiced and the timber used for poles or sold commercially; thus, their benefit is only long-term. (7) The woodlots did not respond to needs as perceived by the villagers, which were for fruit trees, not firewood.  When many of the Gmelina seedlings died after the first year due to drought, many communities replanted fruit trees and/or horticultural crops.  In response to this project's poor performance, USAID/Gambia has reoriented its natural resource strategy to focus on economic incentives to encourage wise use of resources and on support for community control over natural resources.","Summary highlights: PN-ABG-050","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","9/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Natural resource management|Forestry|Agroforestry|Natural resource utilization|Trees|Plantations|Community participation|Woodstoves|Sawmills|Development programs|Impact assessment","Gambia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNABU996.pdf","1,268 KB","008058 - USAID.

"Mali is running out of forests.  Although wood accounts for 95% percent of Mali's energy needs, forests cover only 7% percent of the country's terrain, a situation exacerbated by the droughts of the 1960s and 1970s and by an annual population growth rate of 2.5%.  This report assesses the effect of USAID projects aimed at in reversing the depletion of forest resources in Mali.  Major findings are as follows. (1) The protectionist, state-oriented approach of Mali's Forestry Service has been ineffective. (2) U.S. and local NGOs have played major roles in implementing group and individual forestry management programs. (3) The Village Reforestation Project succeeded in building local ""ownership"" of forest conservation measures in project villages.  (4) Since the droughts of the 1960s and 1970s, Malians have a better working awareness of the role of forests and soil and water conservation. (5) Since 1991, Mali, with USAID assistance, has made rapid progress in policy reform.  (6) Malian programs are using a wide variety of improved and borrowed technologies for group and individual forestry, natural resource management, and sustainable agriculture.  (7) Inadequate information systems and linkages have limited the usefulness of USAID-funded forestry activities in identifying extendable technologies. In conclusion, USAID forestry programs in Mali are successful as pilot efforts that combine approaches to forestry and sustainable agriculture. Constraints to long-term sustainability of these programs include the lack of efficient linkages between research and extension and the fact that Forest Service carries out both extension and policing activities. Lessons learned are as follows.  (1) A sense of ownership is critical in a group undertaking.  (2) Effective forestry management requires broadening political participation through decentralization and delegation of rule-making authority.  (3) Forestry interventions are more likely to succeed when implemented simultaneously with agricultural interventions.  (4) A single agency cannot effectively carry out both enforcement and extension functions. An extensive bibliography is appended.","Summary highlights: PN-ABS-507","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","4/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Forestry|Natural resource depletion|Natural resource management|Government departments|Law enforcement|Community participation|Environmental policy|Policy reform|Private voluntary organizations|Indigenous private voluntary organizations|Development programs|Impact assessment","Mali","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNABU997.pdf","1,944 KB","008058 - USAID.

"Despite government replanting programs and regulations against deforestation, forests in the Philippines continue to be threatened by weak administration and the growing demand for fuelwood, timber, and farmland, especially in the heavily deforested upland areas.  This report summarizes a 1993 field study of the $11 million social forestry component (1983-91) of A.I.D.'s Rainfed Resources Development Project. Although it ended before demonstrating the benefits of repeated forest harvesting (the rotations of which require a minimum of 7-10 years), the project has been a great success.  It has sensitized local households and government agencies to environmental problems in upland areas; increased government and NGO capacity to develop and promote low-cost forest use and management; used community organizations to establish sustainable social forestry programs; and developed ""stewardship"" arrangements whereby local groups manage and use forested public upland areas.  Some problems persist:  official attention continues to focus on lowland irrigated rice cultivation (neglecting the needs of upland areas where the subtle relationships between forests and crop cultivation are poorly understood); the Department of Environment and Natural Resources and the Department of Agriculture have overlapping jurisdictions in regulating and supporting land use in upland areas because there is no clear title to sloping public upland areas; households have only leaseholder or squatter status and thus limited incentive to manage the land responsibly; and the high levels of poverty and illiteracy in upland communities make the provision of social services and technology transfer difficult.  There is a also a need for stronger political commitment, clearer tenure arrangements, and more technically sound approaches to forestry. Nevertheless, community forestry has emerged as one of the Philippine government's major tools in countering forest degradation in upland areas.  Lessons learned include the following. (1) Motivated and competent staff are critical to sustaining community-based conservation forestry activities.  (2) In the absence of positive political will, social forestry approaches can only partially meet deforestation challenges.  (3) Sound forestry practices spread and are sustained best when access to benefits of improved management can be assured of land for more than one harvest cycle.  (4) Hands-on training and technical expertise for both leaders and participants is a necessary part of upland social forestry programs.  (5) Upland forestry management systems need an ""economic engine"" for sustainability and expansion.","Summary highlights: PN-ABS-506","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","4/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Social forestry|Deforestation|Upland soils|Development programs|Impact assessment","Philippines","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNABU998.pdf","1,647 KB","008058 - USAID.

"USAID's Forest Resources for a Stable Environment (FORESTA) project aimed to reverse runaway deforestation in Costa Rica by supporting sustainable development of parks and buffer zones in the country's Central Volcanic ""Cordillera"" Conservation Area (ACCVC).  A Costa Rican NGO, FUNDECOR, was created to implement the project.  After describing the problems threatening forests in Costa Rica and USAID's assistance approach, this report discusses the implementation, impacts, and performance of the FORESTA project and draws a number of lessons.  The report shows that much has been achieved.  FUNDECOR has avoided the adversarial role of the General Directorate of Forestry and has developed partnerships with local landowners to reforest or pursue sustainable extraction of natural forest products.  It has also used education, training, and inputs from research organizations to introduce new forest management procedures, and has promoted sector reform through policy dialogue with the Costa Rican forestry service.  As a result of these efforts, ACCVC landowners and loggers are now using practices that reduce damage to natural forests and raise profits from logging while reducing costs.  Plantations established by FUNDECOR show initial positive signs of healthy tree growth.  Two problem areas stand out. First, using natural regeneration to create secondary forests in degraded areas may be more efficient than FORESTA's innovative promotion of native tree species which require government subsidies and have an uncertain long-term economic potential. Second, by emphasizing larger landowners, the project may have missed an opportunity to address the inequitable access to economic opportunities that is one of the major causes of natural resource deterioration, although it is also possible that such an emphasis is necessary for FUNDECOR's long-term survival.

"PACR of a project (1/93-6/94) to help the newly established Grain Management Cell (GMC) of the Punjab Food Department (PFD) in Pakistan to sustain the Bulk Grain Handling and Storage System introduced under the Agricultural Sector Support Program (ASSP). The project opened a Personal Ledger Account (PLA) into which Rs. 500,000 was placed to meet the cost of GMC activities; converted a godown (a warehouse) in the Provincial Reserve Center in Gulberg III, Lahore into an office building for the GMC and its training and research activities; and hired staff for the GMC. A sufficient number of PFD officials were trained to ensure the safe handling of the new bulk system technology.  The PFD conducted several courses in the new GMC office building, including a master trainers training course, a basic computer training course for deputy directors and others, a seminar on bulk grain management, a demonstration to show the technique of fumigating a stack of wheat bags under a sealed polyethylene cover, a short course on paddy handling for officials of the Pakistan Agricultural Storage and Services Corporation, an operational trainers training course, a short course on efficiency and disciplines rules, and a field staff training course.  Some of the training was implemented in coordination with UAF.  Research on grain protection was conducted jointly by the University of Agriculture, Faisalabad (UAF) and GMC. The project used A.I.D.-provided bulk handling equipment to mechanize Hex-Bins, retrieve wheat, load bulk wheat onto trucks, and deliver wheat in bulk to flour mills.  Since the equipment was mobile, it was moved from job to job to minimize idle time. GMC gradually increased the scope of the bulk operations beyond the existing bulk storage capacity by converting a HT godown for bulk storage at PR Center Islamabad; the conversion was cheaper than the construction of new facility would have been.  The PFD also worked to help ensure the market acceptance of clean wheat at a price differential sufficient to pay cleaning costs. The following lessons were learned.  (1) The project that introduces a new technology to the public or private sector can expect a very favorable response through practical demonstration of the technology; seeing is believing.  (2) For testing, demonstrating, and/or implementing a new technology, equipment can be fully utilized if it is mobile enough to be transported from work site to work site.  (3) The institutionalization of project activities, including new organizational systems, can best be managed through a separate cell established within the organization.  (4) In implementing a new mechanized system, it is advisable to begin by concentrating on a limited number of activities in order to ensure effective supervision and maximum use of available equipment.  Once experience and confidence has been gained, the scope of the activity can be gradually increased.  (5) The training of officials of an organization to implement the activities of a new technical system is best done through master trainers; a few qualified and talented officials of the organization itself could be selected and trained for this purpose.  (6) Financial and technical assistance provide a very useful support to sustain projects to introduce new technical systems into the public sector.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","8/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Institution building|Agricultural storage facilities|Food storage|Agricultural equipment|Government departments|Public sector|Technology transfer|Agricultural technology|Cereals|Materials handling operations","Pakistan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABL231.pdf","3,636 KB","008588 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (1/93-6/94) to help the Grain Research, Training, and Storage Management (GRTSM) Cell of the University of Agriculture, Faisalabad (UAF), Pakistan, to strengthen its research, training, and outreach programs. The UAF opened a Personal Ledger Account for GRTSM Cell activities into which Rs. 200,000 of the required Rs. 500,000 was placed; appointed eight professional staffers; and renovated the building, including grain storage research laboratories, which houses the Cell.  The laboratories now serve as the Cell's training and research center. In addition, the GRTSM Cell initiated a biannual publication of the ""Grain Storage Management Newsletter;"" a two-semester diploma course in Grain Storage Management, which was completed by nine students and covered the theoretical and practical aspects of grain storage management; one-day workshops for the Punjab Food Department staff working in the Faisalabad, Toba Tek Singh, Jhang, and Sahiwal districts and the Gujranwala division to demonstrate techniques of fumigation under polyethylene cover, and to discuss problems related insect pests, rodent pests, and fumigation techniques, and the magnitude of storage losses; and three workshops, in collaboration with the National Rural Support Program, for 60 male and female farmers to apprise them about insect pests and preservation methods of their domestic wheat stocks. A number of research projects are in progress and cover: monitoring the resistance of stored grain insect pests to phosphine and grain protectants; ecology of grain storage losses; comparative studies on traditional and supervised fumigation; determination of phosphine dosage for effective insect control under polyethylene cover; physical quality of grain and insect management in Bini Shell; the physical characteristics of wheat in Punjab; comparative assessment of different storage structures; economics of bulk handling of wheat; and qualitative and quantitative evaluation of Aflatoxin in stored wheat samples. Unfortunately, the GRTSM was not able to organize any of the three planned annual seminars or carry out bulk grain handling operations (USAID equipment was temporarily housed in the workshop of the Farm Machinery Department).  However, efforts are being made at UAF's Post Graduate Research Station to establish a field laboratory for bulk handling and storage of food grain and for training in bulk handling operations. The following lessons were learned.  (1) When a new course oriented toward a specific technology is to be introduced in a university, it could be managed properly by a separate cell established by the university.  (2) Short-term financial assistance provided to a university should be used for training and short-term research rather than for long-term research, results of which may not be available until after the project is completed.  (3) The outreach training program is useful for addressing the problems faced by the grain handling agencies since it demonstrates the results of research related to the problem. (4) The UAF was unable to utilize the bulk grain handling equipment for training because it possessed neither sufficient food grain nor large enough bulk storage facilities.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","8/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Institution building|Agricultural colleges|Agricultural extension|Agricultural research|Agricultural education","Pakistan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABL230.pdf","2,852 KB","008588 - USAID.

"Evaluates project component to provide training and TA in key areas of commercial law activity in Bulgaria, Poland, and Lithuania.  Final evaluation covered the period 1992-10/94. Training assistance included short- and long-term training in the form of workshops (in-country, in the region, in Rome, and in the United States) and law faculty and law firm internships (in the United States). Training effectiveness was influenced by the extent to which:  a tested training methodology and skilled instructors were used; training took the local context into account and drew comparisons with other European legal systems; included needs assessments and follow-up; formed part of a broader plan; and was targeted at an appropriate audience. TA included long-term, foreign resident advisors, medium- and short-term foreign advisors, short-term out-of-country specialists, and institution-building advocacy grants and related TA to NGOs.  Key factors influencing the effectiveness of the different types of TA include:  relevance of the background and qualifications of the advisor and his or her proficiency in the local language; the extent to which the assistance was clearly defined and understood by both providers and recipients; the adequacy of advance preparation of both advisors and recipients; whether the advisor was paid or not (a factor affecting not advisor performance but advisor availability); and the duration of the assistance (flexibility is a key requirement in this regard) and the degree to which it was coordinated with other activities and donors. Other factors influencing the effectiveness of TA include:  the extent to which assistance included participation by local counterparts and was adapted to local conditions and legal traditions; the degree to which the advisor was able to bring resources to bear in support of reform activities; the type of assistance approach (a pro-active approach proved more effective than the demand-driven approach envisioned in the Project Paper); and the specific type of law involved and the stage of its development (substantive areas of U.S. strength are perceived to be insolvency, banking, intellectual property, foreign investment and trade, and competition). It is much too early to fully assess the impact of assistance activities, but the various modes of training and TA have had a positive developmental impact overall and include the following results.  (1) Skills-based training workshops have increased the capacity of local professionals to understand, analyze, and perform commercial law transactions.  (2) Participation of women in training activities has been quite extensive and has led to increased involvement by women in commercial law reform activities.  (3) Workshops and law faculty internships have increased networking among local lawyers and the potential for consensus-building within the legal community.  (4) Law faculty internships have improved commercial legal education as law school curriculum have been revised, new commercial law courses are being taught, and different teaching approaches have been used.  (5) Short-term TA and advocacy grants have helped indigenous legal organizations become more sustainable and strengthened their capacity to promote commercial law reform. (6) Technical comments on draft legislation have been adopted and have led to improved drafts of commercial laws.  (7) Technical legal assistance workshops and law commentaries have contributed to increased and more informed discussions of draft legislation. (8) Resident advisors have accomplished role transfer as local individuals are more involved in law reform and have assumed increasing responsibilities in addressing commercial legal issues. It is important to note that no single formula or ""model"" for assistance in support of legal development exists.  Each mode of intervention must be carefully tailored to suit the particular needs and goals of commercial law reform in a specific country.","Delivery order no. 3|Contents: Main text -- Annexes","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","PCE-0026-Q-00-3031-00","","10/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Commercial law|Business law|Legal reform|Technology transfer|Technical training|Technical assistance|Consultants","Poland|Lithuania|Bulgaria","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABL246.pdf","5,414 KB","007294 - Coopers and Lybrand","","006991 - USAID.

"Evaluates the health education component of a project to institutionalize public child survival programs at the district level in three of Bolivia's nine departments.  Interim evaluation covers the period ending 11/94. Given important cultural, geographic, personnel, and time constraints, the project has achieved several positive results. The process of designing and testing the health education modules was lengthy and very expensive, but the results -- which include modules on social management and the census-based approach to health education, health promotion (through adult education) and diarrhea management, and popular participation and standard case management of acute respiratory infections -- are generally good. Since the program has been active in most communities for only 6 months, it is too early to gauge the impact of health education activities.  Nonetheless, the process has already: (1) generated enthusiasm, hard work, and many local innovations from government (National Health Secretariat) staff; (2) stimulated a greater sense of community identity in pilot communities; (3) raised the priority of good health and the level of knowledge in the pilot communities; (4) developed some very useful training and support materials that could be widely effective in Bolivia; and (5) established a good system of supportive supervision and follow-up training. On the negative side, the program has done a poor job of establishing meaningful program and impact indicators and in systematically collecting baseline information.  Additionally, while an educational approach has merits, it may result in little actual change in practices. Finally, the pilot communities only include some 12% of the districts' populations, and should be expanded. A major thrust of the recommendations is to incorporate several concepts from social marketing for developing comprehensive strategies aimed at specific, feasible changes in behavior. Overall, however, the health education component of the project has enough strengths to recommend its continuation.","BASICS technical directive no. 000-BO-01-017|Project title: Basic support for institutionalizing child survival|(BASICS)","Special Evaluation","Documents","HRN-6006-C-00-3031-00|HRN-C-00-93-00031-00","","11/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Child survival activities|Health education|Districts|Institution building","Bolivia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABL249.pdf","883 KB","000223 - Academy for Educational Development, Inc.

"Evaluates participant training project in Morocco to upgrade the managerial, analytical, and technological expertise of public and private sector Moroccans involved in planning and implementing Morocco's social and economic programs.  Final evaluation covers the period 1983-12/94. Project achievements have been superior.  The number of successfully completed U.S. training programs exceeded the project goal, with 247 long-term academic degrees and 762 short-term seminars, workshops, and courses.  Women made up 26% of participants, the private sector accounted for 21%, and 30% of the trainees attended Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) vs. goals of 30%, 10%, and 10%, respectively.  The completion rate of 98% for those who commenced long-term graduate studies in the United States represents one of the very best records ever achieved in USAID academic participant training. This success has been attributed to the selection process and to appropriate pre-departure English language training. Long-term participants considerably increased their understanding of U.S. family life, cultural and racial diversity, the role of women, democratic institutions, free market systems, volunteerism in community activities, and leadership styles. Short-term trainees increased their understanding most in the area of diversity.  Upon returning, some trainees sensed a lack of support from employers and colleagues, whom they felt were distrustful or envious.  However, the U.S. training was viewed as improving trainees' communication, interpersonal, and public speaking skills.  Few instances were found in which returnees felt that they were able to achieve better results because of colleagues having trained with them.  Most alumni are not active in post-training follow-on activities, and USAID is unclear as to how best to support returned trainees.  The project structure was appropriate and flexible, but effective mechanisms for training utilization were not in place at the employer level. In fact, employers' involvement was low, clearly a problem since they are major stakeholders.  The project was primarily a scholarship program.","Project title: Human and educational resources network support|(HERNS)","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","FAO-0071-I-00-3070-00|FAO-I-00-93-00070-00","","12/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Participant program administration|Participants|Education for development|Personnel development","Morocco","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABL285.pdf","3,054 KB","012322 - Aguirre International","","008579 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of a pilot project (9/90-9/94) to develop model micro hydro electricity projects (MHPs) in Nepal's private sector. Three MHPs -- Purang MHP with the capacity of 25 kw, Sikles MHP with the capacity of 100 kw, and Seema MHP with the capacity of 16 kw -- were all properly completed, with the exception of a minor technical problem at Sikles.  The implementing agencies could have easily built six MHPs as envisioned in the project paper, but did not because of the mission's policy decision not to pursue the construction of any more plants. All three MHPs were managed by electricity users' committees, as planned.  This community-management method was more effective than management of MHPs by the Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA); unlike the NEA, the users' committees can determine the electricity tariff and impose any additional charges on the electricity in order to mobilize local resources required for quick major repairs.  The drawback was lack of technical support, although USAID-funded on-site training has helped villagers understand how to operate and maintain the MHPs. The major problem faced by the committees was sale of electricity; in Sikles only 40 kw out of 100 kw could be sold, and in Seema only 3.5 kw out of 16 kw could be sold.  The problem may not be long-term for Sikles, where the people are better off economically (able to afford electricity) and where tourism development activities will be undertaken by the Annapurna Conservation Area Project (ACAP).  It is more of a problem in Seema, where the community is comprised of subsistence farmers who are poorer and also influenced by different political ideologies. Apart from the financial subsidy, both the cost/benefit ratio and economic internal rate of return of all three MHPs are very low. Nonetheless, the MHPs have produced significant social impacts; the MHPs have fostered a new relationship between the dominant ethnic group and other minority groups because of the common ownership and management of the MHPs, women now work in a soot-free environment in the home and are less burdened by the task of collecting firewood (although their working hours have increased from 1.5 to 3 hours), there have been improvements in environment (electricity has replaced or reduced the use of kerosene and firewood for lighting and dry cell batteries used for flashlights, radios, and cassettes), foreign currency savings have increased, improvements have been made in health and sanitation, and there has been a reduction of migration of people from villages to other places.  On the negative side, although all households contributed labor equally to construct the MHPs, they enjoyed its fruits unequally due to disparities in ability to pay for electricity. In conclusion, right-sized MHPs are economically replicable and sustainable because they are within the managerial capability of the rural people.  This potential will be realized when MHPs are integrated within microenterprises and when the electricity generated from MHPs completely replaces firewood. The following lessons were learned.  (1) Seasonal climactic conditions and labor availability must be taken into consideration during project planning in order to avoid time and cost overruns.  This is applicable to all three sites.  In Purang, most of the adults are not available during winter because they go to neighboring countries for trade.  In Seema and Sikles, people are not available for other work during the agricultural seasons.  (2) Communication gaps cause cost and time overruns, especially when so many agencies are involved in the construction of MHPs.  (3) When beneficiaries learn about the benefits of electricity, they take initiative toward building an MHP, but they do not subscribe for electricity even when it is available when they are not aware of its utility.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","9/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Pilot projects|Hydroelectric power plants|Small|Electric power generation|Community participation|Private sector","Nepal","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABL418.pdf","3,223 KB","008583 - USAID.

"At the request of Kazakhstan's central Ministry of Health, Abt Associates, Inc. evaluated two health insurance demonstrations, one ongoing and one planned, in two oblasts in the republic.  The evaluation covered four areas concerning health insurance and related health policy changes: (1) the adequacy of financing -- to what extent a new employer payroll contribution and other sources of revenue would ensure adequate financing of the health care system; (2) changes in efficiency -- what is the effect of the health insurance structure and related payment policies and organizational changes on the efficiency with which services are provided; (3) the impact on quality of care -- what is the effect of changes in financing, payment, and quality assurance programs on the quality of service delivery and ultimately on health status; and (4) the equity of access to care -- what is the effect of the new system on what was one of the strengths of the old system-relative equity of access to services by various socioeconomic groups.  The evaluation found that parts of these demonstrations can serve as models for health care reform for the rest of the country and that a number of specific design features can be used to help inform the debate about the health insurance reform law under consideration by the parliament.  To strengthen the existing demonstration models, especially in the context of national reform, a series of 40 recommendations and options for action were developed for financing, payment methods and efficiency, quality of care, and equity of access to care. Several areas for potential short-term technical assistance also were identified, including development of an improved legal framework for innovative demonstration sites in the future, intensive training activity, and model hospital cost and information systems.

"Evaluates a program to foster exports and foreign investment in Bolivia.  Midterm evaluation covers the period 1989-1/94. The program has been effective in promoting Bolivian exports, especially the nontraditional exports (NTEs) on which it has focused, and, to a lesser but still significant degree, foreign investment. During the period 1990-1993, the project helped develop more than $40 million in exports, or about 10% of the national total for NTEs.  The project has also generated more than $17 million in foreign investment in areas in which Bolivia previously had little or no foreign investment.  Economic data support the claim that the program has benefitted the Bolivian poor.  There are also anecdotal data and survey results indicating that both investment and export promotion efforts are having a favorable impact on employment and incomes. The success of the program can be attributed to flexibility in project management and to strong business acumen on the part of the staff.  The contractor and USAID/B have successfully redefined project objectives, reallocated project resources, and retargeted markets and sectors in order to maximize export and investment results.  For example, rather than targeting the United States and Europe for exports and investment as originally planned, the project capitalized on the opening of regional markets to increase intra-regional trade by opening offices in Argentina, Peru, Brazil, and Chile.  The contractor has demonstrated a strong business sense in picking companies and business persons that will perform, while USAID/B has given the contractor the needed flexibility to pick its beneficiaries and generate exports and investments. Project achievements have not been without tradeoffs, however. Combining export with investment promotion, while giving the program great flexibility and market access, has diffused the efforts of the contractor's overseas offices, and it is not likely that the project will achieve its target of $50 million in investments.  In another potential trouble area, an effective balance has been struck between helping larger, already-exporting firms find new markets and providing intensive production and marketing TA to smaller, export-ready firms. It is crucial to maintain this balance, since assistance to larger firms generates good results, while assistance to small/medium firms has more of a transforming effect on production, management, and marketing processes. The program has also been effective in developing sustainable exporting firms.  However, with no institutional home and uncertain government support, the program faces the prospect of terminating its activities in 1995, when USAID assistance is likely to end, just as it reaches the top of its operational learning curve.  Results to date support the argument to continue, in a reduced manner if need be, both the overseas offices and production-oriented TA. Several lessons have been learned.  (1) Changing markets and regional trends demand flexibility in the design and implementation of investment and export promotion projects.  (2) The strong trading and business background of program staff has enabled the project to follow a case-by-case targeting of viable companies and obtain quick results. (3) Focusing on results and on developing sustainable exporting companies, while a successful strategy, makes it difficult, if not impossible, to sustain the program after USAID funding is terminated. (4) The highly subsidized nature of the program's export promotion services affects the credibility of the compliments heaped on these services by program clients.","Also entitled: Midterm evaluation of the USAID/Bolivia investment|and promotion program|Project title: Implementing policy change (IPC)","Special Evaluation","Documents","AEP-5451-I-00-2058-00","","1/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Export promotion|Nontraditional exports|Investment promotion|Foreign investment|Business enterprises|Business support services|Small scale enterprises|Business formation|Development strategies|Development project management|Project sustainability|Markets|Economic impact|Income generation|Employment|Regional trade","Bolivia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABL458.pdf","3,037 KB","000241 - Louis Berger International, Inc.

"Evaluates Panama project of the Caribbean and Latin American Scholarship Program (CLASP)/Central American Peace Scholarship Project (CAPS).  Final impact evaluation covers the period 1986-12/94. The CAPS project was driven by complex and changing goals, influenced by the political crisis of the 1988-89 invasion of Panama; the crisis caused a 2-year gap in the program, resulting in a breakdown of student tracking and assistance.  Substantive changes were made in the project's design before and after the crisis, including a shift in the research design to focus on returnees as change agents and on the economic betterment of socioeconomically disadvantaged groups, such as women and rural inhabitants. The initial group consisted of 150 trainees, 100 of which were chosen in a short period of time with little quality control over the process. All long-term returnees in this 1985-86 class received preparatory and English as a Second Language (ESL) training at U.S. institutions.  After 1986, fewer trainees were selected, more care was taken in reviewing their applications, and all preparatory and ESL training was received in-country at the Panama Canal College (where training proved more effective than in the United States).  Selection achieved a balanced representation of the various provinces and a targeted balance of men and women trainees.  U.S. institutional support was excellent, and follow-on activities organized by the recent CAPS country coordinator significantly increased employment opportunities and leadership capacity among returnees. The development of returnees as ""change agents"" is linked to their success in gaining employment in their fields of study and in interacting with a variety of social institutions.  Training has resulted in a significant transition from low to high job status for returnees and a marked shift in the employment and income, particularly of long-term returnees.  Increased job status and income has been significant for both men and women. Significant impacts were noted in the family and workplace, including transfer of knowledge and assumption of leadership roles.  At the community level, returnees have had greater impact in rural settings and many have been very active in the political arena.  Since the CAPS project was a training project and not a development project, returnees cannot at present be expected to have major institutional impacts beyond some exceptional cases.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","LAC-0661-C-00-0046-00","","12/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Education for development|Participants|Scholarships|Change agents|Disadvantaged groups|Technology transfer|Women","Panama","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABL565.pdf","11,109 KB","012322 - Aguirre International","","000114 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to strengthen development planning in India. Mid-term evaluation covers the period 1988-9/94. The project has been extremely flexible and successful in spanning a period in which the relationship between the Government of India (GOI) and the USAID has improved and the GOI has embarked upon a series of far-reaching economic reforms.  It has funded 21 diverse activities, most of which were related to economic growth; there were also activities related to the environment, food policy and food relief, public administration, and scientific and educational exchanges.  These activities included policy analysis and research, TA, training seminars, dissemination conferences, and participant training.  Funding levels ranged from $9,000 to $3 million, and duration from 1 week to 6 years. Because of the broad range of activities and implementation methods the project's impact was difficult to evaluate.  Another factor impeding evaluation was the project design, which contained vague goals and objectives and which therefore did not lend itself to identification with any one USAID strategic component or implementation method. However, some trends have emerged.  High-impact activities have been those related to technical redirection leading to economic growth, while activities that tried to use the project as an implementation mechanism (possibly because they lacked an individual or technical office that had ownership of or interest in them from conception through implementation) have had a lower impact, as have small, short-term activities involving seminars and dissemination. Due in part to the GOI's economic liberalization policy and USAID/India's project portfolio, which now features an economic growth component through 2000, the project was redirected in 1991 toward the goal of promoting economic growth. However, it still needs to establish a strategy for achieving this goal, as well as specific technical objectives. Brief descriptions of the 20 grants funded so far under the project are included among the appendices.","Project title: Implementing policy change (IPC)","Special Evaluation","Documents","AEP-5451-I-08-2059-00|AEP-5451-I-00-2059-00","","10/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Development planning|Economic growth|Development strategies|Economic reform|Development project design|Impact assessment","India","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABL595.pdf","2,711 KB","006727 - Development Alternatives, Inc.

"Final report by Land O'Lakes (LOL) on a cooperative agreement (6/91-3/94) to provide training and TA to small producers and their cooperatives in order to increase the quality and quantity of their consumer products. LOL completed 15 new projects (vs. 6 targeted) and 19 new country assessments (vs. 7); it trained 1,772 people in-country (vs. 470) and 66 in the United States (vs. 41).  However, it completed only 21 of 30 targeted short-term consultancies and none of the 18 targeted regional workshops. LOL met its goals in the four targeted functional areas (organizational development, resource enhancement, limited program services, and program development), as well as in the Baltics' New Initiatives amendment, although the latter expended only about half of the $100,000 allocated. LOL's International Development Division grew from 8 staff in 8/91 to 50 employees and consultants worldwide, and it strengthened its linkages with other LOL units and member co-ops, many of which participated in training and TA activities in this project. In the area of resource enhancement, LOL conducted a butter monetization program under which 5,000 MT of donated butter were sold in Russia, with the profits used to purchase equipment for Russian agriculturalists.  LOL initiated joint programs with Texas A&M in Mexico and Development Alternatives in Morocco. Activities under the limited program services component included eight in-country workshops to support the development of dairy cooperatives; a dairy production and management techniques course and TA in Northern Mindanao, Philippines; training in dairy nutrition and alfalfa production in Mexico; and assistance to the dairy sectors of Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuania.  In Cameroon, the Tadu Dairy Cooperative Society (TDCS) was assisted by the project and over 1,500 men and women benefited from U.S. internships and in-country training.  The closing of the Mission in Cameroon ends funding for what has been a successful 5-year association with TDCS. In the area of program development, LOL explored projects in 19 new countries and funded projects in 9 (Cameroon, Estonia, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Lithuania, Morocco, Poland, Russia, and Ukraine).","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","PDC-0192-A-00-1045-00","","4/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural cooperatives|Agricultural enterprises|Small farms|Dairy farms|Farmer training|Agricultural training","Latvia|Estonia|Lithuania|Cameroon","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABL698.pdf","178 KB","005829 - Land O'Lakes, Inc.","","007746 - USAID.

"Evaluates efforts of the Office of Women in Development's GENESYS project to provide socioeconomic research, gender analysis, and training in support of the organizations implementing the Global Climate Change (GCC) Program in Brazil.  Mid-term evaluation covers the period 1991-94. Results are mixed.  GENESYS has played a key role in promoting participatory approaches to socioeconomic research.  Instead of hiring three social scientists to carry out socioeconomic analysis for the environmental NGOs involved in the GCC program, gender specialists (most of them not social scientists) were chosen from within the NGOs to conduct the research.  Thus the researchers required (and received) a great deal of TA, especially for surveys.  Gender analysis has been incorporated into various questionnaires.  Overall, however, data collection and analysis have not been systematic in terms of gender differences and participation by sex in productive activities. Little attention was paid to developing a consistent data collection process with a view to obtaining:  (1) a general baseline socioeconomic and gender desegregated data set; and (2) indicators for monitoring changes in socioeconomic and gender variables at the individual NGO level and other GCC program activities. Gender issues have not been vigorously incorporated into GCC activities, and the NGOs have institutionalized gender considerations in varying degrees; PESACRE has accomplished this task completely (though not wholly thanks to the project) and most NGOs are at least more aware of, and in some cases committed to, gender issues.  GENESYS lost an opportunity to advance gender analysis when it failed to seize the opportunity presented by the Araras Women's Group's request for assistance early in the GCC program. The planned special study on marketing has not been completed and the one on income generation has not even been begun. Nonetheless, GENESYS activities have enabled GCC collaborators and NGO staff to better understand the structure of markets for non-timber forest products (although the GENESYS marketing guidelines and manual have been of limited usefulness).  GENESYS' provision of marketing research methodology and TA have been very beneficial to two NGOs (PESACRE and CEPASP). Training in research methods, gender analysis, and marketing has been well-received; it has been most beneficial to those with little knowledge of the methods taught.  The training process also had the advantage of facilitating networking among the different Brazilian NGOs involved with the GCC Program.  Before GENESYS, the NGOs knew little about each other, or their respective roles in the program. Despite some problematic administrative areas (poor communication between USAID/B and WID, turnover of personnel among all parties, and the high costs of some activities), GENESYS has accomplished a great deal, considering that the staff have been working mostly on a part-time basis.  In general, the NGOs are very satisfied with the TA, feed-back, support, and administrative follow-up received, especially from the GENESYS Brazil office.","Project title: Gender in economics and social systems (GENESYS)","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-0100-Z-00-9044-00","","2/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Global warming|Environmental protection|Women in development|Private voluntary organizations|Indigenous private voluntary organizations|Gender analysis|Climate change","Brazil","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABL760.pdf","1,135 KB","001131 - The Futures Group International, Inc.

"Evaluates P.L. 480 Title II-supported food aid and natural resource management (NRM) activities implemented by NGOs in Ethiopia.  The evaluation is based on field visits to project sites and covers a period from program start-up in the mid-1980s through 10/94. NGO projects are making a difference, providing a beacon of hope for countless rural Ethiopians, who, in turn, are responding enthusiastically in a country-wide effort to rehabilitate the nation. However, NGO planning capabilities remain wholly inadequate for estimating both realistic food aid demand and the magnitude of land-use problems and opportunities.  Until NGOs improve in this area, they will find it difficult to justify continuing requests for USAID assistance. Tree-planting has generally been successful, but is not a panacea for Ethiopia's land use problems.  In areas of high population density, it can result in zero sum situations where displacement of livestock may exacerbate overgrazing and accelerate erosion elsewhere.  There are also the persistent problems of mismatching species to sites and choosing mixed plantations, both of which reduce the effectiveness of tree-planting.  Attention should be given to harvesting and marketing the products of tree plantations. Soil and water conservation efforts are too narrowly focused on structures for containing run-off and erosion and should be rethought to incorporate efforts to improve soil quality.  Food aid policies for these interventions (which are best carried out on a catchment basis) must be clarified to ensure that local people do not come to regard the interventions as either employment opportunities or the responsibility of third parties. Also, NGOs are not fully utilizing the full range of technical conservation interventions, and NGO activities are not of sufficient quality to guarantee even a short-term impact. In the area of agricultural development, the improvement of staple crop productivity is being largely overlooked. Diversification, though important, may have little impact, given average land holdings. Construction of earthen dams and similar small-scale irrigation works, by contrast, seem to be increasing productivity.  Unfortunately, professional expertise, which is rarely available at the NGO level, is needed if such works are to be effective.  Additionally, food aid should be replaced by efforts in micro-entrepreneurship to promote self-reliance.  Food aid programs are not adequately addressing livestock issues, especially overgrazing. Field staff seem overworked by the excessive number of projects and may lack the time needed to consider the qualitative dimensions of planning, participation, and impact assessment. Additionally, the NGOs do not have adequate opportunities to meet and exchange experiences about their essentially similar efforts. Consequently, lessons learned are being lost. Some of the lessons learned are as follows.  (1) Food aid promotes an intervention-oriented approach to rural development, particularly where it is used as Food for Work.  This may be counterproductive to finding a wider array of solutions to problems. (2) A number of projects have clearly reached the point where regular food aid can be suspended, although other forms of continued support should be considered.  (3) Program (though not food aid) dependency is an issue which the NGO community must confront, along with the need to de-link food aid as a form of direct payment for rural works.  (4) The logistics of food aid deliveries needs to be taken into account in project planning.  (5) Popular participation is a basic and early step towards defining project objectives during the planning process. Special attention should be given to training project personnel in participatory development mechanisms.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","10/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Natural resource management|Food aid programs|Private voluntary organizations|Indigenous private voluntary organizations|Rural development","Ethiopia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABL809.pdf","3,666 KB","006381 - Abt Associates, Inc.|001203 - U.S. Dept. of Agriculture.

"The recent performance of the Ugandan economy, led by agribusinesses producing non-traditional agricultural exports (NTAEs), has been impressive.  This study examines USAID's agribusiness support program, which has included the Rehabilitating Productive Enterprises (RPE) and Cooperative Agriculture and Agribusiness Support (CAAS) projects; the Agricultural Non-Traditional Export Promotion Program (ANEPP), and a P.L. 480 Monetization Program in support of CAAS. USAID has contributed significantly to the improved policy environment for agribusiness through policy conditionalities under ANEPP and the P.L. 480 programs, and by financing policy studies and dialogue. However, the program's success in strengthening institutions that are important for agribusiness growth has been mixed.  RPE failed to create an agricultural lending capability in the major commercial banks, CAAS failed to make cooperatives commercially viable, and ANEPP has not yet institutionalized policy analysis and development capabilities related to NTAEs.  USAID did provide critical support for establishment of the Uganda Investment Authority (UIA), a key institution in promoting private sector agribusiness investment, and has also played an important role in strengthening the Uganda Manufacturers Association (UMA), the country's largest and most effective private sector trade association (although UIA's sustainability is not assured). The study finds that in the 1980's USAID's agribusiness strategy lacked clear objectives and was based on an inadequate analysis of constraints.  In 1990, USAID increased the emphasis on NTAEs, identified constraints to agribusiness growth, redesigned its activities (including those supported by P.L. 480-generated local currency) to address those constraints, and provided more direct assistance to agribusiness.  Since then, the agribusiness program has made measurable progress in creating the conditions for export-led growth, although it is too early to measure the impact in terms of increased value-added, employment, and income. Uganda's experience shows that even after decades of conflict, mismanagement, and damage to physical and institutional infrastructure, 5 years period of political stability, accompanied by macroeconomic reforms and infrastructure rehabilitation, are enough to restore export-oriented agricultural growth and lay a foundation for agribusiness expansion.  However, inefficient institutions (ranging from research and financial institutions to cooperatives and public utilities) can be critical limiting factors.  In Uganda, political interference and corruption in some of these institutions compounded the problem. Among the lessons learned are:  (1) specific policies and regulations affecting agribusiness take just as much effort and capability, if not more, as putting sound macroeconomic policies in place; (2) effective policy dialogue with donors and with private agribusinesses, along with a strong policy analysis capacity, are essential to assure a coherent long-term policy framework; (3) once policy and infrastructural elements are in place, agribusiness growth can be accelerated through selective, time-limited direct assistance (e.g. by transferring knowledge about technologies and market information); (4) expert TA is vital, for in the case of high-value NTAEs, it is often not possible to predict in advance which commodities, enterprises, or aspects of operations will need assistance; (5) the local private sector and private sector associations should be involved in designing and implementing an agribusiness strategy; (6) if an agribusiness strategy in a low-income country like Uganda is to have significant impact on smallholders, attention must be paid to low-value NTAEs, such as maize and beans; (7) enhanced participation of women requires attention throughout the USAID program, including in education of women and girls; and (8) USAID/U has been strong on implementation monitoring, but weak on the monitoring and evaluation of impact or results.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","6/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Agribusiness|Economic impact|Impact assessment|Institutional aspects|Social impact|Private enterprises|Economic policy|Small farms|Nontraditional agricultural exports|Project sustainability|Cost benefit analysis|Development project design|Economic conditions|Development strategies|Agricultural cooperatives|Financial institutions|Government departments|Gender analysis","Uganda","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNABW847.pdf","1,059 KB","","","008058 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (12/90-6/94) to plan and implement two pilot national parks and to lay the foundation for a new National Parks and Protected Areas System in Jamaica (PARC project). All major targets were met or exceeded.  All staff are in place, local and overseas training have been completed, and both pilot parks -- the Blue and John Crow Mountain National Park and the Montego Bay Marine Park -- were established.  The parks have produced significant community benefits, institutional changes, and tangible products and have given the PARC project positive and high visibility.  Regulations with sanctions were put in place for both parks and the first successful prosecutions of violations have been completed.  Administrative responsibility for the Mountain Park has been moved from the Forestry Department to the Natural Resources Conservation Authority (NRCA). The project also funded a series of activities leading to the establishment of a National Parks and Protected Areas System. Specifically, a National Parks System Plan, a detailed plan of all current, proposed, and potential park sites in Jamaica, was formulated, and a National Parks Fund (currently at J$20M) was established to finance recurrent and capital costs associated with park management. The Conservation Data Center at the University of the West Indies has logged data on most of Jamaica's flora and fauna and has begun to sell information from its data base to local and international consultants. In addition, the Project Paper Supplement making Phase II a component of the DEMO project (5320173) is complete.  Phase II will involve consolidation of work on existing parks, establishment of two new parks (Cockpit Country and Black River Morass), further capitalization of the Trust Fund, establishment of a National Parks Institute, and continued data collection and monitoring.  The Nature Conservancy provided high-quality TA in all aspects of the project. Lessons learned include the following.  (1) Protected areas programs work best when they have clear goals or visions, and a subsequent educational program to build and sustain them.  (2) A long-term commitment is needed for biodiversity conservation programs that require creation and management of park systems. The project should have been designed for implementation over the longer period needed to create the legal, institutional, and financial basis for a park system and also to train and equip staff to assume full operation of a park system.  (3) Demarcation and operation are not the only things to consider when establishing parks.  Measures to address external threats, e.g., from pollution, should be put in place.  This requires going outside the framework of a park system to engage other sectors (urban, industrial, commercial, mining, agricultural) in the process of conservation.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","6/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Natural resource conservation|Protected environmental areas|Natural resource management|Aquatic resource management|Land management|Institution building","Jamaica","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABL899.pdf","409 KB","008563 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (9/84-9/94) to train Costa Rican business managers, owners, and technicians to manage and produce nontraditional exports (NTEs). Results exceeded expectations.  The project included four components: long-term academic preparation for university professors and financial sector analysts; short-term training and observational visits in the U.S. for company owners and business managers; U.S. technical training for plant supervisors and vocational instructors; and seminars and workshops in Costa Rica for technicians and mid-upper level managers. Of 28 students selected for long-term degrees, 27 graduated and returned to Costa Rica.  Over 1,000 participants took part in training activities and international fairs in the United States, which were deemed very successful in stimulating interest in nontraditional exports and providing guidance to companies making the move; the business sector covered 30% of these direct training costs.  The U.S. technical training program exceeded targets by providing 2-3 month U.S. training to 30 rather than 12 participants from the private sector.  Finally, the project provided in-country training by U.S. and Latin American professors and exporters to over 30,000 participants, in addition to establishing the physical infrastructure and human resources necessary to do so.  This last component was initially heavily subsidized by USAID, but from 1991-94 CINDE increased training fees to partially defray costs.  CINDE has developed the institutional capacity to investigate private sector training needs and provide the training activities on a competitive basis with other training institutions.  The project stimulated participation from all sizes of companies and all economic sectors.  It worked with more than 8,200 Costa Rican companies, and it appears that these companies continue to seek additional training with CINDE.  The project enjoyed a good reputation and the funds were spent almost in their entirety.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Export diversification|Nontraditional exports|Export promotion|Management training|Participants|Private sector","Costa Rica","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABL940.pdf","92 KB","008533 - USAID.

"PACR of a project component (4/87-1/94) to upgrade primary school facilities in rural Costa Rica. The project met or exceeded all of its goals.  A total of 817 subprojects (vs. a target of 800) were approved and provided financial support for the physical improvement of an equal number of rural schools.  All of these subprojects were completed, although two were only completed after the PACD due to the Government of Costa Rica's (GOCR) failure to contribute the promised construction materials on time.  Over 55,000 primary school children in the most needy rural Costa Rican communities have benefitted from the physical improvement of their schools. In-kind contributions from the recipient communities were at least equal to the project's donation, and, in some 75% of the cases, surpassed it. The main lesson learned is that the overall success of the subprojects depended mainly on the level of organization and management in the participating communities, which were at all times in charge of developing and managing the subprojects. Other lessons are as follows. (1) The poorer, smaller, and more remote the beneficiary community is, the greater the impact, since the community did not have access to other sources of support.  (2) The close partnership between the Mission's office in charge of the project and the Peace Corps, and especially the work done by the volunteers involved in the project, were key elements in ensuring its integrity and success.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Primary schools|School buildings|Building renovation|Rural development|Educational infrastructure|Rural areas|Beneficiary count","Costa Rica","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABL941.pdf","190 KB","008533 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (9/85-6/93) to implement a drug awareness and education program in Belize.  A key project objective was the development of PRIDE/Belize as an indigenous PVO independent of the project grantee, the Atlanta-based National Parents' Resource Institute for Drug Education (PRIDE). Overall, the project succeeded in meeting its objectives. PRIDE/Belize is now a fully functioning PVO which provides training and TA support in a variety of fields related to drug awareness and education.  It is a recognized leader in this field, serving as a catalyst for many drug demand reduction activities and initiatives in Belize.  Through its newsletters, literature reviews, media program, drug surveys, it keeps the public aware of the extent of the drug problem in Belize and knowledgeable about the dangers of drug use.  It is not, however, financially sustainable at this time. The planned output of increasing and subsequently maintaining awareness and knowledge of drug use among students and the general public was achieved.  However, behavioral changes have not necessarily resulted.  A 6/93 household survey revealed that drug use (specifically, of crack/cocaine) among Belizians in urban centers far surpasses the highest levels reported elsewhere in Latin America and Caribbean countries. The information dissemination output was substantially achieved. Efforts included three school drug surveys, national- and electoral district-level household/community awareness drug surveys, and a national mass media campaign.  However, provision of reliable and useful information on the extent of the drug problem in Belize has been hindered by the absence of an effective management information system. In addition, the mass media program lacked a clear social marketing thrust matching messages with specific consumers. Changes in values, attitudes, and policies can be measured through the project's effects on other bodies and organizations. Several private businesses, as well as the public service, are known to have instituted drug use related programs and policies during the last phase of the project.  PRIDE/Belize was the primary force in the establishment in 1990 of a National Drug Abuse Control Foundation having a legislative mandate for drug demand reduction.  Significant developments in rehabilitation (e.g., the creation of Addiction Alert), have paralleled PRIDE/Belize's focus on drug awareness and education.  Finally, PRIDE/Belize has successfully provided services, training, and dug education at all levels of the educational system and is now promoting establishment of a standard counseling/drug policy for use nationwide. Lessons learned include the following.  (1) The development challenge presented by drug abuse must be combated by an explicit and coordinated strategy implemented by public and private sector agencies with full support at the community level (schools, parents, peers, and media). (2) Community action is fundamental to effecting change in drug use prevalence and patterns among youth.  (3) An NGO in Belize or any other country whose primary mission is drug prevention is not likely to be financially sustainable without support from the communities it serves, donors, government, and other sources.  (4) It is essential that program planning and evaluation be based on reliable and accurate data/information on the extent of the drug problem.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Drug abuse education|Drug addiction|Institution building|Indigenous private voluntary organizations","Belize","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABL986.pdf","581 KB","008513 - USAID.

"Final external evaluation of a matching grant to the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) for a Wildlands and Human Needs program (9/88-6/94) to strengthen WWF's capacity to introduce a local economic development component into conservation projects. Since the grant was awarded, WWF's institutional strategy for conserving biological diversity has undergone a sea change -- moving from grant-making focused on threatened species to implementing and financing complex field projects, 42% of which are now designed to integrate conservation and development objectives.  The Wildlands and Human Needs program has shifted its organizational position in accordance with this change. While once it managed the ""cutting edge"" of WWF's integrated conservation and development projects (ICDPs), it is now primarily a TA unit, operating as part of the Social Science and Economics (SSE) program. As it has developed over the past 9 years, the Wildlands program has supported more than 30 different projects in 21 countries. It has had three different directors, and has organized its staff first geographically, then thematically.  This continuing change in substance and management has been a primary factor in limiting the program's ability to achieve its objectives, although many pieces of the menu have been achieved in different places. Now that WWF has succeeded in integrating development into its strategic portfolio has been achieved, it needs to develop program strategies focused on lessons learned.  To a large extent, the appropriate processes are in place.  In response to the mid-term evaluation, WWF has:  set up multidisciplinary working groups to support and oversee operational project management functions; hired an SSE manager who is primarily a manager, not juggling these responsibilities with TA to a portfolio of projects; located SSE in the Research and Development Division, where it has a unique opportunity to link conservation and social science; and begun to address monitoring and evaluation systematically.  Nonetheless, these steps do not entirely resolve concerns about the coherence of SSE's program. The conditions that have caused projects to wax and wane in resource availability, priority, and relevance will continue to prevail. SSE needs to balance its project-level approach to monitoring and evaluation by developing a research and monitoring agenda sufficient to evaluate impacts and test hypotheses at the program level.  Hiring a qualified social scientist and resource economist, and strengthening linkages with other science programs are recommended.  The first of these steps is already underway. In sum, the program has made significant progress over the last 2 years in defining a management structure for implementation of ICDPs. The recently established structure and procedures are capable of serving the technical needs of regionally managed projects while reserving time to analyze development issues, distill lessons, and assist regions in applying them.  WWF and USAID can use the 18-month interim funding not only to continue core activities, but also to test new structures and clarify what outputs are achievable in future funding periods. WWF felt that the Wildlands/SSE program had been more successful than given credit for in the mid-term evaluation, and to some extent in this evaluation.  It particularly disagreed with the criticism that the program lacked continuity, countering that there has been only one turnover in program directors in 5 years, and that different projects identified as core have all been linked by common themes.

"Evaluates grant to Rotary International's PolioPlus/India program to support the Government of India's Universal Immunization Program (GOI/UIP).  Mid-term evaluation covers the period 1992-6/94. Significant progress has been made toward eradicating polio in India. Polio incidence has decreased from an estimated 250,000 cases in 1981 to 15,000 in 1993, a reduction of 94%.  However, India still reports half the world's cases of polio, and is the major exporter of the disease. India has an ongoing, sustainable vaccine delivery system achieving, in most states, OPV3 coverage rates of 80%.  An estimated 20,000 Indian Rotarians and 1,000 of 16,000 Rotary Clubs participated in polio activities, primarily supporting GOI/UIP activities in urban slums. India is in the process of program transition from a disease coverage to a disease reduction program, but surveillance is weak and laboratory backup is limited.  In the Fall of 1994, New Delhi State will carry out ""vaccination days,"" an important programmatic step in the transition from a vaccination program to a disease eradication program.  A number of recommendations are provided.

"Final evaluation of a project (1981-93) to reduce cocoa production in the Upper Huallaga area of Peru by increasing and diversifying agricultural production. The project went through three phases with mixed results.  The first stage (1981-86) was unsuccessful due to extended violence in the region and the technical incompatibility between coca eradication and agricultural development.  Areas planted with coca in the region progressed from 12,000-17,000 ha in 1981 to 60,000 ha in 1986.  The second phase (1986-91) shifted emphasis from agricultural to community development services, recognizing that the poor living conditions and social exclusion were the most fertile grounds for narcotrafficking and subversive growth. This strategy proved to be highly successful in enhancing the presence of the Government of Peru (GOP) in the area and local community participation.  However, the project setting during this phase was the most adverse to original project goals; profit levels for cocoa and levels of violence were at their highest, and GOP activity at its lowest during this period.  By 1990, the area planted with coca was estimated at 70,000-90,000 ha in the project area.  The final stage of the project (1992-93) was characterized by the lowest profit levels for coca production, the general desire of the population to change to licit activities and look for new viable economic crops, the decline of violence against project personnel, the increase in the level of GOP activity, and a resulting shift in project objectives and activities. The new focus was on strengthening local government and community participation in the alternative development process, improving physical and social infrastructure, and promoting agricultural activities to replace illicit crops.  The new strategy was based on the improvement of local conditions both for private investment and for quality of life. The Democratic Community Development (DCD) phase, the focus of the present report, achieved strong local participation and involvement of the population in the decision and execution of small social infrastructure projects addressing basic needs.  The road rehabilitation and maintenance component yielded the project's key economic contribution by boosting agricultural production through reduced costs and travel time and integrating the Ponaza and Biabo areas.  Improved transportation also helped deter narcotrafficking and subversion. Expectations for investment in the region are high, although farmers are uncertain whether the favorable conditions will continue.  A current (as of 10/94) rise in coca prices is also pushing farmers to cultivate coca. In other areas:  the agro-industry plants promoted and built by the GOP-financed Proyecto Especial Alto Huallaga (PEAH) through loans to farmer groups or private societies did not achieve their goals due to technical problems and lack of markets.  Also, following the procedures of the DCD component, the Cuenca Integrated Development effort in the Ponaza Valley was limited to small social infrastructure and productive projects. It is recommended that the follow-on Counternarcotics Sustainable Development (CSD) include:  the DCD component, the primary and secondary roads component, a marketing and agro-industry component, the Cuenca integrated development component, and a training component.  It is also recommended that the GOP take action to keep coca prices low.","Spanish ed.: PD-ABQ-395","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","12/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Crop substitution|Agricultural productivity|Production increases|Crop diversification|Crop eradication programs|Coca|Crop production|Community self help","Peru","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABM323.pdf","1,793 KB","009188 - Agrarian Action","","008591 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (5/92-8/94) to establish an INTERNET Backbone within Costa Rica to link the scientific and technological communities in Costa Rica and other countries in Central America to their counterparts around the world.  The project was implemented by the University of Costa Rica (UCR) in collaboration with the University of Wisconsin-Madison (UW). The project accomplished its main targets and in some cases surpassed expected goals.  A 64 Kbps satellite INTERNET link (3 times faster than that planned) was put in operation in 1/93 and then doubled to 128 Kbps early in 1995.  The first 12 institutions, including the Legislative Assembly, that were directly connected to the Internet under this project, created the National Research Network (CRNet), which is responsible for administering INTERNET services in both the academic and research sectors of Costa Rica.  In all, 750 computer nodes were directly interconnected to the INTERNET at participating CRNet institutions, which now number 1,500 and cover all sectors.  Particular efforts were made to work closely with the computer center heads at the CRNet member institutions on INTERNET technologies so that additional users at those institutions would be trained in turn.  The CRNet organization model, established at the beginning of the project, is highly decentralized and distributed in physical and logical design, as well as in administrative and information aspects. Communication costs are now completely covered by local participating institutions.  Regarding regional expansion, Nicaragua was connected to the INTERNET in 2/94 through CRNet, using a terrestrial microwave analog link between the two countries.  A few months later, Panama was linked to CRNet, thereby connecting its major universities to the Internet. The total number of users is now estimated at 15,000. Local technicians at UCR have turned themselves into real experts. As it happened, the visit of the UW experts was postponed, so the local technicians, urged to solve the problems that normally arise in this kind of project, used the same Internet as a powerful instrument to receive advice from the UW counterparts.  As a result, the visit of the UW experts never took place. The project is of major importance to Costa Rica's technological development; large-scale, state-of-the-art Internet work technologies have been introduced for the first time in Costa Rica and neighboring countries, and have spread to universities, research centers, corporations, and government.  This is crucial for the competitiveness of Costa Rica and the Central American region, as lack of access to worldwide information would keep it at a disadvantage in an era of increasing globalization.","Cover title: Project assistance completion report : background data","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Information networking|Information technology|Computer technology|Communications technology|Networks|Computer networks|Internet","Costa Rica|Nicaragua|Panama","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABM461.pdf","116 KB","008046 - USAID.

"Evaluates the impact and effectiveness of P.L. 480 Title II support provided through CARE to the Government of India's (GOI) Integrated Child Development Service (ICDS) Scheme, one of the largest child survival programs in the world.  CARE began supporting the ICDS in 1984 and as of 1994 provided supplementary food at 141,101 anganwadi child care centers (AWCs). ICDS is a visionary program with substantial potential impact on the health and nutrition of the vulnerable poor, yet much remains to be done even though the GOI is committed to improving the ICDS and devotes considerable resources to it.  The ICDS is not effectively focused enough on groups with the most dramatic opportunities for impact -- children under age 3 and pregnant/lactating women.  Also, ICDS focuses more on rehabilitating severely malnourished children than on preventing growth faltering -- and yet the resources available have limited potential to rehabilitate the most malnourished children. Available data and analyses show a modest positive nutritional impact for ICDS overall and little difference in nutritional impacts between CARE and non-CARE ICDS, except in children aged 0-3, who appear less malnourished in CARE areas. Full access to the National Institute of Public Cooperation and Child Development's data base and in-depth analyses (multi-variate regression, etc.) may reveal more dramatic and positive impacts.  No significant differences were found between CARE and non-CARE areas in growth monitoring and case management, but CARE has a greater differential impact (compared with non-CARE ICDS) in poorer states like Bihar and Orissa.  Also, immunization coverage is higher in CARE than non-CARE ICDS areas, but is still well below national targets. Knowledge and skills of anganwadi workers in areas where CARE implements value-added programs (CARE-Plus) are far better (especially in areas with continuing health education) than in areas with food only (CARE-Regular) or non-CARE ICDS areas.  Certain value-added CARE interventions -- continuing health education, acute respiratory infections, and bio-intensive gardens -- show a greater potential for enhanced health and nutritional impact than do CARE's ""food only"" activities. Several factors constrain the effectiveness of the ICDS program and will continue to do so over the medium- to long-term unless  specific actions are taken by the GOI and its development partners (PVOs, including CARE, and donors): (1) community participation in AWC activities is low; (2) better intersectoral coordination is needed; (3) water and sanitation are universally inadequate in ICDS areas, and no priority is placed on investing in the necessary physical infrastructure or educational initiatives; (4) resources are limited, and the current lack of targeting and need-based resource allocation dilutes the impact of those limited resources; (5) CARE's resources are not focused on areas of greatest need -- GOI and CARE must work to shift resources to neediest states and phase down in more prosperous areas.  Also, some states (e.g., Bihar) are experiencing distinct implementation problems. The GOI and State Governments should commit to ensuring full functioning of ICDS, with specific attention to resolving bottlenecks in transport and guaranteeing hiring and payment of workers. Numerous recommendations are addressed to CARE, USAID, and the GOI.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-0704-C-00-1043-00","","9/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Child survival activities|Infant nutrition|Child nutrition|Maternal nutrition|Food for Peace Title II|Domestic government programs|Beneficiary targeting|Resource allocation|Private voluntary organizations","India","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABM483.pdf","4,369 KB","009249 - Innovative Resource Partners|008414 - Mendez England and Associates","","008415 - USAID.

"Evaluates the women's literacy components of nine projects implemented in Nepal between 1979 and 1994.  The projects (most were subprojects under the PVO Co-financing Umbrella) were in women's development, health and family planning, agriculture and natural resources management, and direct literacy programming.  Between 1991-94, the projects have provided literacy training to 30,477 Nepalis through 1,239 centers.  They have also trained 380 literacy trainers and 804 literacy facilitators. In four of the projects, the implementing PVOs -- World Education, Inc. (WEI), Private Agencies Acting Together (PACT), United Mission to Nepal (UMN), and Save The Children Federation (SCF) -- maintain in-house literacy education capabilities.  WEI has demonstrated strengths in literacy education policy, curriculum and materials development, and training; its Nayo Goreto curriculum and materials are still the national standard and are used by other USAID-sponsored literacy projects.  WEI also plays a valued advisory role in the new National Council for Nonformal Education, and its policy studies have increased the knowledge base on literacy education in Nepal. PACT has demonstrated strength in developing and delivering curricula and materials for training literacy trainers and facilitators.  PACT classes appear effective and are deemed valuable by students.  PACT's policy advisory role is based less on institutional linkages and more on recognition of its expertise and experience in literacy in Nepal. UMN also maintains in-house capability for materials development and training, with a focus on supporting local groups implementing literacy education.  UMN is somewhat unique, as it claims to use literacy exclusively as a tool for other community development objectives, yet devotes significant resources and expertise to literacy, to such degree that it has the stature of a primary development objective. SCF has a multisectoral development agenda which includes a strong community-focused delivery system for literacy education.  The home office has a nonformal education (NFE) section responsible for developing literacy materials, coordinating with donor agencies and Government of Nepal offices, training of supervisors and facilitators, and delivery of teaching materials.  The strength of its literacy program lies partly in its supervision system, from the home to the field offices.  SCF field offices also contain NFE sections. Four off the five remaining projects use literacy explicitly to facilitate community development objectives, and rely on outside expertise to train literacy supervisors and facilitators.  Of the implementing organizations, the Institute for Integrated Development Studies (IIDS) seems strongest in delivering literacy.  CARE, the Center for Development and Population Activities (CEDPA), and the Ministry of Local Development's Women Development Offices (WDOs) in the Rapti Zone include community mobilization and functional linkages for literacy as important components, yet do not seem to emphasize literacy activities as strongly as do the SCF and IIDS programs. The functional literacy components of the two health projects, HEAL and CEDPA, raised participants' awareness and knowledge of health practices, but found that participants' ability to act on their new knowledge is limited by economic circumstances; HEAL participants, for example, are reported to know the importance of using soap, but are unable to afford it.  This is not intended as criticism of these projects, but as indicators of their priorities.  Only if their focus were more exclusively on literacy would their in-house literacy capabilities seem to need strengthening. Overall conclusions are as follows.  (1) Literacy programs are more effective when coupled with post-literacy activities.  (2) Other development activities, in communities with low literacy levels, are more effective when coupled with literacy programs and groups.  (3) Literate individuals and groups, especially those who have successfully completed a Naya Goreto adult literacy education class, are better able and more likely to undertake initiatives to improve their social, economic, and political circumstances.  (4) The programs which appear most successful in delivering community literacy programs also exhibit strong facilitators and supervisory systems.  (5) Literacy programs are cost-effective, when compared with 3 years of formal  schooling, by a 4:1 ratio.

"Evaluates the P.L. 480 Section 108 auction program in Jamaica for the period FY 1985 to FY 1990.  Under the program, USAID auctions Section 108 funds to private intermediary financial institutions (IFIs) for onlending to productive private enterprises. To date, USAID has held eight auctions, which will result in total lending over 5 years of J$357 million to qualified IFIs.  Reflows of principal and interest to date amount to J$263 million, of which part has already been auctioned. J$136 million is available for future auctions. To have a developmental impact on the country, a subloan project must have the potential to do one or more of the following: create employment; earn foreign exchange or save foreign exchange; bring new technology or processes to the country; bring new entrepreneurs into the sector; and contribute to implementation of sectoral or macroeconomic policy objectives. In Jamaica's case, all outstanding subloans have at least one of these characteristics; most have two or more.  More funds are now flowing to the agricultural sector than in 1991.  The bulk of current subloans are in the construction sector (housing and office buildings), whereas tourism received most of the funds in 1991. IFIs are passing along the advantages of the long-term fixed rate Section 108 funds much less than in 1991.  A considerable number of the ""first-tier"" subloans are now revolving credits rather than term loans, and, with the exception of one subloan, interest rates are variable and quite high.  This is due to the Bank of Jamaica's tight monetary policies, which have pushed average lending rates to over 60%.  Because Jamaica currently has an inverse yield curve, IFIs are treating Section 108 long-term funds as they treat short-term funding sources. When interest rates fall, they will repay the loans which carry rates above their marginal cost of funds. USAID has held seven auctions for ""first tier"" IFIs, with a total of J$359.94 million auctioned, of which J$55 million was repaid early. Several trends have emerged from these auctions.  (1) The amount of Jamaican dollar funds has increased steadily, due to the steady depreciation of the Jamaican dollar vis-a-vis the U.S. dollar.  The U.S. dollar equivalent remained at around US$25-29 million except in the eighth auction, when the amount demanded dropped sharply.  (2) The spread in interest rates at the auctions has increased sharply, reflecting the differing marginal costs of funds between institutions. (3) The newer, smaller and more aggressive banks are willing to bid higher rates of interest and thus win all the funds.  One banking group alone holds 68% of outstanding Section 108 loans. The sixth auction to ""second tier"" institutions was intended to expand Section 108 subloans to the agricultural and rural sectors and pass on the advantages of the long-term fixed interest rate money to the end borrowers.  Development banks in Jamaica are the only institutions that typically will make long-term fixed rate loans, and even they are moving to variable rates due to Jamaica's volatile interest rates.  In general, the ""second tier"" auction was successful in fulfilling these objectives.  Only J$3 million was auctioned because USAID wished to test the ""second tier"" institutions' absorptive capacity.  One institution, Trafalgar Development Bank (TDB), captured J$2.3 million.  National Development Foundation won the rest. Several issues arose from this auction.  (1) The ""second tier"" group includes fairly disparate institutions.  TDB is by far the largest, and other institutions felt it dominated the auction.  Credit unions themselves vary greatly in size and financial strength.  The question is whether USAID should divide these institutions still further in future auctions.  Because the Section 108 guidelines stress administrative simplicity, this is not advisable.  (2) The borrower risk of ""second tier"" institutions is greater.  Many credit unions and cooperative banks are financially weak.  USAID should make certain that auction participants are well-vetted for financial viability. (3) In lending to small business, it is often advisable to lend on shorter terms to minimize default rates, but Section 108 objectives favor longer term lending.  Thus, some program contradictions may arise. For the immediate future, the two competing uses for reflows are relending to IFIs and payment of U.S. obligations. Because the auction program has been successful in meeting program objectives, USAID should continue auctions for the foreseeable future.

"Evaluates project to improve El Salvador's basic (K-6) educational system (SABE project).  Mid-term evaluation covers the period 7/91-11/94. The project has been through rough times, but is now on track. Start-up was very difficult due to social upheaval caused by the civil war, and the constant turnover of long-term contractor personnel, which sapped the project's vitality and forced USAID/ES to manage the project forcefully and make decisions directly with the Ministry of Education (MOE), causing tensions among all three parties.  Fortunately, the USAID/ES Education Office was up to the task, and with the MOE, guided the project through very demanding times.  The contractor has now hired an extremely well-qualified Project Director, and the originally intended shared leadership among the MOE, the contractor, and USAID has slowly but fully been restored. The damage caused by the turnover in long-term advisors was most strongly felt in three areas:  problems with commodity distribution; uncertain implementation of Component IV (educational development in the ex-conflictive zones); and the decreased learning capacity of the contractor, who had to rely inordinately on short-term advisors. Component IV was created by Amendment 2 to facilitate the peace agreement, yet little progress was made in implementation -- some think this is due to political issues between ARENA, the governing party, and FLMN, the national liberation front; others say the Amendment's translation into Spanish was ambiguous; still others feel that USAID could have interpreted Amendment 2 more flexibly.  However, no matter what the cause of the delay, implementation seemed to be picking up as of June 1994. The project has now overcome most of its early problems and is creating a significant and visible impact on El Salvador.  Teacher training, curriculum development, educational testing, and the writing, printing, and distribution of texts are at once impressive as well as on target with logframe objectives. There are still problems, but the MOE, the contractor, and USAID are working more cooperatively than ever to confront and resolve them. The commodity distribution system is a serious problem. Recommendations are to keep commodities in a central warehouse where they can be carefully controlled by a system. The most important lesson learned concerns the selection and recruitment of long-term personnel who are appropriate and well suited for the task.  However, it is not clear what type of due diligence on background checks is sufficient and legal with respect to the federal law that guides this process.  Secondly, starting too big too fast is a concern for the future when infrastructural development outpaces stable project leadership.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","519-0357-C-00-4098-00","","11/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Basic education|Primary education|Public education|Contractors|Labor turnover","El Salvador","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABM868.pdf","8,130 KB","007414 - Management Business Associates","","008540 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to use NGOs to   expand community-based maternal health and child survival (MH/CS) services to rural areas of El Salvador where such services have been weak or nonexistent due to the impact of armed conflict and/or geographic isolation (PROSAMI project).  Mid-term evaluation covers the period 7/90-11/94.  The project is being implemented by Medical Service Corporation International (MSCI). PROSAMI is successfully fulfilling its objective of organizing a network of NGOs to provide a uniform system of MH/CS services.  The system appears to be very effective in reducing morbidity and mortality in rural communities and provides a model for other areas.  With appropriate training and supervision, community personnel with little formal education can successfully provide fairly complex primary health care services.  Also, a community-based health delivery system consisting of a basal census, active case detection, simplified case management, immediate referrals of high risk patients, and health education and counseling, can effectively reduce morbidity and mortality rates. With regard to the planning systems for technical and financial control, the project has developed very detailed innovative and appropriate reporting, monitoring, and feedback systems to move information around the communities, the NGOs, and the central staff of PROSAMI.  These systems are important for expressing how management wants organizations to work and for making important changes.  The overall system has led to organizational clarity and control by independent NGOs, as opposed to central control by advisors. The total cost of the PROSAMI health care promoter program is comparatively high in absolute terms, particularly when home and field office costs are added to NGOs' costs. However, the promoter cost per attention provided is competitive when compared to the Ministry of Health (MOH) or other organizations.  Cost recovery from monies provided from other NGO activities has considerably more potential than patient fee money.  The cost recovery from client based fees and the management of these funds is just at the ""launch"" stage.  So far, the percentage of patients who pay is very low. The presence of a central supervisory, training, and normative organization is essential for the continued success of the PROSAMI network and system.  It is therefore recommended that the umbrella NGO CONSALUD be developed and given the financial and technical support needed to assume these functions. Lessons learned are as follows.  (1) Because participating NGOs differ widely in management styles and capabilities, it is important for sustainability purposes that the project provide a flexible system of good administration, planning, and finance be provided, and permit the NGOs to adapt these systems to their own organization and management styles as they see fit.  (2) PROSAMI has demonstrated that a relatively diverse group of indigenous NGOs can be successfully organized into a coherent and collaborative network to effectively provide specific technical services (e.g., MH/CS services).  It has also shown that community personnel with relatively little formal education can successfully deliver a relatively complex package of primary health care services when they receive adequate basic training, with complementary, regular supervision and continuing education. (3) Primary preventive services (education, promotion, and protective measures to prevent health problems) are more effective if associated with and delivered as complements to secondary preventive services (diagnosis and treatment of existing health problems).  (4) Many participating NGOs have highly sophisticated and creative ways of generating funds that help to pay the administrative costs of other programs that need subsidies.  They are good examples of how to set up small business enterprises, small factories, training programs, consulting assistance, agriculture ventures, and similar enterprises.  PROSAMI and the associated NGOs have implemented a number of advanced systems in accounting, inventory, payroll, accounts receivables, and purchasing.  These systems could be compared and then combined into one system that utilizes the best of each individual program.

"Evaluates OPG to the Salvadoran Demographic Association (SDA) to expand family planning and maternal/child health (FP/MCH) services for high-risk populations in rural and marginal urban areas in El Salvador. Interim evaluation covers the period 7/90-10/21/94. The SDA is working effectively to reach its rural health goals.  The service delivery component has met most of its goals in terms of numbers of Rural Health Promoters (PHPs) and Rural Contraceptive Distributors (DARs) recruited and trained, and villages covered.  However, service quality needs to be improved and the program sometimes duplicates efforts of the Ministry of Health (MSPAS) and other NGOs.  IEC materials are generally very good and the video products are excellent; materials exist for illiterate people.  What is lacking is a mass media campaign. Integrating efforts could increase. The number of users of all four types of SDA's services (regional, satellite, marketplace, and physician-referral), has increased, although increases in FP services are lower than in other specialties.  The trend corresponds to SDA's expansion of services and goal of financial sustainability.  The SDA deserves praise for developing a full complement of MCH services.  Hiring physicians to provide health and FP services in marketplace clinics is one of SDA's many laudable schemes. However, the current organization of satellite and marketplace clinics leads to inefficiencies because the clinics revolve around medical services provided only 2-20 hours/week; it is recommended to expand the nurse's role and allow them to insert IUDs and provide MCH services. Sterilizations have not increased.  The trend toward other methods should be encouraged, provided all needed equipment and supplies are available at all times.  Since sufficient Noristeret and IUD supplies are not on hand, SDA should be more aggressive in promoting Norplant and should make it available throughout the country. The institutional development component has a mixed record.  The Social Marketing and Resource Department, created in 2/93, has been hindered by lack of personnel and of top-level SDA commitment. Significant funding has been allocated to building infrastructure, but staff development has been neglected. Sustainability requires a variety of techniques; the project should consider establishing an endowment fund, as recommended in 2/93. No progress has been made under the policy development and research component.  Neither USAID nor the TA contractor is viewed as a partner by SDA, although relations have improved over the life of the project. National policy development has not been led by SDA; future funding should require explicit involvement with MSPAS.  Also, the research division needs to be strengthened. The following are lessons learned.   (1) Without frequent and careful reflection, any institution can get administratively top-heavy and lose sight of its direction and goals.  (2) To increase financial sustainability in recipient organizations, USAID must increase its presence as a partner rather than a distant donor.  Flexibility in allowing tangible as well as personnel resources to be used for non-project activities would enhance this goal.  (3) The cooperative agreement could stipulate the recipient's responsibility to maintain a good and productive working relationship.  (4) Because FP is not self-sustainable, USAID has encouraged expansion of services in order to attain financial sustainability.  However, this has led to a decrease in emphasis on FP.  Changing reimbursement could balance this trend.  (5) Even highly skilled individuals do not follow through and apply what they have learned without supervision and monitoring.  (6) Just because pamphlets have pictures and no words does not mean that they will be accepted by illiterate people.  Cultural norms and values may make them reject graphic drawings of private body parts.","Delivery order no. 17","Special Evaluation","Documents","AEP-0085-I-00-3002-00","","10/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Family planning promotion programs|Maternal child health care|Poor|Rural areas|Indigenous private voluntary organizations|Institution building|Family planning education|Family planning services|Clinics","El Salvador","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABM872.pdf","10,208 KB","000436 - Development Associates, Inc.","","008540 - USAID.

"Evaluates three P.L. 480 Title II programs implemented by TechnoServe/Ghana: (1) Farmer Service Cooperatives, which includes an inventory credit program to reduce postharvest losses and secure higher market prices; (2) Intermediate Technology Small-Scale Palm Oil Mills, to establish 60 community-based palm oil mills; and (3) nontraditional export development.  Impact evaluation covers the period 1992-10/94. TechnoServe/Ghana's overall program of rural, community-based, agricultural enterprise development has contributed significantly to enhancing the food security of local beneficiaries -- men and women alike -- at the household level, and has also had a positive economic impact at the community, regional, and national levels.  The contribution of the Farmer Service Cooperatives program to household food security includes both increased availability of food for farmers and their families and increased access to food (particularly during the lean or ""hungry"" season) via the increased income earned through the inventory credit program.  The cooperatives also contribute to better utilization of Ghana's food resources by assisting farmers with postharvest storage and marketing. Particularly impressive is the impact of the inventory credit program on farmers in Ghana's Upper West Region, located in the southern Sahel, which has only one crop season per year and is among Ghana's most food-insecure regions.  Farmers assisted by TechnoServe have much greater food security than do non-participating farmers, and they have also experienced significant income increases as a result of the program. TechnoServe/Ghana's other programs are located in the central and southern sections of the country, where food insecurity occurs through variability in rainfall patterns and the resultant periodic crop failures.  The impact on food security of TechnoServe's assistance comes mainly through increased household incomes, which enable farm families to purchase food during the lean season. The palm oil mill program has improved local processing of palm fruit and has introduced handy 20-liter containers which greatly facilitate storage and transport of palm oil.  These contributions have been particularly beneficial to rural women.    Moreover, a cost-effectiveness analysis of the program -- using very conservative projections for processing volumes and sales revenue -- reveals that it will provide approximately $10 in economic benefits for $1 of direct TA costs. The anticipated introduction of a palm oil inventory credit program in 1994/95 will likely further increase farmer/processor incomes. While the non-traditional export program only began in 7/93, it is apparent that participants will achieve enhanced food security, as cashews, one of the main crops targeted, are harvested and sold during the lean season, providing cash income to the farmers at the time of greatest need.  With its focus on demonstrating the economic value of tree crops, this program also has potential for significant environmental impact. The evaluation team recommends that USAID approve TechnoServe's FY 1995-1997 Multi-Year Operating Plan and expand the Upper West Farmer Service Cooperatives program.

"This assessment focuses on soil and water conservation efforts supported by USAID/Nepal's major natural resource management projects: Resource Conservation and Utilization; Rapti Integrated Rural Development; Nepal Resource Management; and PVO Co-Financing.  The assessment identifies the program-level changes introduced by USAID to improve  land productivity conservation,' a concept which implies a linkage between cropland conservation and agricultural intensification. In Nepal, this linkage incorporates erosion control, soil moisture conservation techniques, agroforestry, and intensive use of organic fertilizers in order to support production increases and diversification into commercial agriculture.  The report includes findings on the effectiveness, economic efficiency, sustainability, and replicability of USAID's efforts; it identifies both broad lessons learned and outstanding issues of relevance to USAID's overall program of support to sustainable agriculture. Lessons learned are as follows. (1) Cropland conservation initiatives implemented through local organizations are more efficient and sustainable than top-down approaches.  (2) Development programs must avoid exceeding local organizational and management capacity.  (3) Activities targeting women and disadvantaged groups do have an impact and are sustainable.  (4) Natural resource conservation, in the long run, requires less effort than does rehabilitation of degraded landscapes.  (5) Soil and water conservation efforts should target small subwatersheds. (6) Farmers are willing to conduct soil and water conservation practices if they can use the improved agricultural land for new economic enterprises.  (7) Natural resource conservation efforts require a long term commitment in order to achieve lasting results. Farmers began to have genuine interest in land conservation practices only after 6 years of project involvement. The assessment identified four outstanding issues: (1) Can community development be driven by the sale of natural resources from public lands? (2) While organic matter from public forests contributes to soil fertility on private farmlands, it is not yet clear what level of fodder and forest litter can be sustainably transferred from forest to fields. (3) Food self-sufficiency may not be a realistic goal in some resource-poor farming regions.  (4) Decentralization policies and new forms of local administration leave open the questions of conflict resolution.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","3/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Sustainable agriculture|Natural resource management|Intensive farming|Agricultural diversification|Soil conservation|Water conservation|Agricultural land|Watersheds|Land management|Agricultural productivity|Agricultural water management|Development strategies","Nepal","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNABY625.pdf","1,384 KB","008058 - USAID.

"Evaluates the impact of a project component to provide quick-impact, low-cost assistance aimed at improving industrial energy efficiency in Eastern and Central Europe. Evaluation covers the period 11/90-6/94 and is based on site visits to activities of the International Resources Group (IRG) in Bulgaria, Resource Management Associates of Madison (RMA) in the Czech Republic and Romania, and RCG/Hagler, Bailly in Hungary. The project component has been extremely successful in producing high individual rates of return and a solid receptivity to energy efficiency measures.  Although originally authorized and implemented with a short-term focus, the project has also had a long-term impact, as can be seen in the follow-up activities being implemented. The component quickly identified and implemented near-term, no-cost, or low-cost measures that improved, significantly in some cases, plant energy efficiency.  Energy audits and recommendations produced positive benefits; some remarkable savings were had for little or no cost. Plants where process modifications were made showed particularly large savings for essentially no cost.  For example, the Pannonglas Oroshazi Uveggyar glass plant in Hungary consolidated production from four to three lines, reducing annual gas costs by $2 million.  In addition, the installation of energy efficiency equipment in the four countries showed very short paybacks (e.g., a couple of months).  Attempts to save energy with building heating modifications and lighting improvements yielded longer payback periods, but did improve worker comfort, which may, in turn, increase productivity.  U.S. monitoring and measuring equipment was introduced into the region, with several U.S. manufacturers initiating or increasing sales in the region.  Without the project, the risk and expense of market penetration would have been too great.  Plant staff quickly absorbed the technical aspects of energy efficiency measures but will need additional TA to assimilate the economic analysis associated with energy efficiency measures. The component also increased energy awareness in host countries.  The interaction among the audit team, plant personnel, and local subcontractors focused attention on energy costs.  Besides leading factories to purchase energy savings equipment, improved knowledge of energy costs enabled some plants to save money by renegotiating their gas and electricity contracts or shifting demand to lower rate periods. The presence of USAID and western contractors also enabled lower-level energy managers to obtain upper management attention for energy efficiency projects that would otherwise have been neglected. However, energy efficiency has not become a top priority in most plants; managers are preoccupied with survival and retain the old central planning idea that the only path to it is increased production.  Information on energy efficiency is still not widely available, though some private firms have started offering energy efficiency seminars.  Energy efficiency service capability is limited, although a strong technical base for it exists, and host country governments appear open to privatization of energy efficiency services. Most of the equipment supplied by USAID was well-accepted, correctly utilized, and yielded measurable savings. There were a few problems in commissioning equipment and obtaining service and spare parts; local consultants were used to implement these tasks since there were no funds to support U.S. consultants.  The portable energy efficiency equipment left behind by the project for diagnostic use by local entities has not been used as intensively as planned, with efforts succeeding best in Hungary.  Plant personnel were very appreciative of the TA and energy efficiency equipment provided them, and felt it multiplied the project's impact.  Some equipment was used to improve quality as well as save fuel.  In one case, infrared thermometers were used to determine the temperature of metal pieces about to be welded or rolled and to reduce overheating in electric furnaces. The following lessons were learned.  (1) The prospect of privatization has created barriers to the exchange of information among plant owners and operators; some technical data formerly exchanged now is treated as proprietary information. (2) Low-cost/no-cost energy efficiency measures can be put in place quickly and can yield significant savings when introduced in a well-planned program directed by professionals.  (3) Success in extending energy efficiency measures is a function of the receptivity and strength of plant management, the savings obtained from the initial measures, the economic situation of the firm, and the degree of market competition.  (4) Provision of equipment stimulates the interest of program participants and multiplies project impact.  Portable monitoring and measuring equipment is particularly effective since it can be used in many plants.  (5) Programs that provide equipment must also establish an in-country equipment servicing capability to assure host country satisfaction and protect the reputation of U.S. equipment.  (6) Effective dissemination and diffusion of project results requires a well-directed effort, including sufficient funding and personnel to continue the effort over a significant time period.  Increased emphasis on record keeping should be part of future programs.  (7) USAID's efforts to introduce private sector energy efficiency capacity are a welcome complement to government-oriented programs and will help to support the movement to privatization in the region.  However, full acceptance and implementation will take time.

"Evaluates four grants to support democracy in Central Europe by strengthening municipal governments.  The grantees are the University of South Carolina (Bulgaria) and Rutgers University, International City Managers Association (ICMA), and Milwaukee County (Poland).  Interim evaluation covers the period 1991-94. Local governments in Poland and Bulgaria have been strengthened by the grantees' activities.  While progress toward complete decentralization is quite slow, examples of new-found strength and capacity in local governments can be found in each country (e.g., adoption of competitive bidding procedures). While the degree of strengthening has varied widely, the overall effect, considering the modest funding, staffing, and time involved, has been both positive and impressive.  The lack of support from central government agencies during much of the project period in Poland and nearly all of the time in Bulgaria was a major limiting factor for most activities.  Rutgers' program was the most effective, mainly because of the presence and growing capability of the indigenous Foundation in Support of Local Democracy (FSLD). The grants represent a range of approaches to meeting the training and TA needs of local government, including formal training programs, training of trainers, short-term advisors, assistance to municipal associations, and personnel exchanges and visits.  Each approach has potential merit, but the overall impact varies with at least four factors in addition to the competency of the provider:  receptiveness of the recipient; capability of the recipient; availability of a competent indigenous partner; and the national political environment.  In addition, there is a ""point in time"" dimension to each form of assistance.  Formal training in discrete aspects of local government administration is more effective after the local governments have been in place for 2 or more years.  Similarly, the training-of-trainers program was significantly enhanced by placement in the heart of a successful indigenous organization, which could only exist in a relatively stable political environment. Short-term TA is very useful for newly elected officials within newly created municipal governments.  Early assistance to municipal associations should include training on the most basic issues of democratic interest group politics, whereas later assistance can focus on the administrative and communications issues critical to transition and maturation of an advocacy organization.  Personnel exchanges in the early stages of transition appear to expand the horizons of public officials in newly democratic environments, while at a later stage, content-driven (rather than exposure-driven) internships are more likely to prove effective. All types of assistance provided in these projects were effective under some circumstances.  The one with the greatest potential for cost-effective impact, however, is intensive training of local officials where counterpart indigenous organizations are in place, as they are in Poland but are not as yet in Bulgaria.  The next most cost-effective approach is having U.S. local-government experts give onsite advice and assistance for substantial periods of time.  Aid to municipal associations is warranted especially where the national government is unsupportive of local government.  Exchange programs, while potentially valuable for selected individuals, tend to be costly on a per unit basis and quite variable in impact.  Future assistance in Poland should focus on further strengthening the extensive training and consulting base already present in FSLD and its nationwide system of training centers and schools.  In Bulgaria, where the need is greater and there are apparently no strong counterparts or cooperative central agencies, an ongoing program of training and technical assistance is advised.  In both countries, efforts should be made to enlist central government institutions in the decentralization and strengthening process, despite the poor political prospects for this initiative at present.

"Economic Innovation International (EII) has been working under a Department of Labor (DOL) contract with SEED Act funding since mid-1992 to assist six Polish and five Slovak communities in developing local leadership organizations capable of preparing comprehensive strategies to stimulate regional economic growth and create measurable wealth and jobs.  While EII intends to ""institutionalize"" these regional development agencies (RDAs) and the financial mechanisms that will make them independent and self-sustaining, it has not yet offered more than a replication of experience Poland has already had with its indigenous, non-project RDAS. USAID personnel have complained that the project lacks credibility, that EII's initial activities stimulated high hopes of direct technical and financial assistance in the selected communities, as well as expectations that the program would generate employment and create wealth.  EII has instead provided little expertise and even less financial support for the clients, and it has yet to demonstrate significant tangible results in institution building or job or wealth creation.  EII claims the project's purpose is to stimulate jobs and income, but project activities are not directly linked to generating those outputs.  In thus aiming at attractive but vaguely worded goals, there appears to be a communications failure and consequent misunderstanding among USAID, DOL, and EII of the basic project structure.  In addition, the project's underlying assumption that economic growth and development can follow a series of well- defined ""steps"" is misleading and not universally true.  Also, the project design is deficient in terms of EII's not having identified reasonable and time-phased objectives, defined necessary inputs, scheduled required actions, and described expected accomplishments. On the operational level, EII has only provided intermittent and relatively superficial TA, whereas most client communities need far more labor-intensive support to establish themselves and their programs in the project period, as well as a greater diversity of expertise to attend to their wide array of administrative and programmatic concerns. EII must also demonstrate more cultural sensitivity, and it will have to pursue a more systematic approach to obtain other donor support.  The donor community in the ""Planning Teams"" that are to complement EII's inputs with vital technical and financial resources are no more engaged in this project than they are in any other bilateral activity.  EII has proposed extension of the program for four more years, with expansion to other communities and countries. The evaluator recommends that DOL and USAID exercise restraint for one or two years, pending clear evidence of successful job and wealth creation in the communities where EII has already made a commitment.  If the project is extended it would be desirable to have it done under a performance contract that requires a more rigorous plan of inputs, outputs, benchmarks, and objectives.

"This evaluation examines the impact of two USAID projects, conducted during the 1980's, which introduced sustainable production systems in sloping upland areas of the Philippines:  the Farming Systems Development Project (FSDP) and the Rainfed Resources Development Project (RRDP).  Following an introduction, Section 2 summarizes the problem of sustainable agriculture production in the Philippines uplands, USAID's approach to the problem, and procedures used to evaluate USAID assistance.  Sections 3-5 present the evaluation's findings on the projects' impacts and relates these findings to FSDP's and RRDP's strategies.  Section 5 presents evidence of sustainability of impact and of the spread of activities beyond target areas. Section 6 summarizes lessons learned, while Section 7 briefly discusses the applicability of the Philippine experience to other countries.  Appendices discuss farming systems research and Sloping Agricultural Lands Technology (SALT)-based farming in the Philippines and presents a bibliography. The following key lessons were learned.  (1) Conservation farming practices should be introduced first in the locations where they are mostly likely to be adopted -- e.g., where there is little other land to farm, where there are serious erosion problems, and where farmers have secure land tenancy. (2) Upland conservation farming systems require institutional capacity (either public or private sector) and follow-up for sustainability and spread.  (3) Systematic hands-on training at all levels must be built into upland conservation farming programs; few farmers will adopt upland agroforestry practices without training.  (4) Training for project staff should be considered not only for what it does to equip them to carry out the jobs effectively but also for what they may do in post-project employment. (5) Upland farm and forest management systems need an ""economic engine"" for sustainability and spread. Where they are not integrated with cash enterprises, upland agroforestry practices have been abandoned.","Summary highlights: PN-ABS-510","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","4/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Soil conservation|Agricultural technology|Agroforestry|Natural resource conservation|Farming systems|Agricultural training|Hill soils|Sustainable agriculture","Philippines","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNABY894.pdf","1,137 KB","008058 - USAID.

"Impacts of two USAID projects to combat soil infertility in southern Mali's Upper Niger River Basin region are assessed:  Operation Haute Vallee (OHV--6880210) and Farming Systems Research and Development (FSRD--6880232).  Chapter 1 briefly describes the two key public agencies in the study zone -- the OHV du Niger (OHVN) and the Institut d'Economie Rurale (IER) -- along with the zone's farming systems. Chapter 2 discusses USAID assistance to national programs for sustainable agriculture, while Chapter 3 focusses on program outputs, especially USAID's contribution to institution building.  Chapter 4 briefly reviews the technologies promoted by USAID and the (rather undependable) data on their adoption, and presents three case studies demonstrating the complex interplay of institutional, organizational, and economic factors that encourage (or inhibit) technology adoption. The final chapter examines issues related to the replicability, sustainability, efficiency, effectiveness, and impacts of USAID's sustainable agriculture interventions in Mali. The following lessons are noted.  (1) The effectiveness of sustainable agriculture interventions does not depend on technology choice alone; issues of policy, sociology, investment in personnel and infrastructure, and empowerment are also important.  In Mali, successful technology adoption resulted from the confluence of several factors:  a strong functional literacy base; liberalized markets; public commitment to democratization and local-level empowerment; access to high-quality training in financial management and organizational skills; and ready access to markets.  Active involvement of the commercial banking sector is especially noteworthy.  (2) Synergisms among USAID-supported regional and national research programs (such as CIMMYT and ICRISAT) and regional extension organizations appear to increase the chances of technology elaboration and adoption.  This is amply demonstrated in the cases of maize and doliki.  (3) Technologies that seem most widely adopted are those for which farmers can readily observe a short-run payoff, e.g., rock lines or other simple soil conservation structures that visibly arrest erosion in fields that have already suffered serious damage, and organic fertilizers and disease- or pest-resistant cultivars which save farmers expenditures on agrochemicals.  However, producers must first recognize a natural resource problem as serious before they are willing to take ameliorative steps.  (4) Temporary subsidy or incentive programs may be necessary if farmers are unable to adopt natural resource conservation practices ""until it is too late.""  However, care must be taken to avoid the tendency to give out ""gifts.""  (5) Cultivars, technologies, or land-use practices that have a strong cognate in local cropping systems and practices stand a better chance of adoption than alien ones.","Summary highlights: PN-ABS-512","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","3/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Sustainable agriculture|Soil fertility|Crop production|Soil erosion|Natural resource management|Farming systems research|Agricultural extension|Agricultural technology|Technology transfer|Technology adoption|Institution building","Mali","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNABY895.pdf","2,236 KB","008058 - USAID.

"Mid-term evaluation of a project to promote forestry and agroforestry in the Area of Conservation for the Cordillera Volcanic Central (ACCVC) in Costa Rica.  The project has been implemented by the Foundation for the Development of the Central Volcanic Cordillera (FUNDECOR).  The evaluation covers the period 6/91-10/94. The project has established FUNDECOR as a strong and respected institution.  FUNDECOR's performance has been impressive; despite major challenges, the Foundation has implemented innovative, professional, and cost-effective activities in the ACCVC. The project's most impressive achievement has been the promotion of sustainable management of a large amount of the country's natural forest through the preparation of logging guidelines, streamlining of forest management plans, and the sale of timber through an innovative auction system.  In addition, the project has improved national park management through the improvement of visitor facilities and services. Parks are now moving toward self-financing, a rare achievement, through a system of user fees and concessions for park facilities and services.  The project is also developing a native species planting program, providing technical and financial support to fledgling nursery businesses, and has been highly successful in organizing landowners and other residents to develop the native species reforestation program, although a systematic program activity is needed to facilitate broader conservation and improved land use practices. FUNDECOR's excellent performance is attributed to a well-trained and highly qualified staff, and a high level of executive leadership, which resonates throughout the organization.  The new Costa Rican government is already learning much from FUNDECOR as it pursues its aggressive pro-conservation agenda. Additionally, FUNDECOR has brought outstanding creativity to the task of linking conservation and development, particularly in the areas of project design and problem solving.  In fact, the methods FUNDECOR has used to manage natural forests for production are among the most innovative observed in tropical forestry, its methodology for defining ""critical ecological areas"" indicates its skill and intellectual rigor, and its ""Eco-Camps"" proposal, which will ensure that large forests remain intact and that local forest landowners will benefit, is an innovative form of ecotourism that has not been observed elsewhere. However, financially, FUNDECOR is still a somewhat fragile structure with limited time to strengthen itself; unfortunately, examples of successful institution-building projects of less than five years are rare.  If it is to survive, FUNDECOR must quickly take steps to generate a financial base beyond the endowment, which will establish an important core structure, but be insufficient to fulfill the project's objectives or to meet daunting challenges within the ACCVC.","Delivery order no. 12|English ed.: PD-ABJ-393|Project title: Development strategies for fragile lands (DESFIL)","Special Evaluation","Documents","DHR-5438-Q-00-1091-00","","11/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Forestry|Agroforestry|Natural resource conservation|Natural resource management|Institution building|Sustainable agriculture","Costa Rica","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABN178.pdf","8,344 KB","001335 - Chemonics International Consulting Div.","","008355 - USAID.

"Evaluates a grant to The Asia Foundation (TAF) to strengthen democratic institutions in Nepal.  Mid-term internal evaluation covers the period 4/93-12/94. The Parliament Secretariat is functioning more efficiently and effectively as a result of this project, which builds upon a previous USAID-funded TAF project.  Examples include the ability of the Parliament to serve increased numbers of Parliamentarians with the same number of Secretariat staff; the provision of substantive materials on issues facing the Parliament; and a notable increase in the use of the library and computer facilities. Members of the Parliament are benefiting as well. There is a demand for orientation programs, particularly from new members, for research services, and for ideas on the role of the Parliament such as its oversight responsibilities and its role in the budget process. Senior Secretariat officials expressed their appreciation and desire for continuation of TAF's parliamentary projects.  Despite acknowledged rough spots in the relationship associated with the signing of the umbrella agreement with TAF, the Secretariat is committed to the relationship without reservation. The media project with the Nepal Press Institute for the publication of Media Watch is not focused directly on public awareness regarding the legislature and its members.  It will, however, help the public evaluate the Parliament by pointing out discrepancies in government-supported media coverage of Parliament and by serving as a watchdog.  Media Watch is an interesting project that directly educates the media about its coverage, and lack of coverage, of the legislature and its members. Through education of journalists in print, radio, and TV, it provides the public with critical evaluation of the information available on the legislature.  The Nepali and English publication comes out once a month and reaches about 201 Nepali outlets and 30 international outlets.  It is too early to assess its impact since only two publications have been issued. However, in the third issue, an evaluation questionnaire will be included. There is no evidence that the project brings journalists into contact with Members of Parliament, but as media coverage of the activities of Parliament increases, there should be more contact. TAF must keep in mind how hard it is for a bureaucracy to change. This is true for Parliament, but more evident at the Supreme Court. Certainly, the forward thinking, highly respected Supreme Court Chief Justice keeps the project on track and keeps the Supreme Court staff thinking about the project.  However, the nature of bureaucracies and the complexity of change this project is trying to address makes for slow progress.  As the consultants from the New Jersey State Courts said, ""It took the New Jersey State Courts over 40 years to make the same changes they recommended to the Nepali Supreme Court."" Nonetheless, the staff of the Supreme Court are clearly committed to the principle of change.  However, they will need guidance and intervention if concrete changes are to be made by the end of the project.  The groundwork has been laid with the two consultancies, but actual implementation will be harder.  Not much has happened regarding the recommendations to improve legal research.  TAF should work with the staff to determine which recommendations can be implemented. The community mediation project completed its first step only a week before the evaluator's arrival.  However, plans were underway for designing the community mediation pilot projects.

"Final evaluation of a project (4/92-12/94) to develop Ugandan capacity to manage the Kibale Forest (now Kibale National Park) and to nurture the continued development of the Makerere, University Biological Field Station (MUBFS).  The project was implemented by the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS). The implementation of this ambitious and well-justified project has been thwarted by poorly defined and increasingly difficult relationships between cooperating institutions and project personnel, limited financial administration provided by WCS, slow disbursement of USAID funds, early departures of personnel from key project positions with very slow replacement, turnover in Ugandan institutional authority over the forest, and limited financial and institutional investment in the field station by Makerere University. Despite these challenges, significant achievements have been made, including: (1) substantial infrastructure development at MUBFS, enhancing its capacity to serve as a center for tropical forest science research and training; (2) increased levels of applied conservation research and training at the station, with moderate participation of Ugandan students and scientists; (3) in and out park tourism development in place with demonstrable economic benefits to local communities; and (4) markedly increased local support for forest conservation. The imminent withdrawal of WCS from the cooperative agreement poses a critical challenge to the future of USAID support for research, training, conservation, and outreach at Kibale National Park. Consideration should be given follow-on efforts to encourage biodiversity conservation and sustainable development in and around Kibale. The following were lessons learned.  (1) All grants and cooperative agreements, and particularly those involving NGOs, need an administrative unit with the expertise to handle the project's financial and management oversight.  Further, the grantee should have a country representative to handle large and complex projects.  (2) Regardless of the desirability of funding an activity, no grant should be made until adequate management systems of both the grantor and grantee are ready to be put into place.  Missions should not attempt to internally manage a grant without sufficient staff; if numerous, similar grants are anticipated, then it is highly appropriate to develop a grants management.  (3) An understanding on the part of both the grantor and the grantee of the interpretation of USAID ""substantive involvement"" is critical.  This should be established through dialogue and negotiation at the outset of cooperative agreements.  Missions should allow grantees considerable leeway in selecting qualified personnel while maintaining high standards of accountability with respect to project performance and output.

"Evaluates project to increase the utilization and influence of information and analysis for agricultural and natural resource policies, programs, and projects in sub-Saharan Africa.  Mid-term evaluation covers the period 5/92-7/94, and was based in part on interviews with or questionnaires completed by more than 150 persons, including 40 in 14 African countries. The project has had a significant impact on USAID's thinking about agricultural investment in Africa.  The research and analysis it has supported are relevant and generally of high quality; results are being disseminated throughout USAID and increasingly to African policy makers. The project has in place a high-quality, analytically capable technical staff, supplied under a RSSA with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA); this staff possesses a wealth of historic and institutional knowledge about Africa and has strong links to Missions.  Individual staff units have completed a rich variety of analytical national and comparative studies.  Some of these studies have developed innovative methodologies for assessing the impact on economic growth and food security of policy reforms and public and private sector investment in agriculture. Unfortunately, not all of the information generated by the project is being fully shared among units or collaborators.  However, there is a strong correlation between participation and effective dissemination of results, full participation of African researchers in conceptualizing and implementing research appears to positively affect host country and USAID Mission decision making.  The project is increasing utilizing significant levels of African participation. The predominant use of additions (or buy-ins) to Global Bureau projects for research and analysis is an innovative, effective, and efficient process which is positively affecting relations between the Africa Bureau and the Global Bureau. The impact monitoring and evaluation system called for in the project paper has yet to be completely implemented.  The system is necessary not only for full justification of the project but as an aid in internal management, where it will help to set priorities and improve communication between units.  Despite the lack of a fully articulated monitoring and evaluation plan, some of the existing system's outputs have been of notable value, having been used in Agency reporting documents, used by the Africa Bureau for decisions on allocations, and adopted by African institutions. There is a continual need to focus on the purpose of the project. The USDA RSSA staff is such a strong source of talent that it is in constant demand to perform other tasks. Further, the annual addition of new research to the Analytical Agenda opens the project to possible requests to sponsor analysis closely related to the Agenda.  If these activities are truly worthy of effort, then clear justification and inclusion in the Analytical Agenda is essential.

"This evaluation looks at the Sesame Growers' Associations (SGAs) in The Gambia.  The SGAs are rural women's associations that are organized in a pyramidal fashion.  At the base, some 56,000 women belong to about 800 village kafo associations.  These associations are grouped into ""clusters"" of from 5 to 70 kafos.  The clusters then group into 16 associations, each run by an Executive Committee (ExCo) selected by the membership. Catholic Relief Services (CRS) has been working with these associations for several years, assisting their evolution from management committees for the sesame oil expellers to more broadly based development agents that can respond to the needs of their membership. This evaluation looked generally at how the institutions have matured over the past four years since the time when they became independent associations.  Specifically, it looked at how self-reliant the associations are and whether they are becoming more independent in their relations with CRS, how effective their management structures are, and how successful the associations have been in providing real benefits to their members. Among the key findings of the evaluation are the following:  (1) The associations show clear signs of institutional maturing.  They have their own identity and are not merely appendages of CRS (Section III and VII).  (2) The associations are generally more mature and more institutionally sophisticated at the top of the pyramid (ExCo) than the bottom of the pyramid (kafo). (Sections III and IV).  (3) Kafo level identification with the association is still weak. (Section IV). (4) The size of the various associations is not always well-suited to carrying out their responsibilities and strengthening their institutional identity.  The size of some of the SGAs is larger than would be optimal. (Section V).  (5) Sesame production is no longer the ""glue"" maintaining interest in the association. Sesame is declining in importance in all the associations we visited. (Section VI).  (6) One of the biggest challenges facing the associations is finding projects that can provide significant benefits to members so as to retain their interest and willingness to pay dues. (Section VI).  (7) Credit is, in most cases, providing more benefits to the association (through interest earnings) than it is to the individuals who receive it. The exception to this is the Gunjur Association, where investment opportunities are higher and returns to women taking loans are greater. (Section VI).  (8) The associations are more self-reliant in decision-making than they are in resource mobilization. (Section VI).  (9) The associations lack financial planning necessary to assure their core funding and, hence, their institutional survival.  (Section VII) In general, the evaluation found that these are dynamic rural associations that can, potentially, play an important part in the development of The Gambia.  CRS is strongly encouraged (Section VIII) to continue working with these fledgling organizations and to continue to search for ways that it can support the associations' development without smothering their independence or growing sense of initiative.

"Final evaluation of Save the Children's (SC) MotherCare project in Bangladesh, aimed at reducing neonatal and perinatal mortality and maternal and neonatal morbidity.  The evaluation covers the period 10/93 through 1993. The project significantly increased knowledge and, perhaps more importantly, practice on the part of mothers and support persons (husbands and mothers-in-law) in regard to such behaviors as attendance at pre-natal care (PNC) sessions, increased food consumption and fluid intake, intake of iron tablets and of Fe, feeding colostrum, exclusive breastfeeding through months 1-4, and use of modern contraception.  Also significantly increased was mothers' use of, and perception of support from family members for, such protective health behaviors as use of trained traditional birth attendants (TBAs) and referrals for complicated deliveries. The project improved TBA management of normal deliveries, significantly increasing TBA use of soap and plastic sheets during delivery and of boiled blades and decreasing the placing of materials (e.g., hot compresses, ash) on the umbilical cord stump (a practice significantly associated with neonatal health problems).  There was no association between delivery by a trained TBA and the incidence of maternal problems post partum, but infants delivered by trained TBAs were significantly less likely to have health problems.  Given the current debate over the impact of TBA training and use of safe birth kits, this association bears more careful investigation, with control for possible confounders. During pregnancy, dizziness was the leading problem, though women usually had to be prompted before admitting any problems during pregnancy.  This lack of spontaneity, along with a tendency not to regard problems as ""serious"", makes it difficult to assess levels of knowledge about potentially serious problems during pregnancy and/or willingness to seek treatment. Prolonged or delayed labor was the most common problem during delivery, while ""fever"" accounted for the largest proportions of problems in the post-partum period.  Acute respiratory infections (ARI) accounted for most problems of the newborn. For problems in pregnancy or delivery, women and their families would first seek care from local providers (SC personnel and village doctors); only in the last resort would they go to the hospital.  The training program seems to have improved the status of TBAs to the point where their advice on the need for advanced care was generally heeded.  Even after being referred, however, families would seek help from nurse midwives or village doctors.  Local government service sites were consulted for only a small proportion of problems; the lack of providers at such sites is a notable problem, despite continuing government efforts to improve maternal child health services and to increase the number of government personnel actually posted in villages.  NasirNagar is a particularly difficult area for recruitment. Another major reason for not seeking treatment was lack of money. The services of village doctors, in particular, is prohibitively expensive.  The quality of the care they offer is also of concern: their administration of syntocin to women in labor is just one of their many potentially adverse health practices.  Proscriptions against leaving the home did not appear to be an important obstacle. Birth and infant death rates decreased during the project.  From 1/90 to 12/93, the birth rate dropped from 37 to 32, infant mortality from 116 to 100, and neonatal mortality from 54 to 53, though to what extent these changes were due to project interventions is uncertain.  The target population is too small to permit reliable calculation of maternal mortality.  A slightly higher proportion of neonatal deaths was attributed to tetanus in 1993 than in 1990, possibly due to the shortage of tetanus toxoid during the first few months of that year.  In both 1991 and 1993, the main cause of neonatal death was ARI. A large proportion of women of reproductive age are malnourished, with some groups especially vulnerable.  In the final survey, mean mid upper arm circumference (MUAC) for women aged 15-45 was 22.6 cm (up from 22.2), while 5% of the population was severely malnourished and 25% moderately malnourished, down from 8% and 32% respectively.  In both surveys, MUACs of poorer and younger (15-20 year old) women were significantly smaller than those of ""more affluent"" and older (26-35 year old) women.","Attached to PD-ABN-582","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","FAO-0500-A-00-2034-00","","6/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Child survival activities|Maternal child health care|Infant mortality|Morbidity|Health education|KAP surveys|Mortality rate|Prenatal care|Child delivery","Bangladesh","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDABN582A.pdf","338 KB","008015 - Save the Children/Bangladesh|001407 - Save the Children (U.S.)","","007746 - USAID.

"Evaluates seven Collaborative Research Support Programs (CRSPs) between USAID and U.S. universities and other research organizations, implemented between 1979 and 1985.  Individual CRSPS focused on: sorghum/millet, beans/cowpeas, small ruminants, soil management, pond dynamics/aquaculture, peanuts, and fishery stock assessments. The CRSPs have largely achieved their objectives.  They have educated over 1,700 scientists from the United States, host countries, and developing countries; improved crop cultivars for use by farmers, and contributed substantially to the body of knowledge concerning tropical soils, agriculture, and fisheries; and developed new techniques that should substantially improve fishery stock assessments, pond aquaculture, pest and disease control, and plant and animal breeding. Some CRSPs developed new computer software to improve interventions in commodity production.  The pond dynamics and aquaculture, bean/cowpea, and small ruminant CRSPs to date have had the most impact per dollar spent in the developing countries.  The sorghum/millet, bean/cowpea, and peanut CRSPs have had the most impact per dollar spent within the United States.  Unmet goals include the development of new food products with significant commercial value, development of a multivalent vaccine for small ruminants and of soil management technology transfer methods, and analyses of a pond dynamics and aquaculture experiment. The CRSPs have helped create a legacy of scientific personnel, most of whom have returned to their home institutions to continue contributing to agricultural research management and national development policy.  Unfortunately, direct beneficiaries of the CRSPs were predominantly male; the goal of gender equity was not articulated from the outset and accountability for it was not demanded by USAID project managers.  The CRSPS also clearly increased the institutional capacities of participating U.S. universities. All participating universities matched their required cost-sharing contributions, and several contributed at higher percentage levels. Conversely, the CRSPs have not been very successful in fostering governmental recurrent cost support for local research institutions. Mission buy-ins to test the validity of new or improved technologies have proven satisfactory and USAID should seriously consider assisting a follow-up, utilization phase of activities beyond the CRSPs. In terms of management, an effective CRSP program requires a minimum structure consisting of a management entity, a Board of Directors, a technical committee, and a well-functioning external evaluation panel (recommendations for improving the effectiveness of these entities are included in the report).  However, expatriate country coordinators, most of whom have been withdrawn, are now seldom necessary or even advisable. The major problem cited by the CRSP management entities was USAID's inability to honor its financial commitments to the CRSPs in full and on time; there was a gap of approximately $20 million between the original grant appropriations and actual grant authorizations.  As a result, some research activities were cut short, some operations closed in host countries, some scientists and staff were discharged prematurely, and entire CRSP components had to be eliminated.  Most of the management entities also voiced strong concerns about the persistent and inexplicable delays in receiving annual funding authorizations from USAID.  However, most of these problems are solvable. Future CRSPs, particularly if they maintain their global focus, must be truly multidisciplinary, integrating biological, physical, and social scientists. They should also work to ensure a critical mass of scientists in a range of disciplines, trained at the best universities, and possessing the minimum equipment, facilities, and communications links needed to be effective.  Greater effort in supporting regional networks is also urged. The following lessons were learned.  (1) Title XII legislation has led to a perception of ""entitlement"" among participating institutions that is not always a positive force in research design and implementation.  (2) The CRSPs have faced unresolved dichotomies between research and development activities, and in allocating resources between global and local research needs.  (3) When new scientific knowledge is sought through CRSP projects, it should have a strategic character, applicable within a reasonable time to ameliorating specified development constraints.  (4) Universities have placed great emphasis on CRSP training outputs.  USAID needs to recognize that universities are more likely to produce high-quality training outputs than to generate technological outputs.  (5) The dissemination of CRSP research outputs requires persons with the contextual skills and perspectives that the CRSP scientists may lack.","Delivery order no. 2","Special Evaluation","Documents","LAG-4200-I-00-3056-00","","10/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural research|Research centers|Research organizations|Agricultural technology|Research collaboration|Universities and colleges|Institution building|Developing countries|Partnerships","USA","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABP209.pdf","16,346 KB","005072 - Tropical Research and Development, Inc.","","008409 - USAID.

ACCS is designed to improve the primary health care (PHC) system in four governorates in Yemen: Hajjah, Mareb, Sa'adah, and Hodeidah.  The evaluation covers the period 1989-9/93. REACH supported the ACCS project in five areas:  manpower and training, commodities and equipment, Expanded Program of Immunization (EPI) cold chain system and equipment maintenance, PHC management, and cost recovery.  Results are as follows. REACH was largely effective only in training PHC workers (PHCWs); 259 new PHCWs (165 males and 94 females) have greatly enhanced the Ministry of Public Health's (MOPH) capability to provide health care to rural, underserved population, especially women and children.  REACH did not perform management or clinical training and only superficially performed trainer training, even though these types of training, particularly of females, is crucial to strengthening the PHC system.  Because PHCW training used an outdated 1986 curriculum (the 1989 revised curriculum and approved by REACH consultants was not ready in time), graduates lacked some skills required by their job descriptions.  A new curriculum for female PHCWs has been completed but not yet produced. REACH developed a standard list of commodities and equipment for the PHC Units and the health training centers, appropriate to the tasks and capabilities of the personnel who were to use them. REACH was not responsible for ordering and procuring the commodities and equipment. REACH consultants played a key role in developing the National Model EPI/PHC Operations Plan, which contributed to the development of cold chain systems in the four project governorates and of an equipment repair and maintenance workshop and program. REACH was also involved in follow-up work in the four governorates. There was no apparent change in PHC management as a result of REACH activities.  REACH consultancies were elementary inputs rather than sustained activities with closure. Health cost recommendations produced by the REACH consultant in early 1992 were incomplete and inconclusive; they focused on cost containment and improved financial management, rather than cost recovery through the use of clinic fees. The project demonstrated the importance of having a national counterpart for long-term personnel and of having a proactive management oversight mechanism, especially if project management by the contractor is weak.  The project also demonstrated that buy-ins do not facilitate the long-term counterpart relationship essential for developing shared ownership, sustainability, and transfer of technology.  Other lessons include the following.  (1) The process followed by the MOPH in developing the National EPI Plan should be emulated when strengthening the PHC system as a whole. (2) In the current political climate, a task force seems to be the most effective mechanism for fostering collaboration within the MOPH and donor collaboration. (3) Strengthening the management and decisionmaking capacities of institutions at all levels is essential for sustainability, as is government commitment to senior-level policies such as decentralization and financial support of PHC.  (4) When key MOPH players do not feel they are active project partners, they are less likely to commit to the project.  (5) The implementation and sustainability of a project are adversely affected when the MOPH and governorates are not involved in its design.  (6) The difference between willingness to pay and ability to pay must be carefully weighed before signing grant agreements with the Yemen Government.  When there are no mechanisms for ensuring commitments, the Mission must either not expect sustainability or actively help the host government develop alternative health care financing mechanisms.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","4/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Primary health care|Health professional education|Logistics|Procurement|Health care planning|Cold chain|Health care administration|Health care costs|Cost recovery","Yemen","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABP316.pdf","2,999 KB","006434 - Devres, Inc.","","008624 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of a program/project (1/90-1/95) to reform the Senegalese banking sector and deepen and broaden access to credit, particularly by small and medium-scale enterprises (SMEs) and farmers. The program was an overall success. Conditions precedent were met prior to the disbursement of all five tranches.  The program achieved its purpose and most of the objectives relating to the restructuring of the banking sector; it also made considerable progress in increasing access to credit for SMEs and agriculture, particularly with regard to establishing credit unions. Specific successes were as follows.  (1) The banking sector has been consolidated and the remaining private banks, for the most part, are solvent, more liquid, profitable, and better managed.  (2) Banking supervision has improved through the creation of a regional banking control commission.  (3) Reserve requirements have replaced credit ceilings as a means of control of credit exposure by individual banks. (4) Government ownership of and interference in the banking sector have lessened significantly.  (5) The foundation for a legal and institutional framework for credit unions has been laid, thus providing a basis for an appreciable increase in the future availability of and access to credit for SMEs and agriculture in the future.  (6) Donor coordination was excellent; USAID's role in the program was particularly effective. Principal shortcomings were as follows.  (1) The reform of the banking sector does not appear to have been a major cause of the general improvement in the economy that occurred during the project, although without this reform the general improvement would have been impossible. More efforts are needed to adjust the structure of the economy in other areas if a general improvement is to be accomplished.  (2) The program has not significantly increased either sectoral or term diversification of credit from commercial banks or access to credit for SMEs and agriculture from the formal banking sector.  However, some critical assumptions made in program design regarding lending to this sector were flawed.  (3) Mobilization of private sector deposits has not succeeded due to the capital flight caused by an uncertain domestic economic environment.  (4) Although a considerable amount of the bad debts of the liquidated banks were recovered and the conditions precedent were met, a substantial amount of bad debt remains uncollected and prospects for recovering the remaining debts are not good.  (5) The banking sector monitoring system to be used by the Government of Senegal (GOS) was not implemented.  However, the evaluation team believes that the concept of the monitoring system had some major design problems. The following lessons were learned.  (1) Program grants tied to conditions precedent can be very effective in changing government policies, if they are perceived to be in the government's interest.  (2) Effective donor coordination is critical to the success of major structural reforms of the economy.  Donors should perceive their roles as being complementary to each other, with each donor focusing on a special aspect of the reform.  (3) Effective monitoring of the process of change by USAID, as well as participation in day-to-day meetings and communication were extremely important in restructuring the banking sector.  The use of five separate disbursements tied to specific conditions was particularly effective.  (4) Exploring alternative mechanisms for financial intermediation outside the formal banking system is essential for improving access to credit to SMEs and agriculture.  (5) Banking sector reforms and restructuring by itself cannot effectively change the structure of an economy. Attributing overall changes in the economy to banking sector improvements alone is very difficult, if not impossible.  (6) Improving access to credit through private commercial banks, especially to sectors perceived as being highly risky, cannot be accomplished by improving the financial viability of banks.

"Evaluates activities of the Institute for Contemporary Studies' International Center for Self-Governance (ICSG).  The ICSG promotes self-governance and the entrepreneurial way of life in developing countries. Interim evaluation covers the period 8/90-3/94. ICSG's goal, strategies, and objectives have evolved considerably from those envisioned in the Cooperative Agreement, particularly with respect to the development and dissemination of books, videos, workshops, and training materials.  The content that ICSG seeks to communicate through these materials, which have been favorably evaluated by the target groups, is fundamentally sound and relevant to the problems of self-governance; there is also widespread interest among survey respondents and some USAID staff in the concepts of self-governance.  Further, ICSG publications, especially Elinor Ostrom's work on self-governance of irrigation systems, have had appreciable impact on the intellectual debate concerning development and self-governance, although difficulties in translating theory into practical tools and the consequent small amount of completed training materials have resulted in minimal impact on ""grass roots"" self-governance. On the down side, ICSG has been slow to focus its program and to define a strategy appropriate for its resources.  Elements of its existing strategy are debatable, including: over-reliance on advocacy NGOS; the belief that adequate translation (theoretical concepts to practical tools and into various languages) will lead to ""stand alone"" products; failure to anticipate and structure desirable roles for international donors and host country government agencies; failure to fully develop and explain how the contemplated Local Action Foundations will function; and excessive reliance on the ""International Network"" for feedback and learning by ICSG. Further, the Office of Small, Micro, and Informal Enterprises (SMIE) of the Global Bureau/Economic Growth Division and ICSG have fallen into an almost adversarial management style that adds difficulty for both. Given a certain lack of expertise and interest in self-governance and democracy, it is more difficult for SMIE to make a positive contribution to the resolution of difficult conceptual issues that ICSG faces. Other findings are as follows. (1) Both the content and strategy of ICSG's work are unique; no redundancy or overlap exists between ICSG's work and that of ""similar"" projects. (2) Internal management and planning of ICSG's program is not sufficiently institutionalized.  To some degree, personal management occurs instead of rule-ordered relationships. (3) The demand for ICSG's services is difficult to determine. The principal evidence is provided by book sales.  The number of workshops produced to date is small, but this is evidence not of a lack of demand, but rather of a hesitant marketing effort by ICSG and SMIE.  Demand for future ICSG products is hard to determine given the rightsizing of USAID and the limited funds and crowded agendas of Mission offices.

"Evaluates project to develop sustainable natural resource management (NRM) models in selected protected areas of Ecuador and their buffer zones (SUBIR project).  Interim evaluation covers Phase I of the project (3/92-5/94).  The project is being implemented by a PVO consortium headed by CARE/Ecuador. Much has been accomplished.  (1) With SUBIR's help, Ecociencia has become Ecuador's premier biological research and training institution capable of supporting not only Phase II of SUBIR but similar initiatives elsewhere.  SUBIR/Ecociencia research has yielded considerable baseline data on the biological resources of project sites and has served as a fertile training ground for scientists and community parabiologists. (2) The paralegal program trains and assists local people in community laws and legal advocacy on issues such as land titling and natural resource access rights.  SUBIR is strengthening second-level organizations to test and extend sustainable uses of biological resources.  ""Guardaparques comunitarios"" bolster a weakened park protection system with assistance from SUBIR and second-level organizations.  (3) SUBIR has made significant strides in opening channels of communication between environmental groups and natural resources related industries, particularly with Endesa/Botrosa in timber and Maxus in oil exploration.  These linkages, combined with SUBIR field efforts, demonstrate promise for improving private management of resources and the NRM policy environment.  (4) The project's geographical focus is particularly conducive to the conservation of ecosystem diversity.  SUBIR has focused on three protected areas and their buffer zones that encompass an array of more than a dozen distinct ecosystems from Pacific mangroves through cloud forests, paramos, and the forests of the Amazon. Yet serious problems exist which must be addressed before embarking on Phase II.  (1) The assumption by the Consortium Executive Committee of project management oversight and policy guidance has proved unworkable -- the Project Implementation Committee and the Consortium Executive Committee have come to play virtually the same role, resulting in confusion and delays.  Legitimate interventions by USAID/Ecuador have been frustrated.  (2) Though CARE is the lead institution, some members of the Consortium prefer to handle hiring and salary issues separately. The Project Coordinator at times received directions from the Consortium Executive Committee, USAID, and CARE/ Ecuador.  These different chains of authority have led to management frustration, created confused signals, and contributed to high turnover, from the coordinator down through the project field staff.  (3) At one point, SUBIR was carrying out more than 300 activities.  This number was subsequently scaled back, but draft 1994 work plans are still unrealistic.  (4) Though staff have some inherent sense of what has and has not worked and why, there is no systematized way of accessing and analyzing data about project activities.  SUBIR is not yet able to function as the learning institution it was intended to be in the Project Paper. Lessons learned include the following.  (1) When many international NGOs are involved in project design and implementation, summing up their different concerns and interests does not necessarily result in the best project.  (2) Not involving local NGOs and other relevant stakeholders in project design and implementation causes friction and limits local support for project objectives.  (3) Mutual expectations and obligations for counterpart agencies and other institutional participants should be made clear at the outset.  (4) Project management and governance structure is critical, especially when several entities are involved in project design and implementation.  (5) Dialogue must be promoted among the various, and potentially conflictive interests of the various NRM groups, recognizing their legitimate interests if sustainable use is to be approximated.  (6) Effective model building and testing of integrated approaches to NRM best occurs when focused on a limited but representative geographic area where impacts can be monitored and analyzed.  (7) The low priority accorded biodiversity conservation, together with the lack of adequate financial resources and trained professionals, implies that SUBIR-like projects will be needed on an expanded scale with multidonor support for many years, complemented by programs that increase economic well-being and environmental awareness among rural populations.","Full report: PD-ABP-379","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","5/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Biological diversity|Natural resource management|Natural resource utilization|Natural resource conservation|Protected environmental areas|Environmental protection|Private voluntary organizations|Community participation|Local groups","Ecuador","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABP378.pdf","27 KB","005072 - Tropical Research and Development, Inc.","","008538 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to support environmental initiatives by NGOs in the New Independent States (NIS). Midterm evaluation covers the period 4/93-7/94.  The project is being implemented by ISAR -- the Institute for Soviet-American Relations. The project is an effective use of U.S. taxpayers' money.  Both the ""Seeds of Democracy"" project in Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, and Moldova, and the joint U.S.-Russian programs show what relatively small amounts of money -- applied broadly yet carefully -- can do to encourage social, environmental, and institutional change in the nations emerging from the shadow of Soviet totalitarianism.  While there are institutional problems and management issues that ISAR and USAID must confront, they are exceptions to a general rule of solid achievement. The ""Seeds of Democracy"" program -- for which ISAR has established and maintained strict standards for financial and programmatic impacts -- gives grants ranging from $500 to $3,000 to NGOs that have shown promise in environmental activism and the ability to account for monies spent.  The dire environmental conditions in the NIS and the depth of public apathy towards any constructive projects have inspired, rather than enervated, some NIS NGOs.  The groups now being funded through ISAR work on a range of environmental issues, from radiation monitoring, to biodiversity, to public education, to informing policymakers.  Most of these NGOs have managed to show tangible impacts in the less than 9 months that USAID monies have been allocated by ISAR.  Local government has given legislative and practical support, and ISAR grantees have participated in parliamentary hearings on the national level.  The public, and particularly young people, have shown a new eagerness to work on ecological projects.  The news media has again begun highlighting environmental and democratic initiatives. In its partnership grants program, ISAR allows no more than 15% of the grants, which range in size from $12,000 to $75,000, to be spent in the United States.  This restriction not only reinforces emerging environmental NGOs in Russia but leads both the Russian and the American partners to seek significant impacts on the Russian scene.  These projects are somewhat more conventional in methodology (bringing together U.S. and Russian organizations for seminars and joint research), but they have produced impacts similar to the Seeds grants. The cooperative grants are an important training ground for more effective, results-oriented multilateral cooperation than existed during the euphoria of the first U.S.-Soviet contacts. Two essential elements stand out in the projects assessed by the evaluators:  (1) the professionalism and preparation of the partner organizations, and (2) the high number of policy and environmental impacts they have achieved early in the program.  In addition, ISAR has developed a unique dual-board meeting strategy:  the Russian board meets in Moscow and the U.S. board in Washington, with ISAR staff helping negotiate the actual voting between the different boards.  The most delicate and potentially troubling issue facing the joint program -- conflict of interest among its boards of advisors -- arises because a small number of ISAR's project selection board members have also received ISAR grants.  While this problem has been dealt with openly, ISAR should, to guarantee the program's integrity, cease including potential grantees as members of its boards. By leaving some initiative to grant seekers, and not imposing overly restrictive grant categories, ISAR has concentrated on an essential aspect of its cooperative agreement with USAID:  the development of a democratic and environmental NGO infrastructure in the NIS.  As the program develops, however, USAID and ISAR may wish to move towards a more structured program -- at least for a part of grants given -- in order to show results in urgent program areas.  In addition, given that small NGOs in the NIS are growing in influence, experience, and size, USAID should consider approving larger Seeds grants (in the neighborhood of $10,000). After this point, however, NIS NGOs should be ready to move to other funding sources.

"PACR of a Swaziland subproject (1988-4/94) of the Regional Rail Systems Support Project in Southern Africa.  The purpose of the subproject was to improve the management performance of Swaziland Railway (SR) and ensure its viability. Despite the gloomy predictions of the 11/91 mid-term evaluation, the subproject has had a significant impact on improving the performance and viability of SR. Its net financial position, which stood at negative E10l,472,000 in 1986, improved to positive E41,948,000 by 4/94, and its operating ratio has been reduced from 146% to 68%.  Per the grant agreement with the Government of Swaziland (GOS), SR's loan portfolio was analyzed and loans were restructured; the GOS converted the bulk of its ownership from debt claims to equity claims. According to the 4/94 final evaluation, SR has turned from the brink of insolvency to becoming one of the most profitable railways in Africa. Swazi senior management were trained in the United States and regionally and are doing their jobs effectively.  Other training included on-the-job training and regional courses and technical training for SR managers and other staff.  Additionally, management systems, non-existent at project inception, have been successfully implemented. These include: a management information system, corporate business and strategic planning, improved financial management systems, a safety program, and enhanced operating procedures, including the Radio and Train Order system (RTOS). Assessing the project's impact on regional economic growth is more difficult.  However, at its peak in 1991, over 4 million tons of transit traffic went through Swaziland; substantially more traffic is moved by SR than other railways in the region (Tanzania, Zambia, Mozambique). The railway has provided a shorter and cheaper route for transit traffic moving between the South African ports of Durban and Richard's Bay, and Northern Transvaal and Zimbabwe, Malawi, and Zambia. The following lessons were learned.  (1) Management transitions can be successful if all parties are committed to the effort.  In this project, expatriate contractors moved from management positions to advisory positions after Swazi management training was completed, and then left at the end of the contract.  (2) When planning to transfer management responsibilities from the contractor to a local institution, the latter's Board of Directors' roles and abilities should be assessed. Any efforts to strengthen the institution should begin at the project start-up.  Although this was not part of the original project design, work was instigated with the railway board during the last year of the project when it became apparent that their skills would need to be strengthened.  (3) When designing regional projects, it should be remembered that not all project components may offer a win-win situation for each country.  One of the output targets for this project was an increase in intra-SADCC (Southern Africa Development Coordination Conference) traffic on SR.  With the changed political conditions in South Africa, and with improved security and railway conditions in the region (especially Mozambique), less transport traffic is expected to flow through Swaziland in the future (although other countries will benefit by using more economical and shorter routes).","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","11/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Railroads|Management development|Procedural development|Human capacity development|Economic self sufficiency|Institution building|Management operations","Southern Africa|Swaziland","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABP677.pdf","181 KB","008580 - USAID.

"Ex post evaluation of a project (6/86-12/94) to strengthen the technical, administrative, and legal performance of the three major Government of Peru (GOP) judicial sector entities -- the Judicial Power, the Ministry of Justice, and the Public Ministry. In the early years of the project, 23 subprojects were created, some with budgets as small as $5,000, under five main components: organizational; training and professional training; planning, studies, and modernization of procedures; outreach; and basic equipment.  Due to the limited operational capacity of the GOP implementing institutions, a 9/92 project amendment shifted implementation responsibilities from them to USAID and reduced the number of subprojects from 23 to 4:  special courts, accusatorial system, court administration, and policy options. The pace of project implementation increased significantly thereafter, when many of the project's principal achievements were made. The project's most important tangible achievements were the casetracking system installed in the Public Ministry, the training programs developed in the Judicial Branch and the Public Ministry, and finally, the National Registry of Detainees, which remains under development in the Public Ministry and the Ministry of Interior. More important, however, were its intangible benefits.  For example, the project helped the GOP learn many lessons concerning the reform of the judicial sector.  The Public Ministry benefitted the most and the Judicial Branch the least.  The Ministry of Justice benefitted indirectly from the project through its relationships with individuals and NGOs that were close to the project.  Toward the end of the LOP, judicial reform became a major topic of concern to the GOP, the Peruvian public, and other members of the international donor community, including the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank.  The project can take considerable credit for being the forerunner in the provision of assistance to a sector that is now widely recognized by the donor community as being a key component of sustainable development. USAID itself learned much about the process of judicial reform in the course of project implementation. What the project actually achieved was often quite different from what was specified in the original design and the 1992 amendment, both of which were overly dependent on the political winds then prevailing. These design flaws also hindered the project from responding to emerging opportunities. In fact, some of the most interesting judicial reform activities, including the TA for the reorganization of the Public Ministry and the implementation of the Office of the Court Administrator, and the first year of the development of the National Registry of Detainees, were not even financed under the project, but by Program Development and Support (PD&S) funds.  In these circumstances, the project cannot justly be evaluated in light of the end-of-project indicators contained in the design documents. Other findings are as follows.  (1) Successful management of the project required a high level of organization, the fulfillment of numerous administrative processes, an in-depth understanding of the judicial system, and a prolonged political commitment to judicial reform on the part of all parties involved. Lacking each of these to some extent, project implementation was slow and cumbersome, particularly during its initial phases.  (2) Constant personnel changes, together with staff reductions and repeated and prolonged strikes, greatly limited the ability of the GOP institutions to implement the project adequately.  A related problem was the highly conservative nature of the traditional aspects of the judicial sector.  The GOP authorities involved in the project were often unwilling to make necessary decisions that would have required compromise and change in their highly tradition-bound institutions.  The requirement that they cooperate with one another clashed with judicial sector traditions of inter-institutional competition and jealousy.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","11/1/1994 12:00:00 AM","","Administration of law|Government departments|Judiciary|Judicial reform","Peru","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABP794.pdf","895 KB","008591 - USAID.

"Evaluates emergency U.S. assistance to Mozambique during the 1991-92 drought in southern Africa. The drought exacerbated emergency conditions that Mozambique had been confronting for decades due to war and poor economic management. Because the public and private institutions, the infrastructure, and the private sector economy were ill prepared to handle the compounded crisis, the international community assumed a dominant role in its mitigation under the leadership of USAID/Mozambique, which provided most of the resources and coordinated the relief effort.  International NGOs played an especially significant role in the distribution of the relief goods, accounting for the distribution of approximately 30% of food in the most severely drought-affected provinces.  At least 23 national and international NGOs participated in free food aid distribution, nutritional rehabilitation, health programs, water drought-related projects, local purchases of food, and logistical support. Significantly and atypically, Mozambique relied on private transport for the transport of emergency supplies.  The drought response was greatly facilitated by past donor interventions, especially those of USAID, in the areas of policy reform, deregulation, and infrastructure development. The overriding strategic lessons learned from the Mozambique experience are that it is possible to (1) mitigate potential disaster in the face of weak governmental structures by mobilizing civil society organizations such as NGOs, and (2) make otherwise politically unpopular but needed changes in a developing country by using the emergency as a justification:  the impact of the drought led the conflicting sides to sign the Rome Peace Accord, which suddenly opened all of Mozambique, except the mined areas, to the relief effort. The primary constraint to the provision of relief commodities became transport capacity on the ground. More specific lessons are as follows.  (1) Reliance on diverse organizations and approaches for food distribution and emergency response is an appropriate option in crisis situations.  The Mozambique case demonstrated that there is no need for a grand centralized implementation strategy and institutional monopolies.  (2) The macroeconomic policy framework and the economic and political context, including physical infrastructure, determine the ability of an emergency response to contribute not just to saving lives but to future sustainable development.  (3) Need assessments should be done by independent firms, NGOs, and universities, not the public agencies that deal with emergency assistance and tend to overestimate food shortages. (4) The high levels of relief food sold in markets throughout the country indicates a substantial leakage of food aid. Emergency food and commercial aid in Mozambique are closely interrelated, as much of the emergency aid finds its way into the food market.  This problem is not as grave as the proportions of diverted food indicate.  Much of the food finds its way to the population through commercial channels, albeit at a price not intended to be paid by the poor. (5) Emergency assistance should contribute to long-term food security and not be an isolated act of food distribution.

The major implementing agency was the MidAmerica International Consortium (MIAC). The evaluation covers the period 1977-2/94 against a PACD of 8/94. Major project achievements are as follows:  (1) A functioning and sustainable research center (Aridoculture Center), along with four satellite research stations, capable of generating technology for dryland agriculture has been developed. This center will serve as a model for other National Agricultural Research Institute (INRA) centers as INRA pursues its goal of decentralization.  (2) A critical mass of highly-skilled and motivated scientific staff has been trained.  By the end of the project, 61 INRA staff will have received higher degree training in the United States, 45 at the Ph.D. level.  In addition, non- degree training, both in the United States and at the Center, has upgraded skills in areas such as research station management, research planning and budgeting, rapid rural appraisal, technology transfer, human resources management, financial management, and equipment maintenance.  (3) Substantial progress has been made in the planning, prioritization, and evaluation of research activities, based on an assessment of production constraints faced by farmers.  This process is still incomplete, however, especially regarding the prioritization of research projects and their linkage to resource allocation.  (4) Effective linkages have been forged between technology generation and technology transfer.  (5) A useful body of knowledge, indicated in part by an impressive list of publications, has been generated on dryland agriculture, including socioeconomic data on low- resource farmers in the region and the production constraints they face.  (6) An impressive volume of technology in terms of improved varieties and agronomic practices has been generated. Farming equipment suitable for small and medium-scale farmers in dryland areas has been developed and to some extent adopted, though it is too early to expect a change in national production figures. Two sets of actions that need to be taken after the PACD are described:  (1) General areas that need attention, irrespective of the funding source, to ensure institutional sustainability include: equipment maintenance; linkages with the international scientific community; in-service training; and improved access to scientific information.  (2) Specific actions that should be supported by USAID after the PACD are, in order of declining priority:  completion of course work by Ph.D. students still in the United States; facilitation of continued linkages between Regional Research Center (CRRA) Settat staff and MIAC universities; a study on the development of a national agricultural science documentation service; additional work to identify problems and prioritize research; collaborative research on sustainability and natural resources management issues; an assessment of the impact of Center-developed technologies; collaborative research on integrated pest management; policy analyses; provision of stand-by electric power facilities; continued assistance in development of a research planning and monitoring system; and procurement of publications and compact disks for the Center's Technical Reference Center and the national documentation service. Lessons learned are divided into three parts:  (1) Positive elements of project design and execution include:  a long-term commitment for agricultural research and institution- building; involvement of U.S. universities in agricultural institution-building projects; thesis research conducted in the host country; and management training.  (2) Components that should have been done earlier in the project include: baseline studies on farming systems and socioeconomic indicators in the target region; program planning by objectives; human resources needs assessment based on program planning; and attention to post-PACD needs. (3) Actions that might have been done better include:  phasing of project to provide for an orderly end-of project transition, with less or no TA in the latter years; more on-farm research, with farmer feedback loops; integration of project activities with those of other donors; site selection of the Center; integration of project activities with those of the host center; and timing of equipment purchases.
