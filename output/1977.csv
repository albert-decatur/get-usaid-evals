"Evaluates project to develop a Government of Lesotho (GOL) nutrition planning (NP) capability.  Evaluation covers the period l975-77 and is based on interviews with GOL and contractor personnel. The project has not progressed as expected.  The GOL is reluctant to fully commit itself to NP (the need for which is obscured by prevailing traditional views of nutrition).  Despite the GOL's creation of a Food and Nutrition Coordinating Office (FNCO), jurisdiction over and responsibility for NP remains uncertain and poorly coordinated. This is evidenced by the exclusion of the Departments of Commerce and Industry, Finance, and Works and representatives of major food-related donors and PVO's from GOL planning bodies such as FNCO's ad hoc National Nutrition Advisory Group (NNAG). Moreover, the GOL does not view as a problem the nation's almost total dependence on the Republic of South Africa for employment (although return of migrant miners would require greater food production and dependence on foreign aid), imported food, and transportation. Since the GOL has designated no NNAG staff to interact with the contractor -- Planning Assistance, Inc. (PAI), little NP information has been passed on to the GOL. Nonetheless, PAI could have been more flexible in providing training and assistance outside the strict confines of the NNAG. The presence of two U.S. research teams collecting similar nutritional data was an added complication; the University of Colorado's Food Systems Study, while valuable, was not widely circulated; community participation was not promoted; and a Second National Nutrition Conference, while potentially useful, was not held. Before Phase II start-up, it is recommended that: (1) FNCO's responsibility for national NP and its relationship to NNAG and other GOL bodies be better defined; (2) the posts of FNCO Director and Deputy Director be made permanent; (3) GOL agencies and private groups now excluded be considered for membership in FNCO; (4) the PAI's role in nutrition and management consultancy and systems analysis be clarified; (5) evaluation standards be set for PAI and the project; and (6) a section on nutrition be included in the next 5-Year Plan.","Evaluation period: 1975-77","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","8/1/1977 12:00:00 AM","","Health policy|Sector planning|Nutrition|Workshops|Nutrition improvement|Health care planning|Nutrition research|Nutritional status|Food production","Lesotho","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAJ184.pdf","1,085 KB","000969 - Planning Assistance, Inc.","","","English","application/pdf","Evaluation team|Indepth evaluation|Onsite evaluation","","Parlato, Ronald|Fong, Sunny|Collins, Connie","","25 Aug 1977","","","","Lesotho food and nutrition planning and research assistance project : an evaluation","","PD-AAJ-184","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTUyNzYy","Lesotho","6320066"
"Evaluates project to derive new high-protein, low-fiber foods from coconuts in the Philippines.  Evaluation covers the period 3/75-4/77 and is based on site visits by an expert team. The Texas A&M Research Foundation (TAMRF) has performed satisfactorily -- i.e., new products have been developed, but evaluation of potential markets is incomplete.  The Philippine Government has provided strong support and is interested in continuing the project. Copra research was postponed by mutual agreement. A pilot plant is operating well and appears economically feasible. The aqueous coconut extraction process is producing high-quality oil and byproducts (four dried and four syrup) with commercial potential. However, there is a need for market evaluations, financial studies, and more detailed work on process design.  Philippine technicians were trained to operate the plant but require further assistance in research. Nonetheless, private companies' interest in utilizing the new protein products or in constructing additional plants is very low.  Moreover, despite the need for and the potential value of new sources of high-quality protein, these coconut products have not proven superior to traditional foods, and the local populace has a generally negative attitude toward coconuts. It is recommended that: (1) operation of the pilot plant be continued to provide a sufficient volume of products for market testing; (2) the TAMRF provide marketing and product application specialists to companies planning to test-market the new products; (3) the high-protein, low-fiber foods produced by using the aqueous process be compared to food grade copra and coconut flour in terms of market demand and production costs; (4) detailed studies of process and scale-up design be conducted after completion of the market study but before construction of a commercial plant; and (5) serious attention be given to promoting coconut flour, copra, and high-protein, low-fiber coconut products as part of the domestic Philippine food supply. A key lesson learned was that it is more efficient to determine the marketability of end products before operating a pilot plant.","Evaluation period: Mar 1975-Apr 1977","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","5/1/1977 12:00:00 AM","","Extraction|Coconuts|Plant protein|Marketing research|Food marketing|Technology transfer|Appropriate technology|Food preferences|Food processing technology|food industry|Pilot projects|Technical assistance","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAJ041.pdf","1,099 KB","","","","English","application/pdf","Evaluation team|Indepth evaluation|Onsite evaluation","","Kraemer, Herbert F.|Larrison, Vaughn|Wilcke, Harold L.","","31 May 1977","","","","Evaluation of the performance of the Texas A & M research foundation in fulfilling the conditions of contract AID/EA-C-1073 in the Philippines","","PD-AAJ-041","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTUzMTEy","Technical Assistance","9310522"

"EVALUATES PERFORMANCE OF THE INTERNATIONAL RICE RESEARCH INSTITUTE ON A PROJECT TO ADAPT, MANUFACTURE, MARKET AND SERVICE SMALL-SCALE RICE PRODUCTION EQUIPMENT IN SELECTED COUNTRIES (THAILAND AND PAKISTAN) UNTIL 4/77. EVALUATION WAS COMPILED THROUGH 2 OPINION SURVEYS -- OF FARMERS AND MANUFACTURERS, INTERVIEWS WITH IRRI STAFF IN THAILAND AND WITH HOST COUNTRY STAFF IN THE DEPT OF AGRICULTURE. IT IS NOTED THAT THE LIAISON BETWEEN IRRI STAFF AND THE THAI AGRICULTURAL ENGINEERING DEPARTMENT IS GOOD. IN ADDITION, THE PRESENCE OF IRRI STAFF HAS ENSURED THAT TESTS WERE COMPLETED AND REPORTS MADE. HOWEVER, SLOW RECRUITMENT OF THAI STAFF HAS RESTRICTED THE SCOPE AND EXTENT OF PROGRAM ACTIVITIES. SURVEY DETERMINED THAT ONLY 2 IRRI MACHINES HAVE BEEN ACCEPTED BY THAI FARMERS--THE POWER TILLER AND THE AXIAL BLOW THRESHER.  THE POWER TILLER HAS SOLD WELL AND HAS REACHED THE SMALL FARMER.  THE AXIAL THRESHER,HOWEVER, HAS BEEN PURCHASED ONLY BY WEALTHIER FARMERS. NEITHER OF THESE MACHINES HAVE BEEN PURCHASED BY THE POOREST FARMERS. IT IS NOTED FURTHER THAT CONCERN WITH IRRI DESIGNED MACHINES HAS LIMITED THE PROJECT. WHILE THERE ARE MANY LOCALLY DESIGNED MACHINES WHICH COULD BENEFIT FROM INDEPENDENT TESTING, LITTLE EFFORT HAS BEEN MADE TO DO SO BY THE AGRICULTURAL ENGINEERING DIVISION. THIS IS AN AREA WHERE THE IRRI COULD LEND SUPPORT. RECOMMENDATIONS INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING: 1)THE PROJECT SHOULD CONTINUE AND THE SECOND PHASE SHOULD BE IMPLEMENTED; 2)CONTINUITY FO THE WORK SHOULD BE INSURED AFTER IRRI WORK HAS BEEN COMPLETED; 3)MORE EFFORT SHOULD BE MADE TO INSURE RECRUITMENT OF ALL STAFF AND EQUIPMENT PROVIDED FOR IN THE CONTRACT; 4)SOCIO-ECONOMIC IMPACT STUDIES OF MECHANIZATION SHOULD BE INITIATED; 5)TESTING OF MACHINES AND ADVICE ON DESIGN AND MANUFACTURE SHOULD NOT BE RESTRICTED TO IRRI DESIGNED MACHINES; 6)CONSIDERATION SHOULD BE GIVEN TO OFFERING A SHORT TRAINING COURSE FOR THAI ENTREPRENEURS AND THEIR ENGINEERS; AND 7)A SMALL FARM MACHINERY WORKSHOP SHOULD BE CONDUCTED AT IRRI HEADQUARTERS.","Project title: International agricultural research centers (IARCs)","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/TA-C-1208","","1/1/1977 12:00:00 AM","","Rice|Agribusiness|Crop production equipment|Agricultural equipment|Axial blow threshers|Power tillers|Small farms|Farmers|Technical assistance|Beneficiary interviews","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAD301.pdf","874 KB","000672 - International Rice Research Institute (IRRI)","","","English","application/pdf","Onsite evaluation|Interim evaluation","","Cowell, P.

"A PROJECT: TO ASSIST WITH THE EVALUATION AND REDESIGN OF THE MALARIA CONTROL PROGRAM IN PAKISTAN. DURATION: 1961-1977. DEVELOPMENTS: THIS REPORT DESCRIBES THE BACKGROUND OF THE PROGRAM, THE MONIES USED, PROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED, SHORT TERM MEASURES, LONG TERM MEASURES, STAFFING, TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE, INTEGRATION, AND RECOMMENDATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS. THE MALARIA CONTROL PROGRAM BEGAN IN 1961 AND ORIGINALLY AIMED AT TOTAL ERADICATION OF MALARIA IN PAKISTAN BY 1975. THERE WAS OUTSTANDING SUCCESS FROM 1961-1967 BUT A RESURGENCE BECAME EVIDENT IN 1969. THE RESURGENCE WAS DUE TO INCREASING RESISTANCE BY THE VECTORS TO DDT, UNCHECKED URBAN MALARIA INFILTRATING BACK INTO MALARIA FREE AREAS, LACK OF ORGANIZATION IN THE PERMANENT HEALTH SERVICES, AND REDUCTION IN THE MALARIA ERADICATION PROGRAM BUDGET AND MANPOWER. BY 1973, TEN MILLION PEOPLE WERE INFECTED WITH MALARIA, A CONDITION WORSE THAN 1961 WHEN THE PROGRAM BEGAN. THE 1973 EPIDEMIC CAUSED THE GOVERNMENT OF PAKISTAN TO REVISE THE ORIGINAL 1961 PLAN. A.I.D. ASSISTANCE WAS REQUESTED IN FINANCING THE SUBSTANTIAL FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND LOCAL SUPPORT COSTS OF THE PROGRAM. THE SHORT TERM MEASURES FOR MALARIA CONTROL INCLUDE LARVICIDING, ADULTICIDING, MINOR ENGINEERING WORKS FOR SOURCE REDUCTION, CASE DETECTION AND TREATMENT, AND BIOLOGICAL CONTROL OF THE VECTORS. THE ULTIMATE SOLUTION OF THE MALARIA PROBLEM IS THE ELIMINATION OF THE CONDITIONS WHICH ARE CONDUCIVE TO THE GENERATION OF VECTOR BREEDING AREAS. SINCE 1976 THE PAKISTAN MALARIA CONTROL PROGRAM HAS SPRAYED OVER EIGHT MILLION HOUSES ANNUALLY AND PROTECTED AN ESTIMATED FORTY-SEVEN MILLION PEOPLE FROM MALARIA.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","AID/ASIA-C-1237","","1/1/1977 12:00:00 AM","","Malaria|Disease prevention and control|Urban areas|rural areas","Pakistan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAE788.pdf","459 KB","","","","English","application/pdf","","","Shurkin, Walter S.","Malaria","1977","","","","Malaria control project, evaluation and redesign of the project; final report","","PN-AAE-788","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTU5NDE1","Pakistan",""
"Presents two reports on the building material distribution program carried out by AID in Guatemala after the earthquake of February 4, 1976. In the first report, a background review provides information on the emergency itself and on the response by Guatemalan and International institutions. The evolution of AID's program is subsequently analyzed in terms of the approach AID chose to address specific problems. The program AID developed was based on the approach used by OXFAM/World Neighbors, and stressed participation by the beneficiaries. An alternative approach (which characterizes CARE and Red Cross programs) was rejected by AID because it depended on a highly centralized administration and offered relatively little opportunity for grass roots participation. The reasons for AID's choice of the participatory approach are discussed in detail. Also included in the first report are an interview with the director of CARE program and a chronological selection of public media articles concerning the disaster and the reconstruction effort. The second report evaluates the success of AID's program, taking into account the target population, materials used, the involvement of cooperatives, and local perceptions of the program. The report provides data on specific projects, materials, and costs.","Contents: A contrastive analysis of alternative reconstruction|models after the February, 1976 Guatemalan earthquake, with|principal reference to the USAID post-disaster housing program /|Robert Gersony, Tony Jackson, Jo Froman (Oct 1977) -- The US|AID/Guatemala Lamina and housing materials program : ex-post|evaluation report / Alan J.

"THIS REPORT EVALUATES THE USAID MULTIPLE CROPPING PROJECT BEING IMPLEMENTED THROUGH A GRANT TO THE CENTRO NACIONAL DE TECHNOLOGIA AGRICOLA (CENTA) IN THE FORM OF A CONTRACT WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA. A SECONDARY PURPOSE IS AN ANALYSIS OF CENTA PER SE, SINCE THIS HAS SO MANY IMPLICATIONS FOR THE PROJECT. CENTA WAS ESTABLISHED IN 1942 AND IS A CONVENTIONAL RESEARCH AND EXTENSION ORGANIZATION. IT EMPHASIZES BASIC GRAINS AND GENETICS AND RELIES HEAVILY ON MODERN INPUTS SUCH AS CREDIT, FERTILIZER, HERBICIDES, PESTICIDES AND CERTIFIED HYBRID SEED. OPERATING STYLE CONSISTS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF A COMMERCIAL TECHNOLOGY AND IN THE PERSUADING OF FARMERS TO ADAPT IT WITH WHATEVER MATERIAL ASSISTANCE THE PUBLIC SECTOR CAN PROVIDE. THE RESEARCH DIVISION IS DIVIDED INTO DEPARTMENTS INCLUDING AGRICULTURE, HOME ECONOMICS AND YOUTH WORK. MULTIPLE CROPPING (MC) HAS AN INTER-DISCIPLINARY GROUP ATTACHED TO IT, BUT PLACES ALMOST ALL OF ITS EMPHASIS ON CROPS AND CLOSELY RELATED DISCIPLINES. IT APPEARS THAT MC HAS NOT YET BEEN MADE RELEVANT TO SPECIFIC GROUPS OF SMALL FARMERS. THE MAJOR OBSTACLE IN MAKING MC RELEVANT IS THE STYLE OF OPERATION THAT EMPHASIZES COMMODITIES AND MODERN BIOLOGICAL AND CHEMICAL TECHNOLOGIES SURROUNDING THOSE COMMODITIES. INADEQUATE ATTENTION IS GIVEN TO THE FARMER AND TO ECONOMIC TECHNOLOGY AND PERHAPS OTHER SOCIAL FACTORS. SHORT-TERM ALTERNATIVES RECOMMENDED ARE: RE-DESIGNING THE PROJECT TO BETTER MEET THE NEEDS, CURRENT TECHNOLOGY AND RESOURCE ENDOWMENT OF THE FARMER AND FORMING A CENTER EXTENSION SERVICE WITHIN CENTA. IT IS ALSO NECESSARY TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM OF MATERIAL SUPPORT TO THE FIELD EXTENSION WORKERS AND TO FORM LINKAGES WITH THOSE ENTITIES THAT GRANT AUTHORITY AND ALLOCATE RESOURCES. A LONG TERM EXPANSION PLAN IS RECOMMENDED FOR CENTA, WITH SPECIAL ATTENTION GIVEN TO LIVESTOCK AND MANPOWER DEVELOPMENT.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1977 12:00:00 AM","","Cropping patterns|Multiple cropping|Agricultural research|Research organizations","El Salvador","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNRAB763.pdf","983 KB","000197 - USAID.

"EVALUATES PROGRESS OF THE LATIN AMERICAN AGRIBUSINESS DEVLPMNT CORP OF CENTRAL AMERICA (LAND-CA) AS OF 11/23/77. LAAD-CA RECEIVED A 2ND USAID LOAN TO BOLSTER ITS FINANCING OF CA AGRIBUSINESSES ENGAGED IN THE PROCESSING OF NON-TRADITIONAL AGRI PRODUCTS. THROUGH ITS LENDING ACTIVITIES LAAD-CA HAS SOUGHT TO IMPROVE THE ECONOMIC CONDITION OF SMALL FARMERS & OTHER RURAL INHABITANTS. SMALL FARMERS HAVE BEEN AIDED BY THE RAW MATERIAL PURCHASES OF THE INDUSTRIAL FOOD PROCESSERS. LANDLESS WORKERS HAVE BEEN ASSISTED THROUGH INCREASED EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES OFFERED BY FARMERS SEEKING TO EXPAND THEIR PRODUCTION AS WELL AS BY THE PROCESSING PLANTS. 3 EVALUATION TEAM MEMBERS VISITED LAAD-CA HDQTRS & INDIVIDUAL SUB-PROJE IN VARIOUS CA COUNTRIES. ONE TEAM MEMBER,A SOCIAL ANTHROPOLOGIST INTERVIEWED APPROX 100 SMALL FARMERS & ALSO PROVIDED AN IN-DEPTH SOCIOLOGICAL ANALYSIS OF 1 SUB-PROJ IN THE GUATEMALA HIGHLANDS. EVAL FINDINGS INDICATE THAT GREATER ECONOMIC IMPACT WAS GENERATED THRU RAW MATERIAL PURCHASES THAN THRU  EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES AT THE SOMEWHAT CAPITAL-INTENSIVE PROCESSING PLANTS. SMALL FARMERS BENEFITTED MOST WHEN THE PROCESSING PLANTS OFFERED CONTRACTS ASSURING THEM OF A MARKET FOR A SPECIFIC ACREAGE. PARTICIPATION WAS INCREASED WHEN THE PLANTS PROVIDED TRANSPORTATION FOR THE FARMER'S PRODUCTS. WITH REGARD TO TECH ASSIST,THE BEST UTILIZED WAS THAT PROVIDED BY REPRESENTATIVES OF THE PROCESSING PLANTS. THE ASSISTANCE PROVIDED BY BANK OF GOVT ADVISORS TENDED TO BE LESS PRODUCT-SPECIFIC & NOT AS READILY AVAILABLE. ALTHOUGH OVERALL THE LOAN SUB-PROJS DID NOT YET DEMONSTRATE SOLID VIABILITY, THEIR PROSPECTS APPEAR GOOD.

"THE EVALUATORS BELIEVE THAT THE INTERNATIONAL PROGRAM DIVISION (IPD) OF THE NATIONAL RURAL ELECTRIC COOPERATIVE ASSOCIATIN (NRECA) IS HIGHLY QUALIFIED AND PERHAPS WITHOUT EQUAL IN  THE FIELD OF ENCOURAGING GOVERNMENTS TO UNDERTAKE RURAL ELECTRIFICATION AND IN OFFERING TECHNICAL PLANNING AND TECHNICAL CONSULTING SERVICES AND TRAINING TO DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. THE EVALUATORS AGREE WITH IPD THAT COOPERATIVES ARE A PREFERRED METHOD OF DISTRIBUTING ELECTRICITY IN RURAL AREAS. A WELL-ORGANIZED COOPERATIVE CAN EXERT POWERFUL PRESSURES TO OBTAIN ELECTRIFICATION FOR ITS AREA AND IT CAN LEAD TO MORE EFFICIENT MANAGEMENT. IPD'S DECISION NOT TO INSIST ON OPERATING EXCLUSIVELY THROUGH COOPERATIVES IS QUITE PRACTICAL BECAUSE SOMETIMES SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC SITUATIONS ON THE NATIONAL LEVEL ARE NOT CONDUCIVE TO THE HEALTH OF COOPERATIVES. IN THESE CASES, RURAL ELECTRIFICATION THROUGH EITHER PRIVATE COMPANIES OR NATIONAL AUTHORITIES CAN BE PROMOTED. THE EVALUATORS MADE 14 RECOMMENDATIONS WHICH INCLUDE: (1)AID SHOULD CONTINUE TO FUND THE INTERNATIONAL PROGRAMS DIVISION OF NRECA TO CARRY OUT RURAL ELECTRIFICATION PROMOTION, TECHNICAL PLANNING AND TRAINING; (2)THE COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGES OF COOPERATIVES VERSUS OTHER ORGANIZATIONS SHOULD BE MORE THOROUGHLY STUDIED; AND (3)AID SHOULD SPECIFY THE IMPACT ASSESSMENT MODEL WHICH IT DESIRES NRECA TO ATTEMPT TO IMPLEMENT.","WORK ORDER NO. 19","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/OTR-C-1383","","1/1/1977 12:00:00 AM","","Electrification|Rural areas|Cooperatives|Electric power distribution","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAI792.pdf","4,493 KB","006727 - Development Alternatives, Inc.

"THE EVALUATORS DISCUSSED TYPES OF SOILS IN THE TROPICS AND THEIR DISTRIBUTION. SOILS OF THE TROPICS CAN MAKE A MAJOR AND SUSTAINED CONTRIBUTION TOWARD WORLD FOOD PRODUCTION WHEN THEY ARE WELL UNDERSTOOD AND ECONOMICALLY-REALISTIC MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS ARE APPLIED. THEY SUMMARIZED SOILS RESEARCH BY CORNELL, WHCIH HAD EFFECTIVELY COMBINED ON-CAMPUS AND TROPICAL FIELD RESEARCH ACTIVITIES. THEY SUMMARIZED THE PROGRAM AT NORTH CAROLINA STATE UNIVERSTIY WHICH COMBINES THE ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS OF SOILS-AGRONOMIC ECONOMIC RESEARCH, INCLUDING TRAINING AND INSTITUTION BUILDING AT THE COUNTRY LEVEL. THE NORTH CAROLINA PROGRAM IS ALSO FORMULATING UTILIZATION AND INFORMATION TRANSFER COCNCEPTS AND METHODS TO INVOLVE EXTENSION AN FARMING OPERATIONS. THE EVALUATORS REVIEWED THE CORNELL AND NORTH CAROLINA FIELD RESEARCH PROGRAM IN PUERTO RICO, BRAZIL, PERU, AND COLOMBIA. THEY MADE EVALUATIVE COMMENTS ON ELEVEN ASPECTS OF THE PROGRAM INCLUDING PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF TROPICAL SOILS, FERTILITY RESPONSE MEASUREMENT, CUMULATIVE AND RESIDUAL EFFECTS OF LIMING, AND AVAILABLE SOIL WATER. THEY ALSO DISCUSSED THE CURRENT AND FUTURE USE OF THE FINDINGS RESULTING FROM THE PROGRAM, AND FUTURE RESEARCH POSSIBILITIES. THEY MADE SEVEN RECOMMENDATIONS INCLUDING THAT: (1)RESEARCH AT THE FIELD LOCATIONS BE CONTINUED; (2)A REVIEW AND ASSESSMENT BE MADE OF THE NEED TO BROADEN AND STRENGTHEN THE PROGRAM BY MOUNTING A GREATER EFFORT ON LAND USE CLASSIFICATION AND SOILS PROBLEM SURVEY; AND (3)THE FARM SYSTEM CONCEPT BE BROUGH MORE TO THE FOREFRONT.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","2/1/1977 12:00:00 AM","","Tropical soils|SOIL RESEARCH|SOIL FERTILITY|SOIL MOISTURE|Soil management|Acid soils|Soil types|Technical assistance","","","","","","","English","","","","CATON, DOUGLAS D.|SPRAGUE, HOWARD B.|KELLEY, OMER","Soil sciences and research","22 Feb 1977","","","","UTILIZATION REVIEW AND EVALUATION; TROPICAL SOILS RESEARCH PROGRAM; CORNELL AND NORTH CAROLINA STATE UNIVERSITIES","","PN-AAE-057-A1","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc0NTA4","Technical Assistance","9310525|9311194"
"THE RESEARCH WORK SUPPORTED BY THE AID CONTRACT CHIEFLY CONCERNS THE ANTISCHISTOSOMAL ACTIVITY OF A SPECIFIC CHEMICAL SUBSTANCE, 4-ISOTHIOCYANATO-4-NITRODIPHENYLAMINE, WHICH IS DESIGNATED CGP4540 OR 4540. IT IS ESTABLISHED THAT 4540 EXERTS A POWERFUL SCHISTOSOMOCIDAL ACTION IN ANIMALS INFECTED WITH VARIOUS STRAINS OF S. MANSONI AND S. JAPONICUM. THE DRUG IS UNIQUE IN THAT IT IS EQUALLY EFFECTIVE AGAINST BOTH MANSONI AND JAPONICUM AND IN THAT IT PRODUCES A CURE RATE OF 100% AFTER A SINGLE ORAL DOSE. THE WORK BEING PERFORMED IS OF OBVIOUS HIGH QUALITY AND, FOR THE MOST PART, IS DIRECTED ALONG PRODUCTIVE AND NECESSARY LINES. IT IS RECOMMENDED, HOWEVER, THAT MORE EMPHASIS BE PLACED ON THE IDENTIFICATION OF THE ACTIVE FORM OF 4540 WITH A VIEW TOWARD THE POSSIBLE DEVELOPMENT OF A DRUG WHICH LACKS MUTAGENIC OR HEPATOTOXIC POTENTIAL. FROM THE AVAILABLE INFORMATION IT CAN BE SAFELY CONCLUDED THAT 4540 SHOWS SUFFICIENT PROMISE AS AN ANTISCHISTOSOMAL DRUG TO JUSTIFY THE UNDERTAKING OF LONG-TERM TOXICITY STUDIES TOGETHER WITH A SPECIFIC STUDY OF 4540 ON MAJOR BODY SYSTEMS. THE DRUG IS A POWER ANTISCHISTOSOMAL DRUG IN VIVO, IS EFFECTIVE AFTER A SINGLE ORAL DOSE, HAS AN ACCEPTABLE MARGIN OF SAFETY EVEN WITHOUT CONCOMITANT ADMINISTRATION OF AN ANTIBIOTIC DRUG, AND HAS VIRTUALLY NO TOXIC EFFECTS EVEN IN VERY LARGE DOSES WHEN GIVEN TOGETHER WITH AN ANTIBIOTIC DRUG. THUS, IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT LONG-TERM TOXICITY STUDIES BE STARTED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE IN NON-HUMAN PRIMATES AND IN RODENTS AND THAT SPECIFIC ANALYSIS OF ANY POSSIBLE EFFECTS OF 4540 ON THE CARDIO-VASCULAR AND CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEMS AND THE LIVER AND KIDNEY BE UNDERTAKEN SIMULTANEOUSLY.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","3/1/1977 12:00:00 AM","","Endemic diseases|Schistosomiasis|Disease research|Drug therapy|Disease prevention and control|Technical assistance","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAA487A1.pdf","185 KB","","","","English","application/pdf","","","CATTEN, MARION D.","","29 Mar 1977","","","","SITE VISIT RE DEVELOPMENT OF AN EFFECTIVE DRUG FOR THE TREATMENT OF HUMAN SCHISTOSOMIASIS (DRAFT MEMORANDUM)","","PD-AAA-487-A1","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc0NTA5","Technical Assistance","9310642"
"THIS SPECIAL EVALUATION CONSISTS OF TWO SHORT REPORTS WRITTEN IN FEBRUARY 1976 AND FEBRUARY 1977. IN THE FIRST REPORT, THE EVALUATORS WERE FAVORABLY IMPRESSED BY THE PROGRESS MADE TOWARD PUBLICATION OF THE THREE DIRECTORIES (A DIRECTORY OF RESEARCH WORKERS, A DIRECTORY OF RESEARCH INSTITUTIONS, AND A DIRECTORY OF RESEARCH PROGRAMS) PROJECTED WITHIN THE TWO-YEAR PERIOD UNDER CGIAR FUNDING,BUT THEY WERE DISCOURAGED WITH THE OUTLOOK OF SUPPORT FOR CARIS (CURRENT AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH INFORMATION SERVICE) WITHIN THE REGULAR FAO (FOOD AND AGRICULTURE ORGANIZATION) BUDGET. THEY CONCLUDED THAT FURTHER SUPPORT FOR CARIS SHOULD BE DEFERRED PENDING CLARIFICATION OF: (1)THE REQUIREMENTS TO COMPLETE THE DIRECTORIES AND INTENT OF FAO TO EMPLOY THE NEEDED CONSULTANTS; AND (2)THE POSITION OF FAO IN INCLUSION OF CARIS AS AN ACTIVITY IN THE REGULAR PROGRAM. ONE YEAR LATER, IN 1977, THE EVALUATOR FOUND THAT REASONABLY GOOD PROGRESS WAS BEING MADE TOWARD BRINGING OUT THE DIRECTORIES. HOWEVER, THE BUDGETARY POSITION FOR THE WORK LEADING TO AND INCLUDING PUBLICATION OF THE DIRECTORIES WAS NOT CLEAR. THE MAJOR PROBLEM WAS BELIEVED TO BE LACK OF CGIAR INTEREST IN THIS PROJECT. THE EVALUATOR CONSIDERED THE FAO BUDGET FOR CARIS FOR 1978/79 TO BE, AT BEST, BARELY ADEQUATE, AND HE STATED THAT THE FUTURE OF CARIS WAS UNCERTAIN AT THAT TIME.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","2/1/1977 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural research|Agriculture|Information services|Technical assistance","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAA482A1.pdf","296 KB","","","","English","application/pdf","","","BAIRD, GUY B.","Information management, systems and equipment","1 Feb 1977","","","","SPECIAL EVALUATION; CARIS-CURRENT AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH INFORMATION SERVICE","","PD-AAA-482-A1","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc0NTEz","Technical Assistance","9310974"
"THE GOALS OF THE INTERNATINAL EXECUTIVE SERVICE CORPS (IESC) ARE TWOFOLD: TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL AND MANAGERIAL ASSISTANCE TO THE OVERSEAS CLIENT FIRMS AND TO IMPROVE THE IMAGE OF US BUSINESS ABROAD. BY ALL OBJECTIVE MEASURES, THE IESC IS SUCCESSFUL IN ACHIEVING THESE GOALS. CLIENTS ARE USUALLY WELL PLEASED WITH THE RESULTS OF THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE VOLUNTEERS AND, BY EXTENSION, ARE FAVORABLY IMPRESSED WITH THE AMERICAN ENTERPRISE SYSTEM. THE PROJECTS ALSO CONTRIBUTE TO THE ECONOMIC AND INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE HOST COUNTRIES IN THE FORM OF INCREASED INCOME, EXPANDED TRADE, INCREASED GOVERNMENT REVENUE, AND/OR INCREASED EMPLOYMENT. THESE BROAD NATIONAL BENEFITS OCCUR IN THE FORM OF SPILLOVERS FROM THE INDIVIDUAL ENTERPRISE WHICH WAS ASSISTED BY IESC; THEY ARE DIFFICULT TO IDENTIFY WITH PRECISION AND IMPOSSIBLE TO QUANTIFY. IESC NOW HAS OFFICES IN 27 COUNTRIES. THE EVALUATORS SUGGEST USE OF A MORE RIGOROUS INTERNAL REVIEW PROCEDURE BY IESC, TO EVALUATE ON A CONTINUING BASIS THE JUSTIFICATION FOR ITS BEING IN SOME COUNTRIES AND NOT IN OTHERS. BECAUSE MOST INDIVIDUAL PROJECTS ARE SUCCESSFUL, AND BECAUSE VIRTUALLY ALL SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED PROJECTS WILL HAVE SOME DEVELOPMENTAL IMPACT, IESC SHOULD SEEK OUT PROJECT OPPORTUNITIES WHICH EITHER GIVE PROMISE OF EXTRAORDINARY IMPACTS OR WHICH OFFER BROAD ECONOMIC OR SOCIAL BENEFITS AS DIRECT BY-PRODUCTS OF THE PROJECT PURPOSES THEMSELVES. IN GENERAL, IESC HEADQUARTERS SHOULD IMPACT A MORE DISCIPLINED SENSE OF PROGRAM FORMULATION TO ITS COUNTRY DIRECTORS, THOUGH THEY MUST BE LEFT WITH THE  DISCRETION TO DEVISE SOUND PROGRAMS IN THEIR INDIVIDUAL COUNTRIES. THE EVALUATORS FOUND IESC TO BE ESSENTIALLY A CONSTRUCTIVE AND WORTHWHILE PROGRAM. IT ACHIEVES ITS GOALS IN THE LARGE MAJORITY OF INDIVIDUAL PROJECTS, AND IT DOES SO AT A COST WHICH IS GENERALLY REASONABLE.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","5/1/1977 12:00:00 AM","","Management|Problem solving|Technical assistance|Technology transfer","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAA491A1.pdf","5,659 KB","000833 - Robert R.

GENERALLY SPEAKING, COUNTRY SURVEYS HAVE BEEN CONDUCTED ACCORDING TO PLAN. THE WGS HAS SUCCEEDED IN RECRUITING A CAPABLE PROFESSIONAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE STAFF. THE MISSION SUGGESTS THAT, IN VIEW OF THE WORLD-WIDE IMPLICATIONS OF THESE SURVEYS, THE PARTICIPATION OF ADDITIONAL BILATERAL DONORS SHOULD BE ENCOURAGED. THE EVALUATORS RECOMMENDED THAT: (1)A DETERMINATION SHOULD BE MADE AS TO AN UPPER LIMIT ON THE TOTAL NUMBER OF COUNTRES TO BE INCLUDED IN THE WFS PROGRAM; AND (2)A SPECIAL STRATEGY BE PURSUED WITH RESPECT TO THE THREE KEY COUNTRIES: BRAZIL, INDIA, AND NIGERIA.

"FIFTY SUBGRANTS AND 13 IN-HOUSE PROJECTS WERE APPROVED BY AID UNDER AID/CSD-2897 BETWEEN OCTOBER 1973 AND DECEMBER 1975 MOST OF THE CONTRACT FUNDS WERE EXPENDED FOR INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT, INFORMATION PROGRAMS, FAMILY PLANNING, AND FELLOWSHIPS; UNIVERSITIES AND PROFESSIONAL ORGANIZATIONS HAVE BEEN THE PRINCIPAL BENEFICIARIES OF SUBGRANTS. ABOUT THREE-QUARTERS OF THE POPULATION COUNCIL OVERSEAS ACTIVITIES WERE CONCENTRATED IN COLOMBIA, NIGERIA, PERU AND ZAIRE, COUNCIL PROJECTS FUNDED BY AID ARE COMPETENTLY AND PROFESSIONALLY ADMINISTERED. THE CONTRACT HAS BEEN AN EFFECTIVE VEHICLE FOR PURSUING THE POPULATION/FAMILY PLANNING OBJECTIVES DEFINED IN THE AGREEMENT, TO WIT: INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION, GRADUATE FELLOWSHIPS, INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT SUPPORT, DEMOGRAPHIC STUDIES, FAMILY PLANNING DEMONSTRATION, RESEARCH AND EVALUATION, AND TRAINING. DESPITE THE CONTINUING RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE POPULATION COUNCIL AND AID, THERE HAS BEEN A SENSE OF MALAISE IN RECENT YEARS IN AID-POPULATION COUNCIL COLLABORATION. THIS DECLINE CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO COMPLETION BY THE COUNCIL OF SPECIFIC PROJECTS; AN OVERALL DECLINE IN AID POPULATION PROGRAM APPROPRIATIONS; AND THE DIFFERENT PRIORITIES IN THE TWO ORGANIZATIONS. WHEREAS AID ALLOCATED A MAJORITY OF ITS FUNDS TO FAMILY PLANNING SERVICES, THE GREATEST PROPORTION OF COUNCIL OBLIGATIONS WENT TO INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND INFORMATION SERVICES AND FELLOWSHIPS. THIS MATTER OF PRIORITIES, MORE THAN ANY OTHER, WILL DETERMINE THE CONTINUED DIRECTIONS AND LEVELS OF AID FUNDING FOR COUNCIL ACTIVITIES IN THE COMING YEARS. THE EVALUATORS DISCUSSED THE MISSION OF BOTH ORGANIZATIONS AND PROBLEMS IN POPULATION COUNCIL/AID RELATIONSHIPS AND DISCUSSED FIVE AREAS FOR EFFECTIVE FUTURE COLLABORATION: (1)POPULATION IN DEVELOPMENT PLANNING; (2)APPLIED RESEARCH AND EVALUATION; (3)INFORMATION AND EDUCATION; (4)TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE; AND (5)IMPLEMENTATION OF POPULATION COUNCIL PROJECTS.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/pha/C-1100","","1/1/1977 12:00:00 AM","","Family planning education|FAMILY PLANNING|Population programs|DEMOGRAPHY|Information storage and retrieval systems|Family planning research|Family planning occupations|Medical education","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAA508A1.pdf","626 KB","000262 - American Public Health Association","","","English","application/pdf","","","GELFAND, HENRY M.|PIOTROW, PHYLLIS T.","","16 Jan 1977","","","","CONSULTANT REPORT FOR THE EVALUATION OF POPULATION COUNCIL ACTIVITIES UNDER AID/CSD-2897, 1973-1975","","PD-AAA-508-A1","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc0NTI1","Population and Humanitarian Assistance","9320863"
"THERE WERE A TOTAL OF 29 LDC-BASED AND 11 NON-COUNTRY SPECIFIC, OR USA (UNIVERSITY SERVICES AGREEMENT) BASED, SUB-PROJECTS IN OPERATION DURING THE PERIOD COVERED BY THIS EVALUATION. THE EVALUATION TEAM MADE ON-SITE EVALUATIONS OF 12 OF THE LDC-BASED SUB-PROJECTS IN SEVEN COUNTRIES AND REVIEWED SIX OF THE 11 NON-COUNTRY AND USA-BASED SUB-PROJECTS. THE USA'S PROMOTE THE OBJECTIVES OF AID BY STRENGTHENING LDC POPULATION/FAMILY PLANNING EFFORTS THROUGH PROBLEM SOLVING RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OF INDIGENOUS RESEARCH CAPABILITY, AND THEY PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR THE FORMULATION OF LDC GOVERNMENT POLICES THAT IMPROVE POPULATION/FAMILY PLANNING EFFORTS. USA'S HAVE BEEN AN EFFECTIVE TOOL FOR ENLISTING BOTH THE PRIVATE SECTOR AND NON-POPULATION/FAMILY PLANNING PERSONNEL OF THE COLLABORATING COUNTRY'S GOVERNMENT INTO THE PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS. USA'S HAVE INCREASED SCIENTIFIC AND PUBLIC ATTENTION TO THE PROBLEM OF RAPID POPULATION GROWTH IN THE LDC'S. LDC INSTITUTIONS, WITH FEW EXCEPTIONS, ARE WILLING TO COOPERATE WITH USA INSTITUTIONS IN THE PLANNING AND EXECUTION OF SUB-PROJECTS. THE EVALUATORS MADE 11 RECOMMENDATIONS REGARDING IMPROVEMENT IN CURRENT USA'S. THEY ALSO MADE 9 RECOMMENDATIONS REGARDING FUTURE USE OF THE USA MECHANISM, INCLUDING THAT AID/W SHOULD CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THE BASIC CONCEPT OF MAINTAINING UNIVERSITY-BASED POPULATION COMPETENCE THROUGH THE USA MECHANISM.

"THE EVALUATION TEAM CONCLUDED THAT THE INTERNATIONAL PROGRAMS ASSOCIATION FOR VOLUNTARY STERILIZATION (IPAVS) HAS ACHIEVED REMARKABLE SUCCESS IN ACHIEVING THE OBJECTIVES SET BY AID OF EXPANDING THE ACCEPTANCE OF VOLUNTARY STERILIZATION AS A BASIC COMPONENT OF FAMILY PLANNING AND HEALTH SERVICE PROGRAMS THROUGHOUT THE DEVELOPING WORLD. THIS SUCCESS IS MEASURED THROUGH THE EVALUATIVE CRITERIA OF RELEVANCE, MANAGEMENT, INSTITUTIONALIZATION AND POLICY DEVELOPMENT. IPAVS' INPUT OF MONEY, EQUIPMENT, AND TECHNICAL ASSITANCE IS REFLECTED IN MEASURABLE PROGRAM OUTPUT, SUCH AS NUMBER OF PERSONNEL TRAINED, NUMBER OF STERILIZATION FACILITIES PROVIDED, NUMBER OF PROCEDURES PERFORMED AND INITIATION OF NATIONAL PROGRAMS. IPAVS ILLUSTRATES THAT A SINGLE-PURPOSE PROGRAM WITH WELL-DEFINED OBJECTIVES IS STILL NEEDED AND HAS A PLACE IN THE FAMILY PLANNING MOVEMENT. IT IS FULLY EXPECTED THAT IPAVS WILL CONTINUE TO PROVIDE OUTSTANDING LEADERSHIP IN THE AREA OF VOLUNTARY STERILIZATION AND IN THE EXPANSION OF SERVICES. THE EVALUATORS DISCUSSED AND MADE 46 RECOMMENDATIONS ON THE SEVEN MAJOR PROJECT ACTIVITIES, NAMELY: (1)INTERNATIONAL, REGIONAL, AND COUNTRY CONFERENCES; (2)SERVICE PROGRAMS; (3)PLANS AND POLICY DEVELOPMENT; (4)INFORMATION AND EDUCATION PROGRAM; (5) SPECIALIZED RESOURCE AND REFERENCE CAPABILITY; (6)NATIONAL ASSOCIATIONS FOR VOLUNTARY STERILIZATION (NAVS) AND THE WORLD FEDERATION OF ASSOCIATIONS FOR VOLUNTARY STERILIZATION (WFAVS); AND (7)TRAINING PROGRAMS.

FINAL FINDINGS INDICATE THAT THE DIALOGUES ARE GENERALLY WELL-ADMINISTERED AND PRODUCTIVE. MOST PARTICIPANTS HAVE FOUND THEM TO BE USEFUL AND INFORMATIVE. THERE TEND TO BE TWO TYPES OF PARTICIPANTS, WHOSE EXPECTATIONS, NEEDS, AND REACTIONS DIFFER. THOSE WHO WERE FAMILIAR WITH THE AREA OF FAMILY PLANNING WERE MORE INCLINED TO ANTICIPATE A FORUM WHICH WOULD BE CONDUCIVE TO AN EXCHANGE OF IDEAS. THEY PREFERRED FEWER LECTURES AND MORE INFORMAL SESSIONS. IN CONTRAST, THOSE WHO WERE NOT FAMILIAR WITH FAMILY PLANNING AS A PROFESSION EXPECTED TO BE INFORMED BY THE DIALOGUES. THEY PREFERRED A FORMAL STRUCTURE WITH MORE LECTURES. THIS DICHOTOMY APPEARS TO BE RECOGNIZED BY THE AIDC AND AID. ALONG WITH THE TREND TOWARD MORE TECHNICAL/MEDICAL AND COUNTRY-SPECIFIC/PROBLEM-SPECIFIC CONFERENCES, WHICH HAVE DICTATED INVITING PARTICIPANTS MORE ACTIVELY INVOLVED WITH FAMILY PLANNING, THERE HAS BEEN EVIDENCE OF A TREND TOWARD MORE TIME SCHEDULED FOR DISCUSSION AND EXCHANGE OF IDEAS. TRENDS TOWARD MORE TECHNICAL/MEDICAL AND COUNTRY-SPECIFIC/PROBLEM-SPECIFIC CONFERENCES, THE EMPLOYMENT OF POPULATION EXPERTS, THE PROVISION OF BRIEFING MATERIALS, THE SCHEDULING OF MORE INFORMAL DISCUSSION TIME, THE IDENTIFICATION OF HUMAN AND MATERIAL RESOURCES IN FAMILY PLANNING, AND THE PROVISION OF MORE COMPLETE FOLLOW-UP SHOULD BE CONTINUED AND PERHAPS EVEN EXTENDED. THE EVALUATORS MADE 30 RECOMMENDATIONS ABOUT THE DIALOGUES.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","3/1/1977 12:00:00 AM","","FAMILY PLANNING|Family planning occupations|Medical education|Conferences","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAA518A1.pdf","3,760 KB","000709 - Juarez and Associates, Inc.","","","English","application/pdf","","","","","30 Mar 1977","","","","EVALUATION OF THE INTER-AMERICAN DIALOGUE CENTER; A FINAL REPORT","","PD-AAA-518-A1","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc0NTMx","Population and Humanitarian Assistance","9320985"
"THE PROJECT HAS BEEN CONTRIBUTING MOST SIGNIFICANTLY TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE CAPABILITY OF THE PROVINCES TO PLAN PROGRAMS, TO MANAGE THEIR RESOURCES MORE EFFECTIVELY AND IMPLEMENT AN INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAM PARTICULARLY FOR ROADS AND BRIDGES. PROVINCES, PARTICULARLY THOSE WHICH HAVE BEEN IN THE PROGRAM FOR A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME, ARE PLANNING A MORE IMPORTANT ROLE IN INFLUENCING DEVELOPMENT, NOT ONLY WITH THEIR OWN RESOURCES, BUT WITH THOSE OF OTHER GOVERNMENTAL INSTITUTIONS. THE ORGANIZATION, PHILOSOPHY, PROGRAMS, SYSTEMS AND PROCEDURES DEVELOPED UNDER THE PROVINCIAL DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE PROJECT (PDAP) ARE REPLICABLE FOR USE IN MOST OTHER PROVINCES IN THE COUNTRY. THIS HAS BEEN DONE TO SOME DEGREE ALREADY. THE EVALUATORS RECOMMEND THAT, AFTER THE PROJECT IS TERMINATED, USAID CONSIDER ASSIGNING ONE ADVISOR TO WORK WITH PDAP AND THE PROVINCES TO ASSURE THAT CURRENT PLANNING AND INFRASTRUCTURE ACTIVITY DOES NOT REGRESS. THERE WILL BE A CONTINUING NEED FOR CENTRAL GOVERNMENT LEADERSHIP AND GUIDANCE TO THE PROVINCES; IT IS BELIEVED THE CURRENT PDAP ORGANIZATION SHOULD BE KEPT INTACT FOR THIS PURPOSE. THE MAJOR PROBLEM CONFRONTING THE PROVINCES IS THE LIMITATION OF FINANCIAL RESOURCES AVAILABLE FOR DEVELOPMENT PURPOSES. FINANCIAL RESOURCES EXTERNAL TO THE PROVINCES WILL BE REQUIRED IF THE PROVINCES ARE TO PROGRESS BEYOND THE SOMEWHAT LIMITED ROAD AND BRIDGE PROJECTS. CREATION OF AN INSTITUTION TO PROVIDE LOANS TO THE PROVINCES AND CITIES IS STRONGLY ADVOCATED BY THE TEAM. IT IS SUGGESTED THAT THE PRESENT APPROACH TO ECONOMIC FEASIBILITY ANALYSIS BE UPGRADED TO AN APPROACH USING ECONOMIC SHADOW PRICES AND INCLUDING DISTRIBUTIONAL WEIGHTING OF INCOMES AND CONSUMPTION. THIS APPROACH WOULD ENHANCE THE ECONOMIC FEASIBILITY AND PRIORITY OF PROJECTS AIMED AT BENEFITING THE RURAL POOR AND ENSURE THAT THE RESULTS OF THE FEASIBILITY ANALYSIS ARE CONSISTENT WITH NATIONAL AND PROVINCIAL OBJECTIVES ON INCOME DISTRIBUTION.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","5/1/1977 12:00:00 AM","","Planning|Provinces|Government departments|Bridge construction|Feasibility studies|Public administration|Road construction|Rural development|Poverty|Sector planning|TAXATION|Government policy|Economic planning","Philippines","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAA417A1.pdf","1,823 KB","008592 - USAID.

"THE AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT WAS INTENDED TO STRENGTHEN AND IMPROVE THE TANZANIA RURAL DEVELOPMENT BANK (TRDB) AS A RURAL CREDIT INSTITUTION. THE PROJECT'S PURPOSES ARE: (1) STRENGTHENING AND IMPROVEMENT OF THE TRDB AS A RURAL CREDIT INSTITUTION; AND (2)INCREASE FOOD CROP PRODUCTION AND SMALL FARMER INCOME THROUGH DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF A TRDB SMALL FARMER FOOD CROP PRODUCTION PROGRAM. THE TRDB IS A BASICALLY SOUND FINANCIAL INSTITUTION WITH CAPABLE MANAGEMENT. THERE ARE, HOWEVER, FUNCTIONS OF THE TRDB THAT ITS MANAGEMENT WILL WANT TO STRENGTHEN IN ORDER TO EXPAND TO MEET THE GROWING DEMAND FOR AGRICULTURAL CREDIT. THE TRDB HAS THE POTENTIAL TO MEET THE CHALLENGES RELATED TO GROWTH AND IS A VIABLE INSTITUTION CAPABLE OF ADMIINSTERING A PROGRAM SUCH AS THE SMALL FARMER CROP LOAN PROGRAM. IN ADDITION TO THE QUALIFICATIONS OF THE TRDB, OTHER FACTORS ARE FAVORABLE FOR AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROGRAMS. AN IN-DEPTH ANALYSIS OF THE SMALL FARMER CROP LOAN PROGRAM INDICATES IT IS ADMINISTERED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PURPOSES AND OBJECTIVES OF THE PROGRAM. IT GOT OFF TO A SLOW START AND, THEREFORE, IT IS PREMATURE TO FORECAST SUBSEQUENT PERFORMANCE. THE EVALUATORS DISCUSSED THE PERFORMANCE OF THE CONTRACTOR, THE CONTRACT FIELD TEAM, USAID, TRDB, THE GOVERNMENT OF TANZANIA, AND OTHER DONORS. THEY ALSO DISCUSSED OTHER FACTORS SUCH AS FINANCIAL POSITION, EFFICIENCY, PERSONNEL COMPETENCY, TRAINING PROGRAMS, LEGISLATIVE REQUIREMENTS, AND THE LOGICAL FRAMEWORK, AND MADE RECOMMENDATIONS THROUGHOUT THE TEXT OF THE EVALUATION ON MANY MATTERS.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","6/1/1977 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural credit|DEBT REPAYMENT|CREDIT|Small farms|Farmers|Credit cooperatives|Short term credit|Agricultural development banks|Interest rates","Tanzania","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAA535A1.pdf","1,781 KB","","","","English","application/pdf","","","SCHROEPFER, EUGENE|KELLOND, JAMES K.","","17 Jun 1977","","","","EVALUATION TEAM REPORT ON AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT NO. 621-11-140-117; TANZANIA","","PD-AAA-535-A1","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc0NTQw","Tanzania","6210117"
"THE UNIVERSITY CENTER FOR HEALTH SCIENCES (CUSS) DESIGN FOR TRAINING AND RESEARCH IN PREVENTIVE MATERNAL-CHILD HEALTH (MCH) IS WORKING REASONABLY WELL AND IS TURNING OUT GRADUATE PHYSICIANS PREPARED TO COPE WITH AFRICAN HEALTH NEEDS. TRAINING OF NURSES IS PRIMARILY IN ADMINISTRATION AND SUPERVISION. TRAINING IN PARA-MEDICAL SUBJECTS HAS BEEN NEGLECTED AND IS JUST BEGINNING TO ENROLL STUDENTS AND TURN OUT GRADUATES. HARVARD-RECRUITED TECHNICIANS HAVE PLAYED A CATALYTIC ROLE AND HAVE ASSISTED CUSS TO REDUCE TIME OF MATURATION BY YEARS IN TRAINING, RESEARCH AND MCH DELIVERY SERVICE.THE ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT OF OUTPATIENT CLINICS HAVE PROVIDED A WORKING LABORATORY FOR TRAINING IN PREVENTIVE MCH. THE CHILD SPACING CLINIC HAS SUPPORTED THE ENERGING LIBERALIZATION OF GOVERNMENT POLICY TOWARD PREVENTIVE FAMILY PLANNING. FAILURE TO COMPLETE THE HOSPITAL, TO FULLY IMPLEMENT A TEAM APPROACH, AND TO CONDUCT EVALUATION FOR FEEDBACK WERE OUTPUTS WHICH DID NOT SUPPORT THE ORIGINAL TIMETABLE. OTHER PURPOSE INDICATORS -- TRAINED MEDICAL GRADUATES, RESEARCH REPORTS, AND IMPROVED ATTITUDES TOWARD CHILD SPACING -- WERE TARGETS WHICH ARE ON SCHEDULE. GRADUATES ARE BEING POSTED TO RURAL POSTS AND A SYSTEM OF ROTATION SPEAKS WELL FOR SUBGOAL ACHIEVEMENTS. BECAUSE OF THE ESTABLISHMENT OF OTHER AFRICAN COUNTRY MEDICAL CENTERS SINCE THE INCEPTION OF CUSS, IT IS NOT THE REGIONAL TRAINING CENTER IT WAS PLANNED TO BE. THE HARVARD TEAM HAS HAD AN UNMISTAKABLY BENEFICIAL EFFECT ON THE GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT OF MCH TRAINING, RESEARCH, AND SERVICE WITHIN CUSS. THE EVALUATORS RECOMMENDED THAT THE PROJECT BE CONTINUED.

"BASED ON THE EVALUATION TEAM'S ON-SITE REVIEW, THE FINANCIAL AND COMPARATIVE COST ANALYSIS, AND THE OPINIONS OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT EXPERTS LOCATED IN THE PROJECT AREA, THE CARE RURAL PENETRATION ROADS PROJECT HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN CONSTRUCTING FEEDER ROADS COMPLEMENTING RURAL DEVELOPMENT SCHEMES IN THE EASTERN AREA OF SIERRA LEONE. THE RURAL PENETRATION ROADS CONSTRUCTED HAVE SUCCEEDED IN PROVIDING FARMER ACCESS TO THE AGRICULTURAL INPUTS AND EXTENSION SERVICES UNDER THE INTEGRATED AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT. THE ORIGINAL THREE-YEAR TARGETS OF CONSTRUCTING 900 MILES OF RURAL PENETRATION ROADS, 120 BRIDGES, AND 7,425 CULVERTS AT A TOTAL COST OF $4 MILLION WERE UNREALISTIC. BY JUNE 30, 1977, CARE EXPECTS TO HAVE COMPLETED A TOTAL OF 224 MILES OF FEEDER ROADS, BRIDGES AND BOX CULVERTS AND 672 PIPE CULVERTS. BASED ON CALCULATIONS OF ACTUAL IN-KIND AND CASH CONTRIBUTIONS FROM ALL SOURCES FOR FY 1976, THE COST IS AN ESTIMATED $12,000 PER MILE. THIS IS SUBSTANTIALLY LOWER THAN ANY PENETRATION ROADS UNDER CONSTRUCTION IN AFRICA. THERE ARE SEVERAL UNIQUE FEATURES OF PROJECT WHICH MAY LIMIT REPLICABILITY OF THE LOW-COST APPROACH IN OTHER WEST AFRICAN COUNTRIES. CARE IS DESIGNING, CONSTRUCTING AND/OR REHABILITATING ROADS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE MINISTRY OF WORK STANDARDS AND SPECIFICATIONS FOR CLASS IV ROADS, THE EVALUATORS MADE TWO PRINCIPAL RECOMMENDATIONS: (1)THAT THE SECOND TRANCHE OF THE GRANT BE MADE AVAILABLE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE; AND (2)THAT AID SHOULD CONSIDER AN EXTENSION AND/OR EXPANSION OF SUPPORT TO THE PROJECT WITH SPECIAL ATTENTION GIVEN TO THE FOLLOWING MATTERS: USAID-FINANCED PROCUREMENT, GOVERNMENT OF SIERRA LEONE CONTRIBUTIONS, BRIDGES, EVALUATION AND THE AID PROJECT MANAGER.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","3/1/1977 12:00:00 AM","","Roads|Penetration roads|Transportation system design|Road construction","Sierra Leone","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAA524A1.pdf","1,213 KB","","","","English","application/pdf","","","RAMP, RUDY|GALLAGHER, LES|GUIOT, HOWARD","","1 Mar 1977","","","","CARE/SIERRA LEONE RURAL PENETRATION ROADS; GRANT NO AID/AFR-G-1154; EVALUATION","","PD-AAA-524-A1","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc0NTQ2","Sierra Leone","6360126"
"THE BASIC LOAN OBJECTIVE WAS TO BE RESPONSIVE TO THE UNITED NATIONS CALL FOR DONORS TO PROVIDE ZAMBIA WITH HELP IN MEETING THE COSTS OF THE 1973 BORDER CLOSING WITH RHODESIA. A SECONDARY OBJECTIVE WAS TO PROVIDE OVERALL SUPPORT TO THE ZAMBIAN ECONOMY WHICH HAD BEEN EXPERIENCING DECLINING GDP. AS A QUICK POLITICAL ACTION, THE LOAN WAS A SUCCESS. WHEN THE LOAN WAS PROPOSED, ZAMBIA WAS DESPERATE FOR FOREIGN EXCHANGE. BY THE TIME THE GOVERNMENT OF ZAMBIA GOT ORGANIZED AND COULD SPEND IT, THERE WAS MUCH LESS NEED FOR THE MONEY. THE LOAN DID NOT ACHIEVE ITS ORIGINAL OBJECTIVE OF RAPID DISBURSEMENTS. THE LOAN PAPER ANTICIPATED THAT ALL DISBURSEMENTS WOULD BE COMPLETED BY THE END OF 1974. ACTUAL DISBURSEMENT LAGGED MUCH BEHIND THIS TARGET. THE LOAN TERMINAL DISBURSEMENT DATE WAS 3/31/76. A FINAL EVALUATION CONCERN IS THE SUITABILITY AND APPROPRIATENESS OF THE COMMODITIES FINANCED. THE LOAN WAS DESIGNED TO MEET A TRANSPORT EMERGENCY. ALL OF THE ITMES FINANCED WERE DIRECTLY RELATED TO ZAMBIA'S TRANSPORT NEEDS. THE EVALUATORS SUMMARIZED THE HISTORY OF THE LOAN IMPLEMENTATON  AND DISCUSSED A REPORT ABOUT THE LOAN ISSUED NOVERMBER 28, 1975, BY THE INSPECTOR GENERAL OF FOREIGN ASSISTANCE QUESTIONING WHETHER AID SHOULD HAVE FINANCED EXPORT-IMPORT BANK TYPE COMMODITIES AND WHETHER LOAN FINANCED DRIVER TRAINING SIMULATORS CONTAINED INELIGIBLE COMPONENTS.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","6/1/1977 12:00:00 AM","","Internal conflict|Locomotives|Cargo|Transportation|Cranes (machinery)","Zambia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAT476.pdf","566 KB","","","","English","application/pdf","","","LEWIS, JOHN|LIEBERSON, Joseph M.","","1 Jun 1977","","","","SPECIAL EVALUATION REPORT; ZAMBIA PROGRAM LOAN 690-H-004","","PD-AAT-476","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc0NTQ5","Southern Africa Regional","6909801"
"THE AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK (AFDB) IS A TRULY AFRICAN BANK RESPONDING TO AFRICAN PERCEPTIONS, PROBLEMS, AND NEEDS. AT THE END OF 1976, THE TOTAL STAFF NUMBERED 322 FROM 28 COUNTRIES AND THE AFDB HAD MADE A TOTAL OF 120 LOANS TO 33 MEMBER COUNTRIES FOR A CUMULATIVE SUM OF 344 MILLION UNITS OF ACCOUNT. THE AFDB IS SERIOUSLY UNDERSTAFFED AND THIS HAS BEEN THE CASE SINCE ITS INCEPTION. AT THE END OF 1976, THERE WERE 14 EXPATRIATES ASSIGNED FULL-TIME TO THE AFDB BUT BUDGETED BY THEIR HOME COUNTRY OF AGENCY. THE EXPATRIATES EXTEND THE AFDB'S OWN STAFF AND ITS ADMINISTRATIVE BUDGET; THEY DO NOT HAVE MANAGERIAL ROLES. THE AFDB'S TRAINING EFFORTS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN MINIMAL DUE TO HIGH TRAINING COSTS AND ITS UNDERSTAFFING PROBLEMS. THE MAIN THRUST OF AID'S PROGRAM WITH THE AFDB HAS BEEN IN THE SO-CALLED REGULAR GRANTS. WORKING RELATIONS WITH AID HAVE BEEN GOOD. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 1976, THE $6,085,000 GRANTED TO THE AFDB FOR THE REGULAR PROGRAM SINCE 1968 HAD RESULTED IN 44,669,021 OF APPROVED EXPENDITURES FOR 17 STUDIES IN 15 COUNTRIES. THE REMAINING $1,415,978 HAS BEEN ALLOCATED BY THE AFDB FOR US EXPERTS, TRAINING, AND THREE MORE STUDIES. THE EVALUATOR DISCUSSED THE IMPACT OF AID'S NEW SECTORAL LIMITATIONS ON ITS REGULAR GRANTS; ON FINANCIAL PLANNING AT THE AFDB; AND THEIR IMPACT ON THE DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS OF AFRICAN NATIONS. HE DISCUSSED THE SPECIAL SAHEL GRANT AND OBSERVED THAT THE PROJECT HAS BEEN REPORTED MOVING FORWARD RATHER WELL IN RECENT MONTHS. IT IS TOO EARLY IN THE SPECIAL LANDSAT GRANT TO MAKE ANY EVALUATIVE COMMENTS. THE EVALUATOR MADE 15 RECOMMENDATIONS REGARDING: (1)THE AFDB'S INTERNAL ORGANIZATION AND POLICIES; (2)AID POLICIES AND PROCEDURES VIS-A-VIS THE AFDB AND AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT; (3)THE AFDB'S ROLE IN AFRICAN SELF-DEVELOPMENT; (4)THE LANDSAT STUDY; (5)THE AFDB'S ROLE IN BASIC RESEARCH; AND (6)FUTURE EVALUATIONS OF THE AFDB.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","3/1/1977 12:00:00 AM","","Institution building|Feasibility studies|Agricultural development banks|Industrial development banks","Africa","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAA577A1.pdf","143 KB","","","","English","application/pdf","","","LANDFIELD, SHERWIN","","1 Mar 1977","","","","EVALUATION REPORT; THE AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK AND ITS AID GRANTS","","PD-AAA-577-A1","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc0NTUw","Africa Regional","6980127|6250909|6980416"
"THE EVALUATORS CONCLUDED THAT CONSIDERABLE PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE AFRICAN COOPERATIVE SAVING AND CREDIT ASSOCIATION (ACOSCA) BECAUSE OF AID AND OTHER DONOR TECHNICAL AND FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE,AND THAT IT HAS BECOME A BETTER MANAGED AND MORE EFFECTIVE ORGANIZATION WITH IMPROVED ACCOUNTING AND BUDGETING, TRAINING PROGRAMS THAT ARE WELL PLANNED AND PRESENTED, PROMOTIONAL AND EXTENSION SERVICES PROVIDED MEMBER LEAGUES, AND WITH ACTIVITIES BASED ON A FIVE-YEAR PLAN. ACOSCA HAD MADE NO PROGRESS TOWARD ECONOMIC SELF-SUFFICIENCY AND THE EVALUATORS CONSIDER THIS AN UNREALISTIC OBJECTIVE AT THIS TIME. WITH REGARD TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF NATIONAL CREDIT UNION ASSOCIATIONS (LEAGUES), THE EVALUATORS CONCLUDED THAT LITTLE PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE IN THE PILOT COUNTRIES IN EITHER ECONOMIC OR TECHNICAL SELF-SUFFICIENCY. IN BOTH CAMEROON AND LESOTHO, THE NATIONAL LEAGUES HAVE INSUFFICIENT INCOME TO MEET EXPENSES, ARE DEPENDENT UPON DONOR FINANCIAL SUPPORT, PROVIDE MINIMAL SERVICES TO THEIR MEMBER CREDIT UNIONS, AND DO NOT HAVE DEVELOPMENT PLANS WHICH WOULD LEAD TO ECONOMIC AND TECHNICAL SELF-SUFFIENCY. THE EVALUATORS CONCLUDED THAT LIMITED BUT SATISFACTORY PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE IN DEVELOPING DIRECTED AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION CREDIT (DAPC) PROGRAMS IN CAMEROON AND LESOTHO. IN EACH COUNTRY, THREE PILOT CREDIT UNIONS HAVE DAPC PROGRAMS IN OPERATION, PILOT UNION OFFICERS AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS HAVE BEEN TRAINED IN PRODUCTION CREDIT PRINCIPLES AND PROCEDURES, POTENTIAL BORROWERS HAVE BEEN TRAINED IN THE PRINCIPLES OF PRODUCTION CREDIT, AND LOANS ARE BEING MADE AND COLLECTED. GENERALLY, COLLECTIONS HAVE BEEN GOOD AND DELINQUENCIES LOW. THE EVALUATORS RECOMMENDED THAT THIS PROJECT BE REVISED AND CONTINUED,PROVIDED THAT THE LEAGUES MEET CERTAIN CONDITIONS PRECEDENT. THEY MADE SEVERAL OTHER PROJECT-SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","6/1/1977 12:00:00 AM","","CREDIT|Agricultural credit|Credit unions|Small farms|Farmers|Financial institutions|Savings and loan associations|DEBT REPAYMENT|Short term credit","Africa south of Sahara","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAA591A1.pdf","19,839 KB","000013 - USAID.

AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION HAS INCREASED, AND EXPORTS OF AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS, ESPECIALLY TEA AND COFFEE ARE AT HIGH LEVELS, IMPROVING THE FARMERS' AND BANK 'S LIQUIDITY POSITION. THE AFC HAS A BASE STAFF AND BRANCH OFFICES FOR AN EXPANDED CREDIT PROGRAM. APPROX 70% OF AFC LOANS BY NUMBER AND 30% BY AMOUNT ARE CURRENTLY EXTENDED TO SMALL FARMERS AS DEFINED BY AFC. EVALUATOR CONTENDS THAT AFC'S OPERATIONAL DIFFICULTIES,AS OUTLINED IN A JUNE 1977 MANAGEMENT STUDY, STEM FROM RAPID GROWTH IN LENDING TO SMALL FARMERS WITHOUT ADEQUATE PROGRAMS FOR FARMER CREDIT EDUCATION, LOAN APPROVAL PROCEDURES, LOAN SUPERVISION AND CREDIT REVIEW FUNCTIONS. EVALUATOR RECOMMENDS AUGMENTING MANAGEMENT STAFF WITH A DEPUTY GENERAL MANAGER, AN ASSISTANT FOR ADMINISTRATION, AND ADDITIONAL COORDINATING OF AREA MANAGER. CONTINUED SUPPORT OF AFC AT THE PRESENT LEVEL IS RECOMMENDED, WITH PARTICIPANT TRAINING DIRECTED TOWARD ACCOUNTING, AUDITING, PERSONNEL, RESEARCH AND PLANNING, AND MANAGEMENT. EVALUATOR RECOMMENDS THAT AFC EMPHASIZE CREDIT TO THE COMMERCIAL SECTOR OF AGRICULTURE ON A COLLATERAL BASIS. SMALL FARMER CREDIT COULD BE PROVIDED UNDER CLOSE SUPERVISION, WITHIN THE STRUCTURE OF KENYAN AGRICULTURAL COOPERATIVES. AN INFORMAL MERGING OF THE SMALLHOLDER PRODUCTION SERVICES AND CREDIT PROJECT AND THE INTEGRATED AGRICULTURE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT WOULD COMBINE THE SKILLS OF ADVISORS PRESENTLY INVOLVED IN THESE PROGRAMS.

TETTIT, WORLD EDUCATION CONSULTANT SINCE THE INCEPTION OF THE INTEGRATED FAMILY LIFE EDUCATION PROJECT (IFLE) THE PROGRAM HAS MATURED INTO A SERIOUS DEVELOPMENT EFFORT WITH MANY SUPPORTERS IN AND OUT OF GOVERNMENT. THE REASON FOR THE PROGRAM'S WIDESPREAD ACCEPTANCE IS THE APPARENT SUCCESS OF ITS INTEGRATED APPROACH AND THE MANY GRADUATES WHOSE LIVES HAVE BEEN CHANGED SINCE THEY BEGAN TO PARTICIPATE IN IFLE CLASSES AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES. THIS UNIQUE PROGRAM HAS REACHED OUT TO PEOPLE WHO SAW THEMSELVES AS PASSED OVER; MANY OF THE PARTICIPANTS BELIEVED THAT EDUCATION WAS FOR THE YOUNG. IT IS APPARENT TO THE EVALUATOR THAT THE APPROACH USED BY THE IFLE ORGANIZATION IS PROVIDING PEOPLE WITH A LEARNING ENVIRONMENT WHERE THEY CAN DEVELOP SKILLS AND ATTITUDES THAT ENABLE THEM TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF THEIR OWN LIVES, AND CONTRIBUTE TO THE NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT EFFORT OF THE ETHIOPIAN GOVERNMENT. THE EVALUATION CONTAINS A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE EVALUATION METHODOLOGY AND PROVIDES DESCRIPTIVE MATERIALS ABOUT PROJECT MATERIALS, TEACHING METHODS, GROUP LEADERS, AND THE ON-GOING MEASUREMENT AND EVALUATION SYSTEM. THE PROJECT WAS DESIGNED TO DEMONSTRATE THAT AN INTEGRATED APPROACH TO HEALTH, NUTRITION, AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES, FAMILY GUIDANCE AND CIVICS IS THE BEST WAY TO FOSTER SELF-RELIANCE AMONG PROGRAM PARTICIPANTS. THE GREATER PART OF THE EVALUATION IS AN ATTEMPT TO DESCRIBE STATISTICALLY AND QUALITATIVELY HOW THE CENTRAL CONCEPTS IN EACH OF THESE AREAS HAS MADE AN IMPACT ON THE LIVES OF PROGRAM PARTICIPANTS. THE RESULTS OF THE CLASSES CLEARLY INDICATE THAT ILLITERATE PARTICIPANTS LEARNED TO COPE WITH THEIR IMMEDIATE DILEMMAS. WHILE IFLE IS NOT A PANACEA FOR ETHIOPIA'S DEVELOPMENT PROBLEMS, IT IS FAIR TO SAY THAT THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE TAKEN THE IFLE COURSES ARE FAR BETTER PREPARED TO COPE; AND THE CHANCES OF THEIR NUMBERS BECOMING A PART OF ETHIOPIA'S STATISTICS ON POVERTY AND INFANT DEATH IS DEFINITELY LESS.","Evaluation period: 1 Jan 1977-12 Feb 1977","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","2/1/1977 12:00:00 AM","","Basic education|Family relationships|Nonformal education|Adult education","Ethiopia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAA572A1.pdf","17,657 KB","001295 - World Education, Inc.","","","English","application/pdf","","","PETTIT, JOHN J.","","12 Feb 1977","","","","INTEGRATED FAMILY LIFE EDUCATION PROJECT (OPG TO WORLD EDUCATION INC) AN INTERNAL WEI EVALUATION","","PD-AAA-572-A1","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc0ODU1","Ethiopia","6630180"

"EVALUATION OF THE POPULATION/ECONOMIC GROWTH PROJECT; FINAL REPORT, BY PCI, NOVEMBER 18, 1977 (932-11-570-516) THIS EVALUATION WAS ORIENTED TO AID'S DECISION ABOUT WHETHER TO SUPPORT A NEW PROJECT LIKE THE POPULATION/ECONOMIC GROWTH PROJECT. THE EVALUATION DESCRIBES PROJECT ACTIVITIES IN VENEZUELA, PERU, AND COLOMBIA AND PRESENTS DETAILS ABOUT 14 FINDINGS. BASED ON THEIR FINDINGS THE EVALUATORS REACHED SIX CONCLUSIONS. (1) DECISION MAKERS WERE WILLING AND ABLE TO INTEGRATE DEMOGRAPHIC FACTORS INTO DEVELOPMENT PLANNING. (2) MODELS TO SHOW ECONOMIC IMPACT OF POPULATION GROWTH WERE NOT AN EFFICIENT APPROACH TO GET DEMOGRAPHIC VARIABLES CONSIDERED BY PLANNERS NOR TO INCREASE RECEPTIVENESS TO ""FERTILITY CONTROL"" AND ""LOWER FERTILITY RATES."" (3) DECISION MAKERS WERE RECEPTIVE TO RATIONALES FOR ""FERTILITY CONTROL"" OTHER THAN ""REDUCING POPULATION GROWTH."" AID'S POPULATION OFFICE WAS PERCEIVED TO BE WORKING FROM AN UNDULY ""NARROW PERSPECTIVE"" AND PERCEIVED TO BE UNRECEPTIVE TO POPULATION ANALYSIS BASED ON A ""BROADER PERSPECTIVE."" (4) PLANNING AND DECISION MAKING WOULD BENEFIT FROM A VARIETY OF ""POPULATION ANALYSIS SERVICES.""

"SEVERAL RECOMMENDATIONS WERE MADE. A MEETING SHOULD BE ARRANGED BETWEEN THIS EVALUATION TEAM AND THAILAND'S MINISTRY OF PUBLIC HELATH (MOPH) AND THE NATIONAL FAMILY PLANNING PROGRAM (NFPP) COMMITTEE TO DISCUSS RECOMMENDATIONS OF THIS REPORT. THE DEMOGRAPHIC GOAL OF THE THIRD PLAN (1972-76) WAS ACHIEVED, AND THE POPULATION GROWTH RATE FELL FROM OVER 3% PER ANNUM IN 1972 TO 2.4-2.7% PER ANNUM IN 1976. THE NFPP HAS BEEN A SUCCESS, ESPECIALLY THE FOLLOWING ACTIVITIES: 1)EXTENSION OF FAMILY PLANNING (FP) SERVICES TO 2 MILLION FERTILE THAI WOMEN IN OVER 5000 SERVICE UNITS; 2)DEVELOPMENT OF INNOVATIVE SERVICE DELIVERY MECHANISMS; &3)INCREASE IN LEVEL OF CONCERN FOR RAPID POPULATION GROWTH AS A HIGH GOVERNMENT PRIORITY. FOR PLANNING PURPOSES, ONLY THOSE NEW ACCEPTORS WHO NEVER PRACTICED FP BEFORE, SHOULD BE CONSIDERED AS HAVING A DIRECT IMPACT ON THE REDUCTION OF THE POPULATION GROWTH RATE. THE DUPLICATION OF NEW ACCEPTORS SHOULD BE ELIMINATED IN THE RECORDING SYSTEM, AND UNTIL THIS IS DONE, CURRENT ACCEPTOR RATES AND TARGETS SHOULD BE DISCOUNTED BY 20%. THE NFPP SHOULD REVIEW AND REVISE CERTAIN POLICIES & REGULATIONS STILL IN CONFLICT WITH THE NATIONAL POPULATION POLICY. SOME CONFLICTING POLICIES INCLUDED THE FOLLOWING: A)PROHIBITION OF ADVERTISING OF CONTRACEPTIVES THROUGH THE MASS MEDIA; B)INCLUSION OF ORAL CONTRACEPTIVES ON THAILAND'S ""DANGEROUS DRUG LIST"" & THE RESTRICTION ON THEIR DISPENSATION; C)ECONOMIC INCENTIVES FOR THAI GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS TO HAVE LARGE FAMILIES; &D)IMPORT DUTIES ON CONTRACEPTIVES. THE NFPP SHOULD IMPROVE ITS POLICY-MAKING PROCESS AND SHOULD COORDINATE ITSELF WITH THE COMMERCIAL SECTOR. THE PRICING POLICY FOR CONTRACEPTIVES SHOULD BE REVIEWED BY NFPP. FOREIGN ASSISTANCE SHOULD CONTINUE BUT ROYAL THAI GOVERNMENT SUPPORT MUST ALSO INCREASE. NFPP SHOULD ESTABLISH A COMPREHENSIVE OPERATIONAL PLANNING PROCESS & A RESEARCH COORDINATING BODY.A MOBILE STERILIZATION UNIT SHOULD BE BASED IN EACH PROVINCE TO MEET THE STERILIZATION DEMAND. NFPP TRAINING NEEDS TO BE REVISED BY INCREASING STAFF, ASSIGNING FULL-TIME NURSE TRAINERS TO EACH PROVINCE, UTILIZING NON-MOPH SOURCES FOR TRAINING, OR REDUCING THE TRAINING PLAN.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","8/1/1977 12:00:00 AM","","FAMILY PLANNING","Thailand","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAD645A1.pdf","2,395 KB","000262 - American Public Health Association","","","English","application/pdf","","","TIFFANY, TERRENCE P.|LORIG, KATE|MINKLER, DONALD H.","","1 Aug 1977","","","","APHA CONSULTANT REPORT ON THE SECOND EVALUATION OF THE NATIONAL FAMILY PLANNING PROGRAM IN THAILAND, 1972-1976","","PD-AAD-645-A1","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc0OTA1","Thailand","4930209"
"EVALUATES RESULTS OF SECOND LOAN IN LATE 1971 OF $5.1 MILLION TO ENABLE THE FINANCIERA DOMINICANA TO MAINTAIN ITS LEVEL OF LENDING OPERATIONS AND EXPAND ITS INVESTMENTS TO SUSTAIN EXPANDED DEVELOPMENT.

"1/1/77-8/15/77. JORDAN. REPORT DISCUSSES THE SOCIAL & CULTURAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE JORDAN VALLEY POPULATION WHICH MAY BE OF SIGNIFICANCE TO THE FUTURE ROLE OF THE JORDAN VALLEY FARMERS ASSOC (JVFA). THE FUTURE OF LAND DISTRIBUTION IN THE SOUTHERN PART OF THE VALLEY HAS REMAINED A POLITICAL ISSUE. LOCAL TRIBESMEN ARE MAJOR OWNERS OF LAND IN THE REGION & ARE OPPOSED TO REDISTRIBUTION. ALSO,A SIGNIFICANT DIVISION HAS SEPARATED FARMERS WHO ARE ABLE TO FINANCE THE NECESSARY INPUTS FOR CULTIVATION -- SEED,FERTILIZER,PESTICIDES & PAYMENTS FOR IRRIGATION WATER -- FROM THOSE WHO CANNOT. THE LATTER INCLUDES BOTH LANDOWNERS & SHARECROPPERS. THE NEED FOR CREDIT HAS BEEN MET BY LARGE LANDOWNERS WHO PROVIDE INPUTS FOR THEIR OWN SHARECROPPERS & FOR OTHER SMALLER OWNERS. A 2ND GROUP PROVIDING CREDIT TO FARMERS ARE NON-OWNERS OR ""COMMISSIONJIIYAH"" WHO ARE SAID TO CONSIST LARGELY OF 1948 MIGRANTS FROM PALESTINE. THESE AGENTS ARE RESENTED IN THE VALLEY BECAUSE OF THE 30% INTEREST RATE THEY CHARGE. HOWEVER,THIS SYSTEM HAS BEEN A FLEXIBLE RESPONSE TO LOCAL DEMANDS & ASSUMED INVESTMENT RISKS WHICH NO OTHER AGENCY WAS AVAILABLE TO ASSUME. IF THE COMMISSION-AGENTS ARE TO BE REPLACED BY JVFA,THEIR FUNCTIONS SHOULD BE CAREFULLY STUDIED & UNDERSTOOD. THE RECENT DISTRIBUTION OF FERTILIZER BY THE JVFA MET WITH LITTLE RESPONSE FROM FARMERS. THE FERTILIZER WAS UNAVAILABLE TO FARMERS ON AN IN-KIND BASIS (WITH CROPS AS COLLATERAL) AND THOSE WHO HAD MONEY COULD FIND IT AT EQUALLY LOW-OR LOWER-PRICES ON THE MARKET. THE POSITION OF JVFA APPEARS VULNERABLE BECAUSE TOO MUCH WAS PROMISED. ALSO JVFA IS IN AN EXPOSED POSITION BY STATING THAT IT WILL TAKE OVER THE FUNCTIONS OF CREDIT,MARKET REGULATION & OTHER ACTIVITIES WHICH HAVE BEEN THE DOMAIN OF OTHER GOVT AGENCIES. CURRENTLY,JVFA EXECUTIVE POSITIONS ARE HELD BY CHRISTIANS, ALTHOUGH THEY REPRESENT A SMALL PROPORTION OF THE VALLEY POPULATION. THE REPORT RECOMMENDS THAT THE JVFA HOLD BACK ON STATEMENTS OF ITS FUTURE PLANS; ALSO RECOMMENDS THAT IT RECRUIT PERSONNEL FROM AMONG THE EDUCATED RESIDENTS OF THE VALLEY TO AMELIORATE THE SOMEWHAT ALIEN NATURE OF THE PRESENT ADMINISTRATION.","Evaluation period: 1 Jan 1977-15 Aug 1977","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","8/1/1977 12:00:00 AM","","LAND REFORM|Sociology research|Economic research|Agricultural development|Agricultural education|Agricultural production credit|Agricultural product marketing|Farm management|Agricultural credit|CREDIT","Jordan","","","008564 - USAID.

"Evaluates project performance in 6 Sahel Countries from 1975 to 1977. The Accelerated Impact Program (AIP) has assisted individual missions w/small scale, short-term projs & was instituted to quickly finance proj operatns which would provide data, informatn & lessons learned to proj evaluators/designers.  Admin aspects & varying viewpoints between the Phase I review team (RT1) & the Phase II Review Team (RT2) for improving AIP are presented.  Evaluatn methodology based on on-site observatns, interviews & docs. Although situatns vary in Sahel countries, overall probs in proj implementatn has been an inadequate supply of equipmt, funds & qualified personnel; extensive turnovers in personnel; & confusn resulting from file reshuffling.  Difficult travel arrangemts for on-site observatns has necessitated frequent contact w/implementing agencies.  Extensive delays in submitting required reports & lack of necessary informatn in reports caused RT2 to recommend:  less documentatn, quarterly instead of monthly reports, additns of more qualified personnel &/or training in proj design; reports specific to each field; refusals of all Accelerated Proj Identificatn Docs which do not meet expectatns, & AID/W cable approval status to USAID within one month after a thorough analysis of the Accelerated Activity Paper. Although RT2 agrees w/the procedural changes recommended by RT1, it felt AIP's established procedures should not be changed in concept, criteria or documentatn until they have been more thoroughly tested. RT2 feels docs need only analyze relevant proj factors and that expanded documentation recommended by RT1 is too lengthy. RT2 recommends procuremt procedures & proj funding be improved w/more emphasis on agr, health & educatnal start-up activities; allowances be made to Sahel states which can act more expeditiously; proj be expanded Africa-wide in FY 77; local consultants be more fully utilized; AFR/W designate an office to manage & provide financial guidelines for AIP; & more latitude be given to using procuremt waivers. Despite probs, RT1 feels AIP could be useful in devel assist strategies by providing rapid responses.","Evaluation period: 1 Dec 1975-1 Sep 1978","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","3/1/1977 12:00:00 AM","","Rural areas|Health care|Evaluation methodology|Development project design|Development project implementation|Development project evaluation","Sahel","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAP691.pdf","802 KB","000035 - U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)","","","English","application/pdf","Accelerated Impact Program|Multi country evaluation|Indepth evaluation|Onsite evaluation","","POE, KAREN M.|BOBEL, RONALD E.|et al.","","18 Mar 1977","","","","ACCELERATED IMPACT PROGRAM PHASE II EVALUATION (01/20/77-01/21/77)","","PD-AAP-691","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc1MDY4","Sahel Regional","6250910"
"Evaluates the Padat Darya Gaya Baru (PKGB) labor intensive rural works program in Indonesia for the year 1977.  Under the direction of the Department of Manpower, 182 subprojects were carried-out during the year. A stratified sample of 34 of these subprojects were surveyed by 24 TAP's (village development officers).  Their findings are included in the report along with detailed beneficiary information. PKGB has taken on 2 faces: emergency relief and rural infrastructure development.  The first provides short-term employment (maintenance activities) in the wake of natural disasters or socio-economic dislocation.  The second involves planned, quality construction activities.  In 1977 the total was about 450 subprojects with 182 in the planned program.  This massive expansion was accomplished by reassigning local staff, decentralizing decision-making, providing funds directly to the area, and a budgetary increase of 400%, but with no increase in Central PKGB staff. During this rapid expansion, recommendations made in 1976 for improvements in basic management were not implemented.  Poor execution of work and a lowering of construction standards often resulted from hurried work to meet a deadline or through mobilization of a greater number of daily laborers than could be supervised by existing staff. Of the subprojects surveyed, 6 (18%) were considered to be poor. Delays on 2 reforestation projects resulted in late planting during the dry season and the loss of 80% of the trees.  The other 4 were canal projects for irrigation and flood control. Benefits from these subprojects were not maximized because of neglect or poor execution (survey, design, scheduling, workmanship) which could have been controlled by PKGB. Similar faults, to a lesser degree, were found among the 10 subprojects (30%) considered to be fair.  18 (25%) were rated good to excellent. Report recommends that the Department of Public Works provide training to upgrade the para-technical skills of new and old TAP's and that a manual be prepared and courses for local offficials conducted to improve selection of subprojects.","Evaluation period: 1 JAN 1977-1 DEC 1977|Bibcode changed from 32 to 22, 2008-05-19","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","12/1/1977 12:00:00 AM","","Rural development|Public works|Reforestation|Water management|Surface irrigation|Canals|Floods|Labor intensive technology|DRAINAGE|Roads|Road construction|Beneficiary count|Sampling method|Limited data plus","Indonesia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAA428A1.pdf","1,666 KB","008558 - USAID.

USBS COMPONENT DESIGNED TO PROVIDE BASIC IMMUNIZATION, CHILD HEALTH, AND FAMILY PLANNING SERVICES TO PILOT URBAN AREAS VIA INDIGENOUS PROMOTERS; USBS SUBSEQUENTLY LIMITED TO HERRERA SECTION OF SANTO DOMINGO WITH A POPULATION OF 56, 964 SERVED BY 117 PROMOTERS. EVALUATORS UTILIZED SURVEY OF CONTACTS OF 12 RANDOMLY-SELECTED PROMOTERS TO ASSESS ACHIEVEMENT OF INTERMEDIATE OBJECTIVES. SAMPLE REVEALED 55.0% OF CHILDREN UNDER 5 IMMUNIZED WITH 2 DOSES DPT(INTERMEDIATE GOAL SET AT 80%);4.2% CHILDREN UNDER 10 IMMUNIZED WITH MEASLES VACCINE(80% GOAL);21.9% OF REPRODUCTIVE AGE WOMEN IMMUNIZED WITH 2 DOSES TETANUS TOXOID(80% GOAL);5.74% OF WOMEN 15-49 ACTIVELY USING CONTRACEPTION(2.5% GOAL). DEGREE OF IMMUNIZATION COVERAGE IS JUDGED POTENTIALLY UNDERSTATED DUE TO INCIDENCE OF PREVIOUS SECRETARIAT OF HEALTH,UNIVERSITIES,AND PRIVATE CATHOLIC IMMUNIZATION CAMPAIGNS IN AREA. EVALUATORS RECOMMEND FUTUREJINCLUSION OF OTHER(OUTSIDE) IMMUNIZATIONS IN HOUSEHOLD RECORDS MAINTAINED BY PROMOTERS. CONTRACEPTIVE ACCEPTORS -- FOR WHICH GOAL WAS SURPASSED -- ARE LIKEWISE BELIEVED TO BE UNDERSTATED. THE GREATER MOBILITY OF THE URBAN TARGET POPULATION AND OF URBAN PROMOTERS(27% LOST TO PROGRAM) IS JUDGED TO HAVE HANDICAPPED USBS COMPONENT. IN COMPARING USBS SAMPLE TO THE REGION IV RURAL SAMPLE(SEE 5170107021702),ALMOST IDENTICAL DPT & TT COVERAGES IN BOTH URBAN & RURAL COMPONENTS WOULD SEEM TO NEGATE THE ASSUMPTION OF GREATER ACCESSIBILITY OF THE URBAN POPULATION TO HEALTH SERVICES.

RELEVANCY OF RURAL & URBAN DISPARITIES IN MEASLES AND FAMILY PLANNING RESULTS IN JUDGED LESS MEANINGFUL. GREATER EFFECTIVENESS OF ONE PROGRAM AS OPPOSED TO OTHER CANNOT BE UNEQUIVOCALLY DEMONSTRATED ACCORDING TO EVALUATORS.

"Provides initial evaluation of rural Basic Health Services (SBS) low-cost health care delivery system component of AID FY76-FY78 Health Sector Loan to the Govt of the Dominican Republic (GODR).  SBS program designed to provide basic immunization, child health, and family planning services to rural communities via indigenous promoters. Specially-commissioned evaluation utilizes random sample survey of 20 rural communities in pilot region of 4 southwest provinces to measure degree of progress in achievement of intermediate objectives.  Promoter monthly reports deemed unreliable due to over-reporting.  Survey conducted by 10 health professionals who examined household records in sample communities. Sample revealed 50.5% of children under 5 immunized with 2 doses DPT (intermediate goal set at 75%); 14.7% of children under 10 immunized with measles vaccine (75% goal); 21.4% of women of reproductive age immunized with 2 doses tetanus toxoid (80% goal); 8.2% of women 15-49 actively using contraception (4.8% goal).  USAID judges sample findings likely underestimated with respect to measles immunization (most children contacted disease during previous epidemic); tetanus toxoid immunization (2nd dose often administered following delivery in hospital); and contraceptive users (overlooks incidence of sterilization).  Sample results are termed disappointing, but USAID is pleased with Dominican participation in the evaluation process. USAID and GODR are currently mounting health education campaign in pilot area, emphasizing DPT, tetanus toxoid.  Villages identified below goals are being blanketed with posters & radio spots and then offered immunization.  Follow-up evaluation is planned. Infant dehydration & breast feeding components are not widely enough implemented to permit evaluation. Amendment #1 provides comparative data based on census of 3 pilot region communities prior to SBS program inclusion.  Results (5.5% DPT; 2.9% tetanus toxoid immunization; 4.6% contraceptive usage; no measles vaccination) confirm low estimates of immunization coverage and contraceptive prevalence in rural Dominican Republic.","Loan no.

"Evaluates project performance from 10/15/70 to 4/30/75 in El Salvador.  Loan assists the development of a self-sustaining private cooperative federation, the Federacion de Cooperativas de Ahorro Y Credito de El Salvador (FEDECACES), with capital to finance sub-loans to eligible unions for:  1) relending to small farmers, artisans, industries, and commercial enterprises; 2) relending personal loans; and 3) financing improvements in the office's equipment or management of eligible unions. Evaluation methodology not defined. Audits and independent team assessments during the project revealed that the baseline data in the Capital Assistant Paper were erroneous and overstated.  Reviewers thus provided USAID/ES with more realistic and accurate bench marks against which to measure FEDECACES viability and progress. Although completion of loan commitments were behind schedule making it necessary to extend the project two years beyond the contract, FEDECACES has been relatively successful in achieving its purpose. FEDECACES has operated at a profit for the last two years and projected that its finances viability will continue even after it begins to repay the AID money. Evaluator recommends that since the original loan conditions and covenants relating to disbursement, warranties, project execution, procurement, etc are now obsolete, they should be eliminated from USAID/ES's monitoring scope. Mission should continue to monitor funds and other resources to be provided by FEDECACES, and FEDECACES's payment of El Salvador taxes.  AID should continue to provide consultation and assistance with maintenance and auditing of records. AID should also have the right to inspect the project and all records, documents, goods, and services associated with it.  FEDECACES should in turn be required to inform AID of any facts and circumstances that may affect the project.","Evaluation period: 5 Oct 1970-30 Apr 1975","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","7/1/1977 12:00:00 AM","","Financial resources|Financial institutions|Financial management|Credit cooperatives|CREDIT|Credit unions","El Salvador","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAA791A1.pdf","1,029 KB","000035 - U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)","","","English","application/pdf","Pre evaluation data","","ANDERSON, EDWIN D.","","14 Jul 1977","","519-L-016","","LOAN COMPLETION REVIEW REPORT","","PD-AAA-791-A1","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc1MjM0","El Salvador","5190153"

"EVALUATES RURAL ROAD BUILDING PROJECT IN SIERRA LEONE FROM 1/75 TO 9/77. PROJECT PURPOSE WAS TO PROVIDE ACCESS TO MARKETS AND AGRICULTURAL INPUTS FOR THE RURAL POPULATION. EVALUATION CONCLUDES THAT USE OF A PVO, CARE, TO BUILD LOW COST, LOW TRAFFIC VOLUME, LOW DESIGN STANDARD ROADS IN RURAL AREAS HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL, AND THAT SUPPORT SHOULD BE CONTINUED AND EXPANDED IN A SECOND OPERATIONAL PROGRAM GRANT. OVER 200 MILES OF RURAL ROADS WERE CONSTRUCTED OR REHABILITATED. THESE ROADS WERE BUILD TO STANDARDS WHICH WITH PROPER MAINTENANCE, WOULD ALLOW YEAR-ROUND USE BY TRUCKS AND VANS. AN ONSITE INSPECTION AT THE END OF THE RAINY SEASON REVEALED LIGHT OR NO OVERALL DAMAGE, LEADING TO THE CONCLUSION THAT OVERALL DESIGN WAS ADEQUATE. CONSTRUCTION TECHNIQUES USED A MAXIMUM OF AVAILABLE MECHANIZED ROAD-BUILDING EQUIPMENT. EXPERIENCE DURING THE COURSE OF THE PROJECT, PARTICULARLY WITH REGARD TO VOLUNTARY LABOR, REINFORCED THE NECESSITY OF USING MECHANIZED EQUIPMENT. MOST OF THE EQUIPMENT USED ON THE PROJEC, HOWEVER, WAS FROM 6-15 YEARS OLD. ALTHOUGH THE EQUIPMENT WAS USABLE, AVERAGE DOWN-TIME WAS APPROXIMATELY 45%. IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT AS MUCH NEW EQUIPMENT BE USED ON THE SECOND OPG AS POSSIBLE, AND OLDER EQUIPMENT BE RETIRED IF IT CONTINUES TO BE UNRELIABLE, EVEN IF IT IS NECESSARY TO DISCONTINUE ONE WORKING FRONT. COST PER MILE WAS COMPUTED TO BE $12.3 THOUSAND OUT-OF-POCKET EXPENDITURES (EXCLUDING EQUIPMENT PURCHASED). LOW PROJECT COSTS ARE ATTRIBUTED TO EFFORTS OF EDUCATED, HIGHLY MOTIVATED, MINIMALLY PAID PEACE CORPS AN VSO WORKERS, COMPETENT AND DEDICATED ADMINISTRATION BY CARE, WELL-PAID SIERRA LEONIAN PROFESSIONALS AND SKILLED LABOR, AND DONATED UNSKILLED LABOR. IT IS NOTED THAT THE OPERATION COULD BE DUPLICATED SUCCESSFULLY IN OTHER AFRICAN COUNTRIES IF THE SAME CONDITIONS THAT EXIST IN SIERRA LEONE COULD BE MET. LABOR INTENSIVE PRODUCTION USED IN THE FAR EAST FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF RAILROADS, DIKES AND SO FORTH IS NOT FEASIBLE IN MOST PARTS OF AFRICA, BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF HEAVILY POPULATED RURAL CENTERS AND THE UNWILLINGNESS OF THE AFRICANS TO SUBMIT TO SUCH REGIMENTATION.","Work order no. 16|Evaluation period: 1 Jan 1975-1 Sep 1977","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/OTR-C-1298","","12/1/1977 12:00:00 AM","","Transportation system design|Access roads|Farm to market roads|Rural areas|Road maintenance|Road construction|Roads|Vehicles","Sierra Leone","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDBAD538.pdf","758 KB","009170 - Frederic R.

"Evaluates projects in 7 Latin American Countries to increase food production in arid & sub-humid areas through improved water & other managemt practices from 1968 to 1977.  Evaluatn is based on progress reports. All LDC's have benefited from the proj. In Brazil 3 new research/demonstratn statns are in operatn & 3 others were reorganized; water managemt practices for over 40 crops were devel; an index of the ratio of dependable precipitatn to potential evapotranspiratn was prepared and managemt research was evaluated for the NE; and officials were provided with formal & informal field & office training. In Chile, irrigatn, planting, fertilizer tech, and corn disseminatn results were improved; soils were classified according to moisture holding capacities in order to devel drought proofing specificatns; and orchard irrigatn techniques were adjusted to improve infiltratn. In Colombia, rice was determined to be the best crop for Atlantico soil & surface grading the best alternative of eliminating water ponding. In Ecuador the Water Law Digest is now a standard reference text; a 4-LDC agr survey was completed; and studies indicated that rice productn can best be improved by intermediate farm improvemt. In El Salvador, irrigated managemt technologies were devel for corn, rice, sorghum, pangola grass, and tomatoes; extensn bulletins were prepared in Spanish; staff received training in water managemt tech; San Andres drainage probs were solved; aquatic weed control for canals was devel for the Zapotian Valley; recommendatns were made concerning alternative irrigatn strategies for the Sonsanote's pangola pastures; and the devel of comparative irrigatn methods now permit farmers to select the best method based on climate, soil, and economic conditns. In Guatemala irrigated crop tech was devel for melons, tomatoes, chili, onions, garlic, okra, and corn; blossom-end rot in tomatoes & melons was linked with low infiltratn rates; and treatmts of gypsum, green manuring, and chisel plowing were shown to improve infiltratn rates. In Peru, researchers were trained in irrigatn & a national irrigatn research program was developed.","Evaluation period: 1 Jan1968-30 Apr1977","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","AID/TA-C-1103","","4/1/1977 12:00:00 AM","","CROP YIELD|Agricultural research|Subtropical zone|Arid zone|Water management|Maize|SORGHUM|Aquatic weeds|Pest control|RICE|Irrigation|Pilot projects|SOIL RESEARCH|SOIL FERTILITY|Soil types|Vegetables|SOIL MOISTURE|Agricultural management|Technical assistance","","","","002417 - Utah State University.

"Evaluates Afghanistan Basic Health Services Project (BHSP) 6/76-6/77. BHSP was designed to provide basic health services (BHS) to 830,000 persons living in 50 minor civil divisions within 4 of Afghanistan's 6 health regions. Project emphasizes basic maternl/child health (MCH) and includes developing elements of 2 or more Alternative Health Delivery Systems (AHDS) that are administratively and financially feasible, effective and replicable.  AHDS are intended to provide minimal health services to approximately 3,000 persons without access to a Basic Health Center (BHC). Evaluation methodology focuses on assessing project objectives and establishing a framework for a more in-depth 2nd yr analysis of project by interviewing U.S. project staff and management personnel.  Field trips were made to existing BHCs and new construction sites to view Village Health Worker (VHW) programs and a final analysis of each subject area coded on questionnaire (staffing, training, construction progress, a fixed amount reimbursement plan, cost estimate, preventive/curative services, recruitment, data collection & commodity assignment) was done when all data had been collected. First AHDS program models have been well received. Eleven VHWs, including 2 women, were recruited & trained to provide optimum curative & preventive services. Eleven traditional birth attendents were trained to provide pre-natal, delivery & post-natal care to mothers & infants. Thirteen Auxiliary Nurse Midwife (ANW) teachers have returned from U.S. training.  Comprehensive manuals for BHC staff have been completed, tested, & disseminated.  Five mobile training teams have been established & provided on-the-job mgmt training at 54 BHCs.  Afghanistan Min. of Pub. Health (MOPH) & AID have agreed that MOPH will assign necessary construction personnel & design a plan for construction supervision & inspection.  USAID will not obligate funds for additional BHCs until warranted by construction performance.  Evaluation team concludes that project shows prospects of having favorable impact on Afghanistan BHS delivery system based on 1st years experience.","Attached to PD-AAA-403","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","10/1/1977 12:00:00 AM","","Health delivery|Alternative health delivery services|Primary health care|Community health workers|Fixed amount reimbursement","Afghanistan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAA403A.pdf","2,678 KB","008504 - USAID.

"Evaluates 1976 Natn'l Community Devel Service (SNDC) project in Bolivia. Proj purpose is to establish adivsory services & credit for small farmer (SF)'s.  Visits were made to SF's, SF programs, SNDC offices, Banco Del Estado, and Institutns which might provide proj assist in the future. Although some SF's may be excluded by not forming coops, indicatns are that proj is helping even the smallest land owners.  Proj is on schedule & SF's formerly skeptical of the proj have requested participatn since adequate funds and technical assistance are available. Many discrepancies have resulted in proj admin due to inconsistencies from local officials & undefined policies.  Zonal offices have not adhered to limited organizatn eligibility for credit & have received inconsistant info, and communicat'n between offices has been poorly designed & managed.  Due to the probs & the slow rate that info reaches branch offices from La Paz, it is discouraging that there is continued resistance to decentralize SNDC so that decisns other than admin ones could be made locally where actns would be more timely & judgemts  more effective.  Although numerous organizatns could provide assist & strategies are being devel by SNDC with regard to the types best suited for SF's, no organizatn other than SNDC is presently providing assist. One of the greatest problms in improving credit assist programs is that the numerous socio/econ studies conducted in  140 communities are quite inadequate due to lack of necessary baseline data for future planning & eval. Since techs & SF's have many excellent ideas, they should be more innovative in searching out alternative sources of info & help, and receive reports of the Ministry of Agr.  As program expands it will be necessary to more fully utilize the assist of commercial & govt sources. Program future success will also depend on the availability of relevant tech for SF's, econ resources from service agencies, SF organizatn, and technical advice all of which must appeal to the SF.","Evaluation period: 1 Jan 1976-1 Feb 1977","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID-511-113T","","2/1/1977 12:00:00 AM","","Cooperatives|Financing|Management operations|Agricultural development|Development strategies|Agricultural credit|Economic studies|Agricultural cooperatives|Small farms|Farmers","Bolivia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAA070E1.pdf","3,262 KB","000833 - Robert R.

"Evaluates project performance from 1958 to 1977 in Bolivia. The Natn'l Community Devel Service (SNDC) provides small farmers credit to increase agr productn & provide an economically viable infrastructure. Proj consultant gives his recommendatn for proj continuatn. Consultant feels that semi-autonomous intermediate institutns, such as SNDC, are the best system for Bolivia's rural devel & change. Despite SNDC's internal problems it has demonstrated the best organizatn for developing a coop strategy.  Other rural institutns such as INALCO, IBTA, and Banco del Estado have not succeeded in serving small farmers since they lack experience & institutional capabilities; and Govt of Bolivia (GOB) institutions such as the Ministries of Finance, Agriculture, and Education are difficult to work through. Unfortunately, Bolivia's present military govt eliminates the developmt of an independent privately controlled coop movemt as originally planned. SNDC's survival in Bolivia will necessitate that it be developed within the framework of the GOB's control & blessings.  GOB must be convinced of developmt benefits of an indepent coop movemt capable of developing Bolivia's rural sector. Proj consultant outlines 3 alternatives in developing SNDC's necessary reorganizatn.  Alternative one, the most preferable but also the most timely & expensive, would involve redesigning SNDC into a well-staffed institutn capable of managing rural change. Alternative two, a partial organizational change involving less time, training, and funds, would result in some depts & field offices running sufficiently to keep proj out of trouble but not tackling SNDC's major organizational probs. Alternative three, which would do little more than keep SNDC together, would require continuous adjustmts in a few depts until a regional coop developmt system was implemented.  Although consultant prefers alternative one, he feels alternative two fits the needs of USAID at this point & could be implemented within 2 to 3 years. Consultant feels alternative two can be implemented only if funds are sufficient.  If funding is limited alternative three is preferable.","Evaluation period: 1 Jan 1976-1 Mar 1978","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID-511-113T","","3/1/1977 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural credit|Economic studies|Cooperatives|Financing|Management operations|Agricultural cooperatives|Agricultural development|Development strategies|Small farms|Farmers|Agricultural production|Rural development|Limited data","Bolivia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAA067C1.pdf","727 KB","000833 - Robert R.

"Evaluates project performance from 1976 to 1977 in Bolivia. Proj purpose is to provide credit & tech assist to Bolivia's Small farmer (SF)'s.  On-site observatns were made at 3 regional & 4 zonal offices & interviews conducted with Natn'l Community Devel Service (SNDC) employees. Although some progress has been made many probs must be solved. One of the major reasons so few SF's have been able to repay loans results from poor socio-economic & historical studies.  Coops chosen for program participatn were not the best since studies did not provide info about organizational activities, member involvemt, and historical data on basic line of productn in the community over the past 5-10 yrs. An attempt is made to evaluate proj according to productn credit & admin aspects.  During interview, techs were extremely cooperative, open, and willing to discuss how probs could be solved. Unfortunately techs did not keep logs, making it difficult to determine the time they devoted to each of their responsibilities & those in the Tarija zone were not developing feasibility studies for the next agr cycle.  Often techs did not visit or assist SF's often enough due to transportatn probs. Technical backstopping from regional offices was minimal & funding inadequate in many cases to admin the proj.  Unusually heavy rain in some areas & drought in others also resulted in poor agr yields. Rice crops in the Santa Cruz zone & wheat in the Tarija zone were encouraged when past productn had been unsuccessful.  In most cases techs have not asstd SF's make transitns to more productive agr activities which has resulted in failure for SF's to break even &/or repay loans. Techs are concerned about the lack of improvemt in coop organizatn & have complained they lack per diem to travel enough to give support. Communicatn, frequent admin changes & slow response times from La Paz are also probs. The Cochabamba region, due to a new potato seed & the building of a lg dam & irrigatn sys, has had the most success. Evaluator feels projs such as Cochabamba should be undertaken to assure adequate water for crop success, etc before loans are made.","Evaluation period: 1 Mar 1970-26 Jul 1977","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID-511-116T","","7/1/1977 12:00:00 AM","","Management training|Cooperatives|Management operations|Agricultural development|Agricultural education|Agricultural credit|Economic studies|Agricultural cooperatives|Small farms|Farmers|Agricultural production|RICE|Potatoes|Agricultural management|WHEAT|IRRIGATION","Bolivia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAA069F1.pdf","3,649 KB","000833 - Robert R.

"EVALUATES PERFORMANCE OF THE SEDERHANA (SIMPLE) IRRIGATION AND RECLAMATION PROGRAM (IRS) IN INDONESIA FROM 6/75 TO 6/78. THE IRS PROGRAM INCLUDES HUNDREDS OF SMALL-SCALE IRRIGATION/RECLAMATION SUBPROJECTS SCATTERED THROUGHOUT INDONESIA DESIGNED FOR QUICK INCREASES IN RICE PRODUCTION. THE 3-MAN EVALUATION TEAM VISITED 60 SUBPROJECTS, INTERVIEWED FARMERS AND IOCAL OFFICIALS, HELD DISCUSSIONS WITH GOI AND USAID OFFICIALS, AND UTILIZED PROFRAM DOCUMENTATION. THE EVALUATORS CONCLUDE THAT IRS IS PROVING TO BE A WORTHWHILE AND EFFECTIVE PROGRAM FOR PROMOTING RICE PRODUCTION. BY LATE 1977, IRS HAD EXPANDED IRRIGATED RICE HECTARAGE BY 18,000 HA. IRS HAD ALSO ENHANCED INCOME FOR SEVERAL HUNDRED THOUSAND SMALL FARM FAMILIES. THE COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS SECTION OF THE REPORT CONCLUDES THAT IRS IS ON ITS WAY TOWARDS COVERING THE SOCIAL OPPORTUNITY COSTS OF BOTH CAPITAL AND LABOR. PROGRESS TOWARDS STRENGHTENING GOI AND VILLAGE INSTITUTIONS RESPONSIBLE FOR IMPLEMENTING IRS, WHILE READILY OBSERVABLE, APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN SLOWER THAN PROJECTED. HENCE, TARGET HECTARAGE FOR THE GOI 1977/78 FISCAL YEAR WAS REDUCED TO 21,000 HA, DOWN FROM 49,000 HA DURING 1976/77. IRS OFFICIALS HAVE, HOWEVER, ACCUMULATED MUCH BENEFICIAL EXPERIENCE. EVALUATORS FEIT THAT FAR TOO SMALL A PORTION OF THE US TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE HAS BEEN DEVOTED TO STRENGTHENING THE IRS TRAINING INSTITUTIONS.IMPROVED TRAINING FOR IRS AFTER SHOULD BE FIRST PRIORITY FOR EXPANDED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. GOI HAS NOT YET INSTITUTIONALIZED OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE (O&M). NEVERTHELESS, THE LACK OF O&M BY THE IRRIGATION SERVICE HAS PROVIDED INCENTIVE FOR LOCAL COMMUNITY INITIATIVES. O&M OF MAJOR WORKS BEYOND THE CONTROL OF THE FARMERS SHOULD BE INSTITUTIONALIZED BY GOI. EVALUATORS RECOMMEND THAT DESIGN CONTRACTORS BE REQUIRED TO RETURN TO THE FIELD WITH THEIR PRELIMINARY LAYOUTS TO GET FEEDBACK FROM LOCAL ENGINEERS. THIS WOULD IMPROVE THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE FINAL DESIGNS AND SSVE CONSIDERABLE GOI STAFF TIME NOW DEVOTED TO CORRECTING CONTRACTOR MISTAKES.

"Discusses tech aspects & outlines an implementatn schedule of project to increase rice, corn, sorghum, and millet productivity in Chad by providing farmers with adequate quantities of improved seeds at reasonable prices. Report based on on-site observatns & statistical data. Govt of Chad (GOC) is not presently making a national effort to devel & implemt a seed improvemt & distributn program, and personnel lack trng & experience in seed improvemt. Research & processing facilities are not yet constructed, and most farmers are so lacking in capital that they consume the best grain & store the lowest quality seed for next years crop which is damaged by moisture & pests.  Also, present distributn methods are inadequate since:  1) ONDR, the promotn & distributn unit of the Min of Agr lacks personnel; 2) Chad's transportatn sys is inadequate, and 3) operating funds are not sufficient to support farmer seed productn, support seed multiplicatn Unis, or pay ONDR for seed distributn. The ultimate improvemt in productn will depend on:  1) research & cooperatn with other international research centers; 2) GOC's willngness to make a strong commitmt to the program, 3) farmer's acceptance of improved seed & methods; 4) more agr inputs, 5) adequate trng for personnel, 6) availability of consultants & candidates for trng & placemt, and 7) costs of equipmt & constructn be within estimates. Proj has resulted in 90,000 hectares being planted w/improved seed, increased grain yields by 20%, seed costs for improved seed being the same as traditional ones, personnel trng at all levels in Chad, Africa, and US & the purchase of commodities such as vehicles, and equipmt for cleaning, treating, testing, and storing grain. It is recommended that ONDR provide farmers with seeds at planting time & receive grain at harvest time; trng be continued at all levels; agricultural research be strengthened and continued; an extension service, marketing system and institutional framework be developed, and improved technical assistance be provided.","Evaluation period: 1 Jan1975-9 Nov1977","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/TA-C-1219","","12/1/1977 12:00:00 AM","","Peanuts|Maize|RICE|SORGHUM|Millet|SEED TESTING|Management information systems|Information dissemination|Agriculture|Information services|Varietal research|Agribusiness|Seeds|Technical assistance|Beneficiary count","Chad","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAC617A1.pdf","739 KB","001385 - Mississippi State University","","","English","application/pdf","Indepth evaluation|Onsite evaluation","","BUNCH, DEAN H.","","1 Dec 1977","","","","SEED MULTIPLICATION SUB-PROJECT OF THE AGRONOMIC RESEARCH, SEED MULTIPLICATION AND GRAIN MARKETING PROJECT PAPER FOR CHAD (11/9/77-12/7/77)","","PD-AAC-617-A1","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc1NzM0","Technical Assistance","9310203"

"The Fixed Amount Reimbursement (FAR) procedure has contributed in varying degrees to progressive improvements in early project implementation on three of the four projects for which the procedure has been applied.  The procedure has not been effective for Phase I of the Central Helmand Drainage project because of cost estimating difficulties and a reluctance by the grantee to seek reimbursements when actual costs exceeded estimates.  The evaluators analyzed each of the four projects individually. Twelve common conclusions about the Rural Works, Rural Primary Schools and Basic Health Services projects were summarized. They include:  (1) the FAR procedure, coupled with technical assistance, has led to significant improvements in grantee cost estimating; (2) requirements of the FAR procedure for pre-agreed designs and specifications and USAID engineering certification of completion have brought about better grantee acceptance of constructive criticism and engineering technical assistance in design preparation; (3) FAR permitted project implementation without undue USAID involvement in grantee-negotiated contracts; and (4) the requirement that schools and Basic Health Centers must be ""operational"" as a precondition for reimbursement may be the most important, beneficial element of the FAR procedure. The evaluators made 10 recommendations including:  (1) the FAR procedure should be applied to projects in Afghanistan when the project entails replicable or discreet units of construction; (2) AID/W must provide assistance to obtain a significantly increased engineering capability; and (3) USAID must assure continuity in advising grantees of required performance standards when project officers, technical advisors, and engineers are replaced or exchanged.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","3/1/1977 12:00:00 AM","","Fixed amount reimbursement|Contract management|Clinics|IRRIGATION|DRAINAGE|Educational facilities|Building construction|Public works|Bridge construction|Rural development|Development project design|Development project implementation|Development project evaluation","Afghanistan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAA400A1.pdf","1,308 KB","008504 - USAID.

BY FOLLOWING THE RECOMMENDATNS OF EXTENSN AGENTS TO CULTIVATE SUGAR CANE & MELON, 19 DE JULIO COOP HAS GREATLY INCREASED ITS AGR YIELD. UNFORTUNATELY, FEW TARGET GROUPS ARE BEING REACHED SINCE THE NATL DEVEL BANK (BNF) RARELY LENDS TO COOPS & FAILS TO PROVIDE LONG-TERM CAPITAL REQUIRED FOR AGR DEVEL DUE TO OVER-EMPHASIS ON ANNUAL CROP FINANCING. ALTHOUGH THE COOP WINDOW (BNF'S ADMINSTRATIVE AGR COOP SECTN) IS BETTER STAFFED, IT LACKS AUTHORITY TO APPROVE LOANS. THESE & OTHER LOAN DELAYS HAVE DEFERRED STATISTICAL STUDIES. MAF RECOMMENDATNS ARE THAT: 1)IMPROVED USE OF LAND & LABOR BE DETERMINED; 2)INVESTMT PLANS BE DEVEL; 3)TOTAL FARM BUSINESS BE PLANNED; AND 4)ASENTAMIENTOS DRAFT THEIR OWN PLANS. DUE TO HIGH LOAN COLLATERAL REQUIREMTS IMPOSED BY BNF,LIMITED USE HAS BEEN MADE OF SMALL FARMER COOP PRODUCTN FUND (SFCPF) OR SMALL FARMER CAPITAL DEVEL FUND (SFCDF).

"EVALUATES PROJECT IN HONDURAS PROVIDING DISASTER ASSISTANCE IN THE AFTERMATH OF HURRICANE FIFI (1974) WHICH INCLUDED RECONSTRUCTING PRIMARY SCHOOLS, EXTENDING AGRICULTURAL CREDIT, AND CONSTRUCTING LOW-COST HOUSING IN THE DAMAGED AREAS. THIS PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT DISCUSSES ONLY THE HOUSING CONSTRUCTION COMPONENT AND EVALUATES THE PROJECT FROM ITS INCEPTION THROUGH 9/30/77. IN THE ORIGINAL PROJECT DESIGN 2,400 LOW-COST HOUSING UNITS WERE TO BE CONSTRUCTED, AVERAGING $400 IN CONSUMER COSTS. A CAPACITY WITHIN THE NATIONAL HOUSING INSTITUTE WAS ALSO TO BE DEVELOPED TO COORDINATE AND EXECUTE RURUL SHELTER PROJECTS WITH PRIVATE VOLUNTARY ORGANIZATIONS (PVOS) EXPERIENCED IN LOW-COST RURAL HOUSING PROGRAMS. HOWEVER, INVA AND THE PVOS DISAGREED AT THE BEGINNING ABOUT ADMINISTRATIVE CONTROL PROCEDURES, SITE LOCATIONS, AND UNIT DESIGN SPECIFICATIONS. THE PVOS THEN DISASSOCIATED THEMSELVES FROM THE PROJECT, LEAVING INVA (EXPERIENCED ONLY IN LOW-COST URBAN HOUSING PROGRAMS) WITH TOTAL IMPLEMENTATION RESPONSIBILITY. ONCE CONSTRUCTION BEGAN, WORK STOPPAGES, WEAK ADMINISTRATION, AND A MAJOR FLOOD CONTINUED TO HINDER PROJECT PERFORMANCE. NEVERTHELESS, WITH ASSISTANCE FROM A HIGHLY QUALIFIED HOUSING ADVISOR, INVA PROCEEDED TO DESIGN AND CONSTRUCT 969 BASIC ONE-ROOM UNITS COSTING THE PURCHASER $50 HIGHER THAN ESTIMATED. TO COMPENSATE FOR THE LACK OF SKILLED LABOR, SHORT INTENSIVE COURSES ON TEACHING CONSTRUCTION METHODS WERE CONDUCTED FOR CONSTRUCTION CREW CHIEFS WHO THEN TRAINED VOLUNTEER LABORERS. THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AGREED TO CONSTRUCT LATRINES AND POTABLE WATER SUPPLY SYSTEMS FOR ALL HOUSING SUBPROJECTS FINANCED UNDER THE LOAN. BECAUSE OF INSUFFICIENT FUNDS AND TRAINED PERSONNEL, CONSTRUCTION WAS DISCONTINUED; IT WAS RESUMED IN JUNE, 1977 WHEN FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE WAS PROVIDED FROM AN AID NUTRITION LOAN.

"EVALUATES PROJECT TO CONSTRUCT 238 KM OF A CLASS II HIGHWAY BETWEEN TARAPOTO AND RIO NIEVA, PERU. EVALUATION COVERS THE PERIOD 4/76-3/77 AND WAS CONDUCTED BY USAID/PERU, OFFICE OF ENGINEERING. THIS PROJECT WAS ORIGINALLY AUTHORIZED IN 1964, BUT LOAN DISBURSEMENTS WERE HALTED IN 1968 DUE TO PROJECT-RELATED PROBLEMS AND AN UNCERTAIN POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT. DURING THIS PERIOD, 135 KM OF HIGHWAY BETWEEN TARAPOTO AND RIOJA WAS CONSTRUCTED. IN 1974 THE LOAN WAS REACTIVATED, ALLOWING THE MINISTRY OF TRANSPORTATION AND COMMUNICATIONS (MTC) OF THE GOVERNMENT OF PERU (GOP) TO CONTINUE CONSTRUCTION ON THE REMAINING HIGHWAY BETWEEN RIOJA AND RIO NIEVA. THE FIRST SECTION OF HIGHWAY FELL INTO DISREPAIR DUE TO MTC NEGLECT ANDFOUL WEATHER CONDITIONS DURING 1968-1974. UPON LOAN REACTIVATION, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT RESURFACING AND GENERAL REHABILITATION OF THIS 135 KM OF HIGHWAY WOULD BE NECESSARY; HOWEVER, THE DAMAGE WAS MORE EXTENSIVE THAN ANTICIPATED. AS A RESULT, THIS SECTION WILL NOT BE COMPLETED BY THE TERMINAL LOAN DISTRIBUTION DATE (TDD) OF 12/31/77 AS PLANNED, BUT BY 6/78 INSTEAD. ALL OTHER ROAD CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITIES WILL BE COMPLETED ACCORDING TO PLANS AND SPECIFICATIONS, AND WILL BE FULLY SERVICEABLE FOR LIMITED LOADING BY THE TDD. IT IS PROJECTED THAT ALL LOAN FUNDS WILL BE DISBURSED BY 12/77. A BALANCE OF NEARLY $370,000 WILL EXIST IN A REVOLVING FUND, CREATED FOR THE PURCHASE OF SPARE PARTS AND NEW EQUIPMENT, BECAUSE OF GOP BUREAUCRATIC DELAYS IN PROCUREMENT ACTIVITIES. THE EVALUATOR RECOMMENDS THAT THE TDD SHOULD NOT BE EXTENDED, BUT THAT A REVIEW BE MADE IN SEPTEMBER 1977 OF THE DISBURSEMENT RATE. FURTHER, THE GOP SHOULD BE ADVISED TO APPLY AS MANY FUNDS AS POSSIBLE IN THE 1977 BUDGET FOR THE REHABILITATION OF THE TARAPOTO-RIOJA SECTION OF HIGHWAY, AND TO INCLUDE OTHER FUNDS AS NECESSARY FOR HIGHWAY COMPLETION IN THE 1978 BUDGET. TO ASSIST THE GOP IN MEETING CONSTRUCTION COSTS IN 1978, THE UNEXPENDED REVOLVING FUNDS SHOULD BE REALLOCATED FOR CONSTRUCTION. LASTLY, USAID SHOULD DISBURSE NO MORE MONEY TO REPLENISH THE REVOLVING LOAN FUND THAN THE GOP CAN LIQUIDATE IN THREE MONTHS AFTER THE TDD.","AID LOAN no. 527-L-028|Evaluation period: 1 APR 1976-1 MAR 1977|Bibcode changed from 32 to 22, 2008-05-19","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","5/1/1977 12:00:00 AM","","Bridge construction|Road maintenance|Road construction|Limited data plus","Peru","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAN443.pdf","276 KB","008591 - USAID.

(1) EXPERIENCE, INC WAS CONTRACTED TO DRAW UP A COMPREHENSIVE PLAN FOR DAIRY INDUSTRY DEVELOPMENT. DUE TO THE CONTRACTOR'S INEXPERIENCE WITH TROPICAL DAIRYING, THE STUDY PROVED OF LIMITED USE TO GOG, ALTHOUGH STUDY RECOMMENDATIONS REGARDING ESTABLISHMENT OF A COW HERD AT MOBLISSA AND THE NEED FOR A SELECTION PROCESS FOR FORAGE SPECIES WERE AT LEAST PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED. THE STUDY FAILED TO EMPHASIZE SUFFICIENTLY GOG INEXPERIENCE AND MANAGEMENT SHORTAGES AND THE DIFFICULTIES OF PRODUCING FORAGE UNDER GUYANESE CONDITIONS. (2) EG & G INTERNATIONAL WAS CONTRACTED TO COLLECT HYDROGRAPHIC, OCEANOGRAPHIC, AND SEISMIC DATA ON THE ESSEQUIBO RIVER AND TO TRAIN SEVEN GUYANESE IN DATA COLLECTION. GEOPHYSICAL DATA WERE USEFUL, BUT CONCLUSIONS FROM HYDROGRAPHIC DATA WERE NOT WELL-FOUNDED. THE STUDY PROVIDES A GOOD FOUNDATION FOR A FUTURE FEASIBILITY STUDY FOR A DEEP WATER PORT ON THE RIVER. (3) TAMS WAS CONTRACTED TO DETERMINE THE FEASIBILITY OF PROVIDING AGRICULTURAL INFRASTRUCTURE TO THE INTERMEDIATE SAVANNAHS. THE STUDIES ARE COMPREHENSIVE AND HAVE PROVEN VERY VALUABLE TO GOG. OTHER STUDIES MADE WERE ON THE AGRICULTURAL POTENTIAL OF BLACK BUSH POLDER AND TAPAKUMA (HARZ ENGINEERING COMPANY) AND WATER SUPPLY DEVELOPMENT FOR THE NEW AMSTERDAM AREA (GILBERT ASSOCIATES). ALL STUDIES PROVIDED PREVIOUSLY UNAVAILABLE DATA BUT IMPLEMENTATION OF ALL WAS LIMITED BY IMPRECISE WORK SCOPES (A FAULT TO BE REMEDIED IN FUTURE PROJECTS OF THIS KIND), CONTRACTOR INEXPERIENCE, AND LACK OF GOG COOPERATION. THE PROJECT HAS TAUGHT THAT THE USEFULNESS OF FEASIBILITY STUDIES CANNOT BE ASSUMED.

"Evaluates a Block Grant (BG) project to improve the capacity of the Government of Colombia (GOC) to plan, design, and implement sector development programs.  This final evaluation covers the period 12/21/72-12/31/76.  Evaluation methodology is not specified. GOC officials were familiarized with the ""cities within cities"" conceptual approach.  The GOC has used BG studies as policy guidelines to implement programs in such areas as land acquisition and financial strategies. Regarding tax administration, BG surveys were used to formulate the GOC President's ""To Close the Gap"" development plan.  A national code book for natural resources and environmental protection was compiled, including recommendations on the Temporary Duty Studies services provided under the BG. Also, an evaluation of alternatives for carbon transportation from Guajira to domestic and international markets was used in designing a regional development plan.  A conceptual framework for analyzing the education sector was completed and is being used by the GOC.  A Princeton University study on Colombian population patterns served as the basis for Colombia's presentation at the Human Settlement Conference in Ottawa in 1976.  Michigan State University completed a review/analysis of the existing agricultural marketing system and initiated its recommended marketing plan.  Technical assistance was given to the Institute of Colombian Studies and the DNP on the use of statistical indicators as a tool to measure industrial growth and to formulate industrial policies.  The Denver Research Institute assisted the Colombian Institute of Technological Investigations in its technology transfer capability and held seminars covering topics such as budgeting and cost controls.  In total, 10 short-term courses were offered, providing training in all of the above project areas and in social communications. USAID believes that while BG technical assistance and training have aided the GOC, the project was too ambitious in light of the diversity of the project components.  The block-type project model should be abandoned.","Evaluation period: 21 Dec 1972-31 Dec 1976","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","5/1/1977 12:00:00 AM","","Institution building|Block grants|Rural development|Urban development|Evaluation methodology|Development project design|Development project implementation|Development project evaluation|Agricultural product marketing|Statistical data|Industry|Education|Sector evaluation|Natural resource management|Development planning|National level|Universities and colleges|Limited data","Colombia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAC781G1.pdf","505 KB","008530 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to improve the capability of the Tanzanian Livestock Development Authority (LIDA) and the Tanzanian Livestock Marketing Company (TLMC) to assist traditional livestock producers (TLP).  This special contracted evaluation covers the period 1/73-6/75 and is based on interviews and site visits. Texas A&M University (TAMU) personnel, while performing well, have been constrained by Tanzanian Government (GOT) policies.  Although specific data on project benefits to TLP's were unavailable, most technical assistance was directed toward parastatal ranches and facilities. Institutional aims have not been achieved.  Inputs have been used ineffectively, due to poor communication between LIDA parastatals and TAMU advisors.  Parastatals have not sought help from the latter, most of whom have a limited operational role, nor assigned suitable counterparts. Further, there have been deficiencies in the subsector analysis and the financial/management operation. All livestock parastatals have taken losses except the TLMC, due to its high marketing fee. Unfortunately, inefficiency, high transport costs caused by GOT regulations, and low fixed beef prices, force TLMC to offer low prices to TLP's.  Besides not helping TLP's, this distracts TLMC from its primary responsibility of operating markets, stock routes, and holding grounds -- which can benefit TLP's. Evaluators recommend the following:  (1) Upgrading GOT's institutional capability should be reemphasized and the project replanned to support GOT institutional functions which benefit TLP's. (2) While a 4-man TAMU team should continue to provide assistance, project activities should be delayed until more is known about TLP practices and about constraints to and alternatives for serving TLP's. (3) An indepth study of the interface between TLP's and the market should be conducted.  (4) U.S. training (which is on target) should be suspended until the project is redirected and manpower needs are determined.  (5) Technicians should have suitable counterparts to whom they should provide on-the-job and advisory assistance, foregoing any operational role.","Attachment: XD-AAG-632-A|Evaluation period: 1 Jan1973-30 Jun1975","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","8/1/1977 12:00:00 AM","","Institution building|CATTLE|LIVESTOCK|Agribusiness|Agricultural product marketing|Indigenous education|Participants|On the job training","Tanzania","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAG632.pdf","15,661 KB","000929 - Pacific Consultants","","","English","application/pdf","Evaluation team|Indepth evaluation|Onsite evaluation","","ROTH, ALAN D.|MAY, MORTON|et al.","Agricultural markets","2 Aug 1977","","","","TANZANIAN LIVESTOCK MARKETING AND DEVELOPMENT PROJECT - EVALUATION REPORT","","PD-AAG-632","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc3MzU3","Tanzania","6210122"
"Evaluates project to expand family planning services of Planned Parenthood Family Planning/Family Planning International Assistance (PPFA/FPIA). Special evaluation was submitted 5/5/77 by the American Public Health Association.  No methodology is specified. Several recommendations are provided relating to the project in general, its management, commodity and logistics management, technical services, and structure:  (1) FPIA should decentralize its authority while maintaining strong central leadership and reorganize regional offices to include deputy directors, senior program officers, and more staff.  Also, managerial positions should be reorganized, e.g., placing a communications specialist in charge of internal publications.  FPIA's management system must set realistic subproject objectives and develop an incentive system for its staff.  A board, consisting of FPIA's Chief operating officer and Executive Vice President, field directors, and department heads, should conduct monthly reviews of FPIA's activities. (2) To speed up the provision of consultant services to subgrantees, FPIA and A.I.D. should develop a system permitting the contracting of such services to subgrantees (up to certain time and/or money limits), without prior A.I.D. approval. (3) FPIA should conduct on-site spot checks and annual inventories of commodities and review inventory turnover and space usage at its Windsor, Md. warehouse.  Commodity transports should backhaul freight instead of deadheading.  (4) FPIA's feedback to regional offices and subgrantees should be more analytical and interpretative.  FPIA should develop specialized evaluative approaches for overall program assessment and subproject use. Subprojects should meet minimum reporting and evaluation requirements. (5) FPIA's operational structure can handle additional workload if its staff is augmented. Commodity increases should emphasize project activity to ensure FPIA's independent posture with its clients.  FPIA must assist regional directors in meeting their local staffing needs and developing career ladders for local hire regional staff.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","5/1/1977 12:00:00 AM","","FAMILY PLANNING|Development program evaluation|Storage facilities|Contraceptive agents and devices|Administrative occupations|Management operations|Family planning services|Delivery systems|Institution building|Logistics|Private voluntary organizations","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAH540.pdf","2,963 KB","000262 - American Public Health Association","","","English","application/pdf","Multi country evaluation|Evaluation team|Indepth evaluation","","GOROSH, MARTIN E.|LIERBERMAN, E.

"Evaluates project to establish, among five Central American (CA) central banks, the Central American Monetary Stabilization Fund (CAMSF) to assist CA countries with balance of payments deficits and to promote regional economic stabilization and monetary integration.  Evaluation covers the period 12/75-9/77 and updates a 12/75 loan completion report. The Fund's paid-in capital, consisting of capital contributions plus reinvested earnings, now stands at $37.9 million, up from $25 million on 7/31/76 and $18 million at the end of l975. CAMSF's Executive Secretary expects the Fund to reach its total authorized capital of $50 million by the end of 1977. No new credit lines were negotiated during the year, as none were needed.  Total loans and credits thus remain at $l02 million. Repayments by El Salvador, Honduras and Nicaragua proceeded as scheduled.  As of 8/13/77, El Salvador had a balance outstanding of CA$16.9, Honduras of CA$10, while Nicaragua had liquidated its balance. No new loans were granted in l976/77 owing to the region's strong balance of payments position, and it is doubtful whether new loan applications will be received in l977/78.  A substantial reduction in coffee prices would, however, have serious adverse balance of payments consequences and might force recourse to the Fund in late l978 or l979. Despite CAMSF's progress in achieving loan objectives, it has pooled, as of 6/30/77, only 2.9% of CA foreign exchange reserves of $1.755 million.  A major aspect of the problem is that CA countries contribute equally in capitalizing integration institutions.  Thus, contributions to CAMSF are limited by the willingness and capacity of the weakest member.  While additional voluntary contributions are possible, there is little incentive to make them, since this will not enhance a country's voting power in the Fund's management. Still, CAMSF's Executive Secretary believes countries might be persuaded to make such voluntary contributions in an emergency situation.","Loan no. 596-L-009|Evaluation period: 1 Dec 1975-26 Sep 1977","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","9/1/1977 12:00:00 AM","","Balance of trade|Financial institutions|Credit|Financial resources|COFFEE|Economic integration|Limited data","Central America","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAI581.pdf","125 KB","002290 - USAID.

"This report evaluates a methodology developed by the American Institutes for Research (AIR) for assessing the impact of A.I.D. participant training.  The report argues that the methodology developed by AIR, while interesting, is, by reason of its deductive nature and its inability either to measure the impact of training or to provide a basis for improving training activities, of very limited value to A.I.D.  The report recommends that no follow-up to the AIR proposals be made and that consideration of any future impact assessment should await further developments in the start-of-the-art.  Evaluation of other areas, including follow-up in home country, is supported as an alternative.
