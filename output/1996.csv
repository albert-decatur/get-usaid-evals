"Final evaluation of a project to provide short-term assistance to emerging legislatures in Poland, Hungary, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Latvia, Estonia, Lithuania, Bulgaria, and Albania.  The project, coordinated by the Frost Task Force, began in 1991 and consisted of three main activities: equipment provision, TA provision, and the development of library collections.  It ended in 7 countries in 4/15/95, but continues in Albania and Slovakia and has just begun in Romania. The project was universally praised for its timeliness, impact, quick implementation, and because it was unconditionally responsive to parliaments' wishes.  As a result of the project, emerging parliaments are turning out more needed legislation and getting new laws published more quickly; they could be from 3 to 10 years ahead of where they would have been without the assistance.  The quality of legislation varies by country; in some countries it is nominal, but as newly initiated programs mature, it is expected to improve.  Democracy strengthening, though not part of the project's mandate, seems to have resulted as well.  There is general interest in continued cooperation with the U.S. Congress and other parliaments in the region, with an emphasis on cooperation in the field of informatics and the strengthening of legislative processes. In particular, (1) country conferences implemented for Members of Parliament were beneficial, particularly for new legislators and especially when held early in the term; (2) the Parliamentary Institutes were beneficial to parliamentary staff both in terms of the information imparted and the opportunity to meet peers from other countries; (3) research and analysis units have been established and are strong in Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Lithuania, Poland (Sejm and Senat), and Slovakia; (4) the addition of books and periodicals to parliamentary library collections was welcomed because of the limited size of the parliamentary collections and their lack of Western publications; and (5) personal computers are being used to improve and speed up the operations of the libraries.  Putting more information on-line, however, has occurred only in two of the four countries visited. Although the project has achieved its objectives of jump-starting the new legislatures, there is a need for some follow-on activity in some countries and a modified approach in Albania.  In addition, while great strides have been made in utilizing the equipment provided, more could have been done and in less time (in Albania, Lithuania, and Bulgaria) if TA had been provided for automation start-ups. The following are lessons learned.  (1) The jump start approach was appropriate for the countries on which project design was based (Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and the Slovak Republic), but did not allow for long-term TA needed by the countries added later in the project, although these countries did benefit from the project.  (2) A strong automation technology component is recommended in any new program; computers, and usually networking equipment and software, is extremely important for new parliaments to obtain and disseminate information, and to manage the legislative process effectively. In sum, the project was designed for a special situation at a special time in history.  It was extremely successful given its limited time frame and operational framework. It is not necessarily the best formula for future programs because the same conditions are unlikely to exist.","Delivery order no. 34","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","AEP-0085-I-34-3002-00|AEP-0085-I-00-3002-00","","1/1/1996 12:00:00 AM","","Political development|Legislature|Laws and legislation|Institution building|Governance","Poland|Hungary|Czech Republic|Slovakia|Latvia|Estonia|Lithuania|Bulgaria|Albania|Romania","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABM446.pdf","4,596 KB","000436 - Development Associates, Inc.","","007154 - USAID.

"PACR of the Women's Entrepreneurship Development Program (WED-1) (1981-12/90), a component of the Rural Industries Project.  The purpose of WED-1 was to strengthen the capacity of the WEDP Unit of the Bangladesh Small & Cottage Industries Corporation (BSCIC) to promote women-owned, -operated, or -managed microbusinesses and to expand women's profitable participation in cottage industries. Despite the negative economic conditions constraining poor Bangladeshi women, WED-1 was generally successful, demonstrating that businesses managed by women can succeed in rural Bangladesh and that a public sector entity such as BSCIC's WEDP Unit can implement an informal enterprise lending activity at least as well as local and foreign-supported NGOs in similar circumstances.  Though unable to aggressively promote women entrepreneurship, WED-1 did set the stage for further improvement in this area. WED-1 had a positive impact on rural women because it was a women-managed program.  The majority of the staff both at headquarters and in the field were women, many of them young university graduates. The presence of these women provided rural women with positive role models and persuaded them to assert themselves as entrepreneurs. The project disbursed over $1 million (the USAID portion of which was $296,000) in about 16,000 small loans averaging $83 to some 11,000 rural women from the lowest 20% income group and achieved a loan recovery rate averaging 80%.  A 2-day management course taught about 4,000 borrowers how to operate a subsistence firm and engage in more productive and sustainable microenterprise opportunities.  Another 3,000 potential borrowers received skills training.  There were visible improvements in quality of beneficiaries' lives, and the program increased family incomes, but did so by absorbing under-utilized family labor.  In general, expansion by employing outside labor would still entail losses for the borrowers. USAID support for WEDP has continued under project 3880082, which is making efforts to ensure WEDP sustainability after its termination in 1997. Despite its overall success, implementation could be improved in several regards: (1) the effectiveness of WED-1'S 20 field offices varied widely -- even the best need to improve substantially in terms of number of loans, borrowers, and disbursements; (2) costs of lending must be brought down; (3) WED-1 set very low targets for client recruitment because there were no incentives to motivate field workers to exceed targets; (4) the WED-1 policy to limit borrowers to three loans should change in order to encourage more repeat business; (5) WED-1 focused too much on enterprises with tight profit margins; (6) the WEDP Unit should have been given direct responsibility for personnel management, and for selecting office sites and closing unprofitable offices; (7) WED-1 found it difficult to identify potential borrowers in the larger 10,000-60,000 taka loan category; (8) insufficient attention was paid to whether the markets in which applicants operated could sustain yet another enterprise; (9) the accounting system did not treat field offices as profit centers, and so they did not behave as such; (10) loan application procedures were too cumbersome and requested unnecessary information. In addition, the lending practices of the Bangladesh Krishi Bank (BKB), which was a major participant in WED-1, were particularly inappropriate to the needs of small (and often illiterate) borrowers. The disincentive effect of BKB's processing and approval delays was exacerbated by liquidity deficiencies at BKB field branches which delayed disbursement. The project teaches that skills training independent of a credit program yields few benefits either for the project or for the trainees. Management training for borrowers should be mandatory.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1996 12:00:00 AM","","Rural areas|Microenterprises|Women in development|Entrepreneurship|Institution building|Cottage industries|Commercial credit","Bangladesh","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABM454.pdf","639 KB","008511 - USAID.

"Evaluates two projects to strengthen Niger's health sector:  (1) the Niger Health Sector Support Grant (NHSSG), a program/project to support policy and institutional reforms (1986-96); and (2) the Niger Family Health and Demography Project (NFHDP), to expand family planning (FP) programs and demographic research (6/88-96). Results were mixed.  The NHSSG, especially the portion funded with nonproject assistance, was slow to develop due to expectations which were both unrealistic and poorly understood.  A mid-course reduction and clarification of policy reform objectives resulted in some successes, including development of a national health information system and nascent systems for cost recovery and cost containment in hospitals, other health facilities, and drug distribution.  The NHSSG furthered the debate on a national population policy and supported the decentralization of health services management. The NFHDP also contributed to decentralization by testing service delivery models and strategies, promoting social marketing and other modest private sector initiatives, and enhancing operations research. Nonetheless, national service standards remain far from acceptable in quality and coverage. Information, education, and communication (IEC) efforts have been largely ineffectual, and poor communications at all levels have limited the sharing of effective interventions. Unpredictable events, ranging from labor strikes to currency devaluation to a meningitis epidemic, were significant hindrances to both projects.  Equally damaging was the lack of effective coordination between the NHSSG and the NFHDP.  Efforts on all sides notwithstanding, operating two complex projects concurrently was overly taxing on available systems and personnel in Niger, and effective synergy between the two was not fully realized. Nonetheless, the two projects have helped to bring Niger to the beginning of a new stage in the development of its national health systems and infrastructure.  While still fragile, the elements of a decentralized health management system are in place.  Valuable lessons have been learned from trials of service and management models, which could, with improved communications, be used nationwide.  While not deep, the pool of technical talent is of good quality, providing a sound base for expansion. Finally, motivation among decision makers is high, especially when they feel confident that funders are committed to true partnerships and building Nigerien capacity. The evaluation recommends continued nurturing, with TA and targeted budgetary support, of initiatives that are critical to the development and maintenance of a decentralized health system, i.e., of a national health information system, cost recovery at all levels, national population policy dialogue, demographic analysis, and operations research.  Efforts should be redoubled in areas critical to expanding access to and quality of services.  This means increased attention to the skills, attitudes, and supervision of service providers; reorientation of IEC to support national capacity building and community orientation; continued improvement in contraceptive logistics; and expansion of social marketing, along with its integration into the public health system.  Efforts to mobilize private sector participation in health services should be vigorously expanded. Future use of nonproject assistance as a funding mechanism should be weighed carefully; it should probably be used only to support implementation of policy reforms already adopted, until the government's capacity to deal with more complex schemes in enhanced.  In any case, all USAID support to Niger in the health and population sector should be offered under a single umbrella funding mechanism. Finally, careful and focused attention must be given to donor coordination.  USAID can set an important example by establishing rigorous interagency coordination mechanisms and standards for those organizations that use its funds and by ensuring close and continuous communications with the government. By clarifying its own programmatic priorities, USAID has positioned itself to play a lead role in developing an effective, forward-looking partnership between the international donor community and the Government of Niger.  No effort should be spared in moving this partnership forward.  Niger is at a point of great opportunity for strengthening its health systems; the country must have success in the near term or a still fragile opportunity could evaporate.  Failure to build vigorously on the steps taken under earlier projects would have serious consequences in terms of dwindling external support and further eroding the health care available to the people of Niger.

"Evaluates project to help Botswana's Ministry of Education (MOE) to develop and implement an integrated primary and junior secondary curriculum.  Summative evaluation covers the period from 12/92 to 9/95, when the project was terminated, 18 months early. The MOE, with help from project advisors, has taken solid steps toward the project's objectives of an improved curriculum, better prepared teachers to teach the curriculum, a continuous assessment system, and useful feedback on student achievement.  Progress is evidenced by new institutional processes and structures at the MOE's Curriculum Development Division (CDD), Examinations, Research and Testing Division, and Teacher Training and Development Department (TT&D).  These processes and structures lay the groundwork for sustainable long-term educational change, address concerns and issues expressed in the 1993 Report of the National Commission on Education, and are consistent with USAID's strategic objective for education (to increase the level and relevance of what students learn, their receptivity to additional training, and their preparedness for further education). The year 1996 will show the collective impact of the processes and structures which the project has facilitated.  In that year, a new junior secondary curriculum will be introduced; the first criterion-referenced certification tests will be administered, processed, and reported; and TT&D will have completed first wave training for all primary school teachers. The new 3-year junior secondary core subject syllabi will be introduced in January 1996, and CDD has plans and timelines for completion of addition syllabi and materials. Syllabi include coverage of work, gender, family life/population, HIV/AIDS, and environmental issues.  CDD's curriculum development process receives guidance from high-level interdepartmental committees and from the ""Curriculum Blueprint,"" a policy document developed under the project. The project has contributed to a comprehensive overall teacher training policy for Botswana.  The teacher training curriculum has been tied to revisions and innovations in the school curriculum.  Significant accomplishments include: development of a Management Manual for Teacher Training College, and of a diploma program in Primary Education at one Teacher Training Institute (with plans to expand to others); computer-literate staff at MOE headquarters and the College of Education; and plans for an Evaluation and Management Network. In the area of student assessment, significant accomplishments include development of a criterion-referenced Primary School Leaving Examination, which will be administered in 1996; a Criterion-Referenced Testing (CRT) training program in 41 pilot schools; training of 80 regional trainers in CRT, who then trained all Standard 5 teachers; and development of a feasible national CRT training program for all primary teachers. MOE staff were experienced and competent and project staff were all high-level experienced professionals.  Things to be done were clear to the MOE and were done right technically. The prospects for sustainability are excellent. The lessons learned are simple and few.  (1) Project managers need periodic formative evaluations.  Summative evaluations often turn out to be either post mortem analyses of why things went wrong or irrelevant seals of approval.  (2) There needs to be informative interaction among MOE, contractor staff, and USAID.  USAID was not kept informed about the nature of work going on or the quality of staff support given.  This was largely the result of not having periodic formative evaluations. Reference group meetings are never enough.  Day-to-day informal talk is needed to clarify technical issues and solve misunderstandings.  MOE and project advisors should meet informally and on an as-needed basis with the USAID Project Manager.  The notion that the Chief of Party alone deals with USAID is clearly inappropriate for this type of project.  No one person has that much technical ability.  (3) In a project such as this, all short-term consultancies must serve identified and expressed needs of MOE units.  The end of the project saw a rush of consultancies, some of which appear to have been shaky.  (4) When a systematic change as extensive as the one undertaken in this project is attempted, the public and especially the staff and professionals in the system must be informed early about changes that will affect them and their lives.  If this is not started early, confusion results and anxieties grow which can impede success.  CRT, for example, is a simple concept, yet teachers and even teacher trainers appear confused about it.","Delivery order no. 8|Project title: Advancing basic education and literacy 2 (ABEL 2)","Special Evaluation","Documents","HNE-5832-I-00-4016-00","","1/1/1996 12:00:00 AM","","Basic education|Curriculum design|Primary education|Institution building|Procedural development|Teacher training|Student evaluation|Lower secondary education","Botswana","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABM519.pdf","8,546 KB","001341 - Creative Associates International, Inc.

"Evaluates umbrella project to support Egypt's national family planning (FP) efforts.  The project comprises 8 subprojects, implemented by the Ministry of Health, the National Population Council, the Ministry of Information, and the private sector.  Mid-term evaluation covers the period 1992-3/96. The project is making good progress toward its targets for service volume, quality, and IEC.  The MOH infrastructure alone includes a vast network of 3,706 units; no one is further than 5 km from a health care source.  Focus has been on improving service quality and institutionalizing high-quality care and support systems.  Training of the system development SP staff and similar support provided to the clinical service improvement subproject and the teaching hospital organization SP have strengthened their capacity to offer quality services.  The project has supported an effective program of mass communication, local IEC activities, and interpersonal communication. Full and informed choice is an important dimension of quality and in the long term is indispensable to sustainability.  One concern is the heavy reliance on the IUD, although a recent dramatic increase in the use of the injectable is encouraging. A great deal of progress has been made in developing the mission, strategy, structure, staff, and systems in the subprojects.  However, the developments are scattered throughout the subprojects, and most of them need additional TA -- some short-term, some long-term -- for complete institutionalization. Although Egypt faces some difficult policy issues, there is no entity for which policy dialogue and formulation is a priority.  Without such ground setting, there is a risk that Egypt's FP program will be unprepared for the inevitable financial and sectoral changes to come (i.e., eventual removal of free contraceptives given by foreign donors and changes in national price control strategies in all sectors). It is crucial that the new Ministry of Population and FP (MOPFP) and/or the NPC retain a strong orientation toward policy, planning, and research issues.  The new Ministry is uniquely positioned to support the service and IEC activities of other ministries and agencies, to preclude duplication of efforts, and to help implementing agencies emphasize quality of service.  Support for new service delivery activities is not recommended, since coverage is adequate.  The pressing issues are service quality, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness. The project represents a radical change in management, with management placed under a single contract with 8 subprojects, unlike its predecessor, which had 24 subprojects supported through a series of cooperative agreements.  This umbrella mechanism has distinct advantages; it facilitates coordinated planning and implementation and helps to ensure complementarity and avoid overlap.  It also decreases USAID's management burden. USAID should retain the umbrella mechanism in the follow-on project, but consider a more flexible contracting mode. The rigidity of a contract forces a focus on deliverables rather than qualitative outputs and puts a heavy burden on all for detailed documentation.  Either a cooperative agreement or performance-based contract would provide much more flexibility and permit all concerned to spend more time and resources on the program instead of the process. An important lesson learned is that the time frame is too short. The project, initially conceived as a 5-year effort, has been compressed into less than 4 years.  This short period has forced an orientation toward detail (deliverables) and diverted attention from the big picture.  Five years is the absolute minimum for a program with long-term goals and vision; 10 years would be better.  This project should be extended and the follow-on designed with a 10-year time-frame.

"After more than 13 years of democracy, including three peaceful and democratic transfers of power, the Bolivian Congress is gradually turning its constitutional doctrine into a political reality:  it has finalized the selection of presidents, shown an increasing capacity to review and evaluate the national budget, and reviewed and approved legislation enabling economic and political reform.  USAID/Bolivia has promoted this development, since 1992 providing $2.4 million for training, TA, institutional development, and operating expenses, with another $1.8 million planned for 1996�97. Specifically, during the past 2 years, the Agency has helped the Bolivian Congress:  (1) establish a permanent congressional committee to direct the modernization of Congress; (2) approve the National Congressional Research Center, an in-house advisory service (analogous to the U.S. Congressional Research Service), to assist in carrying out modernization; and (3) create, through an arm of the State University of New York, the Technical Office of the Budget (OTP).  (Corresponding to the U.S. Congressional Budget Office, the OTP is bringing about greater government accountability and transparency.  In 1994, for example, it brought to light an error, subsequently corrected by the Ministry of Finance, of 200 million bolivianos (approximately US$43 million) in the 1995 budget. To ensure the sustainability of progress achieved, USAID/Bolivia has helped the Inter-American Development Bank develop and fund its own complementary program to help modernize the Bolivian congress.  Recent congressional approval of $500,000 to fully fund the National Congressional Research Center in 1996 augurs well, although challenges remain. Lessons for donors include the following.  (1) Regularly assess progress and risks, and modify strategies or activities to accommodate the ever-changing political climate.  (2) As an external entity in a sensitive political atmosphere, it pays to remain low-key and neutral. (3) Have at least one staffperson who is ""plugged in,"" knows key actors in the legislature, and can operate within a highly charged political environment. (4) Assess the state of political development of the legislature being supported from day one and keep an accurate chart of its progress.  (5) Stay small until there is evidence of sufficient interest within the legislature to ensure a commitment to change. (6) Foster multipartisan political commitment early on.  (7) Identify a primary area for initial attention and provide needed information and skills on a timely basis.  (8) If providing support up front for operating costs, weigh the associated risk for sustainability.  (9) Ensure that the initiatives proposed are fully endorsed by high-level officials.  (10) It is useful to take steps to assist legislatures through both internal and external channels.  (11) Donor coordination is critical.

"Evaluates project to support Zambia's national privatization program. Mid-term evaluation covers the period 1992-3/96. Following a slow start, which is not uncommon for privatization programs of this kind, the project is on track to achieve and exceed all of its substantial goals and objectives. The Government of Zambia (GRZ), USAID, the Zambia Privatization Agency (ZPA), as well as the prime contractor -- the Center for Financial Engineering in Development, Inc. (CFED) -- and the major subcontractors have performed strongly, especially given the serious initial constraints:  ZPA and CFED personnel turnover at the senior levels, political constraints (ZIMCO), the initial indecisiveness of the ZPA Board, and serious overall logistical constraints. If the project maintains its momentum, it could become one of USAID's most successful private sector initiatives in recent years.  As of 9/95, 31 companies had been privatized (vs. a life-of-project target of 50-75) under the ZPA program. Since the start of the CFED contract (2/94) trough 9/95, sales agreements had been concluded for 22 companies (vs. a life of contract target of 50).  In addition, 6 companies were dissolved or liquidated.  As of 10/95, privatization sales had raised some $26 million for the GRZ. ZPA marketing and promotion activities have correctly focused on both general investment promotion and individual company marketing and, despite a highly inadequate budget, have recorded notable achievements in both.  Efforts have been professional, cost-effective, and have generated direct buyer interest. ZPA's public awareness program has been a key factor in selling the privatization program to Zambian citizens; informing the public about privatization objectives and strategies was particularly crucial during the program's early stages.  Efforts included:  World Bank-funded radio programs; information brochures in seven regional languages and English; wide distribution a ZPA marketing brochure; television, radio, and print advertising; an essay competition; public fora on privatization; and radio and television talk shows. On-the job training of ZPA counterparts by CFED has led to significant skills transfer.  This on-the-job training has related to the entire ""transactions chain,"" including:  valuation methodologies and assessments; cash-flow analysis and net present value (NPV); business plans development and assessments; advertising and promotion of companies; ZPA Board submissions and presentations; scoring and ranking of bids; and transactions negotiations.  Formal training has included: highly effective workshops in negotiation skills by Ostrer and Associates, resulting in a solid cadre of independent negotiators; a CFED training program which has sharpened the privatization and transactions skills of ZPA staff; and third-country training of key ZPA staff and other Zambian officials. Other success factors have included:  (1) strong political support withing the GRZ and strong support from key donors such as USAID and the World Bank, both of which played a key role in liquidating ZIMCO, the holding company for many of the parastatals, which, until its liquidation, was an obstacle to the privatization process; (2) recruiting a top level Chief Executive; (3) a supportive legal/regulatory framework, along with a transparent divestiture process and the linkage of privatization to other macroeconomic and regulatory reforms; and (4) various implementation factors, such as the establishment of ambitious and specific targets and the emphasis on transaction results; the existence of a broad base of Zambian support through local stakeholder participation in various steps of the privatization process, and greater openness to foreign investment than in the past. A few critical policy issues require further attention:  minimizing asset stripping; cleaning up enterprise liabilities that may prevent companies from being privatized unless their debts are written down; minimizing the costs of paying severance to retrenched workers; and overcoming shortages of capital and liquidity.","Delivery order no. 23","Special Evaluation","Documents","PCE-0026-Q-00-3031-00","","3/1/1996 12:00:00 AM","","Privatization|Divestiture|Public enterprises|Domestic government programs|Negotiations","Zambia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABM571.pdf","3,253 KB","002851 - SRI International|007294 - Coopers and Lybrand","","008627 - USAID.

"USAID assistance to the Czech Republic has dealt with a number of problems in the country's shift to a market-based economy following the fall of communism.  One of the biggest problems in the transition was cheap energy, which USAID confronted with two projects.  The Emergency Energy project began in 1990 and was followed 6 months later by the Regional Energy Efficiency project.  The projects provided consultants, training, energy audits, and equipment in support of energy conservation at five industrial plants, as well as support for a nongovernmental energy conservation organization known by the acronym ""SEVEn."" The rationale for Agency assistance was economic:  if the Czech economy could use energy more efficiently, it could maintain economic momentum, advance economic restructuring, and deal with pollution problems. The projects demonstrated that energy conservation works. Companies that made energy investments saw very high financial rates of return, averaging 122%.  This represents financial costs and benefits directly related to the company and the energy it saves.  It excludes benefits flowing to the economy as a whole (reduced pollution, increased taxes) and costs to the economy and USAID for project management.  Including these costs and benefits yields an economic rate of return for the economy as a whole of 50% -- still a very good rate. SEVEn has played a major role in energy conservation.  Being separate from the government and special interests, it has been able to press the government for policy reforms while bringing together industry and energy service providers.  In most other countries USAID has had only fair to poor results working with government energy organizations. Working with a nongovernmental organization might provide a model worth following elsewhere. Energy conservation is more than a technical or engineering issue of making energy-efficient equipment available.  Business decisionmaking is influenced by prices, markets, and incentives. Under communism, Czech industry directed all attention at meeting production targets, not reducing costs.  Even now, with communism gone and with nearly free markets, the old business culture survives in many firms.  Moreover, it has taken the government several years to shift most energy prices to international levels. The government has stressed pollution control rather than energy conservation.  Stiff regulations and fines have forced factories to switch to cleaner fuels and improved burner combustion. Pollution control has done more than cut down on pollution -- it has discouraged wasteful and inefficient energy consumption. A factor impeding widespread success of the USAID project was limited dissemination.  The project succeeded at the five demonstration factories and with SEVEn, but the energy conservation message has been slow to spread throughout the country. The following lessons were learned.  (1) When firms are not oriented toward cost reduction, energy conservation measures are difficult to promote.  (2) Good energy conservation technology is not enough; effective dissemination through multiple channels is critical.  (3) Although energy conservation efforts are important, stressing pollution control through regulation may be the most effective way to cut harmful emissions and improve energy efficiency.  (4) USAID needs to decide on a clear strategy for test-marketing and dissemination. The sample might be a small number of major energy users or a large number of firms that are not energy-intensive, but not a small number of low energy users. (5) An uncertain economic climate will deter most investments, including those in energy conservation.  (6) Long-term energy conservation requires an independent regulatory body (a public utility commission) that supports economic prices, minimizes cross subsidization, has a framework for public participation, and develops rate structures that support conservation.

"Evaluates the reform portion of the multi-year (1992-95) Title III program in Ethiopia.  The reform strove to (1) liberalize food markets and develop a safety net program (SNP); (2) encourage privatization of the agri-based industrial sector; and (3) increase the private sector's role in domestic trade. Each component has made significant progress.  Market reforms have been successful, although the private sector, without considerable support, will not be in a position to meet the new challenge. Under the first component, the Government of Ethiopia (GOE) has greatly reduced its intervention in grain markets, thereby eliminating the distortions whereby producer prices were depressed and consumer prices were subsidized.  At present, subsidies are provided only through public or NGO-sponsored safety net programs and relief operations. However, this liberalization is difficult to attribute solely to the program, since the process began before its inception. Title III resources also helped the GOE establish a Food Security Reserve, which has enabled more timely allocation of resources to communities faced by periodic production shortfalls.  Despite implementation problems, food aid is now used more efficiently.   The SNP has generally succeeding in augmenting meager food supplies and has even introduced possibly more sustainable kinds of supports than simple hand-outs, e.g., revolving fund schemes and food-for-work activities.  Being only a 1-year program, however, the SNP met the needs of only a small portion of the food insecure population and was unable to meet the needs of the chronically poor. Under the second component, 250,000 metric tons of cotton provided by the program to public textile factories allowed recovery in textile production (which had sharply declined in 1992), albeit at high cost and low productivity.  Complementary market reforms and efforts to restructure public enterprises had mixed results, as high prices have accompanied the new opportunities for private investment in the textile and food processing subsectors.  Despite significant restructuring, public enterprises have not significantly improved their efficiency. Resources for the third component were funneled into the first two components. Overall, despite the success of market reforms, the private sector is in great need of support: the market is developing in a not wholly competitive way, with a few large enterprises dominating.  Moreover, there are few employment opportunities outside the public sector, as the rate of implementation for private projects is slow. The following are lessons learned.  (1) The program's strength lay in its ability to address short-term issues that arose as a consequence of reform.  But the real impact of basic economic reform measures are long-term.  (2) The SNP -- though constrained by its low coverage and short duration -- enjoyed the successes noted above and deserves continuance beyond 1 year.  (3) With the withdrawal of public enterprises such as the marketing parastatal AMC/EGTE, there is a need to work out operational modalities if such enterprises are to assume new roles in support of private enterprise and regulate the market.  The program demonstrated several market failures that arise with liberalization, including volatile grain prices, the limited capacity of the private agricultural and other sectors to keep up with agricultural production, and the tendency of smaller firms to be overshadowed by a few large trading houses. (4) Emergency assistance needs to be balanced with development assistance; Title III is considerably flexible and can support both types.  It is useful to note for the future that resources can be:  programmed in the form of project, sector, or non-project assistance; monetized to use proceeds for specific economic development activities, for sector support, or to support policy reform; distributed in direct feeding programs; used to establish emergency food reserves; or expended through a combination of any of these.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1996 12:00:00 AM","","Food for Peace Title III|Market economy|Economic reform|Food marketing|Private sector|Price supports|Subsidies|Food security|Agribusiness|Textile industry|Cereals|Agricultural markets|Agricultural prices|Privatization|Domestic government programs|Food aid programs","Ethiopia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABM589.pdf","4,576 KB","008543 - USAID.

"Evaluates the performance of five U.S. PVOs -- Aga Khan Foundation (AKF), CARE/US, International Rescue Committee (IRC), Relief International (RI), and Save the Children Federation (SCF) -- in providing humanitarian assistance and laying a foundation for economic development in Tajikistan from 1993 through 9/95. The USAID PVO program has contributed significantly to rehabilitating pockets in Afghanistan, mainly within Khatlon oblast.  Collectively, the five organizations have begun to address a range of pressing needs in such areas as water and sanitation, health, food, housing, income, and capacity building; they have also worked with a variety of vulnerable groups, including internally displaced persons (IDPs), returning refugees, and women and children.  The program has made the Tajik people feel that the  rest of the world, including the United States, is aware of their plight and is willing to help. While, given the lack of baseline data, none of the 5 PVOs was able to assess its broader impact (e.g., on long-term health status), output has been impressive.  AKF has fed 221,000 people and clothed 21,000 people; CARE has fed 250,000 people and provided a substantial number with medicines; IRC has provided 40,000 people with access to potable water and latrines; RI has restored health services for 260,000 people; and SCF has fed 27,000 housing reconstruction workers, provided 62,000 returned refugees and IDPs with shelter, and fed 71,000 school children. Only RI has had management problems requiring redress.  USAID management is satisfactory, but could pay more attention to the PVOs and their programs and objectives.  All the PVOs are capable of extending their programs into the development sphere, with most already beginning to do so. In addition, most of the PVOs have begun to provide training and TA to local NGOs (LNGOs) and/or community-based organizations (CBOs), which represent a potentially important development force in Tajikistan. The following are lessons learned.  (1) U.S. PVOs were an effective means for delivering humanitarian assistance in the emergency period following the 1992-93 civil war in Tajikistan.  However, Tajikistan will continue to require substantial levels of humanitarian and developmental assistance; given that the country is far distant and has weak infrastructure, this could be costly and difficult.  (2) Short-term humanitarian assistance efforts should not be overly ambitious (e.g., seek to have a long-term impact on health status).  Realistically, humanitarian efforts should seek to achieve immediate, measurable outputs (number of homes constructed, needy beneficiaries fed, etc.). Once longer-term development begins, attention can turn to longer-term goals and the development of baseline data needed to measure this type of progress.  The need to work toward the development phase was absent in the original grant agreements and in subsequent implementation supervision by USAID.  (3) AKF and SCF have improved the likelihood that their activities will be sustainable by involving LNGOs and CBOs early in their operations.  USAID did not focus adequately on the potential for building sustainability through the involvement of these indigenous groups.  (4) The lack of complete grant documentation and of progress reports to field representatives makes it extremely difficult to monitor project implementation and progress.","Task order 002","Special Evaluation","Documents","DHR-0037-C-00-5067-00","","3/1/1996 12:00:00 AM","","Private voluntary organizations|Civil war|War relief|Humanitarian assistance|Social services|Economic development","Tajikistan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABM640.pdf","221 KB","008485 - Basic Health Management International (BHM)","","009066 - USAID.

"Final self-evaluation of the El Salvador Rural Electrification Project (8/88-3/96) by the implementing agency, National Rural Electric Cooperative Association (NRECA). The project achieved and exceeded all of its outputs by wide margins. Savings in rural electric line extensions through innovative design methods resulted in increased resources which were redirected to TA, training, and other components. Impacts indicating broad-based economic growth include:  180,000 rural beneficiaries provided with electric service, which generated $79 million; $51 million generated by 12,000 microenterprises and 40,000 new jobs; 937,000 women-days saved through electric grist mills, and 30,000 additional garments produced per year due to electric sewing machines in women-operated cottage industries; $1,500 additional income per week for a total of 150 metal workers through more efficient electric sharpening of machetes, and savings of about 156,000 hours each year in grinding and mixing corn and mulch for cattle. The project also resulted in energy savings:  1,000 fewer MT of carbon emissions due to substitution of electricity for kerosene, candles, and firewood in cooking; 3,200 MT fewer carbon dioxide emissions through more efficient transformers and compressors for locally produced refrigerators; and 14,000 trees saved through innovative routing of electric lines.  The Salvadoran Center for Energy Efficiency, a local NGO, was created to promote energy-efficient technologies. The project promoted democracy-building by providing electricity to local municipalities, community centers, and other public facilities, extending electricity to former conflictive regions as part of the Peace Accords, and supporting the development of the first two electric distribution cooperatives in El Salvador. Many elements of the project are sustainable; most notably, electric service will be sustained by consumer payments of electric bills.  Local utilities have adopted new designs and standards, and 2,473 utility personnel have been trained in their use. Nonetheless, only 2 million of 3.5 million rural residents now have electricity. The following lessons were learned.  (1) Flexibility in management allowed the project to redirect saved resources and respond to changing conditions, including the Peace Accords.  (2) Through co-location with the counterpart, and joint productive uses, demonstrations, and objective site selection criteria, the project remained close to its beneficiaries.  (3) The project demonstrated the importance of rural electrification to achieving USAID's strategic objectives of broad-based economic growth (including micro-enterprise development and poverty alleviation), environmental protection through reducing greenhouse effects, and democracy-building by strengthening local municipalities and promoting cooperatives and NGOs.  (4) Rural electrification faces an uncertain future, with limited resources for infrastructure projects, privatization of utilities, and increased construction costs.  Some ways to respond to these challenges are:  placing more focus on rural communities for co-financing; using loans rather than grants; using lower-cost systems; and relying on NGOs to provide ongoing TA for rural electrification over many years.

"USAID's legislative strengthening project has helped the Government of El Salvador to reweave the country's political fabric in an atmosphere of national reconciliation and has supported the Legislative Assembly in its evolution from rubber stamp to independent body during a period of profound political change. The project, which is scheduled to end in 10/96, has met its goals. Seminars and workshops, study tours to foreign legislatures, information resources, and added staff have increased deputies' knowledge of their jobs, the legislative process, and the legislature's relationship with the executive and judicial branches.  As a result, the Assembly's deliberations have become more thoughtful and its relations with other branches of government more substantive.  Infrastructure improvements, such as additional offices, have enabled many members to work more efficiently and meet with constituents for the first time. A public awareness campaign has sparked growing citizen interest in the Assembly and increased contacts between constituents and members. As a result of the project, Assembly members have increased their influence in El Salvador's transition from authoritarian rule to democratic governance.  The Assembly has become a leading forum for debating national issues and exchanging ideas from all political perspectives, and is an emerging model of compromise, accommodation, and consensus building -- essential elements of the democratic process. The project has faced some hurdles -- chiefly, persuading the dominant party of the wisdom of sharing its power with other groups. Other problems have included underutilization of some resources (especially the library and the computers) and high turnover among legislative analysts hired under the project (in part due to tension with staff who had been there longer). Further, most bills still originate with the executive body, oversight is weak, and sometimes legislation passed needs to be revised due to flaws stemming from still-insufficient staff and deputies' inexperience.  In some instances, progress has been slow simply because democratic principles and processes are new to the Assembly. Lessons learned include the importance of taking into account the country's commitment to democracy, along with its political, social, and economic situation.  Other factors key to success are garnering support from key political leaders and providing a broad mix of assistance that benefits as many as possible.  The Salvadoran experience reinforced the importance of focusing on reforming the legislature to ensure that its operations embody the nation's commitment to democratic change. Bolstering the relationship of the legislature with civil society groups and the media, and challenging attitudes and beliefs that undermine an effective democratic legislature are also critical.

"Evaluates project to strengthen the capacity of Jamaican public and private organizations to manage the country's most economically important natural resources (DEMO project). Mid-term evaluation covers the period 9/92-3/96 and includes the PARC II component, which was added in 10/93 to help development a sustainable national park system. The DEMO Project (excluding PARC II) should achieve its principal objectives and purpose, especially that of enabling the Natural Resources Conservation Authority (NRCA) to assume a leadership role in policy, regulatory development and enforcement, and participatory planning involving a wide range of affected stakeholders. DEMO has helped NRCA to assume responsibility for formulating policies and regulations to guide the stewardship of Jamaica's environment.  Specifically, the project has helped the conservation authority to develop guidelines for conducting environmental impact assessments, complete a ""State of the Environment Report,"" develop an accounting system, and install a computer information system.  NRCA is developing provisions for regulatory enforcement.  They will be enacted once they are adopted as law -- a process that is well underway. DEMO has also helped NRCA to develop a ""National System of Protected Areas Plan,""  which proposes a policy for creating and managing protected areas which is expected to be approved by the Cabinet in mid-1996.  The protected area establishment procedure proposed in NRCA's policy has been successfully tested in Negril (through DEMO activities), enjoys widespread support by local government and NGOs, and is soon to be applied by NRCA in the Black River watershed and the Kingston Bay area. In addition, DEMO TA and training have strengthened the management capabilities of a range of environmental NGOs. This has been done principally through support to the National Environmental Societies Trust (NEST), an NGO umbrella organization which helps NGOs to develop project design and management skills so they can access grants from the Environmental Foundation of Jamaica.  As a result of NEST's assistance, about a dozen NGOs have received Foundation grants and are currently implementing community-based environmental improvement projects. In contrast, the PARC II component has accomplished little.  Neither of the planned parks have been created, no revenue generation programs are in operation at the two existing parks, and the Jamaica Conservation and Development Trust (JCDT) capital campaign to increase the Jamaican National Parks Trust Fund, with primarily USAID funding, was never undertaken.  The Jamaican National Parks Institute (JNPI), which was to have helped finance and oversee the management of national parks, was never created, and the Conservation Data Center has played no role in supporting protected area management.  PARC II's design was unrealistic. In particular, projections of the JCDT's ability to raise funds to support a park financing system were overly optimistic, and the Government of Jamaica never clearly and decisively acted to create the JNPI.  Instead of offering direct support for the creation of the JNPI, NRCA (for a variety of understandable reasons) actively pursued a more decentralized approach to the creation and management of a park and protected area system (with assistance from DEMO's SITE component). PARC II will need to make implementation and management adjustments if it is to reach its objectives.  In particular, efforts should be made to: strengthen NRCA's ability to establish, implement, and enforce parks and protected area policy; strengthen the park management capabilities of NGOs to which NRCA will delegate authority for park management; and develop a strategy to tap resources needed to finance protected area management in Jamaica.

"In recent years, donors, academics, development professionals, and members of Congress have recommended that, given the importance of grass-roots organizations, PVOs and NGOs should play a larger role in development and advocacy efforts.  This assessment examines the working relationship between USAID and the PVO/NGO communities, and suggests ways to improve the relationship.  It also looks at how USAID does business -- that is, at the processes involved -- as distinct from the development impact of USAID-funded PVO and NGO activities. Major findings are as follows.  (1) A lack of consistency pervades USAID's use of the various funding instruments; few practical differences exist in the management of grants and cooperative agreements, and many USAID project officers impose onerous controls on each instrument.  Additionally, there is a perceived contradiction between the presumed ""hands off"" management of grants and the Agency's accountability requirements.  (2) NGOs appear to have more difficulty than PVOs in meeting USAID accounting and financial management requirements, although lack of registration is not a major hindrance to obtaining Agency funding.  (3) Negotiation is seen as an especially difficult process, and goes more smoothly when USAID uses a team approach or when implementers have a single USAID contact person.  (4) Agency regulations seem too complex for small organizations to understand, and financial reporting requirements are excessive.  (5) Neither PVOs nor NGOs are significantly consulted in the development of USAID global and country strategies.  (6) PVOs and NGOs strongly support the concept of cost sharing, but would like more flexibility in its application.  (7) PVOs and NGOs are concerned about project sustainability, with beneficiary participation in project design and implementation seen as an important ingredient of success. (8) Compared with other donors, USAID's strengths are its in-country presence and its ability to directly fund indigenous NGO activities. Recommendations focus on immediate management actions which for the most part do not require revisions to the Agency's policies and procedures.

"PACR of a project (2/90-9/95) to increase the availability and utilization of family planning (FP) services in the Philippines by supporting the National Population Program (NPP). As a result of the passage in 10/91 of the Devolution Act, or Local Government Code (LGC), responsibility for the NPP was transferred from the Department of Health (DOH) to more than 3,000 Local Government Units (LGUs), none of which had any previous experience with health and FP programs and many of which did not view FP as a priority.  This unexpected turn of events caused numerous uncertainties and delays, but also provided a challenge which the project met by helping 30 carefully selected LGUs to design and implement a pilot decentralized, performance-based FP delivery program.  The lessons learned from this experience were used to develop the follow-on Integrated FP/Maternal Health Program for implementation in the remaining LGUs. Funding for this implementation shift and for substantially increased training (particularly training in injectable contraception) became available after the Global Bureau's Office of Population provided $11.786 million worth of contraceptives to the project free of charge. In the end, the project met all its major targets. It: (1) expanded the number of government/NGO clinics offering FP services to 3,297, vs. 3,000 targeted; (2) made voluntary surgical contraception available at 29 district hospitals (vs. 25); (3) provided clinical training to almost 61,000 public and private health professionals (vs. a target of only 20,000-25,000) although the training was not competency-based, a problem the DOH has agreed to correct in the follow-on program; (4) established a logistics system providing contraceptive supplies at 2,640 outlets (vs. 3,000 targeted); (5) produced 13 general and method-specific FP brochures (no target) as well as the three targeted media campaigns; (6) helped the Philippine NGO Council award 13 subgrants (vs. 10); (7) made FP information and services available in 61 workplace sites (vs. 98); and (8) established the planned contraceptive social marketing program. At the goal level, the contraceptive prevalence rate rose from 36.2% in 1988 to 50.8% in 1995, although most of the increase between 1993 and 1995 was in the natural FP methods sanctioned by the Catholic Church, whose strong opposition virtually halted the NPP during the last 2 years of the Aquino administration (1990-91).  Current estimates for total fertility rate (TFR) are unavailable; the most recent estimates show a TFR of 4.09 in 1991, well below the target of 4.21. The project taught numerous lessons, some (but not all) of which were used in designing the follow-on.  (1) Sufficient attention was not paid in the design to the sustainability of several key activities (logistics management, IEC, training), and as a result at PACD, none of these had full-time staff. (2) Assignment of counterparts to TA personnel should have been a condition precedent.  The Project Management Unit established at the DOH is staffed almost entirely by contract personnel. (3) Given the uncertainties about USAID and other donors, it is important to press the DOH to increase budgetary resources for the NPP, which up to now has been almost entirely donor-funded.  (4) Although the LGC is almost 5 years old, the roles and responsibilities of the DOH and its Regional Health Offices remain undefined.  Several management information systems are operational at the DOH, virtually all of them developed prior to passage of the LGC, and none of which are relevant or useful. (5) Clear guidance from the national level on service delivery polices and standards is essential for effective program implementation at the LGU level.  (6) Despite the project's best efforts, participation of the private and NGO sectors continues to be minimal.  Market segmentation is key to energizing these sectors.  (7) The case management approach used in the 30 LGUs should be reviewed to determine if it is the most cost-effective and efficient way to implement a performance-based FP and maternal/child health program.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","3/1/1996 12:00:00 AM","","Family planning promotion programs|Family planning services|Health care administration|Decentralization","Philippines","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABM677.pdf","1,248 KB","008592 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (1989-12/95) to expand the provision of family planning (FP) and health services by the Family Life Association of Swaziland (FLAS).  TA was provided by Pathfinder International, and to a lesser extent, the Program for Appropriate Technology in Health (PATH), and the Association for Voluntary Surgical Contraception (AVSC). Until January 1992, the project focused on strengthening FLAS's research and evaluation capability and clinical services, and on laying a foundation for improved information, education, and communication (IEC). Achievements included creation of a FLAS Research and Evaluation Unit and completion of a comprehensive study of FP attitudes, resulting in a new plan for IEC.  In January 1992, FLAS launched a pilot program to help industries to provide FP and AIDS/STD (sexually transmitted disease) education.  The program, which was implemented at four large and three medium-sized industrial sites, uses peer educators to promote contraception, distribute foams and condoms, and make referrals.  FLAS has also trained industry nurses in contraceptive methods, including IUD insertion. A 1993 project amendment eliminated the research and clinical objectives, which by then were well-established, expanded the IEC and industry programs, and added components to introduce voluntary surgical contraception and increase FLAS's self-sufficiency.  AVSC provided training in mini-laparotomy to FLAS and industry doctors and nurses. Currently, mini-laparotomy is offered in FLAS clinics and by all the doctors trained under the project.  Finally, project funds were used to purchase and renovate a house to serve as FLAS's Mbabane clinic, and to construct a headquarters for FLAS (completed 3/96). The primary lesson learned is the importance of continuous fund raising by the FLAS Board.  FLAS management waited until the end of the project to introduce cost recovery and earnestly begin their fund raising.  This has meant a hiatus in activities.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","3/1/1996 12:00:00 AM","","Family planning services|Family planning promotion programs|Indigenous private voluntary organizations|Institution building|IEC|Family planning research|Evaluation|Employer based delivery|Building construction|Sterilization (birth control)","Swaziland","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABM678.pdf","402 KB","008609 - USAID.

"PACR of a 1-year extension of a project to support the Business Management Extension Program (BMEP), an indigenous PVO that provides business management training in Swaziland. Because there were substantial grant funds remaining at the original PACD (11/94), a no-cost extension was approved, with a new PACD of 11/95. In June 1995, BMEP was reborn as LULOTE, which is an acronym for Program for Business Development.  LULOTE's aim is to help clients to transform their income-generating activities into small enterprises, by providing training, consultancies, and small loans.  LULOTE/BMEP developed a long-term strategic and marketing plan which has been instrumental in attracting new finance and creating a long-term vision for the organization.  In addition, BMEP received an E3.6 million grant from the Government of Swaziland.  As a result of these two events, LULOTE/BMEP is now a sustainable local organization that has the capacity to market its services and also has vast potential for moving into regional small enterprise training. It should be noted that no expatriate long-term TA was employed in the BMEP project. It has been managed throughout by Swazis, so there has been no crisis in management at the end of the project. The principal lesson learned is this: Management of a micro-lending operation -- a difficult task -- can be made easier if the organization has a strongly motivated Board to assist the director in defining the long-term direction of the organization, and in other key areas such as fundraising.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","3/1/1996 12:00:00 AM","","Business enterprises|Management training|Indigenous private voluntary organizations|Business support services|Institution building|Microenterprises|Commercial credit|Indigenization","Swaziland","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABM679.pdf","229 KB","008609 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (9/90-9/95) to combat AIDS and sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) in member countries of the South Pacific Commission (SPC) through community/public education. As planned, the SPC developed an AIDS/STD Information Exchange Center, which collected and cataloged books, posters, leaflets and other print materials, videos, audiotapes, condom packages and t-shirts, which can be copied or photographed on request, or used for displays.  The Center boasts extensive mailing lists, to which it has disseminated accession lists (with over 1,500 entries); separate accession lists for materials in French were distributed as well.  The project also developed information resource centers in each of the Pacific countries at National AIDS Committees or national libraries. The project also produced and disseminated a range of materials, including 11 issues of a quarterly AIDS/STD Pacific Bulletin (more than 9,000 copies of the latest issue were printed, in English and French), four posters (3,000 copies each), two comic books (10,000 copies), two videos, radio spots, materials for use by secondary schoolteachers, and items such as key rings and bookmarks promoting the safe sex message. The SPC small grants program made a significant contribution, funding 75 grants (generally under $5,000), with 17 more under consideration, in 20 Pacific Island countries.  Both NGOs and government agencies have received grants for, inter alia, drama projects, training of trainer projects (with teachers, persons in the prison system, and youth and women's organizations), resource libraries, educational materials development, and awareness seminars.  Detailed evaluations of the grants in five countries revealed a great deal of networking among government, NGO, and community entities, as well as an appreciation by government agencies of NGOs' ability to reach audiences at the grassroots level. Training included national and regional workshops and courses on AIDS education; observational travel within the region and to the United States, Australia, and third countries for selected national and community leaders; media training for NGO and other personnel; and workshops for communities and other target groups (this was the most common use of small grants funding). The most common training role played by the project was to provide observers, facilitators, or resource persons to training events organized by other agencies in the region.  Media training, which was implemented by the Regional Media Centre on the basis of the needs of health educators and broadcasters in the region, was the greatest success.  Radio training focused on the importance of a campaign style to address AIDS/STD issues and provided a large number of people with needed technical skills. The project also engaged in advocacy efforts with religious leaders and the media and was successful in promoting acceptance of the need for a multisectoral approach to AIDS prevention. The following lessons were learned.  (1) Meetings of the Technical Advisory Group (which included representatives of other SPC AIDS donors, such as Australia and WHO) were not held frequently enough to be useful, evidently because of the geographic dispersion of the organizations involved.  This problem was exacerbated when USAID shifted project management responsibilities to USAID/Philippines in July 1994.  (2) Given the expected financial shortfalls in the near term, it is important that the future management structure of the project be sensitive to these issues.  (3) Papua New Guinea's needs were so great that all the project's resources would have met only a small portion of them.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","3/1/1996 12:00:00 AM","","Disease prevention and control|HIV/AIDS|Sexually transmitted diseases|Health education|IEC","Oceania|Papua New Guinea","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABM681.pdf","513 KB","005093 - USAID.

"Evaluates the impact of the Agricultural Transport Assistance Program (ATAP), designed to improve rural roads in Tanzania.  Interim evaluation covers the period 9/87-1/96. ATAP has had significant impact at several levels. At the institutional level, ATAP has encouraged the Government of Tanzania (GOT) to:  consolidate road policy and management oversight into one ministry; transfer responsibility for construction and maintenance to the private sector; decentralize responsibility for road operations to regional offices; prioritize efforts according to social, economic, and environmental criteria as well as technical factors; review the sustainability of projects prior to funding; and increase the contract award authority of Regional Tender Boards from $10,000 to $1.0 million per project.  Each reform has dramatically improved the performance of road maintenance and rehabilitation. Additional reforms are in progress. At the financial level, significantly more funds are now available to pay for road maintenance.  Road users bear an increased share of the cost of maintenance, and the Ministry of Works, Communications and Transportation (MWCT) is spending Road Fund allocations in a more economical and rational manner.  The Tanzania Road Fund obtains its funds solely from road user charges, primarily from the Road Toll Tax, a flat tax applied to petrol products and diesel fuel,  This is a well-designed and -administered tax, and the Road Fund is one of the best established in recent years in sub-Saharan Africa. A major success was convincing the GOT to privatize road construction and maintenance.  The number of private road industry contractors has increased from 30 to 500.  These contractors are rehabilitating 1,700 km of roads, constructing/reconstructing 126 bridge projects, and performing design and construction supervision.  Routine maintenance increased from virtually zero in 1988 to over 4,800 km in 1994, and periodic maintenance from virtually zero in 1988 to approximately 400 km in 1994.  One drawback is the time it takes (occasionally over a year) to award contracts, which results in cost increases and contractor discouragement. ATAP-funded roadworks have had a profoundly positive effect on the income and social welfare of Tanzania's rural population.  Traffic on some routes has increased fourfold and passenger traffic up to tenfold; passenger fares have decreased as much as 30%, vehicle operating costs by up to two-thirds, and travel times by half.  Although  several small retailers have closed, they have been replaced by numerous other firms, including retail shops as well as vendors at community markets. Permanent retail shops along improved roads show increased daily sales from 50% to 140%.  Land values have risen significantly, often doubling or tripling, and farmers have taken advantage of reliable transport to diversify into more perishable, though more remunerative crops. Decreased local sales of alcohol are an interesting side benefit of the road improvement program, as rural populations can now easily sell their maize and do not have to brew it into beer to improve and sell it. Overall, there are increased sales of crops and increased access to agricultural inputs in areas affected by ATAP. Moreover, rural populations now have better access to health centers. People now by-pass ill-equipped local government hospitals and clinics in favor of better private and church facilities, though some of this increase must be attributed to the GOT's imposition of cost-sharing and the collection of fees for certain services.  In the area of one ATAP-rehabilitated road, daily attendance at a church-sponsored hospital is up by 30%, while the government hospital serving the same area reports a 70% decrease.  ATAP has also positive affected family planning services.  One key to sustaining these impacts and further improving rural roads is the continued use of local, labor-based crews for road maintenance. The program's successes can be sustained; ATAP-led policy reforms have provided the critical inputs required to construct and maintain rural roads.  However, the GOT is considering creating a new parastatal called TANROADS, which would increase emphasis on the use of direct hire or ""force account"" brigades -- even though there is a well documented history of failure in this type of  effort.  These two issues warrant USAID's continued attention.

"USAID's Technology Transfer for Energy Management Project in the Philippines (1986-92), designed to promote the adoption of energy-efficient technologies in the industrial and commercial sectors in the wake of the 1979 oil crisis, was successful in a number of ways. By project end, 30 technology demonstrations had taken place at the 17 participating companies, and financial payback periods ranged from 0.3 to 20.9 years, averaging 1.8 years.  All $2.4 million set aside in the development loan fund had been loaned and all loans repaid.  Taken together, the 17 companies saved 109,331 barrels of oil, valued at $1.9 million, per year.  The estimated financial rate of return was greater than 12% for 11 of the firms, and greater than 28% for 8 of them. Nonetheless, more energy could have been saved.  There are several reasons for this.  When the project was implemented, host government policy favored industrial energy users by taxing fuel oil less than other petroleum-based products.  The financial incentive for these companies to conserve energy was less than for other companies, and this was reduced further when the price of a barrel of oil dropped from $28 in 1984 to $13 and 1986. For the most part, the energy-saving technologies demonstrated under the project were technically and financially sound, though in some cases they had little replication potential or would probably have been adopted by the companies without project financing.  In addition, because the project did not market the technologies widely, there was little direct replication beyond the 17 companies.  Additionally, institution-building was unsuccessful in the private sector, where it was a high project priority, but successful in the public sector, where it was not a high project priority. The study suggests six lessons learned.  (1) Government and donor commitment to energy conservation is fundamental to project success. (2) Private firms need substantial financial incentives to invest in energy-efficient technologies.  (3) Such technologies will be replicated only if they have broad application, are cost effective, and are widely disseminated.  (4) The public and private sector have important, but different, roles to play in encouraging and implementing energy conservation. (5)  Pressure to disburse donor funds can be counterproductive.  (6) Energy-using firms consider the environmental benefits of energy conservation to be ancillary.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1996 12:00:00 AM","","Energy conservation|Energy technology|Technology transfer|Industrial technology","Philippines","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNABY206.pdf","186 KB","008058 - USAID.

"PACR of the Special Development Activities (SDA) II project (6/91-9/95) in Bolivia, which provides grants up to $10,000 to help small rural communities and local organizations to undertake self-help activities. The targeted number of self-help projects was reduced from 65 to 56 because of higher than expected costs.  Project beneficiaries implemented a total of 22 (vs. a targeted 35) water, sanitation, and health activities, 15 (vs. a targeted 19) school construction and remodeling activities, and all 15 targeted income-generating activities. A total of 94 rural communities, organized around some type of institution (e.g., education or agricultural board, agricultural union, artisan center) were provided assistance. In all, there were about 16,500 beneficiaries, 40-50% of whom were women. The project succeeded both in fostering democratization and improving the lives of its beneficiaries.  It encouraged participation by local governments and community organizations in support of Bolivia's democratic initiatives, and it helped to accelerate decentralization and enhance local decision making.  The project's water, sanitation, and health activities undoubtedly reduced the incidence of diarrhea, the leading cause of sickness and death in Bolivia, by providing safe drinking, cooking, and bathing water and constructing latrines and health posts.  School construction and remodeling, following better designs and structures, and the provision of equipment and faculty housing have motivated children to attend school and teachers to go the communities that offered the housing.  Small activities, such as construction of artisan centers and donation of small agricultural tools, have helped to diversify and increase beneficiaries' incomes. A follow-on project -- SDA III -- is planned.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","3/1/1996 12:00:00 AM","","Community self help|Democratization|Community development|Socioeconomic development|Community services|Local groups","Bolivia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABM729.pdf","160 KB","008515 - USAID.

"Between 1973 and 1996, USAID provided $685 million in non-bilateral economic assistance to the Commonwealth Caribbean (CARICOM) region, of which $450 million supported development in member countries of the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS).  This retrospective assessment chronicles USAID's program from 1978, the year it established the Regional Development Office for the Caribbean (RDO/C) as a full Mission, through 1994, when the program entered its close-out phase; focus on the Eastern Caribbean. The Caribbean Regional Program included five core portfolios:  (1) infrastructure ($194 million); (2) private sector ($170 million); (3) agriculture ($113 million); (4) training and human resources ($63 million); and (5) health and population projects ($36 million).  It also included $55 million in special assistance to Grenada following the 1983 U.S. intervention.  The program evolved in three phases:  political and economic stabilization (1978-83); economic growth (1984-91); and global competition (1992-94). On the whole, the program was highly successful, taking on unprecedented challenges and diverse issues and forcing governments, donors, and institutions to rethink their approaches to development.  In its early years, it successfully strengthened regional institutions, supported post-OPEC economic recovery in the small OECS states, and supported creation of the Caribbean Group for Cooperation in Economic Development (CGCED).  The program had a lasting demonstration effect on private sector government, largely through its investment promotion and productive sector efforts.  It strengthened OECS' capacity to address emerging trade, investment, and integration issues by helping the public sector to rethink conventional economic approaches and improve economic management systems. RDO/C was able to lead both the private and public sectors to place greater importance on human resources development through business management and skills training, and it helped the region make short- and long-term improvements in health, education, and infrastructure. Unquestionably, the Program had a positive impact on economic growth, especially during the 1980s, although targets may have been too ambitious given that the region did not have the capacity at that time to respond to the sudden trade and investment opportunities emerging out of the Caribbean Basin Initiative.  However, RDO/C's manufacturing investment and employment generation activities created business opportunities and increased jobs and export earnings.  Investment promotion efforts showed that the region needs to streamline its investment systems and adopt more favorable policies. USAID's export thrust identified the types of changes needed by the region to attract new investment (the region's failure to attract foreign investment in non-traditional agriculture confirmed its nascent status in that area).  These activities led OECS governments, particularly in the Windward Islands, to re-assess their longer-term productive sector strategies. Efforts to encourage market reforms were only marginally successful; this was a key USAID priority in the 1990s, but was severely compromised by the decision to phase out RDO/C operations. The following lessons were learned.  (1) Beneficiary countries are more receptive to programs that produce rapid results and reinforce established policies than they are to new ideas.  USAID produced more positive results in the areas of economic management, human resources, health, and education than in the productive sectors.  (2) The impact of capacity building is stronger than that of interventions to jump-start economic transformation.  RDO/C's most durable results came from increased institutional capacity and changes in orientation of both the public and private sectors.  (3) Economic transformation must be driven by the beneficiary countries themselves.  RDO/C's efforts to encourage market reforms and diversification were less successful than expected due to the absence of consensus about the importance and urgency of the changes.  This is especially true when countries lack the information systems and the human and financial resources to adopt such strategies. (4) Export and investment promotion efforts are important but not sufficient if the underlying policy framework does not provide a competitive advantage.  OECS' preferential trade arrangements for traditional crops and industries mitigated against adoption of competitive economic development strategies.  Consequently, without cost or other advantages to offer, efforts to stimulate investment faltered. (5) A regional approach to development assistance can be successful, at least where there is a regional identity and effort to address common problems through regional solutions. RDO/C's most important and durable successes were achieved in and through regional institutions.  The level of influence and resources the United States was able to bring to the program may limit its replicability.  Individual country Missions might have had more success in getting the national governments to adopt policy reforms, but this is far from certain.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","3/1/1996 12:00:00 AM","","Regional development|Economic development|Economic infrastructure|Private sector|Agricultural development|Personnel development|Technical training|Health care|Population programs|Economic policy|Policy reform|Political development|Economic stabilization|Economic competition|Economic impact","Eastern Caribbean|Caribbean|Antigua and Barbuda|Saint Kitts-Nevis|Dominica|Grenada|Saint Lucia|Saint Vincent and the Grenadines|Belize|Guyana|Barbados|Jamaica|Trinidad and Tobago","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNABY411.pdf","6,442 KB","005886 - Datex, Inc.","","007707 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of an OPG to Africare to implement an integrated health, water, and sanitation project in Beira and Chibabava District, Sofala Province, Mozambique.  The evaluation covers the period 9/93-4/96, against a PACD of 6/96. Well rehabilitation, water storage tank construction, latrine construction, and development of a fee system for water points were focused in peri-urban Beira, while health post rehabilitation was targeted at specific rural communities in Chibabava District. Information, education, and communication (IEC) activities have been implemented in both areas.  After the mid-term evaluation, the target number of wells and water storage tanks was reduced. The amended targets for facility construction will probably be met, and the construction itself is of high quality, with unit costs kept within acceptable limits.  The project's construction/rehabilitation of 3 health posts in Chibabava District provides the population with access to primary health care.  The health impact of well rehabilitation has been very limited, however.  Unfavorable geological and hydrogeological conditions, compounded by ubiquitous public defecation around the well sites, means that contaminated water will enter the shallow water table and then the wells, even though they have been properly rehabilitated. Proper use and care of latrines would improve the relationship between water and health. IEC at the community level was also conducted cost-effectively. However, targets for number of people to be reached and activities to be completed were overly ambitious.  It is the IEC component that ought to yield the project's greatest impact -- changes in living conditions, attitudes/practices, quality of life, and health status -- but whether this will be so, can only be known over time. Further, sustainability cannot be guaranteed, since there is no organization to follow up on the project's activities. The project developed a good relationship with the Technical and Commercial Institute; the involvement of many Institute students in the field during this program augurs well for future projects requiring the construction of wells, tanks, and latrines.  The coordination with Programa Latrinas Melhoradas (PLM) also proved productive in increasing the demand and use of latrines. The key recommendation is to identify a sustainable partner organization working in the field (e.g., PLM) to ensure project sustainability.  A no-cost extension, re-directing the remaining financial resources towards health education, is also highly recommended. The following lessons were learned.  (1) Developing strong relationships with many people and organizations facilitated the work. (2) A lack of knowledge of in-depth technical issues exacerbated problems encountered in the field. Specialized advice should be seen as an investment and sought when dealing with technical issues such as building construction and ground water.  Such an investment could have reduced the frustration involved in trying to complete the work and saved valuable limited financial resources.  (3) It is important to work with the community in choosing a community strategy.  (4) The transfer of technical expertise to the students who were involved and trained is a great contribution to society and provided mutual benefits.  (5) Targeted outputs must be feasible, attainable, and realistic if they are to be achieved.  (6) Achieving sustainability requires sufficient time for supporting and monitoring an intervention.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","656-0217-G-00-3022-00","","4/1/1996 12:00:00 AM","","Rural areas|Rural urban fringe|Water supply|Water supply structures|Water storage|Outdoor toilet facilities|Environmental health|IEC|Health education|Wells|Health facilities","Mozambique","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABM748.pdf","2,058 KB","000235 - Africare, Inc.","","008580 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (6/90-4/96) to provide training in areas critical to socioeconomic development to leaders and potential leaders in the Eastern Caribbean.  The project consisted of two components: Development Training; and the Caribbean and Latin American scholarship Program II (CLASP II), implemented, respectively, by the University of the West Indies (UWI) and Partners for International Education and Training. The development training component exceeded its numerical targets; 1,758 vs. a target of 800 individuals received in-country and regional training, with an additional 85 scholarships awarded for U.S. short-term technical training.  The public sector received 59% of the training, the private sector 36%, and NGOs 5%; males received 51% and females 49%. However, males actually predominated only in short-term regional training, with females receiving 54% of in-country awards, 75% of 1-year long-term awards, and 55% of 2-3 year long-term awards.  Long-term trainees totaled 110, with training taking place at all three UWI campuses and 11 other tertiary institutions.  Long-term trainees (for whom the program was the end of a long and persistent search for funding) consistently rated the program as excellent to good, and 54% participated in a follow-on activity. Long-term training was provided in the areas of public administration, education, engineering, business administration, community health management, agriculture, hospitality management, and computer science.  In terms of sector focus, all of the countries showed interest in agriculture and many showed interest in tourism.  In 1992, training was reallocated so that 80% supported two new strategic objectives of the Mission:  natural resource management and increased and diversified trade.  To encourage sustainability, the project targeted training towards managers, supervisors, teachers, extension officers, and community leaders, and established a public/private project advisory committee (PAC) in each beneficiary country to identify training needs, recommend training sites, and, in several instances, foster coordination among several participating agencies. The CLASP II component received $1 million in funding in 1993, but no additional funds were obligated because this component met with the same unpopularity as its predecessor, the Presidential Training Initiative for the Island Caribbean (PTIIC), which contained very stringent selection criteria and specific targets established by AID/W.  CLASP II upgraded the subject knowledge and pedagogical skills of 49 secondary school teachers from Dominica, who were trained at New Mexico State University with follow-on training in Dominica.  Dominican authorities have acclaimed this training effort as a total success. The following lessons were learned.  (1) In the development training component, the PACs were mechanisms for participative planning, information sharing, and linkages, and significantly improved the speed of information exchanges with collaborating agencies and persons.  (2) Short-term trainees were encouraged to identify a tangible and relevant activity which they could plan during their training and implement upon their return.  However, only about 50% actually implemented such activities; the main barrier appeared to be lack of support from employers.  A stronger follow-on component is needed and should include working with the trainees, their supervisors, and national training officers.  (3) Collaboration with donors funding similar training activities proved very cost-effective. Donor coordination in the area of human resources development needs to be strengthened.  (4) One way of multiplying impact is through information sharing.  Some of the project's conferences, seminars, and training programs produced manuals, discussion papers, or research findings which were beneficial to various audiences and even the general public.  In some instances, UWI project staff edited such documents and shared them with university libraries. (5) A number of programs (e.g., small business management) were in two phases, with trainees returning to their jobs in between to apply the skills they had learned. While this may cost a little more than a single-phase program, the trainees found it much more beneficial, since it allowed them time to apply and test plans, receiving confirmation or correction or consolidation in the final training phase.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","4/1/1996 12:00:00 AM","","Education for development|Scholarships|Participants|Leadership training|Management training|Technical training|Undergraduate education|Teacher education|Secondary schools","Eastern Caribbean|Dominica","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABM750.pdf","498 KB","001757 - USAID.

"PACR of the West Indies Tropical Produce (TROPRO) project (9/89-3/96) to help member countries of the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS) to increase non-traditional agricultural exports (NTAEs). TROPRO was a success.  It helped to increase export revenues by shifting the market thrust from the low-value United Kingdom market to the higher-value U.S. market and the growing intra regional market.  In addition, new markets and new products were identified as a result of TROPRO-supported trial shipments, and the quality of export products was improved through the adoption of OECS grades and standards and the distribution of posters and commodity specifications.  Sustainable improvements in packhouse operations were made on five islands due to extensive TROPRO inputs of training, packhouse equipment, and crop guideline posters.  As a result, the majority of OECS exporters now pack to international standard weights in product-appropriate cartons.  Since 1996, new commercial pre-cooling facilities have been available to exporters in Antigua, Dominica, Grenada, St. Lucia, and St. Vincent. Additionally, national exporters associations have been formed (though they are still in the early stage of development), and an increasing number of exporters are either becoming producers or are expanding their production, confident of their ability to retain their export markets. The project has also been a powerful agent for lowering air and sea freight rates to extra-regional markets.  A strategy of providing intensive assistance to selected commodities -- from the variety selection stage through to marketing -- has had a strong impact.  Hot peppers and mangoes are two such crops which have seen phenomenal increases in export volumes and values. OECS's Agricultural Diversification Coordinating Unit (ADCU) has been strengthened.  Staff were trained in the management of fresh produce export marketing, and in use of the marketing information system, which ADCU will continue to use to disseminate marketing information to exporters and producers. The following lessons were learned.  (1) Project management was improved by developing a consolidated implementation unit consisting of grantees, accounting staff, and the TA team.  During the first 3 years, the major implementors were scattered over four different islands.  (2) Earlier support should have been provided to high-value crops for the regional market, not only because of untapped opportunities, but because they faced the same variety and quality obstacles as in extra-regional markets.  Even maintenance of regional market share in ethnic produce is being eroded now by high-quality suppliers. (3) Training was initially handled through seminars in which most participants were from public support institutions, and learning was infrequently transferred to the private sector.  Emphasis changed over time to a one-on-one approach, e.g., utilizing postharvest specialists working alongside packhouse staff to carry out improved grading procedures.  These direct interventions produced much better results.  (4) A ""rollover"" fund established by the project to enable exporters to pay farmers and purchase inputs before receiving payments from importers was only partially successful, primarily because guidelines for accessing the fund were not always applied, resulting in some misuse, and also in rejections of some deserving requests.  However, several successful trading relationships (in hot peppers, Asian vegetables, and mangoes) were initiated as a direct result of the fund.  (5) Liaison with the Ministries of Agriculture improved when agricultural diversification officers were appointed within the ministries to directly work with the project.  This move should have been made much earlier.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","4/1/1996 12:00:00 AM","","Nontraditional exports|Export promotion|Agricultural product marketing|Management training|Institution building|Regional development|International trade|Horticulture|Fruit crops|Vegetable crops","Eastern Caribbean|Grenada|Saint Vincent and the Grenadines|Saint Lucia|Dominica|Antigua and Barbuda|Saint Kitts-Nevis|Montserrat","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABM751.pdf","238 KB","001757 - USAID.

"Since 1990, as part of its effort to help Hungary shift from a centrally planned to a market economy, USAID has undertaken projects to combat energy inefficiency, a legacy of the communist era.  The projects, which targeted companies where energy is a major share of costs and which consequently had a strong incentive to make energy efficiency investments, demonstrated that energy conservation works. Factories that made investments were on average able to pay for their investments in just 2.4 months with the money saved by burning less fuel, and experienced a financial rate of return of 485%.  Even from the perspective of the national economy, investments generated an economic rate of return of 165%.  Moreover, the investments helped to reduce air pollution.  The USAID projects were concerned not only with energy conservation ""hardware"" -- installing more efficient burners, motors, or pumps -- but with the even more important ""software"" issues of energy management; one of the most crucial aspects of the projects was the introduction of new ways of thinking about energy management, finance, production monitoring, and maintenance -- which is often more difficult than just buying a new motor.  However, the projects were less successful in spreading the energy conservation message beyond the eight demonstration companies.  Hungary shows no overriding concern for the environmental effects of energy production.  Not only are Hungarian institutions and markets weak, but as long as energy is relatively cheap, there is little incentive to use it efficiently.  Only when the market provides an opportunity to make money will the demand for energy conservation become widespread.

"Final evaluation of a project (9/94-3/96) to provide rapid, time-limited, and visible assistance to help restore democratically elected government and promote popular political participation in Haiti. USAID's newly established Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) implemented the project through a cooperative agreement with the International Organization for Migration (IOM) implemented the project. Despite a difficult political and economic situation, both the in-country OTI coordinator and IOM management and field staff have performed with overall excellence, and the project has met its goals and objectives.  While the restoration of the Aristide government was brought about primarily by the arrival of foreign troops, the project has supported the democratization process by:  quickly providing badly needed material resources to help local organizations begin improving their communities; providing Haitians with a means to express themselves freely with one another and their local representatives; promoting decentralization by working directly with local community groups and local officials; and injecting transparency and accountability into programs and transactions using community resources.  Despite initial and well-justified skepticism, the project has initiated an important process of rebuilding confidence in local government and has laid the foundation for further democratization activities. Remarkably, OTI and IOM are providing highly valued assistance to all regions of Haiti and to 113 of the country's 133 counties, engaging more than 2,000 community groups representing some 50,000 Haitians.  Although earlier USAID projects had achieved similar geographical spread, this project has been unusual in the variety of projects that it has funded and the speed with which it has moved.  Popular reaction to the project's 1,900 micro-projects, particularly Phase I activities (schools, roads, water) has been very positive; the project is uniformly praised for the rapidity of its response to proposals, the absence of hidden personal or political criteria in the micro-project approval process, and its full compliance with all agreements.  Micro-projects were equally responsive to men and women, and primarily to children. While there is some tendency for projects to be located in urban sites versus rural ones and along roads and accessible tracks, this seems unintentional and related to management and time considerations. From the planning stage to the on-the-ground operational period, OTI and IOM have closely coordinated their efforts with U.S. and other foreign military.  As a result, military and civilian counterparts have shared expertise and complemented each other's efforts.  The project is especially profiting from the security umbrella and the logistical and transportation resources of the military. USAID's challenge is to now to build on the project's successes, including the transfer of certain functions to other USAID, Haitian, and/or donor activities.  For example, the experience of the Communal Improvement Committees, a temporary mechanism to involve local officials in decisions about the use of funds, should not be lost when the committees disband. The following lessons were learned.  (1) USAID should be commended for making adjustments needed for a quick response in Haiti.  Its interventions would probably not be feasible for a more typical in-country Mission or where there is no resident Mission.  Although OTI should be encouraged to integrate more of its operations with other parts of USAID (and vice versa), it deserves particular recognition for the success of this project.  (2) The ""notwithstanding"" authority in the use of special funding gave OTI an important advantage in speed and flexibility.  It should be used elsewhere to expedite the delivery of development assistance.  However, OTI should also strive to incorporate more of the sound development criteria and management practices of USAID's traditional operations.  (3) The feasibility and utility of military and civilian cooperation in assistance activities was well demonstrated.  The military provided transportation and other logistic support to OTI/IOM projects, and their mere presence offered civilian counterparts a security that was vitally important.  Such assistance may be essential in similar circumstances before development activities can really get underway and have an impact.  In turn, U.S. Special Forces and Civil Affairs units were helped by the financial resources and on-the-ground knowledge provided by the USAID/IOM staff.  Such linkages can and should be pursued in other settings where both civilian and military personnel are present.  (4) The well-received shift in emphasis from civic education to small projects contains a generic lesson. Democratization efforts in an impoverished setting such as Haiti are effectively pursued through concrete and adequately funded activities yielding tangible benefits.  (5) Under conditions of institutional chaos, it is possible for USAID programs to provide resources to local communities without passing through normal channels of the host government.  Particularly, where there is either no or weak local government, a multi-faceted approach involving NGOs and government and continued management of funds by USAID is a very useful check on the deficiencies of governmental structures while providing real benefits to the people. Following the evaluation, the project was extended 9 months to 12/96.","Delivery order no. 24|Project title: Implementing policy change (IPC)","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","AEP-5451-I-00-2049-00","","4/1/1996 12:00:00 AM","","Democratization|Internal conflict|Institution building|Popular participation|Public administration|Decentralization|Local level|Community participation|Political participation|Community services|Military assistance|Governance","Haiti","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABM768.pdf","3,119 KB","003970 - Management Systems International, Inc.

"Evaluates activities by the International Republican Institute (IRI) and the National Democratic Institute (NDI) to strengthen democratic institutions in Albania, Bulgaria, Ukraine, and Lithuania.  Evaluation covers the period 1991-1996. In Albania, IRI has been effective and its policy of working with all political parties successful.  Training has been well-focused; adoption of new skills and behaviors has been tracked via a strong evaluation system. IRI's activities have helped to democratize Albanian society. The currently high level of receptivity and absorptive capacity will begin to diminish, however.  The coming election, a watershed event in the development of Albanian democracy, may or may not realign political power.  In all likelihood, political party training should be scaled back after the elections; with the next elections not scheduled until 1998, receptivity in this area is likely to diminish drastically.  If parliamentary receptivity is also low, IRI should not keep a representative in-country; if it does, it should strengthen its already close ties with NDI.  The two institutes should move from the ""push-pull"" strategy to a ""hand-in-glove"" strategy. Since beginning its activity in Albania, NDI has focused on creating an indigenous NGO, the Society for Democratic Culture (SDC), to monitor elections and promote civic education.  SDC has shown sustained progress in regard to election monitoring, and the civic education function, while difficult to evaluate, appears successful if measured by the number of significant events that the SDC has promoted at the local level. In Bulgaria, IRI's program has been most effective during two key periods:  1990-91, after the fall of Communism, and 1995-96, largely due to the fluctuating receptivity of the democratic parties. Paradoxically, the democratic opposition seems to have required several years of disunity and electoral failure before becoming open to the practical reforms IRI has been offering. There is no guarantee that this openness will continue, but IRI is now in position to strike while the iron is hot:  relatively pragmatic and receptive political figures are in ascendance and the coming presidential election has focused the collective mind of the opposition. The objective institutionalizing election monitoring capacity as a cornerstone of the electoral process in Bulgaria has been accomplished. The Bulgarian Association for Fair Elections and Civil Rights (BAFECR), supported by NDI, is recognized as an nonpartisan, technically competent institution, though questions remain about BAFECR's long-term ability to finance operations. NDI's contribution to BAFECR has been timely and highly satisfactory. Ukraine's political environment is extremely difficult in which to work.  Parliament is obstructionist in nature, and most Ukrainians are deeply suspicious of the political process, a feeling intensified by the failure of political leaders to implement meaningful reforms and by a series of pointless by-elections.  In response, IRI has focused almost exclusively at the local level and in a limited number of cities, so as to have an identifiable, if modest, effect.  IRI's training activities are well-executed. NDI's parliamentary effort in Ukraine seems to be reasonably well-organized and on track.  Its civic organization component is effective with respect to its general NGO development aims, and it deserves particular credit for nurturing the Committee of Voters of Ukraine (CVU).  NDI's work with the CVU rests on the assumption that there is room in the Ukrainian political landscape for such an organization; however, the evaluation encountered strong resistance to this idea from a wide range of Ukrainians on the political scene. With regard to political party training and other local training efforts, NDI's objectives, activities, and target cities have undergone almost continual change.  While it is laudable to have flexibility and ambitious objectives, to be effective a program needs consistency and focus.  NDI has been trying to do too much in too many different realms. Instead of the synergistic effect NDI hopes to achieve from its ambitious program, there is a dilution of impact. With regard to NDI's local government initiative, having two advisors in the same city must be deemed redundant unless close coordination has been undertaken between the two grantees, and the latecomer grantee (NDI) has made a convincing justification for doubling up scarce resources.  NDI has not done this for its program in Lviv. In Lithuania, IRI has effectively transmitted political skills, but has not created a mechanism to allow Lithuanians to transmit those skills on their own.  There is both a need for and a high degree of receptivity toward such training. NDI is well situated to reach into municipalities using the Municipal Training Center and the Association of Local Authorities of Lithuania. There is a reasonable chance that in partnership with these two institutions, NDI may effectively affect selected municipalities in promoting greater citizen participation in local government. Lessons learned include the following.  (1) The level-the-playing-field policy is a high-cost strategy which should be reviewed regularly to see if it can be dropped in favor of a nonpartisan approach.  (2) Training to strengthen political party organization at the grassroots was universally judged as having significant impact; however, objective criteria should be established.  (3) Training of trainers should be considered to institutionalize the training provided by IRI and NDI to indigenous political parties.

"PACR of a child survival program (10/89-3/95) in the Philippines. The PACR has two parts, covering (1) the original program period (10/89-12/93) -- see PD-ABM-027 for an evaluation abstract covering this period; and (2) supplemental assistance (1/94-3/95) provided to the Philippine Department of Health (DOH) to strengthen the capabilities of local government units (LGUs) in the area of child survival -- covered in this abstract. During the supplemental assistance period, the program provided TA to the DOH in several technical areas.  When Depo-Provera (DMPA) was approved for use in the Philippines in 11/93, the DOH, with program TA, developed and implemented a plan to introduce DMPA throughout the country.  DMPA was included in the contraceptive social marketing project, and 5,027 doctors, nurses, and midwives were trained in its use by 3/95.  Mechanisms are now in place to ensure the availability of DMPA and of trained LGU-level personnel to administer it. The program also provided TA to help the DOH in its campaign against vitamin A, iodine, and iron deficiencies.  At its annual National Micronutrient Day in mid-October, the DOH distributes Vitamin A capsules to children aged 1-5, iodine capsules or iodized oil to mothers, and vegetable seed packets and malunggay cuttings to families.  A surveillance system monitors adverse reactions to the high dose Vitamin A capsules, and informational booklets are disseminated to workers and community volunteers.  The program, which reaches 90% of the targeted children with Vitamin A capsules, has been authorized for another 3 years. In addition, the program assisted the 20 LGUS selected to participate in the DOH's LGU Performance Program (LPP) in developing their family planning/maternal child health plans.  In 1995, the 20 LGUS received a grant from the DOH to implement these plans.  The program also helped develop sustainable information strategies for the LPP, using a buy-in to the Data For Decision Making Project to provide TA to the DOH in establishing a rapid appraisal system for two regions (Cordillera Autonomous Region and Bicol Region).  This involved establishing a set of consensus health indicators, setting up computer workstations for data analysis and interpretation, developing communication tools to enhance dissemination of information to key decision makers, and providing management training to LGU officials and staff. Finally, a program advisor helped the DOH design a Women's Health and Safe Motherhood Project, which will be funded by five other donors. USAID's follow-on program -- Integrated Family Planning/Maternal Health (4920480) -- will adopt the performance-based disbursement mechanism and most of the implementation mechanisms employed under this program.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","3/1/1996 12:00:00 AM","","Child survival activities|Project sustainability|Institution building|Government departments|Decentralization|Local level|Maternal child health care","Philippines","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABM782.pdf","1,864 KB","008592 - USAID.

"PACR of a program (8/89-1992) to support economic policy and administrative reforms in the Philippines. The program's conditions were met, disbursements were carried out more or less as planned, and almost all of its goals were met.  Several problems in meeting policy targets arose, but all except one--increasing the number of VAT (value-added tax) filers to 78,000)--were resolved without significant difficulties.  The Government of the Philippines (GOP) felt the VAT target was unrealistic (the most likely reason the GOP had accepted the target in the first place was lack of clear communication).  In any event, USAID's withholding the disbursement of the third tranche and then disbursing less than the full amount may have caused GOP resentment out of proportion to the importance of the target (particularly considering the VAT revenue increase target was met). Alternatively, it may have provided a useful lesson that policy targets are to be taken seriously.  Regardless, USAID/P should have affirmed the feasibility of the target before imposing it. The transfer of program resources and the policy reforms had a considerable impact on the Philippine economy.  The disbursement of $218 million, of which $169 million was disbursed in 1989, reduced the balance of payments deficit by 10% in 1989, and the registered national budget deficit by 16%.  Using a macroeconomic model to calculate the effects of each of the policy targets that could be quantified, the combined effect can be summed up as a 0.25% increase in GDP growth trend.  Associated with this increase were positive effects on revenue, employment, and the current account.  These calculations also permitted the conduct of standard economic appraisal, the first such application for a cash transfer program in the Mission. In sum, the program assisted the GOP in undertaking macroeconomic and structural policy reforms, and promoting efficiency, competitiveness, and privatization.  Its objectives were in line with USAID priorities and also well-suited to the Philippine economic system.  The key to the program's success was the selection of limited but achievable objectives related to the implementation of macroeconomic and structural policy reforms already adopted by the GOP.  In fact, it is a tribute to its concept and design that the program was successfully implemented during a period when the IMF's Extended Fund Facility (EFF) program had gone off track. The basic mechanism used to accomplish program objectives was the incorporation of these objectives in a policy matrix and the use of policy conditionality in second and third tranche disbursements.  The performance indicators in the policy matrix were clear, specific, and precise, and in retrospect, proved reasonable and realistic, given the good record of fulfillment of all performance indicators except one. The Mission also carried on a continuing, intensive dialogue with the GOP on a wide ranging policy agenda; as a result of this and other donor efforts, the GOP has usually taken public positions in principle in favor of the kind of policy reforms advocated by USAID, the IMF, and the World Bank.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","4/1/1996 12:00:00 AM","","Economic growth|Economic policy|Policy reform|Policy dialogue|Economic administration|Nonproject assistance","Philippines","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABM783.pdf","349 KB","008592 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to improve the provision of family health care services by the public and private sectors in Jordan.  Mid-term evaluation covers the period 8/90-5/96. Despite some delays, the project should achieve its goals, provided recommendations are implemented.  The original design was modified for several reasons, including changes in the Government of Jordan's (GOJ's) policies and USAID/J's strategic objectives and the World Bank's interest in restructuring the Jordanian health sector.  Currently, the project has two major components.  The first (and largest) component, Family Health Services Delivery, includes quality assurance (QA) and family planning (FP) activities and the Family Medicine Specialty training program.  The second provides assistance to NGOs, including the National Population Commission (NPC) and the Jordan Association for FP and Protection (JAFPP). The family health services/FP component has some work to do if it is to meet its objectives. The Ministry of Health's (MOH's) Monitoring and Quality Control (MQC) Directorate, which is expected to assume full responsibility for QA once the project ends, needs more TA to improve its capacity and to clarify its role and its relationship to other MOH directorates.  In the Balqa Governorate, where the pilot QA model hospital and Maternal Child Health/FP (MCH/FP) Center were started, the QA concept has been embraced with enthusiasm.  In fact, the ground is very fertile for QA in all governorates, and there is great potential for improving the quality of care in such an atmosphere.  In the last year, the project has begun to expand beyond Balqa to two other governorates.  To assist in meeting USAID/J's strategic objective of increasing the practice of modern family planning, this expansion should place primary emphasis on MCH/FP centers and birth spacing and less on hospitals.  To ensure that the concept of QA is institutionalized, TA needs to be provided until the end of the project; 5 years of continuous TA may be needed to establish a national program of this size. The Family Medicine Specialty Training Program aims to create a new cadre of certified family medicine practitioners by establishing training programs in the University of Jordan (UOJ) and the Jordan University of Science and Technology (JUST), as well as to strengthen continuing education in this specialty.  The program has several potentially serious problems:  (1) the curriculum and training program used at UOJ and JUST do not comply with the accreditation standards of the Jordan Medical Council; and (2) the faculty at the two institutions are not adequate.  Sponsoring newly graduated doctors for U.S. training in family medicine has failed.  Alternatives need to be found immediately. Under the second component, JAFPP activities are on schedule; the five authorized new clinics are open and functioning, other quality of care activities are progressing, and there are no serious problems.  The NPC subcomponent is just getting underway.  The grant was signed in May 1995, with TA to be provided by the Johns Hopkins University Population Communication Services.  The activities will be mainly institution building and the implementation of a mass media campaign complemented by advocacy activities.","Project title: Population technical assistance (POPTECH)","Special Evaluation","Documents","CCP-3024-Q-00-3012-00","","5/1/1996 12:00:00 AM","","Public health care|Family health care|Family planning services","Jordan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABM788.pdf","1,065 KB","008485 - Basic Health Management International (BHM)","","008234 - USAID.

"Evaluates the performance of Macro International, Inc. in implementing the Demographic and Health Surveys Project (DHS-III) during the first 3 years (1992-95) of a 5-year contract. Macro has continued to produce high-quality DHS's which have become accepted as a global standard for population, health, and nutrition (PHN) surveys, and are used by USAID, host countries, and other donors in program planning and assessment. Macro has added more coverage of health issues, but many health professionals still consider the DHS to be essentially a demographic survey.  Also, there are a few areas where potential users question the validity of DHS measures (e.g., immunization prevalence), a problem which could be mitigated through corroboration with other surveys and through an independent review of survey operations in a few countries. Measurement of progress towards contract goals is difficult, since the exact number of surveys was not specified in the contract (e.g., ""approximately 20 surveys,"" and ""up to five special surveys"").  Also, surveys are being implemented more slowly than expected, which may lead to overscheduling during the last 2 years of the contract.  Macro feels confident the surveys will be completed on time. While progress is being made on post-survey tasks such as dissemination and data analysis, these have been given significantly lower priority.  As funding gets tighter, even less emphasis is expected to be given survey analysis and utilization activities.  More attention to local capacity building is also needed.  The contract provides no strategies to guide capacity-building efforts.  Analysis and software workshops are on hold because of funding concerns and questions about their value.  The DHS Fellowship Program has had little impact -- none of the six Fellows funded under DHS-I and DHS-II are working in their home countries, and the four being trained under this contract are also unlikely to return home.  However, Macro has effectively trained subcontractor or implementing agency staff in some countries, largely as a by-product of doing the surveys and preparing reports.  More experienced subcontractors, like those in Bangladesh and Egypt, say they can now conduct DHS surveys, but would need TA in areas such as sampling design and further analysis.  In addition, Macro has developed high-quality documentation that could be integrated into a survey management guidance package to help cooperating country staffs improve their survey capacities.  At this advanced stage of the DHS (Year 12), action plans should be prepared for capacity-building in priority countries to ensure the continuation of DHS operations. Many USAID staff, under recent pressure to collect more short-term program monitoring and progress data, have requested that the DHS add new topics or conduct more frequent surveys.  USAID and Macro need to decide how to accommodate such demands, given existing survey commitments. Several Mission and Washington staff have noted the need to reduce the high cost of the DHS surveys.  Costs might be reduced by developing less expensive survey designs, coordinating USAID-funded PHN surveys more tightly, and attracting more resources from host countries other donors; thus far, DHS has been primarily a USAID-funded and -managed project.","Project title: Population technical assistance (POPTECH)","Special Evaluation","Documents","CCP-3024-Q-00-3012-00","","5/1/1996 12:00:00 AM","","Demographic surveys|Health surveys|Population surveys","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABM789.pdf","1,493 KB","008485 - Basic Health Management International (BHM)","","008234 - USAID.

"PACR of a grant (1/90-12/94) to the International Executive Service Corps (IESC) to help Costa Rican businesses to develop new industries and export markets for industrial and agro-industrial products. IESC succeeded in helping local companies to overcome production, quality, management, and market constraints. A 1993 evaluation concluded that 93% of the companies assisted by IESC had improved their technology, reduced production costs, increased efficiency, upgraded quality standards, or strengthened their management capability.  More than 20% of the companies surveyed had increased exports. In all, IESC assisted 69 companies and institutions (80% of target); approximately 75% of the volunteer assistance was provided to companies and institutions working for the nontraditional export (mostly industrial export) market.  IESC completed 20 (vs. 18 targeted) American Business Linkage Enterprise (ABLE) projects (in which an IESC volunteers worked in the United States to investigate problem for Costa Rican firms). The Costa Rican Coalition for Development Initiatives (CINDE) became IESC's main client, requiring 40% of IESC's assistance.  CINDE's projects had a multiplier effect, as each IESC volunteer working with CINDE collaborated with 3-6 companies recruited by CINDE's Impulso Industrial Program aimed at developing local export capacity.  However, as CINDE's programs became smaller due to the elimination of USAID funding, CINDE reduced and finally eliminated requests for IESC assistance.  Restrictive conditions in the Costa Rican economy further reduced the demand for IESC services. After the grant ended, the price of IESC services rose, and only 5 projects were initiated in 1995, vs. 30 during each of the grant years. The client profile also changed, as only the larger companies could now afford IESC services (under the grant USAID subsidized 66% of the costs for beneficiary firms).","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1996 12:00:00 AM","","Business support services|Export promotion|Nontraditional exports|Industrial productivity|Management training","Costa Rica","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABM849.pdf","117 KB","008533 - USAID.

"Evaluates project (SOMARC III) to promote contraceptive social marketing (CSM) programs in developing countries, including social marketing of longer-term family planning (FP) methods. Interim evaluation covers the period 9/92-5/96. The project is on track, and the demand for SOMARC's activities has been greater than expected.  Successful efforts have been made to develop longer-term FP methods and to initiate a new marketing venture. Particular success has been achieved in training, public relations, and collaboration with HIV/AIDS prevention programs.  Linkages with the Association for Voluntary Surgical Contraception (AVSC) have been less successful. Contacts with commercial suppliers of contraceptives have met with varying degrees of success in various countries. SOMARC's management is highly qualified and its personnel are dedicated to the project.  A fourth regional office has been opened, improving management communications at the country level.  Training of local management has taken place, but there is still a need for more cross-fertilization of ideas and experiences not only with SOMARC country advisors but also with the cooperating agencies.  A financial management information system (MIS) is now in place. Extensive market research has taken place.  Efforts have been made to explore global and regional branding, with some success in the latter; global branding seems less worthwhile. Public relations programs have been well developed, and can be used to counter social and religious constraints to contraception. Implementation of a strategy to promote longer-term contraception has been a little slower and less consistent than desired.  Recorded couple-years of protection (CYP), in terms of products sold, increased dramatically in 1994, with IUD sales doing particularly well.  More attention needs to be given to launching Depo-Provera, and this is in fact being done, with launches imminent in eight countries. In terms of marketing, there have been some notable successes and considerable experience gained.  Great care is needed to ensure quality of care in situations where SOMARC provides short-term marketing TA and also where it has a more direct implementation role.  Training is being carried out, but monitoring of activities to ensure continued quality of care needs to become a regular part of SOMARC's tasks.  In cases of Mission buy-ins, it is important to establish criteria at the outset to ensure that SOMARC's services are optimally utilized and that the cooperating agency is equally accountable for the funds being expended. Budgeting was difficult during the early stages, due to delays in approval of buy-ins, but the overall budget is on track.  The recently revised USAID budget procedure will significantly reduce the amounts received from buy-ins, which in turn will increase demands on the central level and reduce the availability of future funds for management and TA; an amendment is needed to raise the core funding ceiling to accommodate these changes.  Also, a mechanism is needed to cope with the likelihood that no-cost extensions -- a regular feature of SOMARC to date -- may be more difficult to obtain in the future. Self-sufficiency has proven highly dependent on the nature of each country and each project.  Of the 20 SOMARC III country programs examined, 4 have only just started; 9 are first or second generation models at less than 40% sustainability and would suffer a reduction of services if USAID funding were reduced or withdrawn; and 7 are generation three or four models with self-sufficiency greater than 41% and could probably continue operating with reduced USAID support.  It is of utmost importance that USAID and SOMARC continue to evaluate together the nature and aims of the programs, and revise sustainability objectives on a case by case basis, especially since SOMARC is tasked with continuing to target middle and lower income groups. In general, however, it is important that a follow-on SOMARC project be continued after 1997.","Project title: Population technical assistance (POPTECH)|Project title: Social marketing for change (SOMARC)","Special Evaluation","Documents","CCP-3024-Q-00-3012-00","","5/1/1996 12:00:00 AM","","Commercial retail sale of contraceptives|Social marketing|Project sustainability|Economic self sufficiency|Demand|Contraceptive methods|Family planning services|Public relations","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABM853.pdf","2,068 KB","008485 - Basic Health Management International (BHM)|001131 - The Futures Group International, Inc.

"Evaluates progress made by two private Mexican family planning (FP) organizations -- MEXFAM (an affiliate of the International Planned Parenthood Foundation or IPPF) and FEMAP (the Mexican Federation of Private Associations for Health and Community Development) in achieving financial self-sustainability.  The evaluation covers the period 1992-2/96. USAID's assistance to MEXFAM and FEMAP has been channeled primarily through IPPF's Transition Project, but also through other centrally funded projects.  Shortly before the evaluation, a significant reduction in USAID's population assistance budget, along with other efforts to streamline Agency programming, strengthened USAID/Washington's resolve to conclude population assistance activities in Mexico in the near future. USAID/Mexico and MEXFAM, however, had expected a longer relationship and are concerned that an early phase-out will disrupt MEXFAM's program. MEXFAM and FEMAP have played significant and valuable roles in promoting the reproductive health of Mexico's poorest citizens.  Both organizations have strong, dedicated managers and staff, and have developed innovative ways to deliver FP information and services to ""hard-to-reach"" and marginalized groups.  USAID staff, in both Washington and Mexico, attach a very high value to their long-standing partnership with MEXFAM and FEMAP. The two organizations have approached the challenges of an assistance phase-out in very different ways.  MEXFAM, having assumed that USAID support would continue for several more years, has used USAID resources to (1) continue most elements of its service and information delivery program, with emphasis on poor rural and peri-urban populations (the ""social program""); and (2) launch a series of medical clinics (the CSMs), designed to serve middle-class clients and generate enough eventually to replace USAID funds currently used to support MEXFAM's social program.  According to this evaluation, however, the CSMs will not achieve their projected earnings, although many of them may break even or realize modest profits if given enough time to develop a client base.  Absent this expected income, major elements of the social program are vulnerable to significant and unanticipated cutbacks.  It is recommended that MEXFAM make some overdue adjustments now to the social program -- including the near elimination of the low-impact, high-cost Industry program (PIN) and commodity transfer activities such as the Program of Technical Cooperation (PCT) -- and begin a rigorous strategic planning process to identify and develop a new role for the organization.  Given MEXFAM's late start in getting this process underway, the team recommends a 1-year extension of support. USAID should continue contraceptive assistance to MEXFAM during this period, though at lower levels than in the past, and should assist MEXFAM in obtaining more cooperation from commercial vendors on contraceptive pricing and product registration. FEMAP, as a decentralized network of largely autonomous and self-supporting organizations, is less vulnerable to reductions in USAID funding than is MEXFAM.  FEMAP was therefore able to use USAID funds and TA to strengthen its technical and management capacity, and to help transfer these skills to some 18 of its 44 affiliates.  Indeed, FEMAP's leadership is not greatly concerned about a phase-out of USAID assistance -- except regarding their need to secure favorable commercial prices for oral contraceptives currently donated by USAID.  USAID should extend its assistance relationship with FEMAP for an additional year so that both parties can address this contraceptive supply issue. Finally, USAID, MEXFAM, and FEMAP should begin to develop the framework for a continuing collaborative relationship.  That framework could include, for example, identifying a joint agenda for operations research; trials/demonstrations of innovative ways to reach young adults, men, or other hard-to-recruit groups; and utilization of MEXFAM and FEMAP as regional training centers, as sources of TA for developing country programs, and as partners  with USAID, other U.S. Government agencies, and U.S. NGOs in developing responsible reproductive health policies and priorities and presenting them at donor and international fora.

"PACR of a project (9/87-9/95) to increase the production and export of non-traditional agricultural export products (NTAEs) in El Salvador. The project was implemented by the Salvadoran Foundation for Economic and Social Development (FUSADES). Working through DIVAGRO, its agricultural diversification unit, FUSADES provided tailored TA packages to entrepreneurs and companies in a wide variety of products in several commodity lines.  Related short-term training was also provided.  Credit assistance consisted of $5.47 million in loans to 43 entrepreneurs and private companies for new/expanded operations, some of them innovative, such as a shrimp hatchery and ornamental plantations. In the FUSADES institutional support component, the project built and equipped one of the most modern laboratories in Central America, and supported four agricultural experiment farms which tested a variety of crops.  One of these, and the only one remaining, La Colina, a multiple use farm purchased by FUSADES's own funds and oriented to the testing and production of NTAEs, received in its last year funding for operational costs and equipment.  La Colina -- a permanent symbol of USAID and FUSADES commitment to NTAEs -- is producing vegetables and vegetable seedlings, ornamentals, and pineapple, watermelon, and mangoes on a regular basis.  With the 11/94 addition of a pineapple packing plant, pineapple exports are underway. The Quality Assurance Program (QAP) laboratory, added along with an aquacultural experiment station in a 7/89 amendment, is actively promoting its services to industry and agriculture in general; soil, water, foliage, and microbiology analyses, as well as pesticide residues analyses are performed routinely.  A Tissue Culture unit is in charge of propagating highly priced plant varieties. At the PACD, the project had generated $57.5 million in foreign exchange for the agricultural sector vs. a target of $49 million; generated 27,346 full-time equivalent jobs vs. a target of 12,600; 20 NTAEs are being exported vs. a target of 15; and 29,106 ha have been placed under NTAEs vs. a target of 23,000. On the down side, a final external evaluation (XD-ABM-865-A) was harsh in its judgements.  (1) DIVAGRO did not establish a program for continued development of NTAEs.  The successful enterprises that resulted from the project have a modest impact on income, employment, and foreign exchange earnings, but they hardly justify 7 years of effort and an investment of $33 million.  (2) DIVAGRO lacked the initiative or will to adapt its NTAE assistance program to the prevailing agribusiness environment, which was not conducive to implementing the program.  (3) While the ornamental horticulture industry was well suited to FUSADES's NTAE strategy, its potential is limited. On the other hand, large-scale agro-industry like the Del Tropic freezing plant provided a model that combined the entrepreneurial focus of FUSADES with the land and productive capacity of the Agrarian Reform cooperatives.  The option of combining post-harvest entrepreneurship with the productive capacity of the cooperatives was not pursued by DIVAGRO.  (4) FUSADES disagreed with two important USAID-initiated policies that constrained project implementation, but did not vigorously attempt to change either of them: the restriction on non-traditional crop production for local markets, and the requirement that DIVAGRO develop an aquaculture industry based on cultivated shrimp.  (5) La Colina is a FUSADES-owned commercial enterprise whose principal function is to generate income to support the institution.  This activity comes at the expense of DIVAGRO's development function. The evaluators also added the following lessons learned (taken from XD-ABM-866-A).  (1) When unalterable obstacles impede implementation of the project as designed, the implementing organization should have the flexibility to modify its implementation strategy, or the project should be redesigned. FUSADES's senior managers unanimously observed that the NTAE program was not viable under the civil war conditions and political instability of the 1980s and the early 1990s.  (2) There is no substitute for effective USAID project monitoring. Even under the Cooperative Agreement mode of implementation, an involved project officer is a valuable input into the process. DIVAGRO has evolved into a commercial farming operation and in the future will most likely be almost entirely profit oriented, having minimal activities in NTAE development. With La Colina fully operational, most DIVAGRO staff are employed either at the farm or in support positions at DIVAGRO's office in San Salvador.  Extension services and TA to NTAE producers are currently carried out by two DIVAGRO agronomists; conceivably, even this minimal extension and TA may be eliminated entirely if the organization runs into economic difficulty.

"Evaluates as of 11/95 the impact of USAID's efforts to support the social and economic reintegration of ex-combatants in El Salvador following the Chapultepec Peace Accords of 1/16/92.  The evaluation was conducted by Creative Associates, Inc., which itself participates in reintegration efforts under a contract with USAID. Both subjective and objective measures indicate that ex-combatants have indeed been reintegrated into society:  some 80% of respondents in the evaluation sample consider themselves to be reintegrated, and respondents' median scores on a `reinsertion index' of social and economic indicators were within the same range as the scores for civilians.  The only group not reintegrated according to the index are those who received no benefits.  According to respondents, civil options, skills development, and taking advantage of benefits were the three principal contributors to reintegration.  The more respondents consider themselves reintegrated, the more they value civil options and skills development, as opposed to demanding rights or relying on benefits programming.  Further, ex-combatants are increasingly involved in their communities (a key indicator of social reinsertion).  They believe that:  reinsertion programming was highly important in their reintegration, they themselves played a key role in selecting their benefits, and the international community is responsible for the availability of their benefits.  Conversely, ex-combatants do not recognize the sizable role played by the Government of El Salvador in creating and delivering their reinsertion benefits.  While no group was fully satisfied with the menu of available reinsertion programming options, benefits were generally considered appropriate and useful to reinsertion. Lessons learned are as follows.  (1) Much has been done to support the war-to-peace transition in El Salvador, much of it geared specifically for ex-combatants.  In particular, local and international financial support for reinsertion programming was tremendous.  (2) Reinsertion programming offered broad coverage to those who served in the 12 years of conflict, with a varied menu of choices.  (3) Reinsertion involves many changes in status, behavior, and self-definition.  (4) The number of benefits accessed has no direct impact on reinsertion, though beneficiaries tend to value what they received.  (5) Period of military service has no direct correlation with level of reinsertion.  (6) While level of formal education has a slight impact on ex-combatants' degree of reinsertion, reinsertion programming masks the educational requirements for civilian performance.  (7) Income is the single most important factor in successful reinsertion.  (8) Benefit tracks were able to accommodate many but not all ex-combatants -- the tens of thousands of demobilized represented too large and varied a population to be accommodated in full by three tracks of benefits. (9) Practitioners and ex-combatants did not understand reinsertion in the same way.  (10) Reinsertion programming may have crossed the efficiency curve whereby benefits no longer outweigh costs. (11) The impact of programming begins with design.  Specific impacts should be planned and defined up front so that programming may be specifically geared to fulfilling those goals. Recommendations are that:  reinsertion goals and scope be clearly defined at the outset; reinsertion programming model civilian life and stress performance; reinsertion programs be based on a thorough knowledge of the target populations and their needs and include specific measures to address identified barriers to reinsertion; and benefit tracks be kept flexible and allow the demobilized to change options. Finally, it is recommended that reinsertion programming:  be specifically linked to opportunities for income generation; include training in decision making; guarantee equal value of benefits (which is not the same as equal benefits for all populations); wherever possible, reward superior performance; be demand-driven; and include counseling to help ex-combatants develop realistic expectations.

"Evaluates the pilot courts component of the Judicial Reform II project in El Salvador, aimed at developing a prototype administrative system for the country's criminal trial courts. The pilot specifically aims to improve the deployment and skill levels of court personnel, to improve filing, tracking, and management information systems, and in some courts, to introduce a common secretary (clerk) to handle such functions as case assignment.  Interim evaluation covers the period 1/93-2/96. Originally scheduled to be implemented in less than a year, the pilot has been delayed by various factors, including problems in the appointment of a new Supreme Court, resistance to innovation on the part of judges, and delays in purchasing computer equipment.  Nonetheless, by mid-1995 the new model was completely designed and installed in ten criminal courts in Sal Salvador and two in Santa Tecla.  In San Tecla, introduction of a common secretary is awaiting the approval of the Supreme Court. The administrative reforms introduced by the pilot have had a significant impact.  The introduction of a uniform set of guidelines, forms, and systems has been quite successful. This uniformity in processing is essential to strengthening justice sector institutions and monitoring human rights issues such as speedy trials and due process. This project has clearly increased judges', prosecutors', and public defenders' awareness of structural weaknesses in the existing systems and the need for reform. The in-depth training of highly qualified administrative support personnel and their absorption into the judicial system should help to institutionalize the administrative reforms already introduced.  The enthusiasm and support displayed by staff and judges in both the criminal courts and the Supreme Court indicates institutional acceptance of the principles and practices introduced by the project. The resolution of almost half of the cases over 2 years old is in itself a significant accomplishment.  The other half will probably be resolved by the end of the year.  Very few projects can claim an effect on case backlog to the degree that this project can.  This resolution of old cases should increase public confidence in the courts. The following lessons have been learned.  (1) Assignment of an interested member(s) of the Supreme Court as a counterpart is critical to Administration of  Justice projects. (2) Key elements in this project's success include (a) a participatory approach to problem identification and target setting; (b) an effort to alter interpersonal relationships well as organizational structure; and (c) adequate funding for both the project and the other judicial agencies.  (3) The transfer of financial and administrative responsibilities from the project to the Government of El Salvador is crucial to institutionalization. This project has already has transferred a number the contractor's employees to the government.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","2/1/1996 12:00:00 AM","","Pilot projects|Administration of law|Judicial reform|Criminal law|Courts|Procedural development|Technical training|Institution building","El Salvador","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABM880.pdf","1,527 KB","","","008540 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of a housing guaranty (HG) pilot project (4/87-12/95) to upgrade and legalize clandestine neighborhoods in Tetouan, Morocco.  The complementary TA project (6080194), aimed at building the institutional capacity for housing industry decentralization, has been evaluated separately. After a slow start, mainly due to the project's complexity, construction proceeded relatively smoothly.  The first major activity, construction of 200 low-income housing units in the Dersa-Samsa neighborhood for inhabitants displaced by demolition, was completed by 12/91, and as of 9/93, 95% of the physical upgrading activities, including sewerage, roads, potable water, and electricity had been completed; the main thoroughfare through Dersa-Samsa was also completed by that time.  However, beneficiaries' payments are well below targets, due to land registration problems and political changes.  In the sites and service zone, about 95% of the physical work is completed.  Work in the Zone d'Amenagement (ZAC) began in 1991, but there has been little activity on this component (which would supply infrastructure to private land to generate cross-subsidies for Dersa-Samsa) for the last 4 years, due to the newness of the concept, the lack of national implementing legislation, and a lack of interest on the part of the private sector; as a result, low-income units in the upgrading zone have not been subsidized. The off-site infrastructure component also experienced a slow start-up.  In 1992, under project 6080194, a U.S.-Moroccan engineering consortium began work on a Sewerage Master Plan for Tetouan; all environmental assessments and construction have been halted awaiting completion of the technical studies for the Master Plan. Overall, the project has left the Government of Morocco in a much better position to plan urban development activities by showing very clearly what works and what does not. The reasons for success or failure of a given component are complex, and are often due more to political or social reasons than to a flaw in project design.  While implementation was sometimes slow, considering the enormous institutional strengthening that had to take place in order for any earthmoving could begin, these delays should not be considered excessive. The impact of the project has been enormous, as evidenced by the following developments.  (1) According to reports by the National Upgrading Agency (ANHI) and Community Infrastructure Fund (FEC), 29 cities have neighborhood upgrading efforts underway or planned, most notably in Meknes and Agadir. While Tetouan's model is the most ambitious and none have incorporated Tetouan's cost recovery system, it has nonetheless had a major impact on urban policy in Morocco.  (2) Tetouan Urban Community and other entities in the region have created a ""syndicat de communes"" in conjunction with the Regional Public Utility Agency (RDE) to plan future regional sewage needs.  (3) Because of cost recovery problems experienced in the Tetouan project, the FEC no longer allows beneficiary payments as the major component in loan repayment plans.  (4) USAID HG-003 and HG-004 were designed following lessons learned in the Tetouan pilot project.  (5) In light of cost recovery in Tetouan, other communities are using methods such as no payment/no sewer hookups, linking sewer payment to the water supply. On the social level, the project has been an overwhelming success. Tetouan's densely populated hillsides generate health and environmental problems (e.g., water-borne diseases, wastewater runoff, mudslides). The Tetouan authorities made the decision that infrastructure improvements could not wait for informal neighborhood residents to come around, and the health and environmental situation his vastly improved.","Related documents: PD-ABM-885 and PN-ABY-571","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1996 12:00:00 AM","","Housing investment guaranty|Urban development|Low cost housing|Pilot projects|Slum areas","Morocco","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABM884.pdf","1,558 KB","","","008579 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of a project (4/86-6/96) to provide TA and training to those involved in the Tetouan Urban Development Project in Morocco. The project focused its efforts on the Community Infrastructure Fund (FEC), the Municipality of Tetouan (MUN), and the National Shelter Upgrading Agency (ANHI), but included central-level counterparts in all activities.  While most TA activities ended in 1993, the grant was extended for the environmental part of the project, consisting of Raleigh-Tetouan twinning activities and the Sewerage Master Plan studies, which are still in progress. Project advisors designed a property tax collection system; analyzed municipal administrative structures; conducted an analysis of taxes collected by the MUN, and computerized the municipal revenue office; and installed a system that will allow the MUN to keep trade of beneficiary payments.  In addition, the project advisors completed a Land Development Strategy for the Zone d'Amenagement Concerte (ZAC); completed a study of MUN's solid waste management services; procured Geographic Information System (GIS) equipment and provided training in its use; and developed a computer mapping for Tetouan (Dersa), including hardware, software, and training.  Finally, the project provided MUN personnel a 4-week training course in management information systems; analyzed an RFP for a Sewerage Master Plan study; and completed an industrial zone study for Samsa to increase project revenue stream.  An initiative to improve recovery of real estate taxes by computerizing property tax rolls was interrupted.  A review of Tetouan's Public Works Functions and procurement of sewer-related equipment is ongoing. This ambitious project was meant to test a wide range of service and shelter options, which required enormous institutional strengthening. In many cases, external events (e.g., procedural changes, changes in political leadership, and reorganization of Tetouan) undermined project success.  In fact, many project elements, especially in municipal assistance, were implemented but later discarded; the GIS systems envisioned for municipal financial management, for example, were moved to a separate GIS section in the Urban Community following restructuring.  However, the systems are now available for users within all city departments. It would have been impossible to predict these changes, and the project should still be considered a model for future TA projects.  Many ideas are germinating that will take years to flower.  For example, staff from the Direction Generale de Cadastre (National Land Survey office) recently visited Tetouan to view the GIS system and determine its sustainability for the national office in Rabat.  Solid and liquid waste continue to be widely discussed, and it is clear that in the near future Tetouan will search for alternative funding to construct a sewage treatment plant.","Related documents: PD-ABM-884 and PN-ABY-571","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1996 12:00:00 AM","","Urban development|Housing administration|Institution building|Cities and towns|Municipal level|Urban planning|Personnel development|Technical training|Management training|Technical assistance","Morocco","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABM885.pdf","1,303 KB","","","008579 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (8/88-3/95) to consolidate agricultural development efforts begun under predecessor project 5150191 in Costa Rica's northern zone. While the project increased environmental awareness in the zone, environmental degradation continues unabated. People, industries, and government are more aware of the problems caused by deforestation, and more willing to act on this knowledge, yet this awareness arrives too late:  more than 80% of the lowland rainforest in the zone has been eliminated, and little of what remains is under any kind of protection or management scheme.  A key lesson is that development and conservation are complementary, inseparable issues.  This knowledge, while part of the project's design, was not efficiently incorporated into its structure or implementation. Environmental education needs to be an ongoing, permanent process, not part of a series of disconnected projects. The road maintenance component was more successful. The Asociacion de Mantenimiento Vial (AMV) was created as a self-sustained private business for maintaining gravel feeder roads in the area.  AMV provided periodic maintenance to 420 km of gravel secondary roads and rehabilitated 150 km.  AMV is far more successful than anyone thought possible, and, despite some continuing problems (e.g., attempts at political interference), faces no serious imminent threats.  Its principal challenge now is to create lasting linkages with key individuals in Costa Rica's road building, technical, and political communities. The third component, which included plant material production and agricultural diversification and was implemented by CARE from 10/91 on, has largely fulfilled its objectives. CARE responded to the great expectations that had been raised, and its efforts to extend perennial crops, establish credit committees, and train farm families in the use of pesticides and alternative biological control systems have left a sustainable impact.  A local foundation (FUNDECA) was established to provide farming communities with markets for their products, access to reasonable and flexible credit, and representation at the regional and national levels. Several lessons can be learned from the CARE component. (1) To achieve success with a credit program within the period of project implementation requires adequate funds, not just ""seed money"". The 33 credit committees founded by CARE have sufficient funding to maintain interest and attract additional capital.  (2) By establishing a farmer organization early in the project, CARE had time to provide the training and attention needed to bring the organization to maturity, thereby assuring sustainability. (3) The strategy of limiting credit to certain activities was effective in promoting agricultural diversification.  Without this policy, large sums would have been invested in cattle, beans, and other traditional activities, leaving fewer funds available for heart-of-palm and pineapple.  (4) Community organization must be done carefully and systematically.  In this project, an initial community diagnostic was never done, and as as a result, some activities were not planned in accordance with community priorities.  (5) Plant production targets proved overly optimistic when none of the local nurseries produced seedlings in the amounts for which they had contracted.  Dependence on local nurseries can place the entire implementation of a project in jeopardy.  (6) The implementing NGO must have good systems for credit management and supervision.  CARE had such systems and transferred them to the credit committees.  Its personnel had several years of experience and support staff were always available. (7) Projects should focus on a few,  well-defined objectives.  In this project, objectives at first were not very clearly defined, but the focus on three crops and the credit fund made it easy for project staff to establish priorities.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1996 12:00:00 AM","","Environmental protection|Private enterprises|Road maintenance|Agricultural credit|Crop diversification","Costa Rica","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABM899.pdf","398 KB","008533 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to expand private sector participation in the provision of urban services (especially water, wastewater, and solid waste management) in Indonesia (PURSE project).  Mid-term evaluation covers the period 9/91-5/96. This timely project has helped to create a strong interest and commitment to private participation in the provision of urban services within both central and local governments and the private sector.  Early problems, due partly to contractor staffing and management problems and partly to the project's novelty and complexity, have been mostly resolved and useful. Policy papers, overseas training of managers and policy makers, demonstration projects, and other outputs have established a good foundation for a successful conclusion to the project and sustainability thereafter. Particularly valuable have been the following recent achievements: progress in developing  Project Life Cycle' materials; a clear definition of the roles and responsibilities of key central government agencies; development of risk management guidelines; increased emphasis on demonstration projects; and improvement in the project's practical orientation and its degree of engagement with local government.  In addition, three technical papers have been prepared that provide practical guidance on engineering risks, unaccounted-for water loss, and performance targets; another paper addresses complex issues in water concession agreements. The project has yielded a number of lessons:  (1) heightened realization of the difficulty of promoting private sector participation in ways that benefit both the public and private sectors; (2) the importance of achieving a clear consensus among project stakeholders regarding issues and priorities that can be effectively addressed; (3) the importance of an institutional framework and leadership that can resolve conflicts, set priorities, monitor and evaluate, and redirect the program if necessary; (4) the need for policy and regulatory work to lead to concrete, operational results; (5) the need for demonstration projects to reflect clients' real needs (i.e., to be demand-driven), to focus on quality not quantity, and to be relevant, replicable, and promptly disseminated; and (6) the need for training to be adapted to local conditions and provided at a relevant scale and on a sustainable basis.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","PCE-1008-I-28-2065-00","","5/1/1996 12:00:00 AM","","Public services|Urban areas|Privatization of services|Water supply|Waste collection|Solid wastes|Wastewater|Waste disposal","Indonesia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABM909.pdf","3,075 KB","000968 - Planning and Development Collaborative International, Inc.

"PACR of a project (9/88-3/96) to modernize and consolidate the Costa Rican judicial system. All three project components -- Supreme Court administration, the National Commission, and the Judicial School -- were a success.  Under the Supreme Court component, the project modernized judicial system administration by establishing 7 regional administrative offices in each province and a regional justice center that includes centralized clerk's offices, separation of judges from clerical staff to allow judges to focus on judicial work, and creation of professional administrator positions.  The project also:  conducted pilot projects in Perez Zeledon and Limon (to be replicated nationwide) to reduce caseload delay; introduced techniques for avoiding suspended judgements; streamlined procedures to give the Supreme Court better control over the management of cases in Salas III and IV; and established one of the first fully functioning community mediation centers in Central and South America, as well as an arbitration and conciliation center within the Chamber of Commerce. The project consolidated an organizational and operational model for the National Commission.  The model takes into account the recently created Foundation for the Administration of Justice.  The Commission developed a 5-year plan for justice sector reform, and a 5-year program and action plan for tackling priority reform areas; identified external funding sources and developed funding proposals; broadened its membership with representatives from other justice sector institutions; and explored mechanisms for funding its activities through the Government of Costa Rica budget (the Commission now receives core funding from the Ministry of Justice, the Supreme Court of Justice and Ombudsman). Finally, the project helped develop the Costa Rican Judicial School into a mature entity that conducts ongoing educational programs. Courses were developed and conducted in the areas of change management and adaptation; management and administration for judicial officials; improving the skills of judges in the writing of opinions; and International Commercial Law. The project's success is attributed, primarily, to the commitment and participation of the highest judicial officials; the project's clearly stated goals and objectives; competent professionals in charge of implementation; the periodic use of outside consultants to guide certain activities and/or conduct research, and having an ongoing external consultant with experience in similar activities; and the constant use of educational seminars to reinforce project activities.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","3/1/1996 12:00:00 AM","","Judiciary|Legal reform|Institution building|Judicial reform|Administration of law","Costa Rica","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABM925.pdf","259 KB","008533 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to increase    the exports of selected non-traditional and traditional agricultural products in Jamaica. Mid-term evaluation covered the period 9/89-6/95. Efforts to improve yields for selected export crops have had varied success.  The mini-set yam subproject was the most successful, with yield increases reaching more than 400%, with a positive spread effect to dasheen and other root crops. However, due to greatly increased input costs as well as high interest rates for production credit, most small and medium farmers have not been able to achieve the yields of which their crops are capable. Earnings from a range of export commodities have evidently increased as a result of the project's pre-clearance facility.  The reformulation of the Agricultural Marketing Corporation has assisted 30 exporters in the assembly, packaging, and quality control of export commodities, which has probably increased export earnings.  Coffee producers are now in a better position to negotiate prices with the Coffee Industry Board, which in turn has increased export earnings at the farm level. Increased investment in traditional crops, including coffee, cocoa, and bananas is fairly evident, although this increase seems to have been in area under production rather than in investment in improved technologies.  A general shift in investment towards non-traditional crops (root crops, tree crops, and vegetables), while not great in magnitude, has led to significant increases in export levels. The quasi-privatization and renovation of the AMC complex is providing more efficient services for up to 30 agricultural exporters. The availability of pre-clearance facilities at the international airports in Kingston and Montego Bay has resulted in far more efficient procedures for exporters. Nevertheless, it is doubtful that either the public or private sector will be able to maintain these services when project support ends.  Currently, private sector services for agricultural exporters are limited to those provided by the Jamaica Exporters' Association (JEA).  To the extent that the project has strengthened the JEA's image through subcontracts to privatize the pre-clearance facilities and to conduct feasibility studies for future subprojects, it has probably made private sector agricultural exports more efficient. Although no training plan existed until very recently, farmer training in cultural practices has taken place -- most likely in excess of the 1,200 farmers targeted -- some of it directly attributable to the project.  Also, the University of Florida, through a subcontract with RONCO, has conducted five seminars, four on integrated pest management and one on conservation biology.  The long-term training component seems to have been dropped early on. For reasons unknown, the proposed use of intermediate financial institutions to jointly support subprojects was never implemented. Instead, the project seeks to improve the business operations of cooperatives and other farmer organizations through the mandatory presence of a manager in all subprojects approved since the beginning of 1995. While the project has met the targets in the project paper, these targets (8% increase per annum in non-traditional exports) are in fact too low to be an indicator of success -- especially since the project's base year was the year in which Jamaica was hit by Hurricane Gilbert. Further, the vagueness of the language in the project paper (""selected crops,"" for example) leaves much room for ambiguity.  In terms of traditional crops, coffee and cocoa exports have experienced annual increases of more than 8%, while banana exports have remained the same. In the case of non-traditional crops, such crops as yams, dasheen, and papayas have experienced phenomenal increases in export volumes while many other crops have experienced smaller increases.  Lastly, while it is quite evident that the miniset yam technology subproject was directly related to the increases in yam production and exports, the case is far less clear with crops such as coffee and cocoa.  The most definite area where increases in export commodities can be attributed to the project is the case of the pre-clearance facilities at Jamaica's two international airports.","Attached to PD-ABM-927","Special Evaluation","Documents","LAG-4200-I-00-3057-00","","1/1/1996 12:00:00 AM","","Export promotion|Agricultural product marketing|Nontraditional agricultural exports","Jamaica","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDABM927A.pdf","5,285 KB","008926 - Cargill Technical Services, Inc.","","008563 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (4/90-1/96) to rehabilitate 49.5 km of road between the towns of Kafue and Lusaka in Zambia. The project rehabilitated 53.4 km of the Kafue-Lusaka road, 3.9 km more than had been anticipated in the original project design.  The work involved the training of 108 technicians and mechanics in-country, and 4 engineers through a one-month course in Tanzania.  The newly rehabilitated road has relieved capacity constraints on the region's trunk road system; removed bottlenecks between Lusaka and Kafue; and accommodated projected annual increases in traffic.  The life of the Kafue-Lusaka road has been extended by 20 years. Under this contract, a devaluation of the Kwacha caused a major dispute (which was resolved) between the original contractor,  Kajima, and the Government of Zambia regarding payments.  The lesson learned is that in countries like Zambia, where exchange rate fluctuations are the norm rather than the exception, future contracts should be denominated in U.S. dollars in order to avoid such problems.","Includes transmittal memorandum|Attachments: XD-BCL-057-A, XD-BCL-057-B","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","6/1/1996 12:00:00 AM","","Road construction|Roads|Traffic","Zambia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDBCL057.pdf","1,190 KB","008627 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (1989-96) to support sustainable environmental and natural resource management (NRM) in Central America (RENARM project). RENARM was designed to test and refine new approaches, especially regionalism, and involvement of regional institutions, NGOs, and NGO consortia in NRM.  Central themes included establishment of regional wildlife corridors; linkages between protected areas, buffer-zone development, and environmental education; and regional action plans for forests and coastal zones.  Both USAID and implementing institutions developed knowledge and tools to address Central American natural resource issues.  This new capacity, along with much overlapping of professional contacts and information-sharing, are among RENARM's major impacts. National parks and reserves in Belize, Guatemala, Costa Rica, and Honduras made progress toward effective management.  Rapid Ecological Assessments in four protected areas gave managers powerful tools to understand baseline situations and assess the impacts of their actions. At least four new parks were established or existing protected areas extended to provide corridors and buffer zones as a result of RENARM activities spearheaded by PACA and Paseo Pantera, two NGO consortia. Indigenous territories were recognized and mapped, and reserves proposed. The condition of several important watersheds has improved.  Natural resource policies changed substantially. Ecologically sustainable economic activities -- e.g., techniques such as contouring and use of nitrogen-fixing plants -- were adopted in the buffer zones of at least four parks. The Central American Commission on Environment and Development (CCAD) adopted an ""Agenda for Environment and Development"" and an agreement on toxic wastes.  A regional Biodiversity Treaty gave legal sanction to the biological corridor concept.  RENARM also supported development of a regional Tropical Forestry Action Plan; revised forestry laws in El Salvador, Guatemala, Nicaragua, and Honduras; and a Safe Pesticide Use program for farmers and homemakers. Much of RENARM's impact was, and will continue to be, felt through research, education, advocacy, and extension organizations supported directly or indirectly by the project.  A total of 295 men and 75 women received Bachelor's, Master's, or Ph.D. degrees, or year-long, intensive in-service training; 10 research projects received grants.  Many short courses, training modules, and extension networks developed or strengthened by RENARM will continue to function.  Demand for continued and repeat courses, even on a paying basis, is a good indicator of the value accorded these courses and the probability of adoption of recommended practices. RENARM stimulated creation of many new community-based environmental NGOs and promoted partnerships with international NGOs.  Some U.S. PVOs' skills and practices were enhanced, with impacts that will extend beyond the project and the region (e.g., CARE has made working with local NGOs, its preferred mode of operation).  Installed capacity to manage data and make it accessible can be seen in the University of Florida's Mesoamerican Biodiversity Legal Project, in the PACA partners, and especially in CATIE, which reorganized its watershed expertise, established a geographic information system (GIS) network, developed a regional forestry management/demonstration program, and developed a successful outreach network for the Tree Crop Dissemination (MADELENA-III) program. Lessons learned are as follows.  (1) RENARM's policy component shifted USAID from a prescriptive to a participatory approach to environmental policy.  This point of view was influential in the design of several bilateral natural resources projects.  (2) During the project's final year, both implementors and USAID staff reported increased satisfaction with levels of communication and collaboration. The NGO consortia in particular seemed to find their stride in developing regional models of working.  (3) The mid-term evaluation made several recommendations of lasting importance about designing multi-national, multi-sectoral projects (see XD-ABJ-687-A).  (4) Promoting NGO consortia will succeed only if proper attention is paid to the management requirements of the consortia.  (5) RENARM taught USAID a considerable amount about working with NGOs. Large organizations will generally continue with their previous strategies, and many local NGOs are actually ahead of international PVOs on targeting useful local interventions. Heeding the local NGOs' counsel will eliminate the risk of useful activities that nevertheless do not hit key threats head-on. (6) Follow-on activities should include a local NGO umbrella project to provide a forum and access to information and project assistance, and possibly a safe haven for dialogue with local governments.  (7) Possibly because the funding period was too short, the National Ecotourism Councils established by Paseo Pasitera served more as laboratories for learning to use ecotourism as a tool for conservation, than as models of successful promotion and coordination.  Tourism remains one of the most promising sources of revenue for biodiversity conservation and sustainable development in Central America. Above all else, the Councils showed that collaboration requires participation by key players who are convinced of the gains to be reaped and do not see the new organization as a threat.  The Paseo Pasitera ecotourism project also highlighted different approaches to ecotourism -- a ""greening"" of mass tourism at heavily visited sites, with a potential to produce significant revenue but also to do significant damage if not controlled, and a ""community-based"" vision of small-scale visitation as a tool for local sustainable development.  RENARM's most effective interventions in the former instance were in linking tourism planning and development with park management support.  In the latter case, the MAYAFOR activity highlighted the steps needed for communities to succeed in ecotourism.","Regional Environmental and Natural Resource Management (RENARM)","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","4/1/1996 12:00:00 AM","","Regional development|Natural resource management|Environmental management|Natural resource utilization|Natural resource conservation|Private voluntary organizations|Indigenous private voluntary organizations|Institution building|Institutional linkages|Development cooperation|Environmental policy|Environmental education|Sustainable development","Central America","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABM930.pdf","481 KB","002290 - USAID.

"Ex post evaluation of an activity in Ghana to establish the Ghana Venture Capital Fund (GVCF) and a management company, the Venture Fund Management Company (VFMC).  USAID, through a grant, financed the VFMC's expenses, while the Commonwealth Development Corporation (CDC) of the European Union was the initial investor in the GVCF.  The evaluation covers the period 1992-2/96; USAID funding ended in 11/94. GVCF's most obvious and significant impact has been on the Government of Ghana's (GOG's) policies and regulations. Promulgation of the Financial Institutions (Non-Banking) Law of 1993, and publishing of ""Draft Operating Guidelines for Venture Capital Funding Companies"" by the Bank of Ghana in 1995, with input by VFMC management, clearly show that the GOG wants a regulatory environment which is conducive to institutional venture capital finance. GVCF has undertaken a continual marketing effort to acquaint the business community with its presence and its product.  These efforts appear to have been generally successful. GVCF's presence in the financial sector has increased understanding in the business community of the utility of venture capital as a financing mechanism for certain types of businesses. Moreover, it appears that entrepreneurs are demonstrating greater management discipline and professionalism because they have to meet the Fund's demanding pre-investment criteria and ongoing reporting standards. To date, however, GVCF's investment activity has had no discernible direct economic impact on such areas as job creation, increased tax revenues, or enhanced infrastructural development.  However, given that the Fund had invested a total of $1.6 million in six companies for less than 2 years at the time of the evaluation, a significant impact in these areas is not expected.  Based on the present deal pipeline, the number of approved projects that should come into the Fund's portfolio over the next 12 months, and the fact that approximately 50% of the projected dollars to be invested would go into start-up companies, appreciable direct economic impact should be discernible over the next 5 years. While prevailing macroeconomic conditions and the relative youth of the existing portfolio make it difficult to make predictions about GVCF's ultimate success, the current portfolio, while small, is in fairly good shape.  Of $1.625 million invested as of 2/23/96:  (1) $707,000 (44%) has been invested in companies performing satisfactorily and demonstrating high financial return prospects; (2) $528,000 (32%) has been invested in companies experiencing difficulty due primarily to external conditions and for which return of capital is highly probable and attractive returns possible, though less likely; and (3) the remaining $390,000 (24%) has been invested in a company experiencing significant problems due as much to internal as external problems and for which, barring significant changes, return of capital is doubtful.

"Final report by the grantee, Montana State University (MSU), on a project (6/94-9/95) to develop safe, effective, and cost-efficient alternatives to chemical pesticides for grasshopper/locust control in Africa. Good progress was made.  Large-scale field trials of Beauveria bassiana GHA -- a safe (EPA experimental use-permitted), cost-effective (about the same price as chemicals) fungal biocontrol agent.  These trials demonstrated the feasibility of biocontrol technology for use under African conditions and carried out by African personnel.  The trials identified an additive for improving the efficacy and kill speed of fungi and raised questions about the sustained efficacy of chemicals. For although the short-term efficacy of B. bassiana GHA was less than chemicals, the effect was longer lasting. Efforts underway at MSU and elsewhere are expected to eliminate the short-term efficacy gap and explain the difference in long-term effects between fungi and chemicals. The project demonstrated that USAID and its partners are on the right track in developing fungi-based biocontrol agents that are safe, effective, and manageable in Africa.  The demonstration trials showed that fungus can be an effective biocontrol agent and improved MSU's understanding of what efficacy means.  MSU now knows that, although B. bassiana GHA achieves respectable results, it must (1) push ahead with more virulent strains (such as a promising new Metarhizium from Madagascar) for regional development, (2) continue research on additives, and (3) compare fungi and chemical control in a longer time frame.  For future large-scale trials, MSU recognizes the importance of having both untreated control plots and control plots treated with a chemical agent. Other evidence supporting the development of fungal biocontrol agents was found quite unexpectedly in trying to measure the effects of an entomopoxvirus on grasshoppers.  The effects of the manually applied virus was mostly obscured by a naturally occurring epizootic of Metarhizium in the region of the field trials in Cape Verde.  Such naturally occurring epizootics are the type of phenomenon which biotechnology of this sort attempts to emulate or augment. A number of lessons were learned about capacity building in Mali. It is necessary to assess the level of commitment and the time horizon of project participants, especially the project leader proposed by the government.  In the training of Malian personnel, MSU's efforts were undermined when after being trained personnel were transferred, hired away, or did not get access to project resources in a way that led to sustainable work.  The result was ongoing training of new faces, misallocation of equipment, and a lack of continuity and commitment to the work.  This problem was exacerbated by the small number of qualified personnel in Mali, the multiple demands on their time (qualified people were transferred as a means of generating new projects to obtain donor resources), and a general cynicism among Malian project leaders about donor aid. Continuity of the work in Mali was also interrupted prior to the beginning of the project, owing to an interruption in USAID funding, which may have contributed to the turnover of Malian personnel.  In Cape Verde, by contrast, the high level of personal, professional, and institutional commitment led to a positive and highly productive project.

"Evaluates P.L. 480, Title II Food for Work and Health programs implemented by Catholic Relief Services (CRS)/Indonesia and counterpart (CP) NGOs over the period 1993-95. The Title II program's health and agricultural activities have provided many tangible, lasting, and at times empowering contributions to many poor and isolated communities. Community participants reported significant benefits ranging from reduced infant and maternal mortality rates to substantial increases in farm income and agricultural production.  CP organizations reported numerous institutional benefits such as standardized systems and improved staffing skills.  However, the complexity of the program probably preempted alternative efforts by both CRS and its CPs to address other important issues.  The program greatly taxed the abilities of CPs and placed little emphasis on participatory development practices.  Also, in response to USAID requirements, CRS managed the CPs tightly, which generated resentment.  Some effects were potentially negative, possibly placing communities in jeopardy of outside exploitation.  Lastly, the program apparently focused on immediate and short-term goals, and focused little effort toward consolidating gains or addressing long-term sustainability. While food aid was an important and much appreciated component of the program, in almost all cases community members reported they would have participated in projects even without food aid.  Hence, the transition to non-food supported programs (Title II food assistance to Indonesia formally ended in December 1995) should be possible for all CPs.  The critical issue for each CP will be its ability to apply participatory community development methods in partnership with client communities. The CPs still represent good potential partners for new programs in agriculture and health, but vary in their abilities and needs. While they could continue to exist without CRS support (though at lower staff and program activity levels), all CPs appear enthusiastic about continuing such programs with CRS support.  CRS will have to be clear and discerning in the kinds of projects to support, based on close negotiations with each partner.  The opportunities for new health and agriculture programs are very good, but CRS will have to define these programs and build its own internal staff capabilities to deliver the programs, as well as the capacities of CPs and communities.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","4/1/1996 12:00:00 AM","","Food for Peace Title II|Food for Work|Maternal child health care|Agricultural development|Private voluntary organizations|Indigenous private voluntary organizations|Community participation|Institution building","Indonesia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABM943.pdf","7,911 KB","007337 - Catholic Relief Services (CRS)","","008558 - USAID.

"Final external evaluation of a project (5/90-5/96) to strengthen Swazi private and public sector managerial/administrative capabilities as well as the training institutions that support private sector growth (STRIDE project). The project contributed much to Swaziland's human resource and institutional development.  It began as a traditional training activity, but was modified to respond to changes in the Swaziland environment.  In fact, the deteriorating Swazi economy and the political changes in southern Africa were seized by STRIDE as opportunities to promote new, more democratic relationships among the Government of Swaziland (GOS), the private sector, and labor. In all, there were 217 U.S. long-term trainees, 276 external short-term trainees, and 4,063 in-country trainees.  The third- and in-country training target groups and numbers had been revised radically, following the mid-term evaluation (XD-ABJ-965-A).  For example, given the failure of the project's original plans to train traditional community leaders and the emergence of more democratic forms in Swaziland, leadership training was shifted to address the needs of newly elected political leaders and to reinforce the trend toward participatory democracy. Additionally, 3rd-country and in-country training were linked in an effort to involve all of the social partners -- government, employers, and labor -- in a sustained dialogue to facilitate political and economic change.  A sampling of those attending STRIDE Phase II training events and an analysis of the records in USAID and STRIDE offices indicate that this strategy has been successful. When efforts of California Polytechnic University (CalPoly) to strengthen the Swaziland College of Technology (SCOT) and the University of Swaziland (UNISWA) were not as successful as envisioned (for reasons detailed in the 5/93 special evaluation, (PD-ABL-219), USAID/S identified alternative local institutions which could be dealt with directly rather than through a cooperative agreement.  These activities seem to be making some inroads.  For example, training provided to BMEP/Lulote, a local organization devoted to small and micro business development, has greatly strengthened both management and training capabilities.  Also, through its participation in STRIDE, the local training institution SIMPA has formed a linkage with Technikon SA, which will provide SIMPA a continuing source of technical support and backstopping, particularly in public sector management training and urban governance. Numerous lessons were learned.  (1) During Phase II, STRIDE shifted its focus from individuals and institutions, and aimed directly at inducing sectoral impacts (improving the education and training system) and national impacts (improving industrial relations) by offering activities to whole communities of interested stakeholders.  Conferences and workshops were used to mobilize and engage large numbers of people from diverse interest groups.  Secondly, every training event was seen as requiring follow-up activities, such as creating working groups or special workshops on specialized topics, as well as follow-up meetings in which the original participants would reconvene for reflection and review.  STRIDE purposely opened the door to broad participation, facilitated the development of networks across interest groups, and gave people an opportunity to set clearer vision and goals for sectoral and national change. (2) The performance of the STRIDE Steering Committee could serve as a model for other training projects.  Such a committee is critical to project success and is only effective if it is comprised of individuals who possess authority to represent their sectors and organizations, respect for differences of opinion, and a shared vision of how to use training to promote significant organizational, sectoral, or national change and not merely to impart skills and knowledge to individuals. The committee must be transparent in its decision making and have clear standards and procedures for scrutinizing and approving applications for training, especially the long-term training on which career advancement often depends. (3) The contractor's record of no drop-outs and an average record return rate of trainees completing academic courses within 80% of the time usually scheduled was the result of a number of practices, e.g., carefully matching participants and training institutions, installing a toll-free 800 number for participants to call, regularly checking on participants' academic progress, etc.  Similarly, the efforts of Swazi public and private institutions to nominate trainees in needed skill areas and to award them post-training promotions according to performance seem to be major incentives in establishing a 100% return rate of trainees to the institutions from which they departed. (4) Because Democratic Governance (DG) initiatives cannot be terminated abruptly, bilateral DG projects must ensure that their most important components are continued in regional projects; such a phase-over, however, cannot be managed solely from a regional office, but requires extensive oversight within the country.","Delivery order no. 18","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","AEP-0085-I-00-2060-00","","5/1/1996 12:00:00 AM","","Education for development|Personnel development|Management training|Participants|Development strategies|Political development|Public sector|Private sector|Democratization|Leadership training|Labor relations","Swaziland","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABM945.pdf","124 KB","005886 - Datex, Inc.","","008609 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (3/87-8/29/94) to improve the distribution of fertilizer in Bangladesh. The project has become a showpiece for USAID's investment in privatization, creating a highly competitive group of private wholesalers and dealers that has improved fertilizer distribution and provided a model that has been studied by countries as diverse as Albania, Nigeria, Kenya, and Egypt.  The private sector is now responsible for virtually 100% of both fertilizer imports and domestic marketing, and fertilizer is available at competitive prices throughout the country.  Supply has increased from 12.08 to 22.92 MT, and use has increased at a compound rate of 8% per year.  Some 14,000 wholesalers now link sales to farmers through 108,000 retailers, and wholesalers and retailers employ about 60,000 additional persons.  Fertilizer distribution margins have shrunk by over half, and real prices to farmers have declined.  Achievements of individual components are noted below. The policy reform component had remarkable success, resulting in Government of Bangladesh (BDG) policies to:  (1) permit direct procurement of urea by private distributors; (2) discontinue public sector fertilizer distribution; and (3) eliminate subsidies on Triple Super Phosphate and Murate of Potash as high as 60% of market value. However, urea fertilizer (manufactured in Bangladesh) is administratively priced, which can effectively subsidize urea and seriously distort the fertilizer balance.  The BDG also allowed direct fertilizer imports by the private sector.  By the end of 1992, the BADC, the monopoly parastatal, stopped importing fertilizers and had been supplanted by over 1,000 new private firms employing some 160,000 persons.  The removal of subsidies and privatization has saved the BDG about $40 million per year. A Commercial Credit Program (CCP) benefitting fertilizer distributors, farmers, and eventually importers, was established in 6/89.  A total of 13 private banks (about half of Bangladesh's commercial banks) were participating in the CCP by 1993 and by 1994 were largely using their own funds to make loans, demonstrating how viable and profitable they consider the fertilizer sector.  Though the loan delinquency rate for the fertilizer sector is undesirable (24% as of mid-1994), it is much lower than in other sectors.  The project also developed an Inland Letter of Credit enabling fertilizer distributors to pay fertilizer factories through banks, resulting in lower bank charges, reduced risks, and improved cash flow. The project developed the capacities of 9,122 fertilizer dealers and fostered technology transfer through demonstrations and 1-2 day training programs, promotional materials, direct TA, seminars and workshops, and study tours. Efforts focused on improving fertilizer use management, crop production technology, fertilizer import and marketing management, and human resource development.  The project also identified infrastructure needs, especially approach roads to factories.  Changes took place immediately, including the use of project funds to construct a 4-km road linking the Urea Fertilizer Factory Ltd., Ashugung to a highway and rail depot. A project-developed management information system (MIS) increased transparency in fertilizer marketing and provided policymakers and others with improved and timely information. Data were collected on a range of topics, including price and market data, the institutional and economic aspects of fertilizer distribution, the determinants of fertilizer use, current knowledge and practices concerning fertilizer use, and the profitability for fertilizer use under different circumstances. This information greatly restrained anti-competitive behavior and aided policy discussions. Two developments augur well for the sustainability of project achievements -- the planned creation of a Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) monitoring cell, and the recent formation, with project assistance, of the Bangladesh Fertilizer Association (BFA). The following lessons were learned.  (1) Deregulation allows businesses to bypass the financial difficulties associated with privatization, such as finding a private enterprise willing to take over the excess staff and unadapted facilities of a state corporation.  Even when competition increases overall employment, however, unemployment or inactivity among redundant personnel can remain a potent issue.  (2) The long-term commitment of USAID and the contractor were essential to achieving the project's goal and purpose. Significant reforms began occurring in year 11 of the fertilizer program (year three of this project).  (3) Factors contributing to the project's success included a sound project design, a capable and dedicated staff, adequate availability of resources, and, of particular note, the productive working relationship, animated by a common goal, among USAID, the MOA, and the project staff.  (4) At the strategy level, the project inculcated the importance of policy reforms (and of continuously explaining their benefit), market competition, commercial credit, timely information flow, technology transfer, and the possibility of using these to develop a community of entrepreneurs. (5) The project's success is based on its two-pronged approach, which not only recommended to the BDG what it should stop doing, but managed to fill the impending void with trained entrepreneurs.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1996 12:00:00 AM","","Fertilizer distribution|Agricultural policy|Privatization|Private enterprises|Policy reform|Imports|Technical training|Personnel development|Market economy|Commercial credit|Management information systems","Bangladesh","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABM947.pdf","950 KB","008511 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (9/89-9/94) to establish a nutritional/health surveillance system in flood-prone areas of Bangladesh.  The project was implemented by Helen Keller International (HKI). The project established in 32 sentinel districts a nutritional surveillance program that compiles data on 11,000 households every 2 months, summarizes and publishes it within 30 days, and distributes it to more than 600 people in government, donor, and NGO organizations. These reports have become widely accepted as a primary source of timely, credible information on nutritional, health, and household welfare status of populations in disaster-prone areas. HKI developed easy-to-use methods and procedures for monitoring nutritional status, which enabled HKI to identify seasonal trends and vulnerable areas.  Following the 1991 cyclone, an extension project was organized to monitor the affected areas, and the resulting information was used by the government and donors for resource allocation. The project also published a series of special reports based on its core data.  These reports include examinations of the link between nutritional status and the 1991 and 1994 cyclones, the Rohingya refugee camps, seasonality, gender, sex behavior, family planning, child nutrition in female-headed households, and meeting the nutritional goals from the World Summit for Children by the year 2000. The project did not succeed in turning responsibility over to the BDG Institute of Public Health and Nutrition (IPHN).  This organization has not gained enough strength within the Ministry to assume additional responsibilities.  The probability that the project can be turned over to the Bureau of Statistics during the next few years is not high.  If the donor community requires the information that HKI furnishes, then it will most likely have to continue funding the project. The following lessons were learned.  (1) Reliable, timely, nationally representative information on health and nutrition is important to USAID/B, UN agencies, other donors, NGOs, and the Government of Bangladesh and helps to allocate resources effectively.  (2) Other agencies are willing to provide support to this project, but these contributions have represented less than 7% of the total costs. Strategies to draw on other agencies' resources need to be developed. (3) In January 1994, HKI distributed a readership survey.  Most of the 13% who responded gave the usefulness of the reports a favorable rating. Two members of USAID's Agricultural Development Division said the data is of utmost importance to their work, allowing them to track the severity of food shortages during a local drought. This positive response by USAID/B officers is consistent with reports by other user organizations.  (4) The project was intended to be an aid in coping with natural disasters.  There have been few of these, but the threat of them still exists. Continuation of the project will assure data will be available to relief organizations in the event of a natural disaster.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","388-0083-G-SS-9127-00","","6/1/1996 12:00:00 AM","","Disaster preparedness|Nutrition surveillance|Nutritional status|Planning","Bangladesh","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABM952.pdf","391 KB","008511 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (6/86-9/94) to train urban volunteers to provide child survival services in the slums of Dhaka, Bangladesh.  In its first phase, as the Urban Volunteers Project (UVP) (9/86-91), the project developed and tested the impact of a maternal child health and family planning (MCH/FP) service delivery model.  In its second phase, as the Urban Health Extension Project (UHEP) (9/91-9/94), the project disseminated its findings and supported related TA to government entities and NGOs providing health and FP services in urban areas.  Both phases were implemented by the International Centre for Diarrheal Disease Research (ICDDR). As a result of the project, over 1 million people residing in urban slums were provided for the first time with basic health, nutrition, and MCH/FP services; basic sanitation and diarrheal prevention; and the use of oral rehydration solution.  The result is improved health conditions for the urban poor.  ICDDR trained over 1,500 female volunteers from the slums to provide MCH/FP services to their neighbors, opening up a previously unexplored avenue of service delivery.  ICDDR also developed and maintained a unique urban health and demographic surveillance system (USS) to conduct and evaluate research on the health conditions in the urban slums of Dhaka.  Thanks to the USS, the Government of Bangladesh (BDG), donors, and service providers have available to them reliable information about the plight of Bangladesh's urban poor, resulting in more informed policy and planning and a likely increase in donor activities for this target group. The following were lessons learned.  (1) Qualitative and quantitative evaluations of the volunteer system revealed the feasibility of recruiting, training, and retaining illiterate and semi-literate slum women as health volunteers -- a significant project achievement.  These women can serve as important links between professional health workers and slum dwellers and may help overcome barriers to service utilization, especially by women.  However, it is not realistic to devise a full-fledged primary service delivery system based only on volunteers, however effective.  It would be wiser to maximize their usefulness by linking them directly to a formal health service delivery program.  (2) During focus groups, the female volunteers revealed that they felt their volunteering would increase their own standing and mobility within the community while providing the community with useful and important services.  (3) Since 1987, the project has maintained two small nutrition rehabilitation centers in the slums of Dhaka to serve moderately malnourished children.  Evaluation of data for 1 year on admissions to the centers and on 1 year of follow-up activity revealed that the high dropout rate of attendees rendered the centers ineffective. Project managers are now considering a home-based nutritional rehabilitation system.  (4) Evaluations have shown that, beyond collecting demographic data on Dhaka's urban slums, it is necessary to disseminate the data widely to policymakers and NGO personnel.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","6/1/1996 12:00:00 AM","","Maternal child health care|Health delivery|Slum areas|Urban areas|Demographic data collection|Volunteers|Women|Health workers|Child survival activities","Bangladesh","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABM964.pdf","689 KB","008511 - USAID.

"Evaluates as of 11/95 the impact of USAID's efforts to support the social and economic reintegration of ex-combatants in El Salvador following the Chapultepec Peace Accords of 1/16/92.  The evaluation was conducted by Creative Associates, Inc., which itself participates in reintegration efforts under a contract with USAID. Both subjective and objective measures indicate that ex-combatants have indeed been reintegrated into society:  some 80% of respondents in the evaluation sample consider themselves to be reintegrated, and respondents' median scores on a reinsertion index of social and economic indicators were within the same range as the scores for civilians.  The only group not reintegrated according to the index are those who received no benefits.  According to respondents, civil options, skills development, and taking advantage of benefits were the three principal contributors to reintegration.  The more respondents consider themselves reintegrated, the more they value civil options and skills development, as opposed to demanding rights or relying on benefits programming. Further, ex-combatants are increasingly involved in their communities (a key indicator of social reinsertion).  They believe that:  reinsertion programming was highly important in their reintegration; they themselves played a key role in selecting their benefits; and the international community is responsible for the availability of their benefits. Conversely, ex-combatants do not recognize the sizable role played by the Government of El Salvador in creating and delivering their reinsertion benefits.  While no group was fully satisfied with the menu of available reinsertion programming options, benefits were generally considered appropriate and useful to reinsertion. Lessons learned are as follows.  (1) Much has been done to support the war-to-peace transition in El Salvador, much of it geared specifically for ex-combatants.  In particular, local and international financial support for reinsertion programming was tremendous.  (2) Reinsertion programming offered broad coverage to those who served in the 12 years of conflict, with a varied menu of choices.  (3) Reinsertion involves many changes -- in status, in behavior, in self-definition.  (4) The number of benefits accessed has no direct impact on reinsertion, though beneficiaries tend to value what they received.  (5) Period of military service has no direct correlation with level of reinsertion.  (6) While level of formal education has a slight impact on ex-combatants' degree of reinsertion, reinsertion programming masks the educational requirements for civilian performance.  (7) Income is the single most important factor in successful reinsertion.  (8) Benefit tracks were able to accommodate many but not all ex-combatants -- the tens of thousands of demobilized represented too large and varied a population to be accommodated in full by three tracks of benefits. (9) Practitioners and ex-combatants did not understand reinsertion in the same way.  (10) Reinsertion programming may have crossed the efficiency curve whereby benefits no longer outweigh costs. (11) The impact of programming begins with design.  Specific impacts should be planned and defined up front so that programming may be specifically geared to fulfilling those goals. Recommendations are that:  reinsertion goals and scope be clearly defined at the outset; reinsertion programming model civilian life and stress performance; reinsertion programs be based on a thorough knowledge of the target populations and their needs and include specific measures to address identified barriers to reinsertion; and benefit tracks be kept flexible and allow the demobilized to change options. Finally, it is recommended that reinsertion programming:  be specifically linked to opportunities for income generation; include training in decision making; guarantee equal value of benefits (which is not the same as equal benefits for all populations); wherever possible, reward superior performance; be demand-driven; and include counseling to help ex-combatants develop realistic expectations.

"Final evaluation of a matching grant (8/91-7/96) to increase the capacity of the Foundation for the People of the South Pacific (FSP) and its partners in Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, and Vanuatu to implement sustainable ecoforestry programs. The project has assisted in the development of NGO sustainable forestry programs in the three targeted countries through the evolution of FSP/Papua New Guinea, the Village Development Trust (also in Papua New Guinea), the Solomon Islands Development Trust, and FSP in Vanuatu. The project also led to the establishment of FSP International's regional office in Vanuatu and helped the FSP network evolve into a global organization, which is now incorporated as Counterpart Foundation, Inc.  The project's institution building objectives were in general achieved. The project's implementation plan was revised following a June 1994 mid-term evaluation which identified a number of programmatic problems. Since that time, good progress has been made.  Country partners are developing and implementing ecoforestry strategies that suit their specific situations.  The planning, management, and implementation capacities of the country programs as well as of the FSP Regional Office and FSP/USA have increased to the point where the programs are leaders in ecoforestry activities within their own countries, and collectively form the largest and most professional group of ecoforestry staff among Pacific Island NGOs.  Networking and sharing of technical expertise between country partners is increasing (though further development is needed).  A range of ecoforestry activities have/are being implemented in each country; there activities are viewed positively by the evaluation team, other multilateral and bilateral donors, and local governments and NGOs.  The capacity of country partners to develop professional proposals for ecoforestry programs has increased (as can be seen in the increased levels and diversity of funding).  In addition, the country programs, FSP Regional Office, and FSP/USA have all increased the professional level of their accounting and management systems, and documentation on the use of funds is now comprehensively maintained.  There are considerable technical resources (e.g., training institutions, country partner staff) in the region which should be further utilized.  Already, the project has helped to generate support from other donors (in excess of what was required by USAID). The evaluation makes 23 recommendations based on four conclusions: (1) country partners need to constantly review and evaluate the performance of their organizations against realistic goals and objectives; (2) there is a need for more comprehensive and integrated statistical and costing data on a number of activities, especially ecotimber production and marketing; (3) the island partner organizations need to develop realistic strategies for accessing local markets for a consistent supply and quality of sawntimber; (4) the evaluation team endorses the idea of establishing the ecotimber industry in the South Pacific through the development of microenterprises.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","6/1/1996 12:00:00 AM","","Regional development|National level|Private voluntary organizations|Indigenous private voluntary organizations|Institution building|Forestry|Environmental management|Sustainable agriculture|Logging","Papua New Guinea|Solomon Islands|Vanuatu|Oceania","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABM968.pdf","3,003 KB","001354 - Foundation for the Peoples of the South Pacific, Inc.","","007746 - USAID.

"Mid-term evaluation of the Biodiversity Conservation Network (BCN), which, based in Manila, supports enterprises in developing countries that earn their income from the sustainable use of biological resources. The evaluation covers the period 9/92-4/96. The BCN is on track. Essential administrative structures are in place and financial flows, though somewhat slow (28% disbursed by the end of the third year), are on track with respect to the realities of project contracting and implementation. While monitoring is in urgent need of simplification, it has received substantial attention when compared with other environmental projects and is headed in the right direction. Enterprise profitability is at the level expected, but individual accounting systems need improvement. BCN is making good progress in understanding and addressing important social organization issues. Emphasis should now shift to the development and utilization of local social structures. Of 20 projects funded, 12 utilize nontimber forest products, 7 promote ecotourism, and 2 harvest timber resources. Six of the projects are located in Indonesia, 3 in Philippines, 3 in India, 3 in Papua New Guinea, 2 in Nepal, 2 in the Solomon Islands, and 1 in Fiji. At least 15 of the 20 were ongoing efforts prior to project funding and thus will meet the three-year time horizon required to show the effectiveness of an enterprise. Although 3 years may be enough in which to establish and prove the various monitoring systems or to detect the direction of change, it will take much longer to judge the project's overall effect on biodiversity and community organizations. BCN progress so far has confirmed the soundness of its concept. It has shown that biological resources used by very poor people cannot be preserved even with police action if the social and economic needs of indigenous and local people are ignored; that profitable enterprises that draw upon biological resources in a sustainable manner can be established in a wide range of ecological conditions; that supportive policies should remain a primary concern beyond the 3-year time horizon to ensure long-term success; and that, through educational programs, indigenous and local people readily understand the relationship between sustaining the resource base and their livelihoods. The following recommendations are made in order of priority. (1)Develop simple techniques for monitoring biodiversity, enterprise profitability, and social structures of participation. This may require some additional funding for outside consultants. The BCN also needs to persuade NGOs on the scene that local people should be helping to develop and implement systems of monitoring. (2) Make sure that indigenous and local people are participating in all aspects of project activities. Local NGOs should not be confused with the indigenous and local people themselves. While NGOs play a vital role in establishing the institutional structures that will involve local people, they must remember that the structures should be designed specifically for this purpose. (3) Begin to plan for a larger enterprise impact by increasing the competitiveness of the private sector in nontimber forest products. BCN projects tend to be implemented where the infrastructure is poor and thus attract relatively few private operators. This activity will have a longer time horizon than current enterprise activities and thus would require the project to be extended. (4) Be aware of the relationship between broader development efforts on the perimeter of the biological resource bases and encourage other institutions to take appropriate action where necessary. (5) Identify the broader policy issues of concern, from the rights of indigenous and local people to land tenure, and develop a plan for policy action across projects and for a general set of policy thrusts. (6) Classify projects and develop a concept of specialization that will make it possible to efficiently supervise a large portfolio of projects. (7) Seek funding from USAID beyond the present grant, preferably for another five years, to enable the BCN to pursue its central concept as modified by experience.","Executive summary: PD-ABM-970","Special Evaluation","Documents","AEP-0015-A-00-2043-00|AEP-A-00-92-00043-00","","4/1/1996 12:00:00 AM","","Biological diversity|Natural resource conservation|Environmental monitoring|Private enterprises","Asia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABM969.pdf","4,952 KB","008916 - John Mellor Associates, Inc.","","008271 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of Catholic Relief Services' (CRS) Title II Programs in Ethiopia for Fiscal Years 1994-96. CRS now programs approximately 21,000 MT annually of Title II food for development programs, more than half of which goes to over 20 maternal/child health (MCH) centers (each serving 3,000 children, pregnant women, and mothers), and for more than a million person-days of Food-for-Work jobs.  CRS continues to reflect its past profile of relief feeding, with nearly half of assistance going to the Missionaries of Charity, General Relief, and Other Child Feeding programs in central and eastern Ethiopia, in Eastern and Western Shewa, Oromia, Gurage, and Hararghe. Principal counterparts are the Nazareth Children's and Integrated Community Development (NACID), Hararghe Catholic Secretariat (HCS), Archdiocesan Catholic Secretariat (ACS), Missionaries of Charity, Cheshire Foundation, Meki Vicariate, Wonji and Metehara Catholic Missions, and Integrated Holistic Approach (IHA). The category Other Child Feeding (OCF) includes integrated efforts to improve the nutritional status of children, efforts to prepare young people for jobs through schooling and/or vocational training, and food-for-work activities; these activities should be programmed separately from the welfare categories.  The remaining programs in OCF and General Welfare either need to be restructured as institution-building efforts (some are relatively new and constitute a fragile social safety net for the poorest in Ethiopia, but need to be strengthened and to broaden their donor base); if this does not happen they risk being phased out under USAID's food security guidelines.  CRS should develop a strategy, in collaboration with local church and institution leaders, that continues to provide welfare support while building the donor base, so that the welfare support can survive when USG assistance is phased out. CRS has plotted new directions for the MCH/Women's Credit and FFW/CFW programs:  they will be linked by integrated mini-catchment geographical units with community health services and programs to improve water supply, and food production and access.  The MCH programs have already moved impressively to include preventive health for the most vulnerable (children under age 2 and pregnant women).  The programs have met the benchmarks for preventing growth faltering; overall rates of malnutrition in the 10 centers visited have declined since the 1992 evaluation -- from 845 among under 4-year-olds to 46% among under 3-year-olds. Severe malnutrition dropped from 16% to 2.3%.  However, lack of control groups makes it impossible to attribute these changes to the program.  CRS has strengthened linkages between medical clinics to ensure that children and pregnant mothers have up-to-date immunizations and checkups, and are referred for medical attention when needed. Pregnant women are being enrolled in the program, a rare achievement in worldwide MCH programs.  Baseline surveys on mothers' knowledge and practices have been completed in two centers and will be extended to other centers; results will be used to revise education content.  So far, it seems that more knowledge of current traditional practices would make for more effective mother education.  Also, CRS should consider and monitoring nutritional status, growth faltering, immunization rates, and mother knowledge and practices; existing data can be used to set targets for age groups. The Women's Credit Program, an adjunct to the MCH program, has been launched successfully and is showing nearly 100% repayment rates, with increasing profits on larger second and third loans, and potential benefits on household food security, especially qualitatively.  Women should explore new trade areas -- those that would complement MCH programs include producing weaning mixes (this has been piloted as an income-generating activity by Caritas).  Also, an M&E indicator should be identified that will measure the extent to which profits are used for food expenditures. Under the Food-for-Work/Cash-for-Work programs, the projects that correct soil degradation have longer term impacts on agricultural productivity but also important early effects on ecosystems and farmer awareness.  Also, there have been short-term benefits from improved water supply whether for livestock, human consumption, or small-scale irrigation.  Grasses that hold the soil are harvested for forage. Future activities will include:  integration of effort within well-defined catchment areas; inputs that ensure short-term increases in crop yield; and consideration of project assets as a priority over simply helping poor families.  Overall, technical performance of the projects was adequate, although demonstration models may be very complex and research-oriented; more practical models might be those that promote proven crop varieties that farmers could rapidly adopt. CRS has taken many steps to move away from what has been a strong humanitarian, egalitarian stance to a new role that will continue to meet the needs of the poorest, but will include more carefully designed, integrated, and concentrated development-oriented projects whose benefits can be measured thanks to baseline and follow-up surveys and a monitoring and evaluation strategy, so that CRS can move on to new areas before counterparts and beneficiaries grow dependent.

"In 1990 Nepal was swept by a democratic revolution that established a new constitution and multiparty democracy, limited, the king's power, recognized the people as sovereign, set up a directly elected parliament, brought the major parties out from underground, and guaranteed human rights.  The United States and other donors attempted to give international recognition to this change and to sustain the democratic opening. This evaluation examines the assistance provided in the legislative arena, assesses its impact, and draws lessons for legislative assistance in other countries. USAID's primary objective was to help Nepal establish the new parliament as a functioning democratic institution, its main strategies to support observation tours to Asian countries and the United States to expose staff and Members of Parliament (MPs) to legislatures in other countries, developing Secretariat support services, fostering nonpartisan discussion among MPs and citizen groups on national issues, and informing MPs and citizens about parliamentary developments in Nepal and abroad.  Specific USAID grants supported (1) an orientation program for new MPs, (2) intermittent visits by an Asia Foundation consultant to develop a needs assessment and long-range development plan, (3) an internship program for recent university graduates, (4) assistance to the parliamentary library, (5) a modest computer capacity, and (6) support of a NGO that held seminars and produced a monthly publication about parliament. At a broad level, the goals of the Nepal government and donors have been achieved.  Parliament is functioning and at the center of political life.  Multiparty democracy is becoming institutionalized, and few seek to undo the democratic changes. Peaceful transitions of government have occurred, with opposing parties acceding to controversial Supreme Court decisions. Although the credit for these accomplishments goes to Nepalis, donor assistance has had four important identifiable impacts. (1) As a result of observation tours, Nepal adopted a committee system that is already helping Parliament function more effectively.  (2) A surprisingly strong and popular oversight role has developed in the Public Accounts Committee, injecting a degree of accountability previously unknown in government agencies.  (3) The Secretariat has gained a sense of professionalism.  Computerization has greatly increased efficiency in tracking bills, maintaining current versions of bills, and producing documents needed by parliament to be effective and transparent. The experience in Nepal provides a rich case for lessons about assistance to parliamentary systems, useful low-cost interventions, interagency cooperation, external actors in the legislative arena, and managing legislative assistance.

"USAID's Regional Industrial Energy Efficiency project benefited 2,000 industrial firms in Guatemala and four other Central American countries by training managers and technicians in ways to use energy more efficiently.  However, economic policies and conditions prevailing at the time limited the probability of widespread adoption of energy conservation. This evaluation addresses impacts both in Central America as a whole and specifically in Guatemala. The project trained a small cadre of energy conservation experts, who could potentially form the core of an energy audit and conservation consulting industry; supported the publication of technical manuals and training guides that are universally regarded as high quality, relevant, and well-presented; and helped participating companies save an estimated total of $7 million a year.  The project emphasized inexpensive measures such as repairing leaks and installing insulation. Because the project helped to increase energy efficiency and reduce use, it has quite probably had beneficial environmental effects as well.  However, the project was unable to stimulate enough demand for energy conservation services to sustain an independent private energy audit and conservation consulting industry, or to encourage medium-term industrial lending by commercial banks for investments in energy conservation measures and equipment. The following lessons were learned.  (1) Education and awareness are critical to promoting industrial energy conservation.  In Guatemala, seminars and workshops informed engineers about energy auditing services and provided them with technical information for improved energy management.  (2) Unfortunately, the project gave only modest attention to energy price policy issues; energy conservation discipline flows as much from price incentives as from knowledge and awareness.  Cheap, if not always reliable, fuel and power supplies offer little incentive to follow responsible energy management practices.  (3) Energy auditing can be a bridge to environmental auditing; industrial companies that participate in energy audits and adopt recommendations frequently move on to address broader environmental problems (e.g., solid-waste management, wastewater treatment) that also benefit their cost performance and lead to a cleaner environment.  (4) Project personnel and participants can form the basis of a constructive network for advancing energy conservation after project funding ends.  Of the 30 to 40 local project staff, a few have moved on to become independent energy auditors and conservation consultants while others continue as energy managers for industrial firms that participated in the project.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1996 12:00:00 AM","","Energy conservation|Heavy industries|Technical training|Natural resource conservation","Guatemala","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNABS550.pdf","373 KB","008058 - USAID.

"Evaluates the impact of training funded by the Human Resources Development Assistance (HRDA) project in Madagascar from 1988-1996. HRDA has been a successful program in Madagascar. The Mission stands as a model for promotion of women, assistance to the private sector, and for use of cost-effective in-country training.  If USAID/Madagascar can now plan training in accordance with reengineering guidelines and strengthen monitoring, human capacity building could become its most powerful tool. Highlights from a survey of 495 of the 1,030 HRDA trainees are as follows.  (1) Ninety-two percent had gained some specific skills or knowledge, 72% improved job performance directly related to their learning, and for 33% their improved job performance led to positive results for their organizations. (2) U.S.-based training created the highest value-added at the level of organizational results, third-country training the least.  Third-country training's impacts on job performance and trainee learning were also significantly lower.  (3) Trainees from the private sector and NGOs were able to make their learning translate into organizational results twice as often as their counterparts from the public sector.  (4) The worst combination of variables for employment and location of training was government employees trained in third countries.  (5) Management training produced consistently high results.  This may be due to the slightly closer attention given to management training than to other types of training, with 67% of management trainees reporting that their training corresponded to their original objective (versus 30% in the sample as a whole). Unfortunately, the levels of monitoring will likely prove inadequate for reporting requirements under reengineering guidelines.  Only 32% of those asked said that anyone had evaluated their learning, and only 36% answered that USAID had made any inquiry into their satisfaction with the training experience.  A mere 16% answered that either USAID or their supervisor had made any kind of evaluation, including simple inquiry, of the impact of their training on their organizations. USAID was conscientious about monitoring satisfaction for U.S. training, but relatively negligent for in-country programs. Also, there appears to be inconsistency in terms of preparing trainees for training.  Barely more than 50% of trainees recalled hearing from either a supervisor or from USAID what the objective of their training would be.  However, 43% of all trainees received formal orientation on substantive, i.e., non-logistical, matters.  There is some evidence, but no proof, that pre-training conditions corresponded to training impact. Finally, fully half of the respondents cited cases in which the training had a positive collateral impact either on their personal lives or on their careers outside of their immediate workplaces.  For U.S. training, because training was of longer duration and higher quality, and because trainees had enthusiasm for the U.S., impact was slightly higher.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","AOT-0463-C-00-3215-00","","6/1/1996 12:00:00 AM","","Participants|Participant preparation|Participant monitoring|Institution building|Trainees|Public sector|Private sector|Management reform|Reengineering","Madagascar","","","006007 - AMEX International, Inc.","","009362 - USAID.

"In 1989, Poland's parliament was at the center of events that led to Poland's becoming the first Soviet client state to dissolve its communist-dominated political and economic system.  U.S. support for the parliament has involved two overlapping programs:  an initial ""Gift of Democracy"" from the Senate, primarily consisting of automation and office equipment, and the House of Representatives' Frost Task Force effort involving equipment, training, and technical support.  Most of the funding, more than $4 million from 1990-95, was provided through USAID, although the Agency's role in implementing the programs was minimal. The programs ushered in a new era for the Polish legislature and helped it to become more efficient, effective, and transparent.  For example, draft bills that used to take a week or more to edit, print, and distribute are now ready overnight, enabling parliament to handle a high volume of needed legislation.  Transcripts of parliamentary proceedings that used to take 6 months to produce are now available the following day. Parliament's information capabilities have increased dramatically.  Research service support from legislative databases, reports, and other expert input and analysis have helped to reduce the duplication and errors in legislation that were common in the early 1990s.  The new information resources have made parliament more transparent because it is easier for the media, advocacy groups, and the public to follow the legislative process.  All this has helped to make parliament more independent.  Its legislative deliberations are more informed and it is now the source of most proposed legislation, although the executive still generates the most significant bills. The assistance had limitations, however.  It did not help parliament acquire the capability to adequately review and analyze executive branch budget submissions.  In addition, high turnover among legislative staff, who, lacking civil service status, are vulnerable to political pressure, threatens the sustainability of program achievements.  Finally, USAID's minimal involvement meant missed opportunities to link program activities with related USAID lines of effort, such as strengthening democratic local governance and political parties. The assistance successfully met its original objectives -- strengthening parliament's infrastructure and information capability. However, it did not address other important facets of legislative strengthening, such as constituent relations, links between the legislature and civil society, or public understanding of how a democratic legislature works and what can be expected from it.  In sum, the two programs were insufficient as a stand-alone legislative strengthening activity -- a broader mix of support is needed to meet a newly democratic legislature's diverse needs.  Specifically, the study indicates the need to:  provide assistance beyond infrastructure and information needs; gain the support of legislative leaders; allocate and distribute assistance fairly; include U.S. and regional training; support development of budget review capability; make staff retention a priority; and ensure broader involvement of the USAID Mission.

"USAID has invested substantial resources in agricultural development for the past 30 years (and more), with yearly investments in the 1980s exceeding $1 billion six times. This study synthesizes the findings of five background studies which assessed USAID's agricultural investments in the areas of, respectively:  policy reform and planning, technology development and diffusion, rural infrastructure, services (especially credit), and asset distribution and access (especially land tenure security).  The study concludes that agricultural development relies primarily on the market and on private sector investment, while also requiring that the public sector provide an enabling policy environment and essential ""public goods."" Specific findings are as follows.  (1) The first priority is to develop an enabling environment, i.e., policies, technology, and infrastructure -- and of these three, policies are the most important.  (2) It is inconclusive as to whether investments in all five agricultural subsectors are essential. Of greater importance is a country's predisposition to agricultural development -- regardless of donor investments.  (3) Investments have been most successful when they have removed a bottleneck (e.g., agricultural research is more likely to prosper where infrastructure has been modernized) or when existing conditions have favored progressive change (e.g., policy reform efforts are more successful when they support an indigenous program of policy change than when donors try to introduce new policies.  (4) Investments in agricultural technology development and diffusion generate high economic returns; the social benefits of such investments justify the costs under a wide variety of situations. (5) Government should become involved in an investment only if public sector involvement will raise real national income more than would otherwise be the case.  (6) For the most part, the literature is silent on the question of which agencies (e.g., contractors, land grant universities) are best suited to implement which agricultural activities.  (7) There is no empirical evidence that the United States enjoys a comparative advantage over other donors in providing assistance in technology development, although it may have an advantage in providing assistance related to policy reform and planning. Two major management recommendations are made. First, in countries with an adverse economic policy environment, USAID should invest reluctantly, if at all.  Second, USAID should concentrate its investments on relieving binding constraints (not all constraints) to agricultural growth.

"Evaluates Phase II of the AIDS Technical Support project.  Process evaluation covers the period 1992-2/96 vs. a PACD of 8/97. The Phase II design was novel and even audacious: (1) in a departure from Phase I, a single major implementing entity, the AIDS Control and Prevention Program (AIDSCAP), was created; (2) Phase II integrated three ""proven"" technical interventions: increased condom access and use, behavioral change communication, and treatment of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs).  The project's umbrella-like structure gave USAID the opportunity to respond flexibly to the growing body of information and experience about HIV/AIDS, while the concentration of USAID's HIV/AIDS resources in the Global Bureau's HIV-AIDS Division allowed that unit to influence USAID Missions and provide global leadership.  On the other hand, the Phase II structure centered the management of this large and complex project on AIDSCAP which was larger than its mother institution, Family Health International (FHI).  FHI and its subcontractors have struggled with this management burden. AIDSCAP has done best in health and family planning, areas where FHI had experience, less well with behavior change and policy activities. The complexity of its task may have discouraged AIDSCAP's managers from being flexible to Mission demands or open to new intervention paradigms. Also, AIDSCAP tended to focus more on interventions and operations, and less on learning activities, such as behavioral research, pilot contextual approaches to HIV/AIDS, and programmatic collaboration. The management efficiencies that were realized from transforming Phase I's bimodal management structure into Phase II's single large project have been lost in recent years due to the mid-stream conversion of AIDSCAP from a cooperative agreement to a contract (which reduced risk-taking and flexibility, and greatly increased the documentation workload of USAID staff) and the introduction of field support budgeting (which, combined with major budget cuts in FY96, is threatening to undermine the project's viability). Although 85% of project resources have been devoted to AIDSCAP, USAID has funded valuable complementary activities implemented by other cooperating agencies (Cas), including behavioral research and pilot tests of alternative AIDS prevention models.  However, most Missions are unaware of these other activities and USAID has not provided resources to enable the two subprograms to learn from each other. Considerable friction was initially created by what Missions perceived as the ""Washington-only"" design of the project and its rather set approach.  However, Missions now feel that AIDSCAP has become more responsive to their needs and more decentralized in decisionmaking. Only seven Missions have established bilateral HIV/AIDS projects that do not use AIDSCAP as the primary implementing agency. Since no single evaluation system has been created for the project, USAID will not be able to evaluate the project's overall impact. Evaluating the impact of HIV/AIDS interventions is a complex and difficult task in any case, and USAID should not promise results to Congress or to advocacy groups.  The project's 5-year time frame is extremely tight -- even with a 1-year extension, a major commitment of financial resources and staff time will be needed to analyze and disseminate the rich data potentially available. As to technical focus, most observers believe that the project's three core strategies are still appropriate, but should be expanded to include:  contextual interventions; a more community-centered approach; reaching beyond traditional ""at risk groups"" to reduce women's and girls' vulnerability to HIV/AIDS; research and testing of vaginal microbicides; and linking prevention and care. Phase II is likely to achieve the target of 10-15 full-scale HIV prevention and control programs leading to documented changes -- an extraordinary accomplishment -- although structural problems may prevent the sustainability of some subprojects.  On the other hand, the target of applying behavioral research findings to communication strategies in priority countries is not likely to be achieved; at best, the findings of a limited number of medium-term research activities will be available.  The target to establish a global PVO/NGO federation -- the International HIV/AIDS Alliance -- was achieved.  The Alliance is off to a good start, but its financial sustainability is doubtful.  Finally, prospects for achieving the target of improved policies, especially for condom distribution and mass media communications relating to AIDS prevention, appear positive, although this outcome will be difficult to measure. A new strategy is needed for Phase III of the project, because a much wider population is now known to be vulnerable and the societal and economic impacts are deeper and more systemic than was realized when Phase II was designed in 1990.  As both a chronic and an infectious disease, HIV/AIDS is an extraordinarily difficult public health problem, which has not been and is not being prevented on any significant scale and for which there is no simple solution.  Various combinations of biomedical, behavioral, and policy changes may be effective, but need to be tailored to specific countries and contexts.  Since HIV/AIDS is here to stay, increased attention to capacity building and sustainability is required.  Also, HIV/AIDS is now recognized as a significant development problem, not simply a public health problem.  At the same time, USAID's financial and staff resources are diminishing, and USAID is likely to be less dominant among HIV/AIDS donors in the future; carefully coordinated donor strategies and country strategies will be needed.  Overall donor resources available for HIV/AIDS have reached a plateau and may decrease during Phase III.  New funding sources (local government, NGO, private sector, philanthropic) and an increased focus on low-cost and sustainable actions will be needed.  Detailed recommendations for designing Phase III are included.","Project title: Health technical services (HTS)","Special Evaluation","Documents","HRN-5974-C-00-3001-00|HRN-C-00-93-00001-00","","6/1/1996 12:00:00 AM","","Disease prevention and control|HIV/AIDS|Development strategies|Contraceptive distribution|Condoms|IEC|Human sexual behavior|Sexually transmitted diseases|Health education","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABN012.pdf","3,644 KB","003366 - TvT Associates|000981 - Pragma Corp.","","008291 - USAID.

"Final, ex-post evaluation of a project (9/2/91-3/94) to help to ""level the political playing field"" in South Africa by strengthening the capacity of previously disenfranchised political parties to participate in the national process of negotiating a new, non-racial, democratic government. The project was implemented by the U.S.-South African Leadership Exchange Program (USSALEP). The project achieved its objectives only partially. From the beginning there was debate over who the recipients should be, what would be an appropriate level of funding, and areas of expenditures.  Contrary to expectations, only two opposition political parties qualified for assistance, the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) and the African National Congress (ANC).  A major problem arose when USAID/SA, fearing the use of grant funds for party-building purposes, disallowed the payment of salaries, which had been expressly allowed in the original subagreements.  This restriction severely affected both subgrantees, and both criticized USAID's unilateral action. The IFP, which had fewer funding sources than the ANC, was especially hard hit.  IFP had its own compelling agenda, and a critical need to find the resources to fund it; it needed to pay its office bearers and mobilize its support base.  In the end, IFP found a way (it used part of the grant to purchase a building, which it promptly sold) to fund its major purposes, salaries and motor vehicles, both of which were expressly excluded in the amended grant.  Another case of disagreement was a planned IFP voter education project, which was rejected by the USSALEP project manager, a very careful and rigorous individual, on suspicion that the trainer was actually a military intelligence front man.  On the positive side, IFP used grant monies to purchase equipment (especially computers) which helped it to set up financial systems and improve branch and regional administration.  In such ways, the grant may have indirectly supported the negotiation process. The USSALEP project manager felt that the grant's main value was to keep IFP's institutional structures alive, and thereby reduce the likelihood of further violence in the country.  At the root of problems with the grant was a dilemma inherent in the project design:  how can USAID support a political party without becoming involved in the internal building up of the party? This dilemma was never resolved. ANC's was a similar story:  USAID denied salary reimbursements and USSALEP -- due to ANC's poor accounting practices -- vetoed funding for airfares and other travel costs (and later denied advances).  ANC, which had been an underground operation, simply did not have the human resources to do everything that was necessary. (ANC said that it had planned to use the promised, but withheld, salary reimbursements to hire qualified financial staff).  Another problem was that the ANC did not delegate authority; all decisions had to be discussed with key office holders and it was often difficult for USSALEP to get hold of these individuals to discuss matters pertaining to the project. Much of the grant funds were spent on buildings, renovations, computers, and training.  While ANC, as a formerly underground group, felt that buildings gave it a desired visibility, USSALEP would have preferred to channel these resources into the Peace Accords.  Did the grant funds have the desired impact on ANC capacity building for the purpose of negotiation? On the one hand, clearly ANC needed financial assistance to move from a resistance movement to a leading negotiator, to contest the elections, and then assume a dominant position in the new government.  On the other hand, the ANC received funds from many quarters, and the USAID funds did not have the desired impact in the targeted area of capacity building for negotiation. The key lesson from both subgrants is that it is difficult to give political aid and at the same time to dictate the terms on which the aid will be used.  It proved impossible to establish or sustain a distinction between ""party-building"" and the promotion of the negotiation process. Another lesson is the labor-intensive nature of managing such a project. According to USAID/SA, the model of contracting out project management worked well, and the Mission will seek to use it more extensively.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","3/1/1996 12:00:00 AM","","Political development|Democratization|Political parties|Disadvantaged groups|Political objectives","South Africa","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABM605.pdf","1,316 KB","008605 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to promote democratic initiatives in the Dominican Republic by providing grants to NGOs and grassroots organizations to promote civic education/participation and support for government reform (PID project).  Pontificia Universidad Catolica Madre y Maestra (PUCMM) is implementing the project.  Mid-term evaluation covers the period 3/92-7/96. After a slow start, activity picked up in 1995.  PID has awarded 57 grants (36 ongoing and 21 completed), ranging from $6,800 to $176,000. According to statistics provided by PID's operational unit, 1,442 institutions have benefited directly from the project, with a total of 17,292 direct beneficiaries and 140,288 indirect.  Most of the direct beneficiaries live in urban areas, although the grants are not concentrated in Santo Domingo, but have also been awarded elsewhere, particularly in the North-Central region and in the South.  While the grants have not focused on the poorest segments of society, most beneficiaries reside in ""barrios populares,"" where incomes are low. Most (57%) beneficiaries are men, but the gender gap is narrowing slightly. While this trend is encouraging, work with women leaders actually declined in 1995. Although PID has expanded the range of recipient organizations, most grants continue to be awarded to the better-known and more established NGOs and organizations.  At the same time, however, the grants tend to focus on specific populations or regions rather than on agenda-setting at the national level. PID's actual impact on democratic culture cannot be clearly assessed. The DEMOS survey by itself, as a baseline survey, does not allow for such measurement, and the project's failure to conduct periodic surveys makes it impossible to assess changes in values and attitudes.  To meet its goals by the 2002 PACD, however, PID will have to become more proactive in identifying target groups and regions, as well as themes related to democratic education and state reform, in order to motivate NGOs and grassroots organizations to apply for funding.  In particular, more grants should be funded in highly deprived regions in the Eastern and Western parts of the country. The following lessons have been learned.  (1) PID is a successful effort to implement a democracy project in an environment which has been distrustful of U.S. interference in domestic affairs.  The ""Medio Paso Atras"" (one-half step behind) strategy gave the Dominicans the lead on this project.  The strategic location of the Operational Unit in the PUCMM also contributed to the project's legitimacy.  (2) The project's 10-year authorization allows time to prepare, define policies, write procedures, gain credibility, and then to see results, learn from mistakes, and adjust the approach.  (3) PUCMM maintains high standards in the grant proposal and award process and in follow-up monitoring. These standards have had positive impacts on the quality of grant activities, and have contributed to the sustainability of the grantees. (4) The Consultative Council, which is comprised of Dominican leaders from political parties, labor unions, and other sectors, has played a key role in legitimizing the project and also has provided an example of responsible civic discussion, where individuals representing diverse interests feel free to discuss their disagreements in pursuit of a common goal of enhancing democratic initiatives.","Companion evaluation summary: PD-ABN-911|Project title: Advancing basic education and literacy 2 (ABEL 2)","Special Evaluation","Documents","HNE-5832-I-00-4016-00","","6/1/1996 12:00:00 AM","","Democratization|Political participation|Popular participation|Local groups|Indigenous private voluntary organizations|Women in development|Civic action","Dominican Republic","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABN017.pdf","124 KB","001341 - Creative Associates International, Inc.

"Evaluates project to revise the Organizational Capacity Indicators used by the Christian Reformed World Relief Committee (CRWRC) as its staff works with indigenous partner development organizations.  The evaluation covers the period 9/94-4/96. Project activities are based on the Appreciative Inquiry approach developed at Case Western Reserve University. Trainer/consultants from Case have conducted workshops with CRWRC staff in four regions world-wide.  That staff has in turn visited a large number of CRWRC partner organizations to learn their views about capacity-building and sustainability in a joint attempt to begin to identify characteristics of a capable and sustainable organization through shared inquiry into past experience.  An important question in this inquiry has been the effect of the local context on this organization-building process. Activities in the field have taken place as planned (chiefly training conferences and ""listening visits"") and have been highly successful, except in the Latin/Central America region, where difficulties unrelated to the grant activities have hindered full and enthusiastic participation.  The other three regions have gathered a large amount of raw data from their partners, setting the stage for productive regional conferences (to be held over the next few months) at which partner representatives and CRWRC staff will work together to analyze the data, attempt to draw some preliminary conclusions, and revise existing indicators and/or formulate new ones for field testing. Partner feedback about the process has been overwhelmingly positive. The process has already done much to improve working relationships between CRWRC and many of its partner organizations. The institutional strengthening component of the project is on or ahead of schedule in all respects except formal research.  The proposed manual is already taking shape, staff training has been completed, and a bibliography regarding capacity and sustainability has been developed. Some of the knowledge gained from the field implementation portion of the project activities has contributed to capacity building within CRWRC itself. While some remedial work must be done regarding formal research and field implementation in Latin/Central America, on the whole the project is accomplishing what was expected and more.  At this point all indications are that the project will be successfully completed and that the larger PVO/NGO community will profit from the experience of CRWRC as it presents its findings at the final conference projected to take place in the final month of the grant period.

"Evaluates the Management, Training, and Systems Strengthening (MTSS) component of the Cairo Water III Project. The component, which is being implemented by Black and Veatch International (BVI), aims to strengthen the General Organization for Greater Cairo Water Supply (GOGCWS). Mid-term evaluation covers the period 12/92-6/96. Overall performance of MTSS to date is fair, but has improved in recent months as the project has gained respect and momentum within GOGCWS.  Much of this can be credited to a new and supportive Chairman. Recent successful events include start-up of very effective pilot projects, establishment of an excellent training program, and establishment of a Performance Management Unit.  Of course, the MTSS contractor team shares in this success. Though recent accomplishments have been impressive, much remains to be done.  The lofty vision of the project paper and the sustainable systems and programs specified in the BVI contract will not be reachable during the remaining year of the performance period, nor will they likely be attained within the 2 years remaining in the project.  For most efforts, at least 3 more years is believed a minimum support requirement to build sustainability.  Personnel and financial systems will take longer. The tariff issue has been a contentious problem for all parties, with USAID rightfully claiming that the Egyptian government has again failed to meet a legal agreement, while GOGCWS and MTSS team members feel they have been asked to deliver on a condition that is not under their control.  GOGCWS and MTSS believe that the recent plan accepted by the Governor will be fully implemented within the next month or two.  The plan provides for a 28% annual increase for 5 years for water and an increase to 50% for the wastewater surcharge.  These have to be ratified by local councils that have the authority to make changes.  This sequence of steps poses a risk and requires close USAID monitoring.  If the rate increase is accepted, all sides should claim victory and move to the next steps of continuing to improve the major water and wastewater utilities in Cairo. Without further development by each, especially regarding operations and maintenance practices, infrastructure improvements from the $1.2 billion USAID investment will be subject to damage and a shorter lifespan. The project's performance improvement methodology is beginning to gain sufficient momentum to create sustainable change if supported and continued at least throughout the planned PACD of 12/97 and perhaps beyond.  This methodology is supported by the commodities program and also frames all pilot activities and training initiatives.  It serves to integrate the project and provide a framework for measuring results.

"PACR of a project (1986-1996) to revitalize Inner Kingston, Jamaica, as a center of economic activity and job creation. The project has generated impressive results from a relatively small amount of USAID funds.  Of particular importance was its role in helping to create an estimated 4,614 jobs, many of them for low income or unemployed residents of Inner Kingston. The Kingston Restoration Company (KRC), one of the implementing agencies, met or exceeded many of the targets set for it, producing 155% more space than projected under its Small Grants program and generating J$34 million in building improvements over a 4-year period.  While KRC did not develop as much industrial space as planned, the goals were illustrative and its accomplishments were substantial.  KRC's results in terms of job generation and delivery of social services have equaled or exceeded expectations.  The other implementing agency, The Urban Development Corporation (UDC), was not able to complete all planned infrastructure projects, and those that were completed were finished far behind schedule and far over budget.  Still, new major infrastructure elements are in place today. There were also several unintended positive outcomes.  First, KRC has developed a reputation and expertise which have made it a leader in shaping the revitalization process downtown.  Starting with neither staff nor an office in 1986, KRC has become an important coordinator and initiator of public and private sector investment; is recognized for its political neutrality; is looked to by the Government of Jamaica (GOJ) for policy advice; and is regularly consulted on matters of policy and downtown problems by the GOJ, the Office of the Prime Minister, business and investment leaders, and international donor agencies.  The GOJ has asked KRC to take responsibility for a number of difficult projects outside of Inner Kingston. Second, the GOJ has given downtown renewal priority attention in large part because of KRC activities.  Third, the project has become a model program in terms of its comprehensive approach to urban problems and its impacts.  Because of KRC's effectiveness as a public-purpose private institution, it has received special attention from USAID and other international donors. The following lessons were learned.  (1) Because urban renewal projects are complex and multi-faceted they require long-term commitment from funding sources and implementing agencies.  Even in the United States a successful urban renewal program takes 20-30 years.  The usual 5-10 year life of USAID projects could be taken into account to ensure that any interventions are strategically central to the longer term effort.  (2) Urban renewal projects must simultaneously address both (a) physical revitalization of buildings and infrastructure and (b) community development to advance the human condition and income-earning potential of low-income area residents.  (3) Sustainability of implementing agencies and the urban renewal program must be designed into the project by establishing long-term endowments and/or investing in assets that both achieve project purposes and yield long-term cash reflows.  (4) Implementing agencies need to adopt a business planning process and produce annual business plans.  (5) PVOs and NGOs operating social and economic development programs require significant long-term TA.  (6) Government and the private sector need to create a development partnership and collaborative planning process that survive changes in government.  (7) Small sub-grants as partial or matching funds and below-market interest rate loans are effective incentives to promote private sector investments. (8) Flexibility must be built into the design of complex urban renewal projects to account for normal cyclical changes to economic conditions that affect long-term private investment and to take advantage of opportunities that could not be anticipated at the design stage.  (9) Patience in expecting visible urban renewal results needs to be built into project design and indicators as the urban development process builds momentum slowly.  Unrealistic implementation schedules and targets cause unnecessary frustrations.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","6/1/1996 12:00:00 AM","","Urban renewal|Economic development|Economic infrastructure|Community development|Employment|Slum areas","Jamaica","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABN027.pdf","940 KB","008563 - USAID.

"Evaluates USAID's Vulnerable Group Food Program (VGFP) in three Caucasus countries (Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia) and in Tajikistan. Despite the devastating consequences of recent political, economic, and environmental upheavals on social and family life in the four countries, the evaluation team was unable to detect signs of mass starvation or even malnourishment, and thus concludes that refugees and internally displaced peoples, along with the traditional vulnerable populations (the old, the sick, and large women-headed families) are making do.  Most families appear healthy and well-nourished.  A few reports indicate some signs of stunting but not the more serious wasting. Better housing, not more food, was the request the team heard most often on its field visits. How this can be is not clear; reasons advanced include higher disposable incomes (by a factor of over 10) than had previously been recognized, support provided by families/extended families and neighbors, remittances from abroad, and possibly the continuing sale of personal assets (although televisions, fine china, and crystal are evident among refugees' belongings). Nevertheless, and even though the absence of reliable baseline data makes it impossible to detect any advantage to programs such as the VGFP, the team believes that targeted supplemental food from USAID probably played a part in preventing acute malnutrition from taking hold in the Caucasus and considers the continuation of well-targeted supplemental feeding programs for entire families or isolated vulnerable population segments to be the best solution to providing effective food aid in all four countries. General recommendations are that:  the total amount of targeted food aid be reduced through improved targeting; donors take every advantage of the income and expenditure studies underway in Armenia and Georgia and conduct similar studies in Azerbaijan and Tajikistan; and special care be taken not to allow such vulnerable populations as the hospitalized and elderly pensioners to slip through the targeted feeding network.  The team endorses self-targeting feeding programs such as those run by the Salvation Army and the French PVO, AICF (Action Internationale Contre La Faim) as soup kitchens.  It also supports the planned shift on the part of the PVO and development community from emergency or direct relief toward development assistance and job creation, and recommends the use of Title I local currency generations to support such development initiatives (such as has been a long-standing practice in Latin America). Of the three Caucasus republics, Azerbaijan deserves the greatest attention regarding continuation of USAID targeted food, given the plight of internally displaced persons and other vulnerable groups such as families of those killed in armed conflict.   Georgia should be ranked somewhat lower than Azerbaijan and Armenia in the allocation of USAID targeted food. Despite higher government-to-government and remittance flows to Armenia than to Georgia, the team saw more self-help, better housing, and better access to energy by target populations in Georgia than in Armenia.  With regard to Armenia, PVO and government authorities should assure targeting of all marginal populations, but other types of assistance should be increasingly phased in, with food assistance limited to groups that cannot be reached in other ways.  Finally, with regard to Tajikistan, the team cautions against scaling down the food programs too quickly, at least until a better quantitative understanding of vulnerability in Tajikistan is gained.","Task order 004","Special Evaluation","Documents","DHR-0037-C-00-5067-00","","7/1/1996 12:00:00 AM","","Humanitarian assistance|Food aid programs|Emergency food distribution|Beneficiary targeting|Nutritional status","Armenia|Azerbaijan|Georgia|Tajikistan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABN057.pdf","174 KB","008485 - Basic Health Management International (BHM)","","009066 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to provide trauma and humanitarian assistance in Bosnia and Croatia.  The evaluation considers the performance of eight grantees:  International Action against Hunger (AICF/USA); America's Development Foundation (ADF), Center for Attitudinal Healing (CAH), and the Harvard Program in Refugee Trauma); the Society for Psychological Assistance (SPA -- Catholic Relief Service's Croatian counterpart); Delphi; the International Rescue Committee (IRC) and Save the Children Federation (SCF). The combined efforts of the eight grantees and their various partners have produced tangible results: otherwise unusable hospitals, schools, public meeting places, and offices are now functional following the installation of windows and gutters and repair of roofs and walls.  Less tangible but no less important have been the creation and strengthening of local NGOs. The project either has reached or has the potential to reach a large proportion of the population.  For example, SCF is facilitating the creation of 770 community preschools; IRC has reached more than 10,000 beneficiaries in a variety of programs under its umbrella grant; AICF distributed seeds to 377,000 people in Travnik Canton in Bosnia during 1995; CRS/SPA have trained more than 600 professional caregivers; and Delphi's STAR project, emphasizing communication through e-mail, magazines, and newsletters, has the potential to reach huge numbers of women and their families in three countries (Bosnia, Croatia, and Macedonia).  Some programs, such as ADF's legal assistance and advocacy programs, are struggling to bring about changes within existing structures.  Others, like ADF's advocacy, legal, aid, and human rights work, are focused on trying to bring about peace through civil society. SCF, IRC, CAH, Delphi, CRS/SPA, and eventually Harvard (whose program is not yet operational) are working to heal members of the war-torn society through a variety of interventions -- group and individual therapy, support groups, dance and art therapy, chess, music, sports, ceramics, occupational training -- many of which are new to Croatia and Bosnia. Attempts at ethnic reconciliation have been meager, but the most deliberate of these have been made by ADF, AICF, and IRC. The grantees have faced serious constraints, including host government hostility, shifting donor emphasis from Croatia to Bosnia, and the changing needs of affected populations.  Most PVOs consider the governments of both Croatia and Bosnia as unfriendly toward NGOs and unhappy about the possible ramifications of citizen empowerment, with Croatia perhaps more ready to act on its antipathy.  Moreover, the PVOs operate in an environment of deep divisions between ethnic groups, where rapid efforts to ensure equity among ethnic groups may exacerbate intergroup resentments.  However, despite these tensions, particularly over salaries and benefits given to PVO personnel, some government officials recognize that their countries benefit from a skilled group of experts. USAID's management of the project has been characterized by frequent project officer turnover in Washington and a division of management responsibilities among USAID/W, the Budapest-based controller's office, and USAID/Zagreb (and more recently, USAID/Sarajevo).  Additionally, PVOs have had difficulty in obtaining timely guidance from USAID, and some have experienced budget and funding problems.","Task order 003","Special Evaluation","Documents","DHR-0037-C-00-5067-00","","7/1/1996 12:00:00 AM","","Humanitarian assistance|Private voluntary organizations|Civil war|War recovery|War victims|War damage|Complex emergency|Ethnic conflict|Post conflict societies","Bosnia and Hercegovina|Croatia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABN058.pdf","216 KB","008485 - Basic Health Management International (BHM)","","009066 - USAID.

"Assesses the impact of a water conservation curriculum developed by Jordan's Royal Society for the Conservation of Nature (RSCN) (with TA from USAID's GreenCOM) for use in Jordanian high school eco-clubs. The curriculum incorporated interactive teaching techniques and covered such topics as the water cycle, water sources in Jordan, reduction of household water use, ground and surface water pollution, and home gardens and irrigation.  RSCN staff conducted teacher training workshops in the curriculum for two teachers from each participating school; for many, it was their first exposure to an interactive teaching methodology.  The curriculum was then implemented in eco-clubs at boys' and girls' high schools between February and May 1995.  Its impact was evaluated by comparing participating and nonparticipating eco-clubs. Results show that some 60% of participating teachers implemented the majority of activities from the curriculum, including some optional activities.  Teachers who did not implement most activities may have used the curriculum only as a guide.  Time constraints such as those caused by the Ramadan holidays may have kept some teachers from completing all recommended activities.  Nonetheless, participating teachers implemented more water-related activities than did nonparticipating teachers.  The overwhelming majority of participating teachers would like to implement the curriculum again.  The curriculum seemed to have little impact on teachers' beliefs about the advantages of interactive teaching methods or their ability to implement these methods. The curriculum had a positive effect on students' water conservation knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors. Further, eco-club activities were shown to have the potential to strengthen school-community linkages and motivate both parents and students to actively participate in conserving Jordan's diminishing water resources. The curriculum evaluated here could effectively serve as a guide for curricula to address other crucial environmental issues. The project also played an important role in enhancing RSCN's institutional capacities in several areas, including:  teacher training; use of participatory teaching methodologies; material development; and social science research and evaluation skills.  Lastly, RSCN improved its capacity to effectively design and implement gender sensitive programs. The evaluation's survey instruments are appended.","Project title: Environmental education and communication (GreenCOM)","Special Evaluation","Documents","PCE-5839-C-00-3068-00|PCE-5839-Q-00-3069-00","","5/1/1996 12:00:00 AM","","Environmental education|Curriculum design|Pilot projects|Secondary schools|Teachers|Water conservation|Educational clubs|Youth","Jordan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABN059.pdf","269 KB","000223 - Academy for Educational Development, Inc.

"Final evaluation of a program/project (1986-96) to encourage agricultural policy reform in Egypt and strengthen the Principal Bank for Development and Agricultural Credit (PBDAC). The project succeeded in moving the agricultural sector to the forefront of Egyptian economic reforms, and has achieved a remarkable transformation of Egypt's agricultural policies, introducing sweeping reforms that have substantially liberalized agricultural production, pricing, and trade and led to significant increases in both production of major food crops and real farm income.  At the same time, however, the liberalization of output and input markets has exposed farmers, processors, and consumers to price instability in the international markets.  Little has been done to develop a system for collecting and disseminating the price and market outlook information that is needed to help Egyptian producers and consumers adjust to external market shocks. Despite this good record, some policy reversals and setbacks occurred during 1995-96 and have damaged public confidence in the continuity of the Government of Egypt's (GOE's) policies and created uncertainty about the security of private investment and agribusiness operations.  The GOE should give high priority to reestablishing its credibility; perceived market failures should be addressed only through limited interventions that disrupt private sector activity as little as possible. Also, with the broadening of the new reform program, continuing to treat studies and policy formulation as benchmarks and giving equal weight to all benchmarks runs the risk of dissipating resources and diminishing the incentive effects of policy conditionality. Conditionality should be assigned in proportion to the expected impacts and strategic importance of the policy actions required. Largely as a result of additions to its equity capital under the project, PBDAC's equity has risen from LE 100 million to LE 900 million, enabling expansion of its loan portfolio.  PBDAC has and will continue to have a crucial role in supplying rural credit; it is evolving from its previous role as a supplier of in-kind credit and provider of distribution and marketing services into a bank that provides credit and financial services to Egypt's small farmers, agricultural businesses, and, increasingly, the entire rural community. The Bank Improvement Program initiated in the last 2 years of the project is moving in very promising directions as far as the village and branch banks and the subsidiary BDACs are concerned.  The program has successfully tested credit-worthy lending methods, promoted deposit mobilization, and extended lending to women and non-farm businesses, clearly showing that such changes are both possible and productive. This approach, which should be extended system-wide, would benefit from additional donor assistance in improving bank incentive systems, loan performance appraisal and reporting, and staff training. Considerable progress has been made in establishing a computer-based management information system.  To date, the system has emphasized accounting, payrolls, and deposits to the neglect of data on loan performance and portfolio risk. As shown by its recent forced forays into cotton marketing and fertilizer distribution, PBDAC has not completely changed its image within the Ministry of Agriculture and Land Reclamation and the GOE to that of a broad and autonomous financial institution.  Complete divestiture of excess staff and facilities would enable PBDAC to make that transition as well as to clean its books so as to reflect its true profitability. PBDAC can operate as a development bank as long as the costs of unprofitable services and loans are covered by outside grant funds and PBDAC has autonomy in borrower selection, interest rates for deposits and loans, credit supervision, and loan collection for its regular clientele and for all the types of businesses it finances. For long-range viability, PBDAC needs a further expansion of staff experienced in modern banking techniques, a reduction in the number of BDACs, and a management reorganization.

"Evaluates the Title II program in Peru over the period 1990-95, specifically:  (1) food aid to the most nutritionally vulnerable (pregnant and lactating mothers, pre-school children); (2) support for comedores, communal kitchens run by poor women in marginal urban areas; and (3) food-for-work (FFW) programs in agricultural and rural development.  The program is being implemented by ADRA/OFASA, the relief and development arm of the Adventist Church; CARE; CARITAS (the relief and development arm of the Catholic Church); and PRISMA, a Peruvian NGO. The Title II program financed the importation of $360 million of commodities, $278 million for direct distribution and $82 million for monetization. CARITAS brought in the largest amount of food for direct distribution (36% of the total), followed by CARE (32%) and ADRA and PRISMA (16% each).  USAID and the PVOs carried out this large and complex program effectively despite very difficult political and economic conditions, USAID/W policy changes, and a large number of program audits and evaluations.  Additionally, USAID/W is to be commended for approving a significant level of monetization of Title II food for support of the Peru program, and CARE for implementing monetization, the need for which is likely to increase as the PVOs try to serve the more remote areas of the sierra and the selva. All of the PVOs, especially PRISMA and CARITAS, made dedicated efforts to get food and nutritional and health messages to mothers and children, who are the most vulnerable members of society.  With Title II food resources diminishing, the messages should be given a much higher priority, along with the training of community promoters and Ministry of Health personnel. This will require better coordination between the agencies and between them and USAID. The comedores have provided an efficient and cost-effective way of distributing food to the needy in urban slum areas and contributed significantly to family nutrition and well-being (and possibly to political stability), especially in the early years of the program, when the Government of Peru (GOP) was unable or unwilling to provide an adequate safety net for the poor.  In light of Peru's serious underemployment and unemployment problem, continued support for the comedores may be needed. FFW agricultural and rural development programs have augmented family food supplies in many impoverished sierra communities and have had some success in meeting Title II mandates to increase awareness of soil conservation, the self-help capacity of poor farmers, and awareness of the dietary value of certain foods, especially for children.  However, all of the PVOs have some weaknesses in providing technologies appropriate for sierra farmers, a problem exacerbated by the inability of the GOP itself in this regard.  This is an area in which USAID (not just the Food for Development office) should assist the GOP and the PVOs.  Also, given the high cost of transporting food to, and ensuring the security of food stored in, remote and inaccessible areas such as the Peruvian sierra, fulfillment of the current food security mandate to reach the poorest of the poor in the sierra will require either or both of the following: (1) increased food monetization to support new ways to deal with the problem; (2) the movement of people from the most remote areas to magnet urban centers, as is being planned by the Office of the Presidencia. Several issues are noted regarding the future direction of the Title II program.  USAID/W's 1995 Food Aid and Food Security Policy paper, while generally concurring with the geographic and beneficiary priorities of USAID/P's 1994 Food Security Strategy Paper, downplays the latter's stress on using the Title II program to improve access to food by increasing the incomes of the poor.  The evaluation team concurs with the Mission's emphasis on access to food through income generation, and feels that it was premature for USAID/W, in the case of Peru, to determine that there was sufficient opportunity from other programs to combat general poverty.  Hence, efforts to promote income-generating activities in conjunction with food distribution should be allowed to continue for a year or two longer than planned.  The team also concurs with the importance of continuing maternal-child health and nutrition education, particularly that related to adequate diets and breastfeeding up to 2 years, the lack of which may be contributing to the high prevalence of growth stunting among children in Peru, particularly in the sierra. Finally, all of the agencies, following USAID guidance, are shifting the focus of their efforts from the coast to the sierra.  This shift brings up questions about the targeting guidelines in regard to both geographic concentration and the types of programs to be given priority. These issues have implications for how the Title II program should be structured as it continues to wind down, and highlights the need for more solid data on which to base operational decisions.","Delivery order no. 35","Special Evaluation","Documents","AEP-0085-I-00-3002-00","","8/1/1996 12:00:00 AM","","Food for Peace Title II|Food for Work|Beneficiary targeting|Maternal nutrition|Infant nutrition|Agricultural development|Private voluntary organizations|Indigenous private voluntary organizations|Poor|Community centers|Kitchen facilities|Food aid monetization","Peru","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABN114.pdf","8,048 KB","000436 - Development Associates, Inc.|001864 - Nutrition Research Institute","","008591 - USAID.

"Evaluates the AIDS Technical Support project, USAID's major effort to combat HIV/AIDS.  The evaluation covers Phases I (1987-1991) and II (1992-6/96, vs. a PACD of 8/97) and summarizes experience and lessons learned for use in designing Phase III. Phase II has supported HIV prevention and control through three major types of interventions -- efforts to reduce sexually transmitted infections/diseases (STIs/STDs), condom social marketing, and behavior change communication -- and several supporting interventions:  behavior research, policy reform, monitoring and evaluation, capacity building, and women's status/empowerment. Field experience with STI/STD reduction demonstrates the following: syndromic management (a simplified approach to the clinical management of curable STIs, which recommends treatments based on symptoms rather than clinical or etiologic diagnoses) is an effective approach in resource-poor settings; sufficient supplies of drugs are critical; the targeted intervention research (TIR) approach is an effective tool for improving service quality and creating additional demand for STI services; provision of STI services along with condoms to high-risk populations is cost-effective; and integration of STI/HIV prevention and control with family planning and maternal/child health programs is feasible.  There is a critical need to identify simple, inexpensive surveillance systems for STI/HIV, develop improved female-controlled barrier methods (e.g., microbicides), and develop rapid, simple, low-cost diagnostics. Condom social marketing (CSM) has been very successful in preventing HIV/AIDS.  The special needs of those who continue to practice high-risk behaviors must continue to be addressed, however, as well as societal norms and values that make CSM more effective.  There is a great need to include female-controlled barrier methods in CSM programs as they become available. Experience with communications to promote behavioral change teaches that mass media can quickly raise awareness and change attitudes and behavior.  Mass media are most effective when coupled with interpersonal communication and community participation/ownership (e.g., peer-to-peer support).  Many findings from U.S. behavior research could likely be applied in international settings (e.g., findings concerning the effects of social structures and community values on individual vulnerability and behavior). Addressing policy is essential: policy reform can create a favorable environment for behavior change, e.g., Thailand's  100% condom' brothels.  A supportive policy environment is essential to the success of many programmatic interventions, such as allowing youth access to sex education and condoms, allowing nonmedical personnel to provide STD drugs, using syndromic management, or eliminating fees and regulatory obstacles to wider distribution of STD drugs and condoms. For Phase III, USAID should consider the following strategies:  (1) policy reform at the donor and country levels, focusing on development of international standards; (2) TA in designing and implementing improved programs, accompanied by manuals, guidelines, and case studies demonstrating proven interventions; and (3) research on immediate programmatic needs (short-term) and on awareness of promising new developments. Efforts should continue to focus on men and women who practice high-risk behaviors, but should be expanded to other groups who are increasingly vulnerable to the virus (women and youth aged 15-29). Condom social marketing and STD reduction strategies should be scaled up during Phase III, as should communication programs that have been proven to change behaviors; more behavior research is needed, however. Finally, as the HIV/AIDS epidemic continues, the most effective response shifts toward activities that integrate prevention with nonclinical care.  In several countries where sero-prevalence is high, the project is already supporting small, community-based social-psychological care and support for HIV positive groups and those living with AIDS.  USAID should also consider supporting community-based social mobilization programs.","Project title: Health technical services (HTS)","Special Evaluation","Documents","HRN-5974-C-00-3001-00|HRN-C-00-93-00001-00","","1/1/1996 12:00:00 AM","","Disease prevention and control|HIV/AIDS|Sexually transmitted diseases|Disease treatment|Behavior change","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABN130.pdf","1,103 KB","003366 - TvT Associates|000981 - Pragma Corp.","","008291 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (8/93-3/96) to create a private foundation (FUNDECOR) to support (a) forestry and agroforestry in buffer zones around the Braulio Carrillo, Poas, and Irazu National Parks and other natural protected areas of Costa Rica's Central Volvanic Cordillera (AVCC) and (b) management of these protected areas (FORESTA project). General activities included the following. (1) Project CARFIX was inaugurated 1/96 to address the commercialization of environmental goods and services. The project will include 1,878 forest and forest plantation owners; its goal is the sustainable management of 20,502 ha of natural forest, 10,570 ha of secondary forest, and 5,533 ha of native tree plantations.  The project also envisions the consolidation of the National Parks of the ACCVC through acquisition of private properties within park limits.  (2) The Base Group, comprising FUNDECOR, USAID, and ACCVC personnel, developed a global strategy for conservation and natural resource management in the ACCVC.  (3) Infrastructure improvements have included the upgrading of Operational Centers at Poas Volcano, Irazu Volcano, Guayabo, Zurqui, Quebrada Gonzalez, and Barva Volcano.  (4) The Protection and Control Program has noticeably reduced and controlled the rate of deforestation and the irrational and illegal use of the natural resources of the ACCVC, especially in the buffer zones, where the illegal activities tend to concentrate. Achievements under FORESTA's three specific components included the following.  (1) Management of Protected Areas.  Management plans and visitor control facilities were prepared for each of the national parks in the ACCVC; boundaries were established for the Braulio Carrillo National Park; and ACCVC administration was improved through technical/administrative handbooks and quinquennial and annual operative plans.  A concession system has helped guarantee financial ACCVC self-sufficiency.  Several publications have been produced, which describe the natural wealth of ACCVC. (2) Management of the Natural Forest.  Using a LANDSAT-based System for Geographical Information (SIG) -- one of FUNDECOR's most important achievements -- FUNDECOR has identified the zones most in need of reforestation.  To date, a total of 13,487 ha are under agreement with private owners for the conservation of these forest masses.  Despite serious regional problems on land tenure and constantly changing forest regulation procedures, 15,000 ha have been placed under improved forest management techniques, vs. a target of only 5,000. More importantly, the legal contract signed between FUNDECOR and the owner ensures that there will be that much forest in the central valley for at least the next 10 years.  While FUNDECOR has not worked at the forest industry level, its support to the owners in the legalization of their properties has been one of its great achievements.  At the local level, FUNDECOR has signed 142 agreements with local communities for the protection, management, of reforestation of 14,546 ha in the ACCVC's buffer zones, and another 112 reforestation agreements with small and medium producers.  These efforts have increased employment and income and improved the marketing of forest products.  FUNDECOR also introduced and spread the practice of ""low environmental impact harvesting techniques"", and is highly accredited for promoting forestry policy changes, including development of a simplified, more efficient, and less costly forest management plan. With assistance from Tropical Agricultural Research and Training Center (CATIE), FUNDECOR's original idea has been adopted by Costa Rica, as well as well as by Guatemala and Honduras. (3) Reforestation and Agroforestry.  In cooperation with the ""Centros Agricolas Cantonales"" of Sarapiqui and Siquirres, FUNDECOR has promoted and reforested some 1,100 ha with native trees species; to permit more emphasis on sustainable forest management, the original target of 4,000 has was revised downward and the agroforestry component dropped.  More importantly, FUNDECOR has spearheaded a regional culture of planting and reforesting with native tree species.  Under a contract with the Organization for Tropical Studies, FUNDECOR controls the quality and the provenance of the seeds used in reforestation projects. In sum, FUNDECOR has become an organization that must be consulted in forest matters both in the ACCVC and at national level, with a credibility that facilitates relationships with farm owners in the zone. At the economic level, the consolidation of the Patrimonial Fund will allow FUNDECOR to continue its long-term operations.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1996 12:00:00 AM","","Natural resource management|Natural resource conservation|Natural resource utilization|Protected environmental areas|Private organizations|Institution building|Forests|Buffer zones|Sustainable agriculture|Reforestation|Geographic information systems","Costa Rica","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABN133.pdf","536 KB","008533 - USAID.

"PACR of a Housing Guaranty (HG)/TA project (1990-96) to foster a greater role for elected city governments, the private sector, and NGOs in the development of shelter-related infrastructure in chartered cities in the Philippines. Project objectives were fully achieved.  The Government of the Philippines (GOP) complied fully with all policy requirements, in some cases exceeding targeted accomplishments.  Key areas of concern included:  (1) developing self-sustaining financing systems for chartered cities; (2) reducing urban and environmental infrastructure constraints on local economic development; and (3) improving access to sustainable urban shelter delivery systems for low-income households. Owing to a large dollar reserve, the GOP decided to forego the last $15 million of the $50 million authorized HG loan. Unfortunately, the GOP was unable to continue its Community Mortgage Program (CMP), aimed at helping communities acquire financing for land and urban services.  Although the project had successfully piloted the CMP, demonstrated its cost-effectiveness, and trained 50 NGOs to promote community participation in the program, the inability of the National Home Mortgage Finance Corporation to process loans resulted in fewer than 50 CMP loans.  Many of the communities found alternate financing, however. TA was provided mainly by Planning and Development Collaborative International (PADCO).  This included monitoring of the GOP's policy achievements, and direct TA to 11 cities and to the League of Cities in capital investment planning, shelter planning, credit finance, and land use mapping and management. Both Cebu and Naga now have a working Geographic Information System (GIS), and Naga has completed a feasibility study for a new integrated bus terminal and commercial center, including all activities to float a local bond.  TA to the League of Cities resulted in 13 sharing programs which featured best practices in the areas of solid waste, sewerage, road, shelter infrastructure, and urban environmental services; this program enabled officials from all 60 chartered cities to see practices that actually work and to learn to copy or adopt them.  The last City Sharing Program enabled the cities to firm up their action plan for making Philippine cities livable.  The plan was submitted to the national government for inclusion in the upcoming Habitat II Conference.  Similarly, an Urban Sector Review and a draft Urban Policy Framework resulting from project TA helped to focus the GOP's attention on urban management, particularly environmental issues. The following lessons were learned.  (1) The project provided a good model for how a policy-based sectoral HG program can be made to work. It demonstrated that long-term involvement in an integrated program with clearly focused policy sub-objectives can lead to important, measurable policy change while avoiding the dangers of project fragmentation.  (2) Where local democracy exists along with an appropriate framework for decentralization with accountability, USAID assistance is likely to be more productive if it directly supports and facilitates local initiatives.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","4/1/1996 12:00:00 AM","","Housing investment guaranty|Housing finance|Low cost housing|Decentralization|Housing policy|Policy reform|Cities and towns|Public services|Municipal level","Philippines","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABN134.pdf","673 KB","008592 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (8/88-3/96) to promote small-scale commercial agricultural production and marketing in Swaziland (CAPM project). The project was implemented in three differing phases.  Phase I, the original design, was focused on policy change and was abandoned after less than 2 years.  Phase II was designed for more direct assistance to farmers and local marketing organizations, including infrastructure development.  A mid-term evaluation showed that the Phase II approach was not going to achieve the intended outcomes, resulting in the final design, Phase III, which focused on developing farmer organizations as means to plan and market production. The work with individual farmers, continued over from Phase II, was the project's most successful aspect.  Improved practices and increased income from horticultural crops seem well established.  The development of farmer organizations, the express focus of Phase III, has been less successful; it is generally agreed that this output was overly ambitious for the short time available in Phase III.  While CAPM advisors were able to find marketing channels for the cooperatives' produce, it does not appear that lasting relationships between regional and local markets and the farmer organizations have been established. At the EOPS level, project efforts led to the development of two agricultural cooperative societies, Khulemela Kwenta (KK) and Hhohho (HFV), both of which were serving their intended functions by the end of the project.  The project has met or exceeded its goal to strengthen 150 farmers on 120 hectares so that they are capable of producing marketable horticultural crops to meet market demand.  Despite variations and shifts in market conditions, the average increase in net income per hectare for participating farmers has far exceeded the target; December 1995 data shows an average income per hectare of E16,603.  In 1995, the total value of CAPM exports to regional markets is expected to reach E650,000; to domestic markets, about E600,000. In terms of sustainability, 10 of the 20 large private growers who participated in Phase II continue to produce 1,500 metric tons of fruit and vegetables annually on 80 hectares, and one of the marketing companies helped during Phase II is still thriving.  CAPM also provided institutional strengthening to the National Marketing Board and the Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives (MOAC) research and extension staff.  In addition, CAPM established produce packing facilities at KK and HFV, developed policies, procedures, and operating systems for the two entities, and provided training in their use.  Of the 320 small horticultural producers who benefitted from CAPM, about 70 are likely to continue commercial farming operations. During the last 4 years of CAPM, some 300 training events were carried out, a third of them concerned with production, including water management techniques, ways to ""scout"" fields for disease and insect damage, and the use of protective clothing and gear when dealing with hazardous materials. Two institutional arrangements entered into under the project proved successful.  The Swazi Business Growth Trust (SBGT) developed an agribusiness loan program which can be fully sustainable beyond the end of the project.  Likewise, USAID support for the University of Swaziland/Ohio State University (UNISWA/OSU) linkage proved very cost-effective, with the Student Attachment Program (SAP) developed to provide UNISWA students with a better, more career-oriented curriculum seemingly ensured of being sustained in the Faculty of Agriculture. The report includes extensive lessons learned regarding farmer organizations, production, packsheds, marketing, and general product development.","Project title: Commercial agricultural production and marketing|(CAPM)","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","8/1/1996 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural development|Farmers|Commercial farming|Export promotion|Agribusiness|Agricultural production","Swaziland","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABN136.pdf","951 KB","008609 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of a project (8/90-8/96) to improve the quality and the efficiency of basic education in Swaziland.  The Institute for International Research (IIR) was the implementing agency. This ambitious and complex project attained its purpose and met its objectives.  (1) The number of students graduating on time from grade 3 has increased from the 1989 base, repetition and drop-out are on the decline, and children are learning more and better.  (2) Teachers of grades 1-4 are applying continuous assessment (CA) to teaching Mathematics and English, and teaching has become more interactive. These educational tools have improved children's learning, giving real meaning to the motto ""every child is a successful learner.""  Core personnel are committed to CA and capable of expanding it to other subjects and to grades 5-7.  (3) Head teachers have the skills and understanding needed to manage their schools better.  (4) The Ministry of Education (MOE) is using empirically generated data to make policy and planning decisions.  (5) There is increased awareness among students of career choices and resources for identifying employment options. In many areas, the project achieved more than it had originally envisioned, enabling the MOE to embrace reform and effect an efficiency-effectiveness-quality paradigm shift.  For example, head teacher management training has improved school management at the primary and secondary levels and previously strident press criticisms have dwindled noticeably.  The in-service teacher training department (INSET) team has embraced training methodologies developed early in the project and conducted, independently, five cycles of training throughout the country.  INSET has so matured that it is planning a program to devolve in-service work to the school level. In addition, a Management Information System (MIS) capable of providing information on demand is in place.  Six years ago the MOE was criticized by a public sector review for its extremely weak planning capacity and its lack of the information needed to make rational decisions.  Today, the unit has a policy support model which it has used to analyze and determine policies and programs.  A teacher data base has helped the MOE rationalize the teaching force at a time when resources are becoming increasingly constrained. Organizational Development (OD) work has helped the MOE use MIS data to establish coherent and useful policies and procedures.  A National Education Symposium allowed 400 prominent people to review the state of education in the country and lend support to the MOE's reform efforts. The symposium marked a turning point by galvanizing the education sector and the community at large.  In addition, a Quality Working Group began planning a school  program to improve effective learning, and a committee of The National Education Strategy prepared, under the motto ""Our Children First"", a strategy for education until the Year 20/20, embracing basic education, CA, and improved school management and autonomy.  The OD component also assisted in the area of donor coordination.  Above all, it helped bring into the open the need and desire for reform as originally envisioned by the National Education Review Commission (NERCOM) report of 1985 and the project design.  The National Development Strategy (NDS) Education Sector Committee has recommended establishment of a group to initiate, monitor, and sustain educational and training reform. The Project Steering Committee, which will continue to function as the ""Basic Education Steering Committee"", included interest groups in its discussion and decision-making, thereby reaching decisions acceptable to the majority of parties involved.  Such is the stuff of reform. Overall, the project has contributed to two of USAID's pillars of development assistance:  economic growth, by helping to establish an efficient and high quality human resource base needed to work toward the goal; and democracy and governance, by lighting the way toward transparent and open development. For lessons learned, see the abstract of PD-ABN-135.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","8/1/1996 12:00:00 AM","","Primary education|Institution building|Technical training|Educational materials|Educational development","Swaziland","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABN137.pdf","721 KB","008609 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (5/90-5/96) to strengthen Swazi management capacity in the public and private sector and upgrade training institutions that support private sector growth (STRIDE project). Subsequent to the 11/93 mid-term evaluation, a major shift of emphasis was made in response to political changes in the Southern Africa Development Community (SADC), particularly in South Africa, and the deteriorating economic environment within Swaziland.  The project widened its target audience to include labor unions, which were in the forefront of promoting democratic change -- which the private sector also perceived as vital for investment and economic growth.  It also shifted its training strategy by bringing together large delegations of participants to examine topics such as industrial relations, governance, economic productivity, and human resource competitiveness. Achievements exceeded targets.  A total of 52 Fellows completed academic participant training and resumed employment in Swaziland, the majority of them in positions where they could apply their training; 78% of the Fellows studied business and 42% were women.  The Swaziland Institute of Management and Public Administration (SIMPA) conducted 23 Public Sector Management Program (PSMP) workshops for more than 1,000 senior civil servants, with priority to those serving the private sector.  STRIDE also funded two 40-person delegations to civil service reform conferences in the Republic of South Africa; without this support, the reform momentum unquestionably would not have been maintained.  Other training included workshops on productivity (one led to a tripartite resolution to create a Swaziland National Productivity Center); training for Community Development staff in preparation for traditional leadership training; and the first ever Budget Development and Analysis workshop, conducted by SIMPA and attended by 90 Parliamentarians. Although the strengthening of SIMPA was not originally envisaged, the project's positive experience with SIMPA after the 1994 appointment of a very forward-looking Principal led to a cooperative agreement between SIMPA and Technikon Southern Africa for the purpose of strengthening SIMPA's capacity to conduct training of elected leaders at the urban government and Parliamentary levels. Cal Poly upgraded commerce programs at the University of Swaziland (UNISWA) and Swaziland College of Technology (SCOT) by providing training in teaching methods and computers along with MBA training for four UNISWA staff and B.S. training for one SCOT staffer.  In addition, an entrepreneurial course was established at SCOT and a small business development center at UNISWA, and Cal Poly helped to establish and refine viable internship programs at both institutions. The 5/96 final evaluation noted that the project had become a major vehicle for promoting national dialogue and political change in Swaziland. In addition to the lessons learned noted in the final evaluation (PD-ABM-945), the project showed how a training project begun in a traditional mode can be refocused as needed to support a very different strategy of achieving Strategic Objectives.  Such flexibility in design, which provides project management the opportunity to respond to major changes in the environment, is a critical feature of any successful development assistance effort.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","8/1/1996 12:00:00 AM","","Education for development|Personnel development|Participants|Management training|Public sector|Private sector|Universities and colleges|Training centers|Institution building","Swaziland","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABN138.pdf","340 KB","008609 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (5/90-8/96) to provide U.S. training and exposure to a democratic society to Costa Rican leaders and potential leaders (CAPS II project). The project was well-designed, especially in targeting socially and economically disadvantaged leaders, and successfully implemented.  CAPS II focused on the private sector, with special attention to women, minorities, and economically disadvantaged groups.  Coverage was over a large geographic area to allow participation of leaders at the national, provincial, and local levels. Under the long-term academic program, 2 undergraduate and 85 graduate students studied in the United States in fields such as engineering, journalism, education, agriculture, business administration, public administration, environmental sciences, and international law.  In the long-term technical program, managed by FUNAC (the Foundation of Four-S Clubs) in collaboration with the U.S. National 4-H Council, 60 high school students spent a school year in the United States, living with U.S. families.  In the short-term training program, 225 participants, mostly community and school leaders from rural and semi-rural areas, received 4 weeks of U.S. training designed especially to meet their needs. All CAPS II trainees, except for eight who are completing U.S. Masters programs, have returned to Costa Rica and are applying their skills, contributing to the development of their country.  Their multiplier effect has been extraordinary. The project gave trainees not only new knowledge and skills, but an increased confidence and sense of responsibility, along with a new open-mindedness about the world. Knowledge of the English language enabled them to get better jobs and obtain promotions. Because of its focus on the socioeconomically disadvantaged and women, CAPS II contributed significantly to USAID/CR's goal to promote active participation in the economy by the disadvantaged. In fact, 51% of all participants were women, versus a 40% target set by USAID/Washington. The following lessons were learned.  (1) The key elements in the success of the long-term component were the establishment of a selection committee (composed of representatives of the Mission's technical divisions and Training Office, training experts, returned participants) and the selection criteria established by the Mission.  (2) Use of intermediary institutions for the short-term technical component ensured broad participation of the socioeconomically disadvantaged.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","8/1/1996 12:00:00 AM","","Scholarships|Leadership training|Participants|Education for development|Higher education|Technical training|Beneficiary targeting|Disadvantaged groups|Women in development","Costa Rica","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABN146.pdf","126 KB","008533 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (8/93-6/96) to promote sustainable forest management in Costa Rica (REFORMA project). Several positive results were achieved by this ambitious project. Its key accomplishment, according to the seven participating organizations, is that now they understand much more clearly what they must do in the future -- and the disaster that will result if they fail.   REFORMA increased public awareness of the importance of the forest and the possibility of a higher standard of living for farmers and landowners; successfully and fruitfully brought together government personnel, scientists, technicians, conservationists, community leaders, and business people to discuss the state of the country's forests, exchange experiences, and coordinate their efforts to save remaining forest resources; and put NGOs, the private sector, and the State to work on the same objective -- to find solutions to deforestation threats. The project made possible the extremely useful monitoring of allegations of illegal logging by CEDARENA (unidentified acronym), while CIIBI (unidentified acronym) produced maps of the forest cover.  These achievements will enable MINAE (probably the Ministry of Natural Resources) to control deforestation more efficiently and develop a sector strategy.  A key achievement was the reconciliation between forestry officials and members of the legal system through training courses where they exchanged ideas, experiences, criticisms, and expectations.  Also, project support for Camara Costarricense Forestal (CCF) as lead entity for the private sector fostered a joint effort to ensure that the new forestry law incorporated regulations important to the interests of the forestry sector.  The CCF improved relationships with the government, simplified procedures, and launched various programs with the forestry sector that put the sector on the road to sustainability, such as the National Program CCF Genetic Improvement of Seeds for Reforestation. Following are the major lessons and conclusions.  (1) The project's brief year and a half duration, aggravated by a slow start and an abrupt finish due to forces outside its control, is not enough time to see concrete results.  Yet several positive outputs were obtained.  (2) Current policies, systems, and procedures, together with existing economic, social, and political factors, will result in continued deforestation and a fragmented forest production base.  The remaining forest cover will be composed of small forest islands incapable of supporting a forest industry.  Most local foresters predict this will have major negative economic and environmental effects.  Through project activities and accomplishments, the Ministry of Natural Resources received a clear message that it must concentrate its efforts on the remaining core area of standing productive forests, reconfigure its staff and material resources accordingly, and identify the additional resources needed to function effectively.  (3) The forest industry's general opinion is that much remains to be done.  Among other things, it is necessary to develop an adequate forestry incentives and to support effective control of deforestation with sustainable yield. (4) Education and training cause a change in mentality for the long term, but in the short term it is necessary to work harder on preventing illegal deforestation.  It is also important to start using approved forestry management plans and create a market mentality among both farmers and the forest industry.  (5) Integration of different sectors is vital for coordinatation of resource preservation and adequate management.  A multidisciplinary group composed of MINAE, the industry, universities, the media, loggers, sawyers, and equipment operators needs to be formed to exchange information, coordinate field work, and attain forest management that is both truly scientific and economic.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","6/1/1996 12:00:00 AM","","Natural resource management|Natural resource conservation|Forests|Deforestation|Forestry|Sustainable agriculture|Public awareness","Costa Rica","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABN147.pdf","172 KB","008533 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to provide access to U.S. food processing and marketing technology to small and medium-sized food processing companies, government officials, and USAIDs in targeted developing countries (SUSTAIN project).  The project is being implemented by the National Cooperative Business Association (NCBA).  Evaluation covers the period 10/91-3/96. With one exception, Project SUSTAIN has achieved the purpose and outputs set forth in the Cooperative Agreement to the complete satisfaction of the beneficiaries and USAID mission, having successfully provided many developing country small- and medium-scale food processing companies access to U.S. food industry experience and expertise on food processing, preservation, and marketing.  The exception is that the special emphases on at-risk women and children and on enrichment of local and weaning foods was not realized.  However, this was not a realistic expectation for a short-term volunteer TA program targeting mostly for-profit food companies. The technical focus has remained on quality control, food safety, waste handling, processing and preservation methods, packaging, and marketing.  But the mix of interventions has differed from that projected at the outset.  Because of their cost-effectiveness, workshops have received relatively greater attention than one-on-one TA consultations. SUSTAIN appears peripheral to USAID's current priority concerns. Though all missions in countries where SUSTAIN has worked have been very pleased with its performance, but are not prepared to finance its work, few, if any, missions have been willing to support bilateral SUSTAIN programs. SUSTAIN has performed a series of excellent short-term overseas missions in many countries, with a number of repeat, or follow-up, missions to some places.  But there is a strong desire, in Central America at least, for SUSTAIN to plan and carry out a long-term program focused on a few priority subjects to achieve some concrete, measurable food industry strengthening objectives.  SUSTAIN shares this desire.  In order to do so, SUSTAIN would require an assured, adequate source of long-term funds, a resident SUSTAIN representative in each country or region of emphasis, and reasonable assurance of the availability of appropriate volunteers as needed. SUSTAIN is at a critical juncture.  It has proven its value as a provider of effective short-term food technology expertise on behalf of USAID.  Now it has the opportunity to become an independent PVO with diversified funding sources, providing longer-term services intended to achieve sector-wide changes in selected countries.  This poses a question of whether it can do so while continuing to rely on volunteers and without an assured long-term commitment of funds. The following lessons were learned.  (1) Many highly skilled U.S. food industry professionals (and university professors) are willing and able to serve as volunteers for short-term missions.  (2) There is strong demand from developing country businesses for SUSTAIN services. (3) When all the pieces of a program -- suitable volunteers, programmatic training, a strong client, and reliable in-country USAID support -- come together, there can be real economic impact, as a result of SUSTAIN's services (e.g., organic coffee in El Salvador).  (4) There may be other technical fields aside from food and nutrition that could benefit from using SUSTAIN's volunteer approach.  (5) SUSTAIN has not obtained concrete information about how its services have been utilized, largely because it did not incorporate any procedure for doing so into the workshop and technical consultations planning and implementation process.  It would be feasible to do so.  (6) USAID has difficulty in recognizing that it has created a valuable and unique resource -- one that is prepared to graduate to independent status and that could be extremely useful to USAID in the future.  SUSTAIN has succeeded in establishing productive links between the United States and third world food industry sectors, to the benefit of each.  (7) USAID's funding, project, and contracting mechanisms have made it difficult for SUSTAIN to participate more fully in broader USAID programs that could benefit from its services. Competition for funds between missions and the Global Bureau, and between contractors, appears to limit USAID's utilization of SUSTAIN.","Project title: Health technical services (HTS)","Special Evaluation","Documents","HRN-5974-C-00-3001-00|HRN-C-00-93-00001-00","","5/1/1996 12:00:00 AM","","Food processing technology|Food marketing|Preserved foods|Technology transfer|Small scale enterprises|Medium scale enterprises|Business enterprises|Consultants|Volunteers|Technology assessment","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABN153.pdf","3,571 KB","003366 - TvT Associates|000981 - Pragma Corp.","","008291 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of a project (1985-8/96) to support four child survival (CS) programs in Egypt:  Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI-- expanded in 1991 to include hepatitis B), acute respiratory infections (ARIs), child spacing/maternal child health (CS/MCH), and nutrition (eliminated as a separate component in 1992). The project has been very successful and has contributed to reduced infant, child, and maternal mortality in Egypt.  The 1995 Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) showed an average 35% decline in infant mortality and 59% decline in child mortality over a 10-year period, concomitant with several CS successes -- increased immunization rates, use of oral rehydration therapy, and appropriate treatment of ARIs. The EPI component has been the most successful. Currently, 79% of health districts are polio-free, and only 71 reported confirmed cases were found in 1995 (down from 550 in 1988).  If current strategies, including National Immunization Days and Polio Mop-up campaigns are sustained and a sensitive surveillance system capable of detecting all acute flaccid paralysis cases continues to improve, Egypt should attain its zero confirmed cases of polio objective by 1997.  Vaccination coverage has been maintained at more than 80% since 1988; at least 83% of 231 health districts have achieved 80% coverage. The 1995 DHS Survey noted 79% fully immunized coverage (excluding hepatitis B3).  In addition, incidence of neonatal tetanus has declined by 89% since 1986; and 76% of districts have reported less than 1 case per 1,000 live births.  A highlight is the Government of Egypt s (GOE) assumption of total financial support for EPI (by contrast, in 1992 the GOE had zero funding for the imported EPI vaccines, which were provided mainly by UNICEF). A national ARI detection and treatment program based on standard case management has been established in all 27 governorates -- one of the first such programs in the world.  The project estimates access to standard case management to be 87%; to achieve this high level, the project skillfully handled all the complexities involved in planning, personnel development, equipment, supply line, information system, research, and information, education, and communication (IEC). The CS/MCH component conducted varied and often innovative activities and programs in association with different Ministry of Health and Population (MOHP) departments, with varying levels of success.  These included an important Maternal Mortality Study in 1992, the development of 100 neonatal care centers, daya (traditional birth attendant) training and linkage with MOHP health centers, and upgrading of delivery rooms and laboratories.  There was, however, relatively little of the desired collaboration between this component and the USAID-funded MOHP family planning program. The project is ending before the crosscutting programs can show final results.  The project has laid the framework for a national decentralized computerized health information system (HIS); supplied hardware, developed software, and provided some training; as yet, however, only a few governorates are using the new system (called DecHIS).  A training curriculum has been developed for decentralized health planning and management; 4 of 27 governorates have received such training so far.  A clinic improvement program (model clinics) has begun and the service standards developed for these 15 clinics are in use there, but not beyond.  Very recently, the mass media program developed a series of 12 TV spots on priority MCH topics that have aired in the last several months.  A revision of the curriculum for nurses has been completed, and that for physicians has been delayed by agreement between MOHP and USAID.  The Field Epidemiology Training program has begun supplying trained MOHP epidemiologists, conducted numerous studies related to public health problems in Egypt, and made significant progress in the institutionalization of the program. In the final 2 years, efforts focused on two areas in particular need of strengthening: training and mass media/health education. Materials produced in these areas are well done and will be very useful in the years to come. Project efforts to achieve sustainability through decentralization and integration are too recent to show results. Numerous recommendations for the successor Healthy Mother/Healthy Child Project are included.

"Evaluates program (comprising Project 5190394 and nine others) to support USAID's special strategic objective (SSO) of helping El Salvador make the transition from civil war to peace and national recovery.  The evaluation covers the period 5/92-3/96. USAID has been very successful in addressing this SSO and has achieved or exceeded most of its targets; it has supported virtually every facet of the Government of El Salvador's National Reconstruction Plan (NRP).  USAID assistance has been effectively managed, and a concurrent audit program conducted by Price Waterhouse has assured financial integrity. However, despite the Agency's substantial investment to repair infrastructure, finance land for ex-combatants and civilian refugees, provide vocational training and agricultural and microenterprise credit to civilians and ex-combatants, increase civic participation and build local democratic institutions, broaden the role of NGOs in delivering social services to rural communities, and address the special medical needs of the war-disabled, the economic potential of those most affected by the war remains tenuous.  The NRP region includes the least developed portion of El Salvador; even if the massive investment through the NRP met all of its objectives, it would take years to overcome the economic and social damage incurred during the war. Several factors facilitated the transition to peace: USAID/ES' experience in carrying out large projects in a variety of substantive areas; war-weariness on both sides of the conflict; the UN's monitoring of compliance with the Peace Accords; the well-organized structure of the guerrilla forces, which facilitated demobilization; the Municipalities In Action (MEA) program, which provided a mechanism for transferring resources to the local level and promoting citizen participation; competent local professionals and local NGOs with experience in the most affected zones; and the massive remittances to those back home from Salvadorans who had fled the country. After recapping the lessons learned during the first 3 years of Project 5190394 (see abstract of PN-ABT-659), the evaluation cites lessons from the last 2 years.  (1) Reconstruction efforts may sow the seeds for social and economic recovery, but should not be expected to accomplish development results.  (2)  It is not always prudent to treat the needs of demobilized ex-combatants within the context of the communities to which they return without providing special assistance. Re-establishing social services is key to reintegrating ex-combatants and those displaced by the war.  If resource transfers to the war-affected are needed, they should be made via grants rather than credit in order to maintain the integrity of the credit system.  (3) Indicators are needed for tracking the peace process as it moves through demobilization, reintegration, reconciliation, and the beginning of long-term development.  (4) It is important to clearly define: demobilization objectives and procedures, the meaning and scope of reintegration, the baseline data to be used, time frames for all activities, resource levels (human and fiscal), implementation channels, and criteria for success.  USAID's attempt to measure success via reductions in the differentials between the rates of relative poverty and extreme poverty in the NRP compared to the rest of the country was unrealistic; basic needs satisfaction is a better indicator. (5) Mechanisms for participation by all parties in design, execution, and monitoring of all phases of activities should be created as quickly as possible.  Citizens should be induced to participate through incentives that are positive and that preclude a dependency syndrome by inculcating citizen rights and responsibilities.  (6) Citizens should have a voice in infrastructure repair and replacement.  Priority infrastructure activities are those most critical for economic recovery, and those congruent with local development planning and having local support.  Nor should social and organizational infrastructure be neglected.  (7) If group titles are used for land transfers, the process for breaking them up should be clarified at the outset. (8) To ensure sustainability, program design should include the organizational development of local agencies, especially private organizations, that serve as implementors and customers.  U.S. PVOs should be required to strengthen their partner NGOs if the latter are expected to continue functioning.  (9) Since the number of female heads of household generally increases dramatically as a result of civil conflict, especially where there are female ex-combatants, special provisions should be made for women and children. (10) A clear, realistic definition of obligations to war-wounded and dependent survivors is needed, as this issue has a high potential for arousing public sympathy and disturbing the peace process.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","8/1/1996 12:00:00 AM","","War recovery|Civil war|Economic reconstruction|Social development|Economic infrastructure|National level|Local level|Peace|Post conflict societies|Societies in transition","El Salvador","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABN169.pdf","1,587 KB","003970 - Management Systems International, Inc.

"Evaluates the U.S. Department of Labor's (DOL) program to provide TA and training to support labor market transition in Eastern Europe, as mandated under the Support for Eastern European Democracy (SEED) Act of 1989.  The evaluation covers 15 DOL projects implemented in Poland, Hungary, and Bulgaria for the period 1992-96. Despite the difficult operating environment in Eastern Europe, DOL quickly fulfilled its SEED mandate by efforts in public employment services, labor statistics, vocational training, labor-management relations training, and the establishment of social insurance systems. Initial project designs were drawn from a menu of standard employment services programs available in the United States, and adapted to local conditions, where possible.  Many initial activities, especially in the employment services area, helped host governments develop a basis for mitigating high unemployment in the region. Once underway, most projects evolved logically despite a few false starts.  Of 15 activities in the three countries, 12 began in 1992 and were continuing in 1996; of these, 1 will terminate this year and 2 have not yet begun.  Of ongoing and long-term activities, 9 have accomplished most planned tasks and had beneficial effects, but the other three -- including the construction crafts training project in Poland, DOL's largest and longest running SEED project -- are of uncertain sustainability without DOL funding.  Of 12 long-term projects, 6 appeared to have a significant impact nationally, 2 are likely to have such impact, and 4 either have had or are destined to have moderate impact in limited geographic areas. Only a single component of a two-component project seems to have had only slight impact. Relationships between the DOL Bureau of International Labor Affairs and USAID appeared strained, mainly due to inadequate consultation, resulting in a lack of information about what, how, who, and for whom activities were to be implemented.  Nonetheless, despite inconsistent management, monitoring, oversight, and reporting by USAID/W and USAID missions, extensive field interviews suggest that most DOL activities have had significant and often nationwide effects. DOL relations with host governments appears excellent, with national authorities giving high marks for DOL assistance, and DOL is viewed by other donors as a useful partner able to apply SEED resources in a timely manner and in ways that facilitate the issuance of World Bank loans and effectively leverage U.S. funds. Country-specific findings are as follows.  (1) In Poland, the assignment of a highly qualified Polish-speaking field coordinator in Warsaw has had an excellent overall effect on DOL operations.  However, activities are at different stages of implementation; some have achieved most of their objectives and are subject to close-out, while others are just getting underway.  As already noted, the construction crafts training project has serious sustainability problems.  (2) In Hungary, activities have had significant nationwide effects.  Demonstrated models are being considered at the highest levels of government for inclusion in the national employment services package; decisions about government fiscal support appear to be possible within the next 2 years.  However, these models will not realize their potential impact until they are effectively linked with local economic development/job creation initiatives.  Problems include a lack of timely and accurate management information and a lack of DOL on-the-ground management for all programs. (3) In Bulgaria, The Employment Services/Dislocated Worker program has had significant effects and is being institutionalized at the national level.  Again, the utility of the model could be enhanced if effectively linked with local economic development initiatives.  The program targeting ethnic minorities has had mixed results.  Literacy training has not resulted in major gains, probably due to a lack of political will.  The Social Welfare-to-Employment program has been widely accepted and is likely to be applied even more widely.  Support requirements in the area of social insurance reform are varied, extensive, and long-term.  Coordination with other donors will prove critical. Private pension reform may become a priority for the mission. Lack of DOL management continuity for Bulgaria has resulted in confusion at the USAID mission as to the appropriate DOL contact.","Task order no. 0005","Special Evaluation","Documents","DHR-0037-C-00-5067-00","","9/1/1996 12:00:00 AM","","Labor market|Democratization|Labor management|Employment services|Technical training|Unemployment","Central and Eastern Europe|Bulgaria|Hungary|Poland","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABN172.pdf","225 KB","008485 - Basic Health Management International (BHM)","","009066 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of the Tunisian Municipal Development and Finance Program (MDFP -- 5/93-6/95) and the Local Government Support Program (LGSP -- 5/93-9/96), designed, respectively, to address problems in Tunisia's municipal financial system, and strengthen local government capacity to administer infrastructure programs in low-income neighborhoods. The two programs contributed to USAID/T's objective to increase the provision of urban environmental services to the poor on a sustainable basis.  They also contributed to urban development policy in Tunisia. Through support to the Ministry of the Interior and its various entities, training of supervisory staff and development of management tools for the local communes, and a number of studies that helped to define issues and suggest alternative approaches, the programs helped the GOT improve planning and monitoring of its municipal development programs. Municipalities are now better managed and trained, have a better understanding of the role of the private sector, and have better investment plans, though they continue to require substantial financial support and assistance.  The programs also demonstrated a number of innovations in training and participation which have the potential to significantly change municipal management and the provision of infrastructure services.  However, these gains are unlikely to be permanent in the absence of continuing attention by the GOT.  There are also infrastructure needs which are not being met, apparently due to municipalities' failure to adequately assess needs and to prepare project requests, or administrative restrictions on government subsidies. The 1992 reorganization of the Caisse des Prets et de Soutien des Collectivites Locales (CPSCL) as a government financial window for communes or local governments was a key step in establishing a more efficient and effective financing process, and was one of the primary outputs of the MDFP.  The Caisse has more than tripled its interest rates (to 6.5%) since 1992 and established a solid loan recovery record and become financially sound.  However, the Caisse depends on government subsidies and external donor support and is far from being sustainable. After a slow start, the LGSP developed the Municipal Training Center (CNPRCRM), which has trained government local and regional staff. However, the Center will need more assistance in order to maintain its momentum and become sustainable.  The LGSP was also decisive in encouraging community participation in municipal management and local decision making through its support of the GESCOME (Projet Gestion Communautaire de l'Environnement) initiative; the GESCOME approach may have resulted in considerable cost savings in providing municipal infrastructure.  However, as a pilot activity, GESCOME was implemented in only two municipalities (in Sousse and in Kasserine, where the provision of additional funds by the governor made it particularly successful) and will not have nationwide impact without further efforts by the GOT and other municipalities.  LGSP efforts involving the Federation Nationale des Villes Tunisienees (FNVT) were not successful. Likewise, the objective of promoting an increased role for NGOs in the municipal development process was not advanced.  This reflects the weak position of independent NGOs in Tunisia. The following lessons were learned.  (1) The methodology for implementing much of the program consisted of pilot efforts or studies followed by workshops and internal GOT reflections on the lessons and validity of these efforts.  This has successfully led to wider impacts. A key component of this approach was structured collaboration between the GOT and Regional Housing and Urban Development Office (RHUDO) at every step in the process.  (2) Collaboration with the World Bank was also of great importance in achieving program objectives, and provides a model that should be examined for replication in other countries.  (3) The assembly of resources by the RHUDO from various USAID programs and collaboration at the field level of three Global Bureau Centers and a regional bureau is another model worthy of being replicated.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","9/1/1996 12:00:00 AM","","Cities and towns|Public administration|Municipal level|Public finance|Financial management|Public works|Institution building","Tunisia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABN198.pdf","5,575 KB","","","004966 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to provide hands-on, face-to-face assistance to farmers and owners of small and medium-sized agribusinesses in the New Independent States (Farmer-to-Farmer [FTF] Program).  Evaluation focuses on the period 1994-95.  The project is being implemented by Agricultural Cooperative Development International (ACDI). The FTF program has experienced significant shifts in emphasis. Due to a host of external factors (i.e., the elimination of directed credits, a high rate of inflation, a disorganized privatization process, and strong cultural determinants), ACDI was forced to refocus its efforts on agricultural and commercial bank management, assistance to agribusinesses and training institutions, and informal credit mechanisms.  Land tenure activities were discontinued because the World Bank and other USAID initiatives had begun working in this area and because decisions on land tenure bogged down politically.  The early focus on agricultural banks was modified because many of these banks became insolvent.  More recently, ACDI has begun focusing on informal mechanisms and credit cooperatives as mechanisms to deliver rural finance. The programming of volunteers has been modified to emphasize repeat visits to targeted institutions and to have a geographic concentration where feasible.  In 1994, after considerable negotiation, the project was expanded to Kazakhstan and the Kyrgyz Republic with the caveat that it must be coordinated with the USAID program supporting financial sector reform.  Also, ACDI recently inherited Tri Valley Growers' Farmer-to-Farmer Program in the Republic of Georgia.  Targets of opportunity in Ukraine, Moldova, and Uzbekistan have also been addressed. Overall, the FTF program is well-managed and reaching its targets. FTF has:  revised teaching methods and curriculum of the Russian Central Bank system; improved the creditworthiness of the Moldova-Agroindbank, which will receive a $20 million loan from the EBRD; increased the viability of ASSOY, which has attracted significant additional investment with ACDI-inspired business plans; and established a new personnel system in the Turan Bank.  Of equal importance are the program's non-quantifiable impacts, such as the acceptance of new accounting methods by commercial banks, the knowledge gained by numerous budding agribusinesses of how to write business plans, and, perhaps most importantly, the fact that many Russian and Central Asian farmers and businessmen now speak the language of the economy and are working with concepts of which they were totally unaware only a few years ago. Transactions such as collateralizing securities, risk rating systems, forward trading of grain and loan guaranties have become part of the business environment as a result of the FTF program. The evolved program appears to be making a difference (ACDI seems to have responded positively to recommendations made in the mid-term evaluation) and ACDI is managing its limited resources extremely well. Because there is not much lead time between recruitment and dispatch of volunteers and because volunteers have only a short time before they return to their full-time jobs, effectiveness can be reduced.  However, there are many occasions where the short-term assistance is having an impact equal to that provided by long-term advisors and at less cost. While it is too early to judge the effectiveness of the Central Asian programs, they seem responsive to the requirement that they be fully integrated with the overall USAID program.  The program has had important positive people-to-people impacts, as demonstrated in the comments of volunteers and the local counterparts.  The establishment of informal consultative relations between former volunteers and their hosts in a number of cases illustrates this.  While no actual exports of U.S. goods or technologies have occurred as a result of the program, several such transactions are imminent, including the possible purchase of 300,000 MT of U.S. soybeans and other U.S. agricultural commodities.

"Evaluates the impact of the Farmer to Farmer (FtF) program in the New Independent States (NIS).  FtF began as a pilot program in 1986 and was later expanded to include 6 (now 5) PVOs implementing the program in 12 NIS countries.

In the United States, FtF is raising awareness of programs like FtF, correcting misconceptions about NIS countries, and helping to inform U.S. businesses that sponsor FtF volunteers about opportunities in the NIS.  In the NIS, FtF is facilitating the transition to a free market economy and helping to develop indigenous institutional capacity and new market-oriented private entrepreneurs and agribusiness enterprises.  Volunteers and FtF staff provide their NIS hosts with credible role models, valuable technical expertise, training in running a business, and assistance in creating institutions such as farmer associations that will provide technical and business services to farmers and new entrepreneurs.  In almost every project observed during the evaluation, the inclusion of reverse farmer-to-farmer training in the United States was crucial to giving the NIS host the confidence to go ahead and implement the U.S. volunteer's recommendations. There are significant results and impact occurring at all levels and areas of agriculture.  The trend has been to move away from production level activities and encourage implementors to focus more on postharvest enterprises.  While there definitely needs to be more focus within some of the programs, and less of a demand-driven approach, it would be a mistake to second-guess field implementors. There is no consistent USAID policy concerning the management, monitoring, and development worth of the FtF Program. Some PVOs question whether USAID Missions are really interested in FtF.  USAID/W may be missing an opportunity to give the Program more recognition as an example of grass roots development that is building widespread support and good will for the U.S. in the former Soviet Union. All implementors seem to have good, effective implementation systems and approaches to the recruitment and delivery of TA through their volunteers, but there is a general feeling that there are too many implementors operating in some of the larger countries.  A geographical division of labor among implementors in the larger countries, e.g., Russia and Ukraine, is likely to yield managerial, efficiency, and cost-saving benefits. Explicit linkages of FtF activities to USAID programs and strategic objectives have varied.  All could benefit from an increase in such linkages.  Missions would gain access to an excellent and highly valuable source of TA at minimal or no cost, FtF volunteers would be associated with major impact activities, and USAID would gain access to the extensive grassroots information base and contacts possessed by most implementors. In sum, the FtF program touches individuals and segments of societies at levels and in ways few U.S. programs can do; it is building good will for the United States; it is helping to build a U. S. public awareness of the problems of these countries and the role of U.S. assistance; and it does contribute to development objectives in numerous small ways. While it can and probably should be more closely aligned with USAID program objectives, there is a limit as to how far that process should be carried without distorting the rather unique character of this program and its raison d'etre as a people-to-people technical exchange program at the grassroots level.  Annexes include case studies based on evaluators' interview with NIS host farmers.","Delivery order no. 17","Special Evaluation","Documents","LAG-4200-I-00-3059-00","","7/1/1996 12:00:00 AM","","Farmers|Technology transfer|Farmer training|Volunteers|Grassroots development|Interpersonal communication|Market economy","New Independent States|USA","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABN206.pdf","11,426 KB","006900 - Agricultural Development Consultants, Inc.","","007746 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of a project (5/91-9/96) to promote private enterprise development in Botswana (BPED project).  The project was implemented by the Botswana Confederation of Commerce, Industry, and Manpower (BOCCIM), the Botswana Development Corporation (BDC), and the Ministry of Commerce and Industry (MCI). The project has had a positive effect on all three implementing agencies.  It has profoundly affected BOCCIM, making it a credible policy analysis organization.  Its impact on MCI has been positive in terms of skills training and development of a database for policy development, although its effect on the Ministry's Department of Industrial Affairs (DIA) is uncertain due to frequent DIA staff changes. As for BDC, its relatively continuous involvement in the project has enabled it to achieve significant improvement of skills.  Because BDC is larger than either BOCCIM or MCI, project advisors have been able to transfer their expertise to many BDC staff, not just to official counterparts. Policy development activities have included issue-based meetings, which allowed participants to identify policy issues and develop activities to address them; these meetings initially focused on the three implementing organizations but were expanded as the project progressed.  The development of this process of collaborative policy discussion is a significant achievement.  Other successful policy development approaches included (1) use of funding to catalyze activities that were subsequently assumed by the three implementing organizations or other entities; (2) BOCCIM's active involvement of its members in planning and implementing activities or policy positions. The two weaknesses of the project's approach -- failure to pursue the participation of legislative draftspersons in financial sector development working groups and BOCCIM's failure to gauge adequately the resources needed to conduct activities -- were minor in comparison. However, while many project activities became the basis for policy dialogue between the Government of Botswana (GOB) and the private sector, this dialogue has seldom led to policy reform.  Several important policy proposals await decisions, but the only reforms actually implemented are tax reduction, some liberalization of interest rates, and the first round of foreign exchange liberalization.  These are substantial improvements over previous policies, but they are partial reforms that leave much to be accomplished. In sum, Botswana is moving steadily toward an enabling environment for private sector development, due in no small part to BOCCIM's work in improving communication and understanding between the public and private sectors.  The crucial question with respect to sustainability is whether BOCCIM will continue to be able to do its own research and analysis. BOCCIM has implemented most of the structural changes recommended in a 1994 organizational strategy review and should be close to breaking even financially by the time project funding ceases. The following lessons were learned.  (1) A clear transition plan should be developed early on, including sequenced declines in USAID budgetary support.  (2) Advisors should be expected to assume both ""line"" and purely advisory functions, with the balance between these functions dependent on the host-country organization, counterparts, and advisors.  (3) Project advisors and managers must exercise diplomacy, especially in working with counterparts to promote ownership.  (4) The project succeeded not only because USAID financed studies, but also because the GOB and the private sector learned to cooperate and to differ amicably about how policies should change.  (5) USAID should try to ensure that both government and the private sector recognize the importance of continuing policy research, analysis, and dialogue after the project ends.  (6) The entity responsible for drafting implementing legislation and regulations related to a policy (e.g. the Attorney General's Chambers in Botswana) must be included in all stages of policy development in order to facilitate implementation of policy agreements reached by government and the private sector.  (7) USAID funding of an institution's activities may create high expectations among the organization's members, and may cause dissatisfaction or confusion if such activities cease after USAID funding ends.  (8) USAID's plans regarding assistance to an organization must be made with a clear understanding of the leadership's and staff's goals for the organization.  (9) Efforts should be made throughout the project to promote ownership of activities so that they continue (even in modified form) after USAID funding ends.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","PCE-0026-Q-00-3031-00","","9/1/1996 12:00:00 AM","","Private enterprises|Private sector|Economic policy|Policy reform|Policy analysis|Policy dialogue|Government departments|Institution building|Business associations","Botswana","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABN209.pdf","7,764 KB","007294 - Coopers and Lybrand","","001940 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (1982-6/95) to help the Government of Egypt (GOE) to rehabilitate and modernize the Aswan High Dam Hydroelectric Station at Aswan. All planned outputs were achieved.  The power station, replacement circuit breakers, and relaying protection are operating normally; some of the equipment and the rehabilitation work performed are still under warranty.  Leakage rates for the rehabilitated gates on average are less than 5% of the maximum allowable tolerance, which means more water to generate power and less down time for maintenance.  The formal and informal training provided by project contractors greatly enhanced the capabilities of High Dam Power Station staff.  A computer-based maintenance scheduling program introduced by the Egyptian Electrical Authority (EEA) subsequent to the PACD should complement this training. General lessons learned are as follows.  (1) Whenever possible, project contractors and subcontractors should use personnel of the GOE implementing agency in rehabilitation or modernization projects at existing facilities.  Use of this procedure in this project gave the contractor ready access to an onsite pool of skilled workers, and enhanced their operation & maintenance (O&M) skills.  (2) In rehabilitation work on older power stations, unforeseen conditions are often encountered which require additional work to be performed or justify canceling work found to be unnecessary.  USAID showed the necessary flexibility when problems were discovered in the hydraulic gates, 15KV circuit breakers, and other systems which required additional funding.  Conversely, original components of the project were deleted when it was found that spare parts could be acquired, thus eliminating replacement of the 132KV circuit breakers.  In the FruCon contract, it was discovered that the 150-ton gantry crane main drive reducer had damage due to a faulty design, and that the intake gate lifting mechanism wire rope had been previously damaged; in both cases, the equipment or parts were replaced.  Additionally, since removal of rock and concrete in order to place the temporary sealing bulkhead was not permitted by the Ministry of Irrigation, which is responsible for the dam structure, the contractor was required to initiate a design change which allowed the work to continue. Specific lessons are as follows.  (1) Replacement of the first 6 units occurred during a drought that had resulted in inordinately low water levels in Lake Nasser, which in turn threatened safe operation of the new runners.  At the request of the EEA, additional tests and studies were conducted which have provided the EEA with operating procedures that will extend the range of operation under the most adverse head conditions.  (2) The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation (BUREC) has revised many of its testing and inspection procedures based on what was learned in this project, which required exhaustive and rigorous testing of the welding.  The comprehensive testing program has been the subject of several technical papers presented at technical association meetings. (3) To ensure that the concrete used to rehabilitate the draft tubes has a compressive strength of 9,800 pounds per square inch, the project: used modern additive materials in mixing the concrete and high-quality assurance procedures throughout the entire batching, placement, and curing of the concrete; imported the cement from the United States (the local cement did not reach the compressive strength requirements), and developed techniques to use liquid nitrogen to cool the aggregate rock in the batching operation.  (4) A sophisticated and technically advanced bulkhead device (a sealing barrier) was designed by BUREC for this project which allowed a dry working environment.  The use of this large bulkhead (approximately 11 meters by 28 meters) developed for the High Dam will reshape industry practices for similar projects in the future.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","9/1/1996 12:00:00 AM","","Electric power plants|Hydroelectric power|Dams|Electrical equipment|Construction engineering|Technological innovations","Egypt","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABN222.pdf","871 KB","008539 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (10/91-12/95) to promote access to financial services by small- and medium-scale savers and borrowers in Costa Rica. The project was implemented by Banco Central, Fedecredito (BCF), Ohio State University (OSU), and Academia de Centroamerica (AC). Project accomplishments included the following.  Under the policy analysis and reform component, OSU supported policy debate leading to the replacement of the crawling-peg foreign exchange regime by a freely floating exchange rate, and the liberalization of the capital account of the balance of payments -- one of the most important policy reforms in Costa Rica in recent years.  AC supported the passage in 1995 of the new Central Bank legislation, which will strengthen the Bank's autonomy and capacity for exercising prudential supervision, as well as efforts of the Special Commission for Financial Reform to draft legislation to eliminate discriminatory regulations and to alter the rules governing state-owned banks, foreign banks, credit unions, and other financial entities.  AC also supported several policy studies and sponsored a training program for Central Bank staff and a feasibility study for establishing an Integrated System of Financial Services for a national payment system, expected to be implemented in 10/96. Under the prudential supervision component, OSU and ASU supported the creation of a new regulatory body, transforming the General Auditor of Financial Entities (AGEF) into the General Superintendent of Financial Institutions (SUGEF) and extending its responsibilities and jurisdiction to all financial intermediaries.  BCF supported the passage in 4/94 of the Supervision of Savings and Loan Cooperatives reform law for new credit union legislation and created an internal organizational unit, AUDICOOP, to provide auditing and prudential supervision services to member cooperatives, which rate its services highly. Under the financial management and innovation component, OSU provided diagnostic studies and TA to the Asociacion Constarricense de Desarrollo (ACORDE), a second-level organization for NGOs, and the Fundacion Integral Campesina (FINCA), which has a network of 180 community banks and is a major supplier of financial services to rural microenterprises, as well as to Avance Microempresarial, an urban NGO with a large credit portfolio.  Also, OSU helped the Government of Costa Rica design and implement an institutional mechanism for disbursing a large IDB loan for microenterprise credit, and designed Certificados de Aportacion Patrimonial, which is now implemented in 20 FINCA community banks.  AC provided training and TA to community banks and evaluated the capacity of the Juntas Rurales (small farmer directive boards on the National Bank rural branches) to analyze an innovative service in credit.  BCF designed a Directed Integrated Technical Assistance Model to improve its efficiency in serving cooperatives and implemented a Program for Total Restructuring (RETO) enabling 22 cooperatives to participate in the Zurqui Initiative, which enhances cooperatives' competitive capacity by providing integrated financial products such as credit and debit cards, nationwide linkages among cooperatives, aggressive marketing, and a public image of financial soundness. BCF also complemented RETO with a Structural Strengthening Fund to help cooperatives resolve their institutional and bad debt reserve deficiencies.  Systems and control software for cooperatives' liquid assets were created, enabling a nationwide check on the credits and debits of the services rendered in the inter-cooperative interchange of products.  Finally, BCF-financed information technicians adapted and implemented Banca 2000, a financial management software for cooperatives. The following lessons were learned.  (1) Due to a 5/94 change in administration, the Central Bank Law drafted in the later part of 1993 was not approved until 11/96.  Projects with strong political aspects should be programmed to begin and end within the same administration whenever possible to avoid rehashing issues and loss of time.  (2) The project's first few years were used to create consciousness about the need for reform and to guide the legislators in drafting that reform. However, the procedure became more directed when, on a practical level, AC hired consultants to draft the reform laws for discussion by the Special Commission members.  Having a written draft legislation to work with made a big difference in producing a product within a restricted time period.  (3) The project's overhead committee was never functional. It is unrealistic to expect a high-ranking official such as the Central Bank President to provide project leadership and continuity, especially in projects such as this, which dealt with specific institutions on a micro-level.  (4) In countries with highly developed democratic institutions and traditions such as Costa Rica, the pace of change can be excruciatingly slow to create the conditions where a genuine consensus can be achieved.  Projects with such goals should be aware of the time restraints for project implementation.  (5) Between the Project Paper and Grant Agreement, the project's prudential regulation and financial innovation components, originally conceived as highly conceptual and sector-wide in scope, became narrowly redefined towards providing TA to particular financial sector institutions.  This narrowing of scope made project coordination more difficult, as implementors tried to coordinate two dissimilar project segments.  (6) Microenterprise efforts were not very extensive, possibly because AC was overwhelmed by the financial reform and supervision assistance components.  A direct grant with another PVO would have been more effective.  (7) Project objectives were very global, making it difficult to monitor implementation and measure achievement.  (8) Delay in submitting audit reports is a common problem, especially if project agreements coincide with the end of the country's fiscal year. Requiring semiannual audits in the Agreement would obviate this problem.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1996 12:00:00 AM","","Financial institutions|Commercial credit|Economic policy|Fiscal policy|Policy reform|Policy analysis|Financial management|Banks|Institution building|Laws and legislation","Costa Rica","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABN293.pdf","1,118 KB","008533 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of a 3/94 grant to Africare to strengthen indigenous NGOs in Benin (BINGOS project). The evaluation, made in 9/96, was held in anticipation of the 2/97 PACD. Of the 33 NGOs accepted into project, 23 remain.  By the closure date, the project will have met or exceeded targets for the training and institutional support components.  On the down side, beyond sponsoring some exchanges among participating NGOs, BINGOS has not been effective in promoting associations of NGOs or working with federations; the strategy for reaching these complex goals was ill-defined in the project proposal. Additionally, the umbrella grant, the method for promoting NGO linkages, was expensive and lacking in flexibility.  If there is a second phase of the project, it should make NGO collaboration an important, if not main component and collaborate with other donors in its implementation. Participant NGOs have found the training in project design, management, and funding procedures to be effective.  All NGOs are taking steps to implement the principles and procedures taught, although they are resistant to the recommendation to separate roles, in particular those of their board of directors and executive council.  As the project comes to its close, training should be added that will help NGOs survive financially after the project's conclusion. The role of the BINGOS Council NGOs should be expanded.  While strictly advisory in nature, the Council offers NGOs a vehicle for participating, through their elected representatives, in some project decisions. The Council can make useful contributions in planning end-of-project and/or follow-on activities and in informing member NGOs of these.  The Council could also be developed as the governing board of an association of BINGOS participant NGOs.  For this purpose, the procedures for electing Council members should be reviewed to ensure that all NGOs, including those outside Cotonou, are represented. BINGOS' efforts to promote governance and democratization have included strengthening NGOs as a class of social actors, extending the umbrella grant to the Joint Center, and supporting an ad hoc network of NGOs advocating a free and fair election.  Little has been done, however, to link governance and democratization interventions to the rest of the project. The project could strengthen these links in two ways.  To make the NGOs more participatory and democratic internally, BINGOS should study the decision processes of general assemblies more closely and use the Joint Center NGOs to train others in methods of internal democracy. The project could also take more direct action to sponsor collaboration between NGOs and government agents at the prefecture and subprefecture level. Lessons learned are as follows.  (1) Two years is a very short time for a project of this kind to make a demonstrable impact.  Project design was optimistic and ambitious, especially considering the inevitable learning curve.  Future projects of this sort should be designed over a 5 or 6 year schedule to allow full implementation of the program and enough time to wean NGOs from project assistance.  In particular, although project design linked institution building to democratization efforts, the project in fact has focused on institution building and democratization for a later stage.  Future projects should consider this a realistic sequence and build it into their design.  (2) Although Africare's management of the project has generally been good and its staff quick to learn, the project has stretched Africare's resources.  A future project of this kind should significantly limit the number of participating NGOs or plan for a larger staff.  (3) Any future project of this kind should have a clear strategy for graduating participants from the program and for preparing them for project closeout.  (4) The initial selection of NGOs was too inclusive. Stricter and better-defined criteria are needed.  Even at this stage, the project could choose to work only with the NGOs that are the most committed to internal democracy, participation, and advocacy.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","9/1/1996 12:00:00 AM","","Indigenous private voluntary organizations|Institution building|Management training|Technical training|Governance","Benin","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABN294.pdf","1,739 KB","000235 - Africare, Inc.","","008514 - USAID.

"Evaluates the activities of the HIV/sexually transmitted disease (STD) program of the Health Sector II project (5220216).  Evaluation covers the period 8/94-9/96, focusing almost exclusively on the activities of the AIDS Control and Prevention project (AIDSCAP) (9365972). It is estimated that 1996 will see the largest number of AIDS cases ever reported in Honduras. Levels of HIV infection remain high, but do not represent an explosive increase from previous years.  The Ministry of Health (MOH) continues to report declining levels of syphilis and gonorrhea. The following progress has been made in STD treatment.  (1) With AIDSCAP support, country norms and guidelines for syndromic STD management have been developed.  (2) During this evaluation, 32 health workers from the health regions in the four project areas were trained. (3) The MOH has planned for a supply of the necessary drugs through a World Bank project, but these drugs are not yet available in the clinics. (4) AIDSCAP has initiated a study to determine antibiotic susceptibilities of STD pathogens in Honduras, but specimen collection has been slower than expected, and no results are yet available. Syndromic management will be piloted in the four STD Integrated Management Units (UMIETS), which will then serve as training resources in area health centers. The STD/AIDS Division was established in 1994, combining the MOH's STD Control and Prevention Program and the National AIDS Control Program, which was founded in 1992.  The Division has a broad mandate and shrinking staff.  Among its responsibilities are support to the Health Regions, developing and promulgating norms for STD treatment, surveillance, condom logistics, and health education.  However, surveillance is not currently being performed, and although norms have been developed for the syndromic therapy treatments regimen and the first tranche of MOH personnel has been trained with AIDSCAP support, continued high levels of support from AIDSCAP will be required.  In addition, the Medium Term Plan which served as a blueprint for the program is ending.  MOH efforts have focused on awareness messages directed at the general population, but they are ambiguous in intent and unlikely to effect behavior change.  AIDSCAP has been assisting the project to adopt a behavior change communication perspective and should continue to do so. The first year of the project has been very successful.  NGOs have been identified and trained, and financial and administrative reporting is in place guaranteeing the appropriate use of project funds.  STD norms, treatment guidelines, and training materials have been developed with the MOH; training is underway; and efforts in quantitative and qualitative research will produce data to develop communication interventions by the NGOs.  Developing, funding, and monitoring of the 10 subagreements with the implementing agencies is an enormous achievement.  USAID, through support to AIDSCAP, is one of the only donors in-country that actually closely monitors each subproject. AIDSCAP has maintained excellent working relationships with the MOH, USAID, and other donors.  The MOH and other donors perceive AIDSCAP to be an essential element in their response to the epidemic. The NGOs report having been strengthened by AIDSCAP and are overwhelmingly supportive of its efforts. All NGO subprojects should be continued for at least the next year.  The NGOs selected have different strengths; one may have strong relations with the target populations and another a strong health education staff.   But all NGOs have been involved in all intervention areas, such as development of health educational materials for different target groups.  AIDSCAP should be permitted to build on strengths and selectively develop the NGOs. NGOs have requested closer supervision from AIDSCAP, recommending that a satellite AIDSCAP office be created on the North Coast of Honduras. This is a good suggestion and thought should be given to either moving staff to the North Coast or recruiting an additional staff person to provide support to projects in San Pedro Sula and La Ceiba.","Project title: Health technical services (HTS)","Special Evaluation","Documents","HRN-5974-Q-00-3002-00","","9/1/1996 12:00:00 AM","","Public health care|Sexually transmitted diseases|Disease prevention and control|HIV/AIDS|Epidemiology|Case management","Honduras","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABN295.pdf","1,771 KB","003366 - TvT Associates|000981 - Pragma Corp.","","008555 - USAID.

"Final external evaluation of the Women Child Impact (WCI) Program, a project to increase Save the Children's (SC) impact on women's and children's health in four core countries -- Bangladesh, Bolivia, Haiti, and Mali -- and in another 30 non-core countries.  Evaluation covered the period 9/91-12/95 vs. a 12/96 PACD. Efforts to strengthen program planning, evaluation, and technical support in SC/Westport has been impressive.  Women's literacy, children's basic education, and women's micro-credit activities have been strengthened or created in all core countries.  The Group Guaranteed Lending and Savings (GGLS) groups, introduced and supported in Mali, Bolivia, and Haiti through WCI, have been immensely successful, and have expanded rapidly in number, particularly in the last year. The use of WCI funds to strengthen program planning and develop staff skills, as well as to provide TA to both core and non-core countries, has been impressive.  No fewer than 164 technical events have been funded by WCI home office monies since 10/91.  The WCI regional resource-sharing funds have also been employed to conduct program planning, training, baseline and evaluation surveys, cross-country program exchange, conduct workshops on gender and empowerment issues, and provide TA.  Some 68 regional resource-sharing funding activities have been carried out to date in 29 countries. All WCI core countries have successfully developed clusters of integrated sectoral interventions. This has been done by adding sectoral interventions to the basic maternal/child health activities already underway.  In most cases, the women's health groups served as a base for literacy, empowerment, and credit activities.  The planned innovative basic education programs have been initiated in Mali, Haiti, and Bolivia, most successfully in the village schools in Mali. On the down side, the development of an agency-wide management and organizational development system and training programs, including the design and implementation of training cycles for local staff in core countries, has not proceeded as rapidly as expected. Also, in the absence of more frequent visits to core countries by the WCI training coordinator, training cycles have not been developed for staff, although numerous cycles are employed in the sectoral programs for male and female program participants.  Training of staff in core country programs has been ad hoc.  However, the eight regional training teams established at the 5/95 Family and Community Empowerment Training Systems (FACETS) workshop have now begun to implement their training plans.  Originally trained in gender analysis, these teams will eventually conduct training in all SC guiding principles and in key technical skills for field office staff. Objective measurement of program impact has been problematic in all core countries, in spite of visits to each country by the home-based WCI evaluation specialist.  Measuring the impact on women and children of SC's programs is complicated by the need to define impact indicators. Further, despite awareness of the need to measure an integrated cluster of sectoral impacts, the lack of an integrated data base and a statistical package to manipulate such data continues to be a failing in all core country programs.  In addition, documentation in the field appears insufficiently developed, although Bangladesh has made greater strides than the other core countries.  The WCI Unit in Westport has produced an important set of monographs and working and occasional papers, but much more could be drawn from the collective experience. Efforts to establish partnerships with local institutions, while pursued in all countries, have made only modest progress, except in Bangladesh and to some degree in Mali.  In particular, the methodology of developing local partners' institutional capacity to take over many of SC's functions as SC ""phases over"" to new zones is not yet sufficiently developed. Gender sensitization has been successfully pursued by the WCI staff, especially in the last year since the arrival of the new WCI Unit director.  Each core country office has also actively pursued activities in women's empowerment -- a concept that remains unmeasured thus far and that is probably still unclear to many in SC.  The planned establishment of new regional management and TA mechanisms has not made much progress.

"Evaluates project to stimulate the expansion of private agro-based enterprises in Sri Lanka (AgEnt project). Mid-term evaluation covers the period 5/92-8/96. AgEnt has made good progress, and by its completion date of 9/98 it is projected to achieve $32 million in investment (vs. a targeted $20 million) and directly or indirectly generate 21,365 new jobs (vs. a targeted 13,000).  It is important to note that these accomplishments will be made without a significant component originally envisaged for the project: the $6 million World Bank Agro-Enterprise Investment Fund. The project has devoted considerable resources to developing new varieties and crops in hope that some will prove profitable and provide new opportunities for Sri Lankan farmers. It is too early to tell whether this has happened.  Nonetheless, interviews with 30 AgEnt customers show that most greatly appreciate AgEnt's assistance. AgEnt has obtained its best cost/benefit results in terms of additional investment and sales in poultry, processed foods, piggery, spices and essential oils, aquaculture, and floriculture.  In terms of job creation, the most dynamic sectors include piggeries, processed foods, spices and essential oils, vanilla, floriculture, and maize. AgEnt should consider placing higher priority on sectors with low cost-to-benefit ratios.  Some sectors, such as poultry and ornamental fish, will probably continue to experience high growth without AgEnt assistance.  In these sectors and when working with large clients, AgEnt should emphasize impacts on employment or on leadership needed to spread an activity. Policy, production, and marketing constraints will continue to adversely affect agribusiness unless they are addressed.  AgEnt has been making good progress in the latter two areas, but needs to do more in the area of policy. The evaluation notes that service delivery can be improved through a radical reorganization of AgEnt, and includes recommendations for accomplishing this. AgEnt's sustainability plan envisages the formation of an Agricultural Development Trust comprised of a Services Unit and a Production Holding Company for investment.  The Services Unit would generate some income from fees and commissions, but without donor funding would face an uphill battle in achieving sustainability.  The Production Holding Company, in which AgEnt plays a more active management role and takes equity positions, shows more promise of eventually generating enough revenue to cover costs. The following lessons were learned.  (1) Although traditionally risk-averse, Sri Lankan farmers respond well to growing a product which is profitable and has a stable market. Prominent examples of success include the outgrowers for the poultry and ornamental fish industries. (2) In sectors which depend upon the Government of Sri Lanka (GSL) for protection from competition, there is always the chance that the GSL will change policy abruptly. (3) AgEnt needs to explore opportunities for value-added processing.  In some instances, such as gherkins, the fresh product is not competitive on the international market, but could become so after local processing.  (4) Quality is a necessary but not sufficient condition for developing a successful product.  Packaging and labeling are just as important.  This is clearly demonstrated in AgEnt's good work with a small spice producer.  (5) Project design should not assume that another donor will contribute the resources necessary to achieve project goals.  For example, the $6 million World Bank Agro-Enterprise Investment Fund failed to materialize. Similarly, it would be a mistake to assume that another donor will provide an endowment to help institutionalize AgEnt beyond the year 2000.","Contract number is listed incorrectly on the cover as|353-01110A-00-3003-00","Special Evaluation","Documents","383-0111-A-00-3003-00","","8/1/1996 12:00:00 AM","","Agribusiness|Agricultural enterprises|Agricultural product marketing|Agricultural production","Sri Lanka","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABN316.pdf","4,125 KB","008096 - Fintrac, Inc.","","008606 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of a project (1994-96) to promote African women's participation in development through (1) pilot projects in Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania integrating women's traditional knowledge with modern technologies, and (2) an ethnological case study of the factors behind women's successful inclusion in community development efforts. The project was administered by Coordination Development, Inc. (CODEL) until 1995 when the Lutheran World Relief (LW) assumed the contract because of CODEL's financial difficulties.  Five CODEL partner agencies implemented the project. Results of the pilot projects, which did not begin until 1994, were as follows.  In Kenya, the Kenyan Institute for Organic Farming (KIOF) trained 38 women farmers in Muranga and Machakos Districts in various organic farming techniques, resulting in increased agricultural outputs. While a few beneficiaries supplemented their existing organic farming skills, the majority learned new skills for linking their own knowledge with organic agriculture. In Uganda, The Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA) trained over 30 women in afforestation and use of the fuel efficient cook stoves and charcoal briquettes made from agro-wastes.  In Nakawa and Makindye divisions in Kampal District, women learned to use the stoves in their home and increased income by selling stoves and charcoal briquettes in their communities.  The stoves helped reduce their cooking time (by allowing users to cook more than two dishes at a time) and to conserve energy and heat.  The Bannakaroli Brothers provided children orphaned by AIDS and living on a banana plantation in Kyotera, as well as their 45-50 female-headed guardian families, with skills in traditional and modern methods for producing bananas, the staple crop in Uganda. In the Hai District of Arusha/Northern Tanzania, TechnoServe taught approximately 40 women farmers how to produce and use indigenous vegetables for seed production, sale, and home consumption.  Seed production has filled a market demand.  Some of the women farmers have plans to sell millet for brewing and to grow and sell maize. For the ethnological case study, the Maryknoll Sisters in Iringa, Tanzania established the Women Trust and Development Association (WTDA), an umbrella association of three women's groups to create a revolving credit fund to improve local women's social and economic situation.  To date, the fund has provided over 200 women from varied backgrounds with credit for home-based or small-scale enterprise activities. The following lessons were learned.  (1) The pilot projects demonstrated that income generation directly bears on improved health and education for children, by providing extra income for basic needs; and also enhances women's status in their families and communities.  (2) The NGOs, which were involved in project identification and design, have indicated their commitment to contribute to the project beyond its conclusion in 1996.  A few have already integrated the program within their ongoing activities.  (3) The pilot projects mobilized women to tap their existing skills and motivated them to improve their lives. However, if these projects are to be expanded, objectives and evaluation criteria will need to be established to build on the lessons learned. (4) For women to carry out productive work and take care of their families, investments should be made in literacy, health care, family planning, and nutrition.  In the future, links should be made between women's welfare and their productivity and economic development during project design.  (5) The transition of the contract from CODE to LW in 1995 was a rushed process during which some management files were left incomplete or were lost, affecting the evaluation process. Moreover, CODEL's philosophy of monitoring has always been to leave primary monitoring to the local implementing agencies.  LW continued this reporting system when it assumed the contract. While in many cases the system worked well, a systemic feed back mechanism should have been established to measure each project's impact, and results should have been properly documented.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","FAO-0158-A-00-3050-00","","5/1/1996 12:00:00 AM","","Women in development|Community development|Traditional farming|Agricultural technology|Technology adoption|Pilot projects|Environmental protection|Private voluntary organizations|Indigenous private voluntary organizations|Anthropology research","Kenya|Uganda|Tanzania","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABN344.pdf","2,916 KB","006190 - AMA Technologies, Inc.","","007746 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of a project to implement reconstruction and redevelopment projects in the area East of Sidon and in Beirut, Lebanon. The project was implemented by Mercy Corps International (MCI), in conjunction with the Middle East Council for Churches (MECC) and the Institute for Women's Studies in the Arab World (IWSAW).  The evaluation covers the period from 8/26/93 to 7/31/96, 1 month before the PACD. The project was a success, and targets were exceeded in all components.  MECC awarded contracts to local construction companies which by the PACD will have repaired and rehabilitated 1,684 houses East of Sidon and in Aley and Souk el-Gharb, vs. a target of 1,230.  These have enabled villagers to return home, although more assistance will be needed to create the basic conditions (such as employment, health care, schools, and community facilities) that will allow returnees to remain. The government has done less than what was expected to meet these needs. IWSAW developed an income-generation training program, supplemented by a Basic Living Skills program (BLSP), which has had a remarkable effect on trainees.  A total of 404 women (vs. a target of 400) participated and gained confidence, decisiveness, and more positive attitudes about their futures; they are also teaching their neighbors and relatives what they have learned in BLSP.  The vast majority have gained employment, where they are using their new skills. A total of 13 infrastructure micro-projects (vs. a target of 10) focusing on repair and rehabilitation of  irrigation networks, agricultural roads, and terracing of land for cultivation have been completed in 10 villages in the East of Sidon, as well as in the Aley and Chouf areas.  Nine more are to be completed by the PACD.  These have allowed returnees to resettle and resume land cultivation in their villages. Community participation in the projects enhances their chances for sustainability. Over 130 representatives (more than double the target) of more than 40 indigenous PVOs participated in workshops to improve their skills in emergency and development situations, the planning of community development activities, priority-setting and strategy development, and internal management.  The workshops were well-received by the NGOs, which expressed a desired need for additional training. In sum, the project was successful in encouraging displaced Lebanese to return to their homes by rehabilitating houses and some infrastructures, improving returnees' chances for employment, and in strengthening the capacities of some indigenous PVOs to continue community development efforts.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","7/1/1996 12:00:00 AM","","Disaster relief|War relief|Civil war|Disaster reconstruction|Population resettlement|Building construction|Housing|Economic infrastructure|Women in development|Vocational training|Indigenous private voluntary organizations","Lebanon","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABN350.pdf","2,489 KB","006676 - TEST International","","008568 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of a project (6/89-6/96) to expand private sector delivery of family planning (FP) services, especially long-term methods (LTMs), in Indonesia. The project achieved most but not all of its targets.  It reached targets for contraceptive prevalence rate, acceptors utilizing the private sector, rural acceptors fully or partially paying for FP through the private sector, commercial sales of contraceptives by couple years of protection, and midwives (at nearly double the target number) and pharmacists trained in FP.  The social marketing of Blue Circle (BC) contraceptives was very successful; BC has high brand awareness and sales expanded quickly.  The National FP Coordination Board's (BKKBN) community-based distribution (CBD) component, which was concentrated in the eight most populous provinces, was also very successful.  A total of 286,608 fieldworkers, volunteers, and community leaders were trained, and each province developed a distribution system to provide commercial contraceptives to rural communities. On the down side, the use of LTMs by both men and women increased only marginally from 35% in 1989 to 36.5% in 1994.  This was due to a decline both in the use of IUDs and, since 1989, in the annual number of voluntary sterilization (VS) procedures.  Causes of the decline in VS include prohibition of VS by the government due to opposition by Islamic leaders, competition from non-operative FP procedures such as IUDs and implants, and BKKBN's vigorous promotion of implants.  Another project shortfall occurred when doctor training was terminated in 1993; many general practitioners were not interested in it and few provided FP services in their practices. There are several issues for sustainability.  (1) In the private sector component, recent Ministry of Health policies constrain the provision of FP services by midwives, and there is need to strengthen the Indonesian Midwives Association's provincial and district headquarters, where most midwife training is conducted.  (2) Sustainability of social marketing depends on affordable, accessible, and quality products; quality providers; and effective promotion.  The Indonesia program had all these until 4/95, when BC advertising ended as scheduled.  (3) CBD sustainability faces three problems:  the fragile and not especially profitable private sector contraceptive distribution system in rural areas; midwives' need for continuing refresher training in persuasion skills and small business management; and the greater economic incentive afforded CBD workers for promoting short-term methods rather than LTMs.  In terms of management, it is not clear who will take over the important function of coordinating the growing number of Cooperative Agreements when the Project Support Group staff leaves in 12/95.  Finally, without additional staff it may be difficult for BKKBN to continue increasing contraceptive prevalence while working to fulfill its new mandates to improve family welfare and relieve poverty.  BKKBN will also face an accelerated demand for the removal of contraceptive implants as it continues to vigorously promote this method; there will be a need for rapidly increasing numbers of midwives and doctors to be trained in proper removal techniques. The following lessons were learned.  (1) Midwives, rather than doctors, are the most important providers of FP services through the private sector, and their role is likely to increase in the future.  In fact, except for VS, doctors have a limited role in the private sector. Similarly, pharmacists have almost no role in FP; assistant pharmacists, however, play an important role, especially for sales of condoms.  (2) A large majority of both urban and rural couples are willing to pay some or all costs of their FP needs, provided products are of high quality, affordable, accessible, and provided by well trained persons.  (3) BKKBN has an unusual capacity to train large numbers of people throughout the country.  (4) Without mass media promotion, private sector sales would not have grown from 12% to 28% of all contraceptive purchases in just 7 years.  (5) Major pharmaceutical companies are willing to make significant price cuts for socially significant causes as long as there is a profit potential.  (6) A successful VS program requires strong government support and adequate publicity.  Facilities, equipment, and trained staff are not enough.","Companion evaluation summary: PD-ABP-352","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","5/1/1996 12:00:00 AM","","Family planning promotion programs|Private sector|Family planning services|Community based delivery|Social marketing|Commercial retail sale of contraceptives|Paramedical education|Contraceptive methods|Project sustainability","Indonesia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABN351.pdf","2,368 KB","","","008558 - USAID.

"The purpose of The Private Sector Family Planning project (PSFP), the centerpiece of USAID population assistance in Indonesia between mid-1992 and early 1996, was to increase the use of private sector family planning providers and contraceptives, especially long-term contraceptives (IUDs, implants, and voluntary sterilization).   While the project was not designed as a research project, a large number of studies were conducted over the project's lifetime, though most of these were for internal purposes and not widely distributed.   As the project was ending and it became apparent that its ""institutional memory"" was at stake, a  last minute extension was granted for the abstracting and gleaning of  lessons learned from the project's research.  This report is in two parts.  A first and shorter part presents: (1)  general lessons learned, and (2) lessons grouped by project component, namely, social marketing of private sector contraceptives in urban areas, community-based distribution of contraceptive services and products in rural areas, private sector development (especially private midwives, and doctors and pharmacies), and promotion of long-term contraceptive methods. The second and longer part contains 54 study summaries, organized according to the same components. Studies that cover more than one component are grouped under a separate category.  An appendix includes a bibliography and an index of key words with pages corresponding to related studies.

"Evaluates project to improve education in grades 1-4 in Nicaragua through institutional strengthening, especially in the decentralization process; support for a child-centered curriculum; and training of educators at all levels (BASE project).  Mid-term evaluation covers the period 1994-7/96 and is based on review of 113 documents, discussions with 97 project and non-project personnel, and visits to about 100 classrooms in over 50 schools. The project's initial achievements are impressive, but restricted primarily to just 68 of Nicaragua's 5,000 primary schools.  These 68 schools were developed as models and potential training centers for other teachers.  Decentralization, which gives real power and funds to the community, has also advanced methodically in an autonomous school program which currently covers fewer than 500 schools.  Parallel to that, the Ministry of Education (MED), with project support, is deconcentrating functions from the central office to 19 departmental offices. The project has done well what it has tried to do. In addition to advances in decentralization and deconcentration, innovative solutions are now in place in budgeting, accounting, finance, teacher pay, evaluation, research, and human resource development.  These are supported by a sophisticated management information system (MIS) which reaches down to the departmental offices.  On the substantive side, 46,000 new child-centered teacher guides and manuals and 426,000 textbooks are in place, and 18,000 teachers (almost 100%) have received some training. However, teachers still do not apply the new curriculum, preferring rote teaching methods, the blackboard, textbook, and copybook.  Changing this will be the central challenge of the second phase of the project. The evaluation team recommends that in this second phase the project focus on a single goal:  improving the quality of classroom learning. Three mechanisms are proposed: (1) simplified, practical pamphlets which demonstrate to a largely untrained teacher how to plan to use a broad range of good learning materials and to make learning more active, practical, and participatory at the classroom level; (2) a continuous teacher training program which combines visits of mobile teams to classrooms, the establishment of learning centers, distance training techniques, and face-to-face training; and (3) systematic development of community support for schools.  The overall strategy is to move from micro to macro, to reach out from the 68 model schools to include all 5,000.

"Evaluates project to support overseas efforts of U.S. cooperative development organizations (CDOs).  Mid-term evaluation covers the period 4/94-8/96. Overall, the project has had a very beneficial impact on the growth of cooperatives overseas and the economic growth of host countries. Nine CDOs have received support grants:  America's Association of Cooperative/Mutual Insurance Societies (AAC/MIS); Agricultural Cooperative Development International; Cooperative Housing Foundation (CHF); Land O'Lakes; National Cooperative Business Association; National Rural Electric Cooperative Association (NRECA); National Telephone Cooperative Association (NTCA); Volunteers in Overseas Cooperative Assistance; and World Council of Credit Unions (WOCCU).  The project has helped the CD0s to assist foreign cooperatives and other NGOs.  However, most CDOs have not come close to achieving economic self-sufficiency in their overseas work and still depend on USAID direct financial support and grants for the majority their revenues. Seven of the 9 CDOs used most of their core grant funds, about $2.3 million, to develop project concepts and project proposals for consideration by USAID (mainly) and other organizations, resulting in over $46 million in new awards -- a good return on USAID dollars.  Six of the CDOs used a limited amount of core grant funds to improve management systems.  Most use core funds to pay for home office personnel who provide backstopping to their overseas programs.  However, in some cases, the relatively unrestricted availability of core funding for an extended period of time has not fostered management efficiency. Also, it is difficult for CDOs to maintain linkages with overseas cooperatives once TA activities are completed.  NRECA's program of dealing with ""second generation"" problems of assisted cooperatives is a potential model for such linkages. Five of the 7 CDOs who have participated in the project and its predecessors for 15 years or more have received (on average) over 90% of their revenues from USAID during the past 3 years, and the other two 70%-80%.  Clearly, little progress has been made in reducing CDO dependence on USAID funding. Except for AAC/MIS and VOCA, most of the CDOs have been spending only 5%-10% of core funds for project's Limited Program Services component, which is intended to finance TA and training, permit follow-up contacts with developing country cooperatives, and foster relationships with overseas cooperative leaders.  There has been little activity to strengthen partnerships with local NGOs and cooperatives assisted in the past, although this is one of the aims of the component. The project includes an Initiatives Grant Program, intended for innovative/special initiatives.  Two of the three such grants reviewed were traditional, limited budget, 2-year programs (WOCCU's African Credit Union Expansion Program and NTCA's Polish Telephone Training Program).  These have been extremely valuable to their beneficiaries, and while perhaps not innovative, neither would likely have been implemented without the availability of these grants.  It is too early to determine the success of the third grant (CHF's Model Project for NGO Development in Romania).  However, the beneficiaries of the four main NGOs visited were pleased with assistance provided so far. The project design is too general.  For example, most CDOs interpret ""Limited Program Services"" as requiring only a minimal expenditure of core funds in this area, and about 30% of the programs developed with core funds have very little to do with cooperative development in the field.  Also, a number of restrictions regarding unfair competition, country selection, and subsidizing of field projects, have frequently been overlooked. In Romania, although it was intended that many CDOs would participate under one large umbrella innovative grant to CHF, this has not occurred.  A number of the CDOs that joined CHF as subcontractors, would not partner as subcontractors with other CDOs in a similar, future initiative due to their dissatisfaction with their limited involvement or noninvolvement in the project's implementation. In other areas:  most CDOs have the ability to track expenditures by program component and have involved local NGO membership both in project planning and in project monitoring and evaluation.  Also, most of the projects visited are likely to be self-sustaining.  Finally, CDOs have implemented most of the recommendations made in previous evaluations. The evaluation includes detailed findings on each of the nine CDOs and their field projects.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","8/1/1996 12:00:00 AM","","Institution building|Cooperatives|Cooperative development organizations","Egypt|Uganda|Philippines|Bolivia|Guatemala|Poland|El Salvador|Romania|Central America","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABN408.pdf","11,228 KB","006190 - AMA Technologies, Inc.","","007746 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of the Improving Educational Quality (IEQ) project (1991-96), designed to improve student achievement in select developing countries through classroom research and innovation.  The project was implemented in Ghana, Mali, South Africa, and Guatemala. The project's primary objective for the core countries of Ghana, Guatemala, and Mali -- to strengthen the capacity of local researchers -- was achieved.  The host country research teams (HCRTs), the primary project implementors, were also the primary beneficiaries of project TA and research experience which, over the project's 5 years, provided them substantial opportunities to use new skills, with help from project teams, in designing and conducting observations of teacher-pupil interactions, monitoring teacher performance, and analyzing and reporting qualitative and quantitative research data.  In all four countries, the teams implemented assessment methods to test the effectiveness of either the IEQ-sponsored innovation or the program innovations they were tasked to evaluate. Although teachers, the project's secondary beneficiaries, were trained in new instructional techniques, the total number of teachers trained in each country was small.  In Ghana, 2-3 teachers in 7 schools were targeted for training.  In Mali, a larger number of schools (42) was included in the Basic Education Project (6880258), but the amount of training provided was less, and not all teachers participated.  In Guatemala and South Africa the project was not mandated to work with teachers. However, participating teachers in all four countries teachers reported positive impacts, such as increased access to educational resources (e.g., text-books and other printed materials) and improved teaching resulting from the simple fact of being observed by the HCRTs. In only two of the focus countries (Ghana and Mali) were the research teams tasked with identifying and implementing solutions that would improve pupil performance.  In these countries, pupils have benefitted from changed teaching techniques, increased access to educational resources, and the reduction in teacher absenteeism. An unintended yet significant outcome of the focus on classroom-based observation was to encourage a broad range of stakeholders in the education sector to look at the child and the classroom as the focus for decisionmaking.  Specifically, the project involved researchers and university faculty in direct contact with the schools.  They in turn served as important informants for the policymakers, who, because they are often unable to visit schools, especially those in secondary cities and rural areas, are forced to make uninformed policy decisions. Finally, IEQ research and the dissemination of research results at international conferences has helped to provoke a change in the attitudes of the educational community about how to go about making educational policy and to increase dialogue among the various stakeholders.  Project sustainability is most likely to occur in countries where the HCRTs are affiliated with a strong institution, although additional resources will be needed to support these units.","Delivery order no. 24|Project title: Improving educational quality (IEQ)|Project title: Human and educational resources network support|(HERNS)","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","FAO-0071-I-00-3070-00|FAO-I-00-93-00070-00","","8/1/1996 12:00:00 AM","","Educational policy|Policy making|Educational development|Educational research|Quality control|Observation|Classrooms|Teacher training|Host country cooperation|Educational innovations|Educational methods|Impact assessment|Institution building","Ghana|Mali|South Africa|Guatemala","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABN417.pdf","7,383 KB","012322 - Aguirre International|008249 - InfoStructure International|007696 - World Learning, Inc.","","008230 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to encourage     private, for-profit involvement in family planning (FP) activities (PROFIT project). Evaluation covers the period 9/91-6/96. PROFIT staff have identified 79 opportunities for subproject activities in the commercial sector.  Of those, 28 subprojects were developed.  Given the project's financial orientation, PROFIT staff used their expertise to prepare a careful ""Due Diligence"" analysis of each potential investment and the final investment document.  Currently, there remain 10 active subprojects after two ended prematurely.  Seven of the 10 involve investments (both loan and equity) -- $5.4 million from PROFIT, $17.3 million from its partners.  Of the other three active subprojects, one is run with a grant and two are primarily TA. The subprojects are being carried out in seven developing countries (Brazil, India, Indonesia, Kenya, the Philippines, Romania, and Zimbabwe) and the United States. Despite considerable staff effort in identifying and developing subprojects, there are only six promising models among those that are active.  These include a commercial company for distributing contraceptives in Brazil; an activity that involves working with pharmacists in Romania to expand information, counseling, and supply of contraceptives; a loan fund for midwives in Indonesia; a low-cost health care plan for workers in the informal sector in the Philippines (with a subsidiary of American International Group [AIG]); a managed health care plan for middle- and lower- income employees in Kenya; and a private sector initiatives program in Zimbabwe.  Through its investment subprojects, PROFIT has demonstrated that it is possible to make investments in the private, for-profit sector of FP and health with very good prospects for recovering the principal sum invested, if not actually realizing a return on the investments. PROFIT has also demonstrated that under certain circumstances USAID funds do not have to be granted or given away.  However, the project's overall costs appear high for such a low output of subprojects. Through a series of consultancies and assessments, PROFIT has also met a growing need among USAID Missions for help from a business-oriented, financially savvy contractor.  For example, a number of sustainability assessments were conducted for NGOs in developing countries.  Additionally, PROFIT has accumulated extensive experience in acting as a catalyst in promoting the commercial sector.  Given USAID's usual modes of giving grants and working with the public sector and not-for-profit NGOs, as well as the current push for quick results, developing and implementing opportunities in the commercial sector have not been easy.  There may be as many lessons to pass on to USAID from PROFIT's unsuccessful efforts as from its promising ones. Lessons learned are that:  (1) some key underlying project assumptions were invalid; (2) both USAID and PROFIT underestimated the difficulty of obtaining access to countries and developing subprojects; (3) USAID should have ventured into the world of innovative investments with more modest expectations; (4) while access to funds (e.g., loans) can stimulate private sector providers and investments, there are many reasons why commercial sector groups will engage in FP and reproductive health activities; (5) FP appears to be too narrow a niche among health services to get providers interested in borrowing funds; (6) TA is a critical part of developing investments in FP and reproductive health; and (7) more than 5-7 years are needed to develop an investment (i.e., more than the typical 5-year time frame of USAID-funded subprojects). USAID should provide the additional funds or TA needed to ensure that promising PROFIT models have a chance come to fruition; PROFIT should follow these subprojects carefully to assess what can be learned from them and how they can be expanded or replicated.  USAID should study carefully the experience documented by PROFIT and its two predecessor projects.  Finally, the evaluation team believes strongly that USAID should continue to pursue work in the commercial sector, taking an R&D approach. in the future.

"Evaluates 12-month cooperative agreement with the American Institute for Free Labor Development (AIFLD) to implement a comprehensive education and training program for labor unions in Nicaragua.  The agreement shifted AIFLD's Nicaragua program from subsidizing unions associated with the Congreso Permanente de Trabajadores (CPT) to direct training of union members.  Evaluation covers the period 4/95-3/96. AIFLD has fulfilled most of the provisions of the cooperative agreement, and is to be commended for establishing a fully functioning labor studies center -- Centro Nicaraguense de Estudios Laborales (CENDEL) -- and developing a comprehensive curriculum that meets the needs of Nicaraguan trade union organizations.  Success in these efforts was achieved in a relatively short period of time and demonstrates the considerable capabilities of the AFL-CIO and AIFLD. The labor studies program is the only comprehensive form of training in existence in Nicaragua which has the potential for modernizing and professionalizing the labor movement, enhancing the ability of union leadership to better represent members and bring social justice to the workplace, and enabling the labor movement to fully participate in the political and economic development of the nation. The majority of those interviewed attributed the success of the program can be attributed to its non-ideological curriculum, the administrative and technical capabilities of its staff, its diverse course offerings, the quality of the instructors, AIFLD/CENDEL's outreach/collaborative efforts with local NGOs, and the relative success of CENDEL graduates in attaining leadership positions in their trade union organizations and the general community.  AIFLD also exceeded the goal for number of women participants. Specific dividends of the labor education program can be measured in terms of the increased trade union activism reported by CENDEL graduates; accession of CENDEL graduates to leadership positions in key trade union organizations following competitive elections; the creation of new unions; and the demands for transparency in union decision making and financial operations, as conveyed in their election platforms. CENDEL estimates that 10% of the 198 students who completed the CENDEL training program were elected or appointed to leadership positions during 1995. Areas requiring further attention include: establishment of a Labor Advisory Council; submission to USAID/Nicaragua of a plan for CENDEL's long-term financial sustainability; and completion of national-level forums on the role of labor in a democracy, new and less adversarial collective bargaining techniques, labor code reform and worker rights, and regional economic integration. It is recommended that the project be extended an additional year. Other recommendations are to:  (1) expand CENDEL training to areas beyond the capital in order to promote a ""bottom-up"" trade union movement that is both democratic and national in scope; (2) consider creating a core of trade union instructors to provide trade union education in the future; (3) phase out administrative support funds to trade union centrals; and (4) provide a small library at CENDEL to facilitate student and staff research.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","3/1/1996 12:00:00 AM","","Labor unions|Trade unions|Management training|Institution building|Training centers|Leadership training","Nicaragua","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABN459.pdf","40 KB","008182 - USAID.

"Evaluates the P.L. 480 Title II Monetization Program, in which U.S. agricultural commodities are sold in developing countries by PVOS and other cooperating sponsors (CSs) to generate local currency for use in USAID-sponsored development and emergency food aid activities. Evaluation covers the period 1986-95. Since 1986, there has been a dramatic growth in Title II monetization.  In 1987, $21 million in monetized commodities supported 21 projects in 19 countries; by 1994, the program was valued at over $80 million and supported 43 projects in 24 countries. Africa has received the bulk of this support and its share is likely to increase.  The Asia and Near East region has also seen increases in monetization, primarily due to the growth of monetization in Bangladesh.  The use of monetization in the Latin America and Caribbean region, as well as food aid in general, has declined steadily due to food security improvements. Although the use of proceeds has evolved and expanded beyond the logistical costs of food distribution, the funds still primarily support food distribution and related development activities.  The use of monetization proceeds for emergencies has been limited due to the difficulties of conducting commodity sales in an emergency environment, and to the fact that funds for the logistical costs of food delivery and distribution are often available from other sources. Recently, USAID has paid heightened attention to the impact of food aid on food security.  A February, 1995 Food Aid and Food Security Policy Paper notes that food aid in general and monetization proceeds in particular should be integrated with other USAID assistance resources to support the program priorities of increased agricultural productivity and improved household nutrition. In the field, many developments have improved the effectiveness and efficiency of monetization.  For example, umbrella monetizations, in which one CS monetizes on behalf of all CSs in the country, have proven effective and efficient in several countries.  More careful commodity selection, with consideration of local market preferences, has improved cost recovery.  Improved financial management has helped to maintain the value of the proceeds generated. Yet numerous challenges continue to confront CSs, which view monetization as an important financial resource.  These include the decline in the availability of P.L. 480 commodities compared to rising needs; the increased pressure on USAID and the CSs to demonstrate concrete progress toward food security goals; and the continuing debate over whether the distribution of food or the monetization of the commodities for use in projects serving needy populations is the most effective use of the food aid resources.  The fact is that USAID monetization policy has evolved as a programmatic response to issues encountered since the start of the program.  A new and more definitive set of policies and guidelines is now required so that monetization can contribute more directly to food security objectives.

"This report synthesizes evaluations of industrial energy conservation projects in six countries:  the Czech Republic, Guatemala, Hungary, Jamaica, Pakistan, and the Philippines.  The report provides country-level data on five factors affecting project performance (energy policy, economic climate, technology, energy education/awareness, and institutional capacity) and examines the projects' economic and environmental impacts, as well their sustainability and replicability. Lessons learned are as follows.  (1) When energy is cheap, there is little incentive to use it efficiently.  As long as there are major subsidies, broad-based energy conservation is difficult.  (2) Privatization creates a more favorable climate for conservation.  (3) The type and level of investment a firm is willing to make depends on business climate and incentives.  Higher energy prices and other incentives are needed to create demand for energy-efficient equipment. However, business attitudes may fail to change quickly enough to keep up with market realities.  (4) The USAID projects succeeded by promoting relatively simple energy-saving technology and emphasizing ways to make existing equipment work more efficiently.  (5) Good technologies are not enough; effective, continuing promotion is needed.  (6) Education and awareness campaigns cannot overcome bad policies or weak institutions. (7) The development of market-driven institutions is critical to success.  (8) Energy conservation investments must generate a strong economic rate of return and a rapid payback. (9) Investments in energy efficiency have important, sometimes surprising, environmental benefits, but pollution control through regulation is still the most effective way to cut harmful emissions and improve energy efficiency.  (10) Use of energy-efficient technologies has generally been sustained, but replication has been a problem.  Replication demands that technologies are broadly applicable, cost-effective, and widely disseminated and marketed.  (11) Firms vary greatly in their level of energy use; USAID needs different tactics for reaching different users. (12) Energy conservation is more than just energy equipment; it is also energy management.  (13) Beneficiary, government, and donor commitment is critical to success.  (14) USAID should not let its own internal budget pressures distort its technology or beneficiary selection.  (15) Developing and transitional economies require different approaches.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","10/1/1996 12:00:00 AM","","Energy conservation|Energy policy|Economic conditions|Cultural environment|Energy technology|Technology transfer|Environmental education|Public awareness|Institution building|Economic impact|Environmental aspects|Project sustainability|Project replication|Investment environment|Industry|Industrial equipment|Industrial management","Czech Republic|Guatemala|Hungary|Jamaica|Pakistan|Philippines","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNABY225.pdf","1,302 KB","008058 - USAID.

"Evaluates Freedom from Hunger's (FFH) Credit with Education (CWE) program, which provides credit and health education to poor rural women. Midterm evaluation covers the period 1993-7/96 and compares the program with the village banking program of World Relief Corporation (WRC). Four country projects, two in Honduras and two in Burkina Faso, are reviewed. Implementation has proceeded smoothly, and all four village banking projects have been successful, though progress toward sustainability has differed.  High membership turnover in Honduras and substantial illiteracy of members in Burkina Faso have hindered loan growth, health message assimilation, and self-management. All four projects have introduced distinct innovations to the village banking program, with varied success.  In three projects, graduation of banks has been abandoned.  In only one (CREDO), do men still belong to village banks; this is problematic.  Turnover of members and single female membership are much greater in Honduras than in Burkina Faso. Member savings policy is probably the most variable component of the projects, ranging from minimal and voluntary to substantial and obligatory, with ability to withdraw savings from cycle to cycle varying from total to nil. The CWE model is being successfully implemented, with minimal changes to FFH education materials.  In the absence of comparative impact studies, it cannot yet be determined whether CWE significantly improves welfare impacts, particularly for infants; the same holds true for the relationship between women's increased income and health education. Relations between WRC and FFH and their partners are cordial and generally collegial.  The most innovative, and in many ways most difficult, partnership is between FFH and Reseau des Caisses Populaires du Burkina Faso (RCPB), FFH's Burkinabe partner.  While satisfied with CWE's education component, RCPB's desire to modify the banking model to fit the needs of its credit union movement has occasionally resulted in friction.  On the other hand, FAMA, FFW's partner in Honduras, a former applied nutrition organization with interests in sustainable agriculture, will need to focus on bank portfolio growth in order to remain successful in village banking. Without significant progress toward self-sufficiency, its village bank program will remain dependent on rapidly shrinking donor contributions. Common to all programs is the need to increase loan size and the number of village banks served in the interest of operational and financial sustainability.  In some cases, particularly FAMA, the number of members per bank should be raised. Increasing loan size to banks and bank members depends on reducing member turnover, discouraging the use of internal fund lending, and uncoupling loan size from amount of savings.  Key to the cost-effective expansion of the village bank portfolio is moving from 4-month cycles with weekly reimbursement of interest and principal to 6-month cycles with biweekly or monthly repayment meetings. While the basic financial problems of village banking are now fairly well understood, the sociological and microeconomic dimensions of village banking are largely unknown.  A precise appreciation of how women's businesses generate income, how this income is reinvested or consumed, and how consumption is directed to human needs is still lacking after nearly a decade of village banking. The need to gauge the enhanced impact of CWE compared with straight village banking has led FFH to develop several surveys, which it will implement late in 1996 in both Honduras and Burkina Faso in collaboration with WRC and all four partner organizations. The trend in village banking toward loans to individuals or small, solidarity groups appears to be inevitable.  Both WRC and CREDO have launched such programs, and WRC appears ready to experiment with other modalities.  Beyond these shifts, FAMA continues to permit internal fund lending in its more experienced banks, while RCPB is moving steadily toward longer loan terms with unchanged interest rates.  While there are dangers to cost containment in such experimentation, experimentation with credit to women entrepreneurs is both warranted and inevitable.

"PACR of a project (2/92-2/96) to support legislative development in Costa Rica.  The project was implemented by the Center for Democracy (CFD). Achievements made toward the project's six major goals are as follows.  (1) To help institutionalize the legislative development process, CFD provided TA to help the Legislative Assembly's Modernization Commission identify goals, set priorities, and develop numerous activities.  Specific achievements included a Master Plan for development and modernization of the Assembly; a permanent, multi-partisan Commission on Modernization and legislative development; and an agreement to co-finance specific training and legislative TA programs.  By investing in modernization, the Assembly not only demonstrated its commitment to the project, but also established a precedent for including funding for similar activities in future budgets. (2) For the most part, efforts to modernize the Assembly led to computerization and staff training rather than basic changes in organizational structure, administration, or procedure.  A new set of rules of order prepared by a CFD consultant is expected to be voted upon prior to 5/96.  If this does not happen, it is likely that the issue will not be re-opened until after the 1998 presidential elections. (3) Helped by a needs assessment conducted by the Central American Institute for Business Administration (INCAE), the project offered a legislative development program for legislators and their staffs combining training (generally through the University of Costa Rica's Center for Research and Training in Public Administration [CICAP]) and publications. Participation in the program has been very strong:  the courses earn civil service points and are also pertinent to the Assembly's work.  One of the program's most significant legacies is the Assembly's awareness, at every level, of the importance of this training. (4) A highlight of efforts to develop institutional linkages between the Assembly and other national and international institutions on the one hand and the Costa Rican public on the other was the creation, during the contract extension period, of the Program for Legislative Development (PRODEL), ratified by the Legislative Directorate in 9/94. PRODEL, which taps the resources of CICAP, provides high-level TA to legislators in developing legislative studies and drafting proposed bills on specialized subjects of national importance. PRODEL also organizes seminars, workshops, and conferences, and produces publications of legislative interest. (5) With TA from CDF, the Assembly purchased an integrated Legislative Information System (SIL), which currently extends to the offices of the 57 deputies and all the legislative offices (though not yet the administrative offices).  Data bases and online services available through SIL include the Daily Legislative Calendar, Plenary and Committee Minutes, Legislative ""e-mail"", Current Law (SLV), Bill Analyses, National Registry Data, Finance Ministry information, National Socio-Economic Statistics, INTERNET, and Legislative Library Services. The results of computerization are already being felt in the Assembly, the investment of whose own funds is but one more indication of its commitment to modernization. (6) Regarding coordination of multi-donor contributions to the Assembly, outside assistance will be sought to continue the Master's Program in Legislative Studies and an effort will be made to involve legislative staff from other Central American Parliaments.  Proposals for co-funding continuation of the legislative TA program have already been presented to a number of donors.  The Assembly is committed to continuing its legislative development program. Lessons learned are as follows.  (1) Legislators and staff should be involved in developing a needs assessment.  (2) Parliament should ""institutionalize"" the legislative development process by establishing a permanent, multi-partisan commission of legislators (to include a representative of the ruling body of the legislature) to oversee all modernization efforts.  This commission should adopt an annual work plan and make decisions only by consensus.  (3) Parliament should be required to contribute financially to all projects undertaken.  (4) Great care should be taken to maintain balance between political parties in all activities.  (5) The program should be guided by a small, ""politically balanced"" executive committee of respected former legislators and staff and should engage only in activities specifically approved by the multi-partisan commission.  (6) Every effort should be made to involve and communicate with the Parliament's permanent legislative and administrative staff.  (7) Legislative development programs should be institutionalized through a permanent linkage with a major university. (8) Making public policy is the responsibility of elected legislators. Everyone else should focus on making sure that the legislators' decisions are based on the best information available and that the legislative institution and process are functioning as efficiently and effectively as possible.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","515-0241-G-00-2133-00","","1/1/1996 12:00:00 AM","","Government reform|Legislature|Institution building","Costa Rica","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABN490.pdf","1,519 KB","008533 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of a cooperative agreement (9/93-11/96) with the Population Reference Bureau (PRB) to produce and disseminate new materials tailored to developing country audiences, provide TA, and support extensive media outreach. The project has met and exceeded its goals, in less time and with fewer staff than anticipated.  The mix of activities has been appropriate and complementary. Technical collaboration with other organizations has been highly valued, appropriate, and successful. Illustrative accomplishments are as follows. PRB has produced, mostly in-house, and disseminated to over 70 countries around the world print and nonprint materials, mostly in English, French, and Spanish which emphasize the goals of USAID's Center for Population, Health and Nutrition, such as reproductive health, youth, women's status, family planning programs, and population policy. More tools need to be developed for evaluating these materials' impact on policy reform. Since 1987, PRB has trained 119 fellows (U.S.-based developing country graduate students) from 42 countries to understand the links between academic research and policy information needs in their home countries and to communicate their research findings effectively to policy audiences.   More than half are working or studying in population.  A highly regarded internship program supports two interns at the Office of Population in the Center for Population, Health and Nutrition and one at PRB.  The Communicating Population and Health Research to Policymakers summer seminar is the first known short-term training program devoted to policy-level communications; 14 senior researchers and policy specialists took part in the 1996 session. PRB has worked with a group of women magazine editors (""Women's Edition""), in producing substantial supplements to popular developing country women's magazines on topics related to women's health, including reproductive health, violence against women, male participation in reproductive health and family planning, women and education, and adolescent reproductive health.  These supplements have reached over 3 million readers in 9 countries.  PRB has worked with the Center for Applied Research on Population and Development on a similar effort in Mali to enhance partnerships between senior print and broadcast journalists and health institutions. PRB undertook small-scale TA efforts to improve the policy communication capacities of national institutions in India, Madagascar, and Nicaragua.  This TA has been favorably received. Other activities have included responses to nearly 500 ad hoc requests (most of them for country briefing packets); hosting international visitors and preparing meetings in Washington DC; and informational presentations to government agencies, foreign embassies, etc. in the Washington area. Seven comparative advantages have strengthened PRB's performance:  an exclusive focus on policy communications, the ability to transform research and data into information that people can understand and use, wide coverage of topics and communication through multiple channels, a focus on institutional development through training and TA, links to U.S. domestic audiences, use of the media to inform public policy discussions and decision, and an extensive database and documentation center. USAID should consolidate the existing activities of Cooperative Agreement and provide the funding needed for the staff required to implement the activities.  PRB has had to operate at below optimal staffing levels and to rely on consultants to implement some activities, such as the Women's Edition. Three main actions are proposed for a future agreement:  move beyond dissemination to focus on use of information; develop tools, handbooks, or frameworks that can be transferred to other institutions; and use technology to extend the reach of activities.","Project title: Population technical assistance (POPTECH)|Project title: Demographic data initiatives","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","CCP-3024-Q-00-3012-00","","11/1/1996 12:00:00 AM","","Population planning|Population policy|Information dissemination|Mass media|Publications|Educational materials|Technical assistance|Technical training|Population education","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABN497.pdf","912 KB","008485 - Basic Health Management International (BHM)","","008234 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to strengthen the capacity of America-Mideast Educational and Training Services, Inc. (AMIDEAST) to promote the development of democratic institutions in the Middle East (DDI project). Interim, participatory evaluation covers the period 7/91-1995; personnel of both USAID/ANE and AMIDEAST were included on the evaluation team. AMIDEAST has carried out democracy/governance activities in the six targeted countries (Morocco, Tunisia, Egypt, Yemen, Jordan, and Lebanon) as well as in the West Bank and Gaza and at the regional level.  These have included needs assessments, training staff of democratic institutions, arranging conferences, providing short-term TA, and serving as intermediary with indigenous partners in cases where political, legal, or other reasons prevent U.S. Government offices from doing so directly.  AMIDEAST has sought to integrate activities so that strengthening an institution in one target area would complement work in another; its work with NGOs exemplifies this approach. Nonetheless, many factors largely beyond AMIDEAST's control affect the progress of democratization in the region, including the political environments of host countries and institutional and policy changes within USAID and its Missions. The project has achieved modest success in building up AMIDEAST's capacity for DDI programming.  AMIDEAST field staff appear to have developed sound knowledge of aspects of DDI programming with which they have been heavily involved (e.g., management of country assessment teams, and parliamentary computerization).  Nonetheless, the project has been overly Washington-centered.  There has been no structured training, exposure, or interaction among field offices to develop field personnel's understanding of democratization issues and strategies. Also, some of the money originally programmed for field activities were redirected to the administrative budget; this is partly a shortcoming of AMIDEAST and partly due to USAID decisions. The project has also been hampered by the involvement of too many U.S. government personnel, both in Washington and the Near East, in both major and minor decisions, at times resulting in conflicting guidance for AMIDEAST.  Despite good intentions, the net result has been to stymie the project and pull it in inconsistent, even counterproductive directions. The project has also been hampered by exogenous factors, such as the civil war in Yemen, and the fact that the Jordan-Israel peace process has contributed to a more sensitive programming environment in Jordan. Some think the project's aimed to make AMIDEAST the Near Eastern equivalent of The Asia Foundation (TAF), which undertakes democratic development work in Asia.  In many respects, it is not appropriate to compare the two (TAF, unlike AMIDEAST, receives an annual appropriation from Congress, focuses on democratic development, and operates in countries with a relatively more open programming environment), yet TAF is a useful model in that its expertise, decisions, and programming impetus are very much field-based, and it builds on its field experience to develop an independent perspective in proposing projects to USAID. In addition, there in concern among some USAID staff as to whether and how well AMIDEAST assesses whether the governmental and NGO leaders it chooses to work with truly possess the will for political reform. AMIDEAST field staff are capable of making such assessments, but have tended to do in only a narrow sense, perhaps because they are uncertain whether they are supposed to lead or follow USAID's thinking. While AMIDEAST has made progress toward financial sustainability for its DDI operations, this progress flows mainly from USAID support; raising funds from foundations and other private sources has proven problematic for AMIDEAST.  AMIDEAST is spending a lot of time and money developing proposals aimed at expanding its DDI portfolio; perhaps some of these resources should be put instead into field activities that will build its democratization expertise. It is recommended that future USAID efforts to strengthen intermediary organizations such as AMIDEAST should focus on (1) building the knowledge and experience of field personnel and (as a secondary priority) other staff in key program areas, rather than merely providing general support for staff salaries, and (2) planning at the outset what capacities will be strengthened and how this will be done.  Such project should be flexible, perhaps by providing a grant that concentrates funding in the field offices and gives them the authority to decide how to spend the funds, subject to a ""no objection"" review by USAID Missions.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","ANE-0375-A-00-1027-00","","1/1/1996 12:00:00 AM","","Democratization|Institution building|Government reform|Private voluntary organizations|Civil society","Middle East|Morocco|Tunisia|Egypt|Yemen|Jordan|Lebanon|West Bank|Gaza Strip","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABN506.pdf","125 KB","000259 - America-Mideast Educational and Training Services, Inc.

"Evaluates the impact of CARE's food-assisted maternal/child health (MCH) project in the Dominican Republic. Evaluation covers the period 1993-3/96. An ambitious baseline study was completed at the start of the project, including a health/family planning (FP) survey covering 16,906 households (approximately 40% of the target population) and a cross-indexed Knowledge, Beliefs, Attitude and Practices (KBAP) survey covering 2,847 families.  In September 1995, the KBAP instrument was re-administered to 904 project families and 175 control families.  The instrument addresses indicators and analyzes findings in FP practices, nutritional status, MCH care, and breastfeeding. Results in FP prove, with extremely high levels of statistical validity, four key findings.  (1) In project communities, non-FP users fell by nearly a third.  (2) The predominant mix of FP choices previously available to project participants (sporadic pill use followed by early sterilization) has changed dramatically.  (3) A nearly 50% reduction in the percentage of mothers at risk of unwanted pregnancies was verified.  (4) A 36% increase in birth spacing to more than 24 months has also been documented.  Non-project explanation of causation has been ruled out.  Additionally, program outreach has increased to over three-quarters of the rural target population, and women's participation in community organizations and assumption of leadership are up significantly. Statistically significant changes in nutrition were found in three areas.  (1) While overall low birth weight did not improve, children whose mothers had participated in project activities demonstrated a decrease of 2.5% in low birthweight, nearly a fifth.  (2) Growth card use is up substantially, but mothers' ability to read the card is down. (3) Severe and moderate malnutrition has declined in project communities, 3% in 1-11 month old children, 4.2% in 12-23 month old children, and 3.7% in 24-35 month old children. Impact in MCH care was found in six areas.  (1) Prenatal care during the first trimester increased in project villages.  Post partum control was much lower, but held steady in project villages, against a declining trend in control communities.  (2) The project had high impact in increasing project mothers' visits to Ministry of Health (MOH) rural clinic. (3) Children's vaccinations are dramatically higher in all villages, in part due to the project's logistical assistance to national MOH vaccination campaigns.  Three of four children had all boosters against DPT and polio; nine of ten for BCG; eight of ten for measles. Six of ten have received all childhood vaccinations.  (4) There has been no reduction in the incidence of diarrhea or acute respiratory infection (ARI), but there has been a statistically significant improvement in project mothers increasing the length of oral rehydration solution and the frequency of its administration to four or more times per day.  A significant number of children had diarrhea for three days or less.  (5) A statistically significant number of project mothers take their children to the rural clinics with ARI than heretofore.  (6) A significant and substantive increase was verified in the proportion of mothers who can recognize three to six signs of dehydration. Impact in breastfeeding and infant nutrition was found in three areas.  (1) Exclusive breastfeeding for children under 6 months of age at time of survey has more than doubled, to 26%; results for children under 4 months old are even better. Formula and bottle use in project villages have decreased by 17%. (2) Administration of laxative to newborns and infants in project villages has gone down by 7.4% to under 40%.  (3) Length of breastfeeding has increased by nearly 12% in project and control villages. Project designers hoped to demonstrate that food-assisted programming could be shown to be as successful as the best of development programming anywhere in the world.  FP results are dramatic at nearly unprecedented levels of statistical confidence.  Nutrition results indicate that carefully targeted interventions can reduce malnutrition through education and better health services, even without a major reduction in poverty.  The project has been highly successful in MCH interventions, with a likely influence on decreased mortality.  Finally, the project has had significant impact on improving feeding practices at birth.

"Evaluates activity (8/95-12/96) to increase civil participation in, and the fairness and transparency of, the 1996 presidential elections in the Dominican Republic. Thanks in part to this activity, the 1996 presidential elections (unlike the previous elections in 1994) were widely considered to be fair and transparent. Dominican civil society came out in full force to ensure that Joaquin Balaguer kept his promise to leave the Presidency in 1996. The activity was implemented by four actors. Partipacion Ciudadana (PC) did an outstanding job of recruiting and training some 5,000 Dominicans, over half under age 24, as election observers, who performed superlatively on May 16 and June 30 and in administering a parallel quick count of votes.  PC overcame the apprehensions of the Electoral Council (JCE) and key political parties, which felt that PC's perceived affiliation with the opposition PRD party would lead to bias. The Grupo de Accion por la Democracia (GAD) used its clout to assure that elections took place in 1996 and to help select and support what was widely seen as a highly credible JCE.  It also carried out a highly participatory activity leading to the development of a National Agenda that was endorsed by the three main political parties, and made a strong start at organizing local Action Groups.  GAD's effectiveness in carrying out mass media and other civic education campaigns to stimulate the Dominican populace to vote was less clear. The Instituto Interamericano de Derechos Humanos/Centro para Asesoria Electoral (IIDH/CAPEL) provided invaluable assistance in helping PC develop election materials, train election observers, and prepare for and carry out the quick count.  IIDH/CAPEL organized an 8/95 seminar that linked up key actors (GAD, PC, JCE) and kicked off civil society's participation in the elections, and its flexibility enabled it to reprogram $90,000 in grant funds marked for PC to cover elections monitoring expenses when PC exceeded its budget.  GAD was not interested in IIDH/CAPEL's assistance. USAID/DR received high marks for its collaborative and participatory approach.  The Mission identified and linked up civil society groups with common interests; brokered the design of a comprehensive program of civil society support for a free and fair election in 1996; brought in IIDH/CAPEL to serve as a neutral bridge between PC and GAD on the one hand and the JCE on the other; played a proactive role behind the scenes in advising PC regarding elections monitoring and the quick count; and provided flexible financing that enabled both PC and GAD to respond quickly to unanticipated situations. In sum, the activity made an unequivocal difference in the 1996 elections.  Knowledge that the U.S. government was closely watching the election with intended neutrality undoubtedly influenced Balaguer's and the political parties' commitment to keep the election on track. Financial support for PC made the JCE more effective; the polling stations and political parties knew they were being watched on election days.  The quick count, which provided data within .026 of the official returns, gave the latter a great deal of credibility.  USAID served as a catalyst in the formation of GAD, and it helped to recruit and train those managing the electoral tables. The following lessons were learned.  (1) That USAID took a very participatory and collaborative approach was highly effective.  Both the USAID Mission Director and the U.S. Ambassador were lauded by their Dominican partners for letting them take the lead and relating to them with deference and respect.  (2) To create the flexibility needed for this activity, USAID included broad objectives and illustrative activities under each grant component, rather than setting specific targets.  This allowed USAID, on numerous occasions, to jump in and provide urgently needed assistance.  (3) The importance of having political parties and government authorities under surveillance during the electoral process cannot be overemphasized.  Throughout the 20-month period, from the signing of the Pact for Democracy in 8/94 to the second elections round in 6/96, both entities were under the constant scrutiny of Dominican civil society, the U.S. Government, and the international press.  (4) Given the circumstances surrounding the 1994 elections, USAID would not have been permitted to bring in a U.S. TA provider even if it wanted to.  Instead, USAID arranged to bring in a Latin American TA provider, IIDH/CAPEL, that had developed a relationship with and the trust of the JCE.  This outside TA was critical, especially to PC.","Contract number is listed incorrectly on the document as|517-0273-O--8229-0","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","517-0273-G-00-8229-00","","12/1/1996 12:00:00 AM","","Elections|Electoral systems|Institution building|Voting|Political participation|Civil society|Popular participation|Election monitoring","Dominican Republic","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABN518.pdf","3,115 KB","","","008537 - USAID.

"Evaluates grant to the World Food Program (WFP) for a disaster mitigation program (DMP) comprising components in vulnerability assessment and mapping (VAM), emergency training, and project identification and formulation.  Interim and strategic evaluation covers the period 1993-7/96. Overall, the DMP has contributed to the visible improvements in WFP. VAM and training have had positive results and are leading to improved programming decisions and staff capabilities. Activities undertaken in the VAM component are appropriate to the original purpose of ""better targeted response in emergency situations"". They have achieved limited but identifiable successes in improved targeting.  Additional improvements are likely to occur in WFP country programs as VAM techniques are adopted and refined.  Two additional foci of the VAM component -- logistics preparedness support and maps for public relations and general communication -- have value-added features that were positively assessed. The workshops in emergency management and emergency operations organized periodically by WFP have been favorably assessed by the participants.  The use of the grant to improve WFP's staff capability has been effective in moving WFP to establish a pool of trained emergency personnel.  New advances in vulnerability analysis and mapping have been incorporated without delay in training materials, constituting a feedback from one component of the grant to another. Since the benefits from VAM and training are only now beginning to be realized, changes in project identification and formulation, which presuppose these benefits, cannot yet be fully assessed.  Trends in food aid distributions in the countries visited are overlain by the powerful influence of the erratic recurrence of drought or other emergencies. The team found instances, nevertheless, where VAM maps were being used constructively in project identification.  The state of acceptance of VAM techniques for operational purposes by host governments showed quite a bit of variability among countries. In summary, the program has substantially contributed to improvements in WFP's emergency management and disaster mitigation capabilities, principally stemming from investments in VAM and training.  These changes in WFP are pervasive and evident at many levels, and are not all due to the OFDA grant.  WFP's approach to food aid has changed over the last 3 years and the DMP has played an important role in this process. A number of recommendations with respect to the three DMP components are provided.

"PACR of a project (5/82-5/93) to provide income earning opportunities, basic health services, and adequate nutrition for the displaced population in El Salvador as efforts are made toward their relocation. The project met its principal objectives, providing a safety net for many of the displaced when the Government of El Salvador (GOES) could not, helping to settle or relocate in rural areas many who otherwise would have migrated to already over-crowded urban centers, especially San Salvador, and reducing to less than 25,000 the number of displaced who were without reasonable prospects of caring for themselves.  At its termination, the project had essentially eliminated the displaced persons problem. While most of the resettled and relocated still live in poverty and a permanent solution for a hard core of displaced has yet to be found, these problems are being dealt with by the National Reconstruction and other ongoing development or welfare programs. Accomplishments made under each of the project's four components are discussed below. The employment generation component, accounting for a significant portion of project expenditures, provided occasional employment to 150,000-200,000 displaced people through 4,968 work projects, which, according to a USAID/ES data base, installed 28,390 latrines, rehabilitated 1.665 million sq m of cobblestone streets, and completed 316 community potable water initiatives. Under the public health component, CONADES and PVOs vaccinated almost 100,000 displaced mothers and children against disease and tetanus infection; provided mothers with nearly 100,000 oral rehydration therapy (ORT) doses; made 588,000 home visits and 83,000 referrals to Ministry of Health clinics; and trained thousands of the displaced how to deal with community health problems. The food assistance component had three phases:  a dole feeding program that peaked at nearly 270,000 beneficiaries in 1984, a supplementary feeding program that expanded the program to over 300,000 between 1984 and 1987, and a food-for-work (FFW) program.  Food assistance provided during the period of rapid growth of the displaced population adequately addressed the problem of malnutrition.  The shift to FFW, while continuing food distribution to the needy, reduced the number of beneficiaries to around 120,000 because the displaced who had other income sources deselected themselves from the program.  Food assistance was phased out in 1992. Under the resettlement and reintegration component, PVOs (primarily World Relief, International Rescue Committee, and Creative Associates International) and CONADES helped 13,218 families reintegrate themselves in the last 8 years of the project.  USAID/ES created the Granos Basicos program, which supplied over 27,000 agricultural packages containing enough seeds, fertilizers, and selected pesticides to enable each of 13,000 farmers to plant corn, beans, and sorghum on 1.7 acres. The following lessons were learned:  (1) Flexible project design and a rapid response capability are crucial ingredients for an emergency displaced persons program.  (2) If the host government is not given enough responsibility for implementing emergency assistance, it may assign lower priority to the program and make less effort to support it. (3) To minimize problems connected with targeting a specific group for assistance, beneficiaries should be graduated from special status as early as possible and in accordance with specific criteria and a deliberate plan.  (4) Coordination is needed in order to preclude duplication of efforts.  (5) The success of the employment program suggests that a jobs program can help displaced people meet some basic needs and maintain dignity while accomplishing useful community projects.  (6) When food distribution moves from pure dole feeding to FFW, specialized TA is likely to be required for implementing institutions, especially when the institutions are inexperienced and have to work in a post-civil war context.  (7) In an emergency, it is easy to forget the importance of understanding what is happening to beneficiaries, especially women.  Data on this group should be gathered and used.

"PACR of a project (8/85-9/92) to promote the production of non-traditional agricultural export (NTAE) crops through irrigation development in El Salvador.  The evaluation focuses mainly on the project's public sector component, implemented by the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock (MAG). The private sector development component, implemented by the Salvadoran Foundation for Economic and Social Development (FUSADES), is the subject of a separate evaluation (PD-ABE-670). The public sector component comprised three activities:  (1) TA, training, and curriculum development in irrigated export crop development to the Center of Agriculture Technology (CENTA) and the National School of Agriculture (ENA), and upgrading of the facilities of the National Training Center (CENCAP); (2) training and TA in irrigation planning and evaluation assistance to the General Directorate of Irrigation and Drainage (DGRD), the Agricultural Sector Planning Office (OSPA), and the Office of Water (OA); and (3) in-country training of irrigation professionals, extension agents, and farmers.  Most targets were met or exceeded.  In particular, 1,582 farmers were trained in on-farm water management (vs. a target of 1,400), and precision irrigation for production of high-labor, high-value NTAE crops has been adopted on 2,727 ha (vs. a target of 2,500 ha). Overall, the project's concepts are sound.  There appears to be no viable alternative approach to significantly increasing the demands for rural labor or to promote increased NTAEs.  However, project designers underestimated the time and effort needed to make farmers inexperienced in intensive agriculture fully effective in this type of production.  A broader technological approach, with more emphasis on the importance of integrating factors of production and water use, would have strengthened the overall project. In addition, El Salvador's institutional capacity for carrying out the proposed activities and for implementing the reforms necessary for achieving the objectives was, and still is, weak.  More emphasis should have been placed on improving inter-institutional coordination between the public and private sectors.  Further, it is not wise to assign responsibility for such a complex program to a high-level public administrator whose responsibilities are already demanding. Finally, the technology of efficient surface irrigation is complex and requires considerable time, repetition of the basics, and patience on the part of extension agents to train both technicians, and through them, producers at the farm level.  The extension technicians must have in-depth experience in production and in meeting market demand for each commodity produced.  Access to technologies developed in similar areas can speed technology transfer.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","4/1/1996 12:00:00 AM","","Irrigated farming|Export promotion|Nontraditional agricultural exports|Agricultural technology|Agricultural water management|On farm water management|Institution building|Public sector","El Salvador","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABN539.pdf","565 KB","008540 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (9/84-9/94) to revitalize El Salvador's economy by promoting trade, investment, and exports. The private and public sector components were implemented, respectively, by the Salvadoran Foundation for Economic and Social Development (FUSADES) and the Ministry of Foreign Trade (MICE), now the Ministry of Economy. The private sector component supported the following FUSADES programs:  Trade and Investment Promotion Services (later renamed the Export and Investment Promotion Program -- PRIDEX); the Association Strengthening Activities (ASA) program, which assisted potential exporters; the Investment Development Fund (FIDEX); and the Economic and Social Studies Department's Center of Studies (DEES).  A major achievement was the spinning off of FIDEX and creation of the first private financial development institution in El Salvador, currently BANFIDEX, S.A.  DEES contracted high-level experts to develop a major structural adjustment program which put the country's economy back on track. DEES also significantly improved economic statistics in El Salvador, and is now doing the same with social statistics. PRIDEX has emerged under this project as a well established, successful export and investment capacity; a major project output was its identification of 532 subprojects vs. a target of 300. Total LOP investment amounted to $86.4 million, and hard currency generated by exports is valued at $272.2 million. Under the public sector component, the project supported a high-level, public-private Export and Investment Development Committee (CODEXI); supported the Government of El Salvador's (GOES) design of CENTREX, the one-stop export documentation center; provided automation and training assistance to the MICE; and supported studies of the San Bartolo Free Zone (SBFZ) that resulted in its privatization.  GOES' counterpart resources financed, inter alia, construction of an additional 24,000 square meters of under-roof industrial space at the SBFZ, which is now fully leased out to exporting companies.  Overall, however, progress was less than dynamic.  Initial problems included the political nature of the MICE, frequent changes of Ministers, managerial and technical weaknesses of MICE staff, and the pronounced lack of GOES commitment to export and investment initiatives.  In 3/90, development of a National Export Strategy as the primary vehicle for economic revitalization and growth led to creation of a public-private National Commission for Export and Investment (CONAEXI) to implement the strategy.  However, no agreement was reached on the structure of the Commission and USAID funds for its operation were transferred to FUSADES.  In sum, in light of the political and economic environment in which the project operated, the public sector component achieved considerable success, principally, three new laws (the Export Promotion Law and its six implementing regulations, the Foreign Investment Guarantee Law, and the Free Zones and Bonded Warehouses Law) that did away with protectionism, made free trade zones legal and privatized, and opened the financial sector to new forms of investment and credit. GOES' policies toward foreign direct investment have become more positive. Lessons learned are as follows.  (1) USAID project managers should have their primary offices in their counterpart NGO or PVO in order to ensure their control, knowledge, and ability to stay in touch with their tasks.  (2) A country's suitability for a project should be carefully assessed in advance.  A pre-project survey might have shown that El Salvador was better suited to industrial projects than nontraditional agricultural projects.  (3) Linking release of Economic Support Fund (ESF) dollars to internal policy change is rarely effective unless the host government is convinced that such change is needed.  Otherwise, empty promises will be made in order to secure release of the assistance.  Building internal analytical capacity and educating the populace about the benefits of proposed changes, while time consuming, is the most effective way to ensure that policy change will be forthcoming and that assistance will make a lasting impact.  (4) In the interest of sustainability, USAID should phase out its assistance gradually and help the client secure alternative funding sources.  In 1995, USAID, previously the major funder of DEES, cut off all funds to that entity.  (5) USAID should consider an endowment for FUSADES, a move for which precedent exists.  Total dependency on USAID funding by any institution is dangerous.  FUSADES is now in jeopardy because of this circumstance and is gambling on the success of one project, La Colina, in order to survive.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1996 12:00:00 AM","","Economic recovery|Export promotion|Investment promotion|Trade liberalization|Industrial productivity|Nontraditional agricultural exports|Public sector|Private sector|Indigenous private voluntary organizations","El Salvador","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABN540.pdf","585 KB","008540 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (7/92-3/95) to provide TA to Salvadoran private industries.  The International Executive Service Corps (IESC) implemented the project. Although a 6/93 amendment freed IESC from assisting clients connected to the Salvadoran Industrial Association (ASI)'s Industrial Reconversion Program, originally the project's main beneficiaries, the project was terminated 3 months before the extended PACD due to poor performance. Assistance (in the areas of production, information systems, and administrative and financial controls) had been provided to only 22 of 40 planned companies.  Results of these efforts included: 233 new jobs in 12 companies; 10%-20% increased productivity in 13 companies; and partial achievement of technology transfer in 22 companies.  No business closures were avoided as a result of the project. One of the causes of the project's poor performance was the inability of IESC and ASI to work together.  ASI took too long to carry out the diagnoses on which IESC TA was to be based.  During the first year of IESC project implementation, ASI did not request assistance from them. In many cases in which the client firm needed to restructure or resolve problems related to its administrative and accounting systems, ASI provided the TA itself without any involvement from IESC. The project's problems were compounded by the high cost of IESC's services, which was not competitive with similar, but lower-cost services being provided by other international organizations and higher than what many companies were willing to pay.  As a result, many ASI clients requested TA to solve only their major problems and did not carry out a complete reconversion program, and some even contracted other international organizations at a lower cost.  This uncompetitive cost structure continued to hinder IESC even after it was freed from the commitment to work exclusively with ASI clients. Lessons learned are as follows.  (1) Project design did not consider competition from other international organizations providing the same services as IESC, but at lower cost.  The design also did not take into account the client companies' ability and willingness to pay for such services.  (2) Project accomplishments showed that, given the type and cost of TA, the project was more suited to medium and large firms.  Of the 22 enterprises that received assistance, 65% were large firms. Additionally, the impact on productive employment generation was low. (3) The lack of a promotional program was reflected in the low accomplishment of the project.  In spite of a project amendment to free IESC from the restriction of carrying out 30 projects with ASI only, IESC was unable to service many other local industries organizations because it did not sufficiently promote its services.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1996 12:00:00 AM","","Business support services|Private enterprises|Business enterprises|Industrial facilities|Costs|Private voluntary organizations","El Salvador","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABN541.pdf","506 KB","008540 - USAID.

"Final impact evaluation of a project (2-7/96) to distribute seed rice and farm hand tools in select districts in Bong and Nimba counties, Liberia, that have been devastated by civil conflict.  The project was implemented by Lutheran World Relief. Farmers, who comprise about 85% of the people in Bong and Nimba counties, are enthusiastic about the seeds and tools distribution program, which, despite various constraints, has proven to be a good undertaking. The project benefitted more than 17,000 farm families (vs. a target of 10,000), each of which received 24 kg of seed rice and 25 kg of bulgur wheat.  A total of 29,631 pieces of farm tools, which include cutlasses, scratching and regular hoes, shovels, axes, files, and buckets, were sold at subsidized prices for an amount equal to over US$21,000.  This money is being used for communities development projects, such as the building of bridges, latrines, and wells, and the renovation of a school.  The project also distributed, on a payback scheme, 2.25 metric tons of foundation seed among 36 farming groups for planting on 60 acres in upland or swampland areas.","Attached to PD-ABN-544|Title supplied by cataloger","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","11/1/1996 12:00:00 AM","","Disaster relief|Agricultural inputs|Seeds|Agricultural hand implements|Distribution|Development projects|Community facilities","Liberia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDABN544A.pdf","1,103 KB","","","007747 - USAID.

"Evaluates the Regional Trade Analytical Agenda (RTAA), a component of the Equity and Growth through Economic Research (EAGER) project in sub-Saharan Africa.  The project is being implemented through cooperative agreements with Technoserve and University of Swaziland's Center for Applied Research and Policy Analysis (CARPA), which was established especially for this project.  Mid-term evaluation covers the period 1993-11/96. The RTAA is an extremely promising activity, mainly because of flexible design, its reliance on African input, and the excellent performance of its two implementing agencies.  It represents an innovative approach to USAID's entire applied research and policy analysis process.  Its research agenda was established via a lengthy process of soliciting information priorities regarding intra-African trade in eastern and southern Africa, and it relies heavily on involving African researchers, technical support personnel, and policy makers in research design, execution, and dissemination, making good use of study definition/planning workshops which create local ownership of the results and reflect Africa's oral culture.  Though risky (since it may lead to conclusions unacceptable to USAID), the emphasis on local participation probably reduces local resistance to unpopular findings on controversial issues (as compared to conventional studies done by expatriates).  It also provides African researchers with opportunities for contract work in the region and thus counteracts brain drain. USAID's choice of a cooperative agreement rather than a contract as the implementation mechanism was a wise one. Cooperative agreements promote flexibility and are ideally suited for developing local capacity.  Both Technoserve and CARPA have performed well in virtually all regards, while USAID's management assistance has also been skillful. Through their RTAA work, African firms and institutions (e.g., The Management Center and the University of Malawi's Agricultural Policy Research Unit) are developing a commercially viable analytical and policy lobbying capacity.  Participation in the studies by African policy makers and technical advisors is also significant, with the more recent studies typically being guided by country technical/coordinating teams comprised almost entirely of Africans. RTAA supports REDSO's strategic objectives (SOs) 2 and 3 by providing regional trade studies and analyses; it also addresses SOs 1 and 3 of the Greater Horn Of Africa Initiative (GHAI) and SOs 2-4 of the Initiative for Southern Africa (ISA). Results indicators may be hard to come by right now, however, for RTAA puts more emphasis on process than outcome.  There are two dimensions in which it clearly excels:  who does the study, and how is he/she/it connected to the policy environment RTAA is trying to change.  As the studies' findings get discussed and digested, however, policy changes will become visible and it will become feasible for RTAA to establish quantitative targets such as savings in transport costs or savings from more efficient trade. The study entitled Comparative Costs of Transportation in East Africa has been well-received by governments and regional bodies such as the East African Co-operation.  The comparative cost studies, and the structural adjustment analysis for Southern Africa also appear to have been well-received by the regional governments.  Some of the findings have been incorporated into the 8/96 Free Trade Protocol signed by all Southern Africa Development Community (SADC) countries, except Angola. To make RTAA's flexibility more rigid, and perhaps more controllable by USAID, would probably harm the project, which should continue essentially unchanged until the PACD.  It should be noted, however, that the tremendous leadership the project has enjoyed will limit its replicability:  it is not easy to find Americans who can do this kind of work successfully.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","AEP-0085-I-00-6016-00","","11/1/1996 12:00:00 AM","","Regional trade|Economic research|Applied research|Policy analysis|Personnel development|Institution building|Strategic planning","Southern Africa|East Africa","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABN547.pdf","126 KB","005072 - Tropical Research and Development, Inc.","","000026 - USAID.

"This review of 13 applied research projects implemented by Wellstart International under its Expanded Promotion of Breastfeeding (EPB) Program between 1993 to 1996 in Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Uganda, Barbados, Chile, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Peru, and the Philippines, yielded 7 recommendations for those involved in breastfeeding promotion programming in developing countries.  (1) Focus on the first week and month postpartum; if women exclusively or fully breastfed beyond this critical period, they are likely to continue.  (2) Focus on specific messages that target key behaviors.  General messages such as  breast is best' are less effective than messages that target key behaviors that impede optimal infant feeding, such as use of medicinal water and sugar and salt solutions in response to infant crying or stomach discomforts, the use of water to prevent dehydration, or the early introduction of complementary foods to get infants accustomed to it.  (3) Focus on families and communities.  In all the countries and settings where research was conducted, exclusive breastfeeding is not a cultural norm. Thus -- to varying degrees -- social support, social networks, and the health system are negative influences that must be countered.  (4) Focus on low birthweight (LBW) infants.  LBW is a significant risk factor for not breastfeeding.  (5) Focus on employed women.  Although the effect of maternal employment on breastfeeding has been mixed, the effect on exclusive breastfeeding has been consistently negative.  (6) Focus on women's nutrition.  Nutrition is a concern to breastfeeding women; exclusive breastfeeding is believed to be harmful to maternal nutrition. (7) Focus on integrating breastfeeding promotion into existing health systems. Health systems are in a unique position to take advantage of frequent contacts with women with young infants.","Project title: MotherCare","Special Evaluation","Documents","DPE-5966-A-00-1045-00","","1/1/1996 12:00:00 AM","","Breastfeeding|Infant nutrition|Applied research|Postnatal nutrition|Maternal nutrition|Health care planning|Exclusive breastfeeding","Kenya|Lesotho|Malawi|Uganda|Barbados|Chile|Guatemala|Honduras|Mexico|Peru|Philippines","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNABZ587.pdf","3,196 KB","008242 - Wellstart International","","008291 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to use environmental education and communication methods to advance sound environmental objectives in host country institutions (GreenCOM project).  The evaluation covers the period 9/93-12/96. Missions and other USAID offices are for the most part enthusiastic about GreenCOM performance.  GreenCOM thinks it has plowed new ground in social marketing by applying it to an area vastly more complex and varied than in previous applications by its parent contractor, the Academy for Educational Development (AED).  One important difference between GreenCOM and AED's earlier communications efforts is that community participation is significantly more important.  The senior staff seem agreed that a clear GreenCOM ""mindset"" has not yet emerged, but most would agree that ""listening to people,"" participation, and an emphasis on gender are important pillars for whatever may emerge. The information exchange part of GreenCOM appears to be functioning as intended.  However, there is widespread frustration among GreenCOM technical staff over lack of time for preparation of synthesis products. The Office of Women Development (WID) contributed to GreenCOM's funding.  The objective was to see that WID issues were integrated into GreenCOM activities.  GreenCOM has been very conscientious about doing that. Although the contract calls for six evaluations in the first five years, only one (in Jordan) has been done.  The problem is persuading USAID Missions to include an evaluation when designing a GreenCOM buy-in.  Research is dependent on funds from buy-ins for all its activities. GreenCOM staff give high marks to their USAID project managers for their understanding of development, environment, and social marketing, for their support, and for dealing with them as professional colleagues. At the same time, the staff feel the need for more core technical support in terms of oversight on the direction, strategy, and approaches being implemented. GreenCOM staff have cited the following lessons learned. (1) There is resistance to research among some Missions who see it as overly time-consuming and academic.  GreenCOM needs resources for research to test models or strategies across countries to get lessons learned.  (2) GreenCOM is moving toward a less quantitative formative research model in response to changing program needs, low funding, and time constraints. However, there isn't always a full understanding in Missions of the importance of formative research to design a program. (3) Sometimes there is funding to conduct formative research, but no follow-up funding is available to implement activities that are identified. This is true in Ecuador (recycling program) and Morocco (improving solid waste collections in poor neighborhoods).  To avoid the problem of having raised expectations, some form of follow-up implementation activities should be mobilized.  (4) Including persons responsible for field implementation in the design process has proved to be a successful initiative. The sense of ownership among national clients needs to be cultivated. The workshop recently conducted in Morocco is an example of a strategy to get people to ""buy in"" to the program through a participatory workshop.  (5) Taking gender considerations seriously has enhanced results.  This was true in Egypt as well as in the Philippines and Jordan.  However GreenCOM has not stressed this lesson when following up with Governments.  GreenCOM has also learned that integration of gender concerns, rather than separate WID activities with separate WID specialists, works better.  (6) Technical staff are recognizing the need to marry environmental considerations with development realities.  A strength of the project is its ability to view its mandate as supporting sustainable use.  Its goal is to be very practical in its approach.  This has two important ramifications. First, GreenCOM staff and consultants need to be very familiar with the breadth of development issues.  Unlike health, environmental communication is heavily impacted by other sectors and GreenCOM consultants need to be able to point this out, even to USAID personnel.  For example, in Mali and Madagascar Missions have stressed school-based environmental education.  But a review of country development indicators suggests that funds would be better put into addressing out-of-school youth since the majority of school-aged youths do not attend school.  And those in school are already the recipients of environmental information. Similarly, technical staff have noted that although urbanization, even in Africa, is increasing at an enormous pace, the environmental education models that GreenCOM is asked to implement respond to natural resource issues not urban environments. USAID staff need to be aware that environmental education can support a wider range of activities than it is currently being asked to.  (7) Missions have to be explicitly told what they can expect in terms of support to avoid creating false hopes.  For example, in El Salvador they had great expectations but felt they got nothing.  In fact, the Mission refused offers of research.  (8)  When the initial visit is made to a Mission and potential staff are identified, it is critical that we determine whether the Mission will deem the salary of local hire individuals acceptable.  In a number of situations, appropriate local hire staff have been identified during the initial visit, only to have them rejected by the Mission contracts officer.","Project title: Environmental education and communication (GreenCOM)","Special Evaluation","Documents","PCE-5839-C-00-3068-00|PCE-5839-Q-00-3069-00","","12/1/1996 12:00:00 AM","","Environmental education|Communication|IEC|Communications research|Development administration|Women in development|Community participation|Social marketing|Development project evaluation","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABN561.pdf","42 KB","","","008355 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to strengthen the capacity of indigenous NGOs in Central Asia to participate in the political and economic life of their countries.  Evaluation covers the period 9/94-12/96 against a PACD of 6/97.  The project is being implemented by a PVO consortium which is headed by Counterpart Foundation, Inc., and includes three partners: Aid to Artisans (ATA), Citizens Network for Foreign Affairs (CNFA), and Goodwill Industries. The project is on track.  It is well-managed, and its design represents an efficient, cost-effective use of personnel. Project offices are operating in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Uzbekistan, and another recently opened in Tajikistan.  The project has provided training and TA to 1,271 NGOs (more than targeted), including 200 that have also received a seed and/or partnership grant.  It has successfully built upon the successes and lessons learned of USAID and other programs in the NIS. Goodwill Industries has founded its own NGO (Goodwill Initsiativa) in Uzbekistan. The Consortium has not targeted a defined clientele, but has provided an open invitation to participate in its programs.  The training program is providing relevant and focused modules in four areas:  NGOs and community, strategic planning, NGO management and project design, and NGOs and the media.  The training of trainers program, which has made good use of Russian trainers, has been effective. The project has been flexible in supporting about 15 different sectors through its partnership and seed grants.  The partnership grants (15) are probably the most important in establishing a sustainable link with a U.S. organization, while the seed grants (163) serve a vital role in establishing an NGO on a firm footing. The project's regional nature has stretched the human resources at times.  The seven expatriate staff are often traveling, but that hasn't negatively affected their performance.  With email now installed in all countries, communication has improved greatly. The circuit rider aspect of the job may have prevented ATA and CNFA from providing equal effort in all the countries.  There is a strong need for additional staff for ATA to adequately support its 9 NGO partners and to expand into Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.  The same is true for CNFA if it is to expand into Tajikistan. Joint programming and the formation of partnerships has been ongoing with other U.S. grantees/institutions and international groups such as UNDP, UNHCR, UNICEF, EU-TACIS, the World Bank, INTRAC and World Learning.  In Kyrgyzstan, leveraging other donor resources (the World Bank, UNHCR and HELVETAS) has enabled Counterpart to establish satellite offices in the more remote rural areas of Naryn, Kara-Balta, and in Jalal-Abad. In addition, EU-TACIS funding has enabled Counterpart to establish a NGO Resource Center in Bishkek with a satellite center in Osh in partnership with a local NGO support organization (Interbilim) and two European partners (Christian Aid and Dutch InterChurch Aid). The Counterpart Country Director also sits on the USIS-managed Democracy Commission which oversees a grant program for local NGOs and others promoting civil society.  In Tajikistan, Counterpart has partnered with Save the Children to provide NGO training as well as to share operational expenses. In most countries, NGO legislation is waiting to be acted upon by the various governments.  This project is fostering the ""bottom-up"" approach, with NGO membership being a critical factor in gaining political influence in order to promote policies benefiting NGOs. Counterpart is supporting the Working Group on Legal Reform in Uzbekistan, the Forum of NGOs in Kyrgyzstan, and consumer rights and human rights organizations in all targeted countries.  As an outgrowth of the 1995 regional conference on NGOs and the law, NGO coalitions have formed in Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Kazakhstan to work on legal reform and promotion of the NGO sector. Timing is important.  The program has been operational less than 2 years and in Tajikistan began only this year.  Training and a support system of TA in more specialized areas will be needed during the next stage. Lessons learned are as follows.  (1) To have maximum benefit, participatory evaluations (such as this) should be implemented midway through a project.  This project only has about 7 months remaining, and the staff are concerned about what comes next.  (2) Personnel and financial management require professional management from within the country and from the partners' home offices.  This project had a different staff than originally proposed, and yet worked as a team of dedicated and professional members due to the transparent management style of all consortium members. The central control from Almaty of all bank transfers has proved effective in financial control.  (3) Having an agreed upon monitoring and evaluation plan from the outset is key in successfully implementing a consortium-type project.  The entire consortium team knows its responsibilities within the program.   (4) Operating in the same local bank as the donor agency does not mean that your assets are secure.  Trust your own sources for determining when to move funds from the bank to a safer place.  The bigger the safe doesn't always mean your money is safer.  (5) Use of Peace Corps volunteers and internships is an expeditious way of leveraging the long-term use of expatriate staff who are familiar with both the culture and the environment.","Delivery order no. 3|Project no. listed in document as 115-0001","Special Evaluation","Documents","AEP-5468-I-00-6012-00|110-0007-A-00-4020-00","","12/1/1996 12:00:00 AM","","Institution building|Private voluntary organizations|Indigenous private voluntary organizations|Civil society","New Independent States|Kazakhstan|Kyrgyzstan|Tajikistan|Turkmenistan|Uzbekistan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABN627.pdf","892 KB","003970 - Management Systems International, Inc.

"Final evaluation of the citizen participation component of a project (6/93-7-96) to strengthen the democratic and electoral process in El Salvador (CIVICA project).  The project was implemented by Creative Associates International, Inc. (CREA). Overall, the majority of CIVICA's pilot activities successfully met their objectives, and most have been sustained, even after project support ended. Perhaps even more important are the unintended results achieved, mainly the collaborative working relationship that has developed between eight Salvadoran NGOs from different parts of the political/ideological spectrum -- something that would have seemed impossible a few years ago.  By virtue of the confidence garnered by CREA staff and the method applied for joint NGO activities, those organizations have learned to reach consensus on subject matter, activity sites and dates, the materials used, and related issues.  This, in turn, has encouraged those organizations which, responding to an evolving environment, have decided to opt for autonomy and independence from political parties -- which in some cases has cost them dearly in terms of material support. In short, had the future been known when this project began, longer-term planning could have produced even more effective and efficient results.  Meanwhile, the importance of the results achieved, intended and unintended, should not be underestimated. The contractor has accumulated an abundance of information on subprojects and the organizations that implemented them.  It is estimated that over 8,000 Salvadorans in some 75 municipalities and nearly 200 communities in all 14 Departments were reached directly by this project.  Though overall data are not sex-disaggregated (despite the fact that women were one of the target populations), such information could probably be reconstructed fairly easily by those involved. Judging by the number of participants in activities aimed specifically at women, plus other project data, it is estimated that females were probably 30-45% of those reached.  Given that some pilots involved communal radio or other media at one time or another, it is not possible to estimate the total number of citizens reached indirectly by the project. Phase II activities, on which this evaluation focuses, were implemented between 4/94 and 7/96, in four rounds.  (1) During Round One, CREA invited some 100 NGOs to submit proposals for civic education projects.  Though the application form was simple, CREA had to provide individualized TA to develop proposals that USAID could approve, despite the fact that institutional strengthening was excluded from the contract.  This process resulted in the approval of 7 projects carried out by 17 NGOs, some of which worked in groups.  A number of these activities, particularly those targeting women, are being institutionalized.  (2) During Round Two, CREA introduced the deliberative forum method for citizen participation created in the United States by the Kettering Foundation.  The 7 NGOs selected to work on this project, Youth for Democracy, were given training in the Kettering method, along with follow-on TA.  The project addressed poverty, violence, and the Peace Accords.  The implementing NGOs have incorporated this deliberative method into other projects.  (3) During Round Three, changes were made to adapt the Kettering approach to El Salvador's education and cultural realities so that it would stimulate greater participation in the deliberative process.  Beginning in Round Three, a conscious attempt was made to involve local government officials in project activities.  While results were mixed, many mayors and town council members did participate and support local and departmental forums.  (4) Round Four was dedicated to the issue of citizens safety, which many showed interest in during Round Three. Fifteen Departmental forums were held on citizens safety; these yielded a synthesis of causes and solutions to citizens safety issues, which will be presented to the GOES and to the media. The project suffered from some shortcomings. (1) Because of its experimental nature, the project's greatest weakness has been its short-term focus and lack of follow on support for successful pilot activities, as well as the absence of overall strategic direction in the post-election phase.  (2) Delays and false starts were occasioned by the requirement that the Office of Democratic Initiatives (ODI) pre-approve all activities and written materials to be used by implementors.  While USAID felt that this was a necessary requirement, given the sensitive nature of the subject, the Mission underestimated the management burden this would cause, and was therefore ill-prepared to provide timely responses.  (3) The project missed opportunities to involve more NGOs in the Kettering training; recruit a greater variety of implementors in Round Two and beyond; and employ additional methodologies in those Rounds, even as control mechanisms to measure the comparative effectiveness of Kettering.  (4) CIVICA and USAID's Municipal Development and Citizen Participation (MDCP) project (whose participation component is also carried out by CREA), showed virtually no coordination, reducing the Mission's ability to capitalize on those investments by leveraging activities and results.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","519-0394-C-00-6075-00","","7/1/1996 12:00:00 AM","","Democratization|Pilot projects|Political participation|Electoral systems|Local groups|Civic action|Voting|Elections|Women|Rural populations|Youth|Civic education","El Salvador","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABN686.pdf","4,273 KB","003970 - Management Systems International, Inc.

"Final report by the Government of Egypt's Ministry of Health and Population (MOPH) on the USAID-funded Child Survival Project (CSP) (1985-8/96).  The report, which documents the project's accomplishments, activities, and lessons learned, is based, in part, on the final project evaluation (PD-ABN-167). The CSP has been a very successful project and has achieved most of its objectives.  The Expanded Program of Immunization (EPI) component is the most successful of the three components; it has attained almost all of its objectives, as follows.  (1) A total of 79% of health districts are polio free, with only 71 cases found in 1995 (down from 550 in 1988).  If current strategies, including National Immunization Days and Polio Mop-up campaigns are sustained and a sensitive surveillance system, capable of detecting all acute flaccid paralysis cases continues to improve, Egypt should attain its ""zero confirmed cases of polio"" objective by 1997.  (2) Vaccination coverage has been maintained at more than 80% since 1988.  At least 83% of 231 health districts have achieved 80% coverage.  The 1995 Egypt Demographic and Health Survey noted 79% fully immunized coverage (excluding Hepatitis B3).  (3) An 89% reduction has been achieved in neonatal tetanus since 1986.  A total of 76% of districts have <1 reported case per 1000 live births. A highlight of the EPI program, and of the development of Egypt's support for it, is the Government of Egypt's (GOE) assumption of financial support for the program.  In 1992, the GOE had zero funding for the imported EPI vaccines (polio, DPT, measles and part of BCG). However, as the CSP ends, the GOE is picking up total support: vaccine costs alone in 1996/1997 are $28 million, to be borne by the GOE. A national Acute Respiratory Infection (ARI) control program based on standard case management (SCM) has been impressively established in all the 27 governorates: it is one of the first such programs in the world. CSP estimates access to SCM for ARI to be 87%. CSP achieved this success through skillfully handling all the complexities of creating the required support components -- planning, manpower development, equipment, supply line, information system, research and information, education and communication (IEC). The child survival/maternal child health (CS/MCH) component conducted varied and often innovative activities, in association with different MOHP departments and with varying levels of success.  These included an important Maternal Mortality Study in 1992, the development of 100 neonatal care centers, daya (traditional birth attendant) training and linkage with MOHP health centers, and upgrading of delivery rooms and laboratories. This report also concludes that the CSP has: (1) laid the framework for a national decentralized computerized health information system (HIS), and supplied hardware, developed software, and provided some training in its use; (2) developed training curriculum for decentralized health planning and management; (3) developed a clinic improvement program, known as Model Clinics, which was pilot tested in 15 clinics to provide service, operational, and supervisory standards; (4) developed a mass media program, including more than 24 T.V. spots on priority MCH topics; (5) initiated the revision of sections of the physicians and nurses curricula that deal with child and maternal health; (6) established a Field Epidemiology Training Program and Unit to supply trained epidemiologists to the MOHP (trainees have already conducted a number of studies, and significant progress has been made in institutionalizing the program); (7) focused efforts during the final 2 years of the project on strengthening training and mass media/health education, with good results; and (8) institutionalized the three project components (EPI, ARI, and CS/MCH) and initiated efforts to achieve sustainability of other aspects of the project through decentralization and integration.

"PACR of a project (8/89-12/94) to expand and strengthen the training programs of the Centre for African Family Studies (CAFS), which was established in 1975 to address the need for training of family planning personnel in sub-Saharan Africa (CAFS II project). CAFS made considerable progress toward the project goal of strengthening its training capacity.  It developed new and updated old courses (including development of trainer and participant manuals and supplementary training materials); expanded its reach into francophone Africa (by the PACD, 34 of CAFS' 79 courses were presented in this region, vs. 9 of 57 during the period 1981-89); trained 1,077 family planning professionals in anglophone and francophone regions; initiated an evaluation system to determine the impact of its training programs; and upgraded its course fee structure to cover 50% of the direct costs of training. While progress was made in CAFS' organizational development, and in prospects for its continued institutional viability, the pace was slower than envisioned.  As a result, a follow-on project, CAFS-III, has been designed to assist in attainment of these institutional goals. The following lessons have been learned.  (1) Indigenous family planning professionals are increasingly demanding better quality services that meet their training needs in rapidly changing management and service provision environments.  CAFS needs to be more responsive to customer needs and more competitive.  (2) CAFS, historically staffed by training professionals, did not have the managerial expertise or systems needed to sustain institutional improvements.  (3) If true sustainability lies in indigenous peoples addressing their own needs, organizations such as CAFS must be seen as legitimate partners and able to compete directly for USAID and other donor funding.","Contract no. listed erroneously on document as 623-0004-a-00-942-00","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","623-0004-A-00-9042-00","","1/1/1996 12:00:00 AM","","Training centers|Institution building|Health professionals|Family planning services|Family planning education","Africa south of Sahara|French speaking Africa|English speaking Africa","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABN755.pdf","39 KB","000026 - USAID.

"This report evaluates the impact of U.S. food assistance provided Ghana since the early 1960s.  Section I discusses the social context for food aid in the country, with consideration for agricultural production and nutritional security.  It also examines the social impact of various food aid programs:  Title I/II (pre-1991 Title III), Title II (covering assistance provided by the Catholic Relief Service Program, the Adventist Development and Relief Association, the MCH feeding and Food-for-Work Title II programs, and Title II NGO programs), and (post-1991) Title III, covering feeder roads and NGO projects (including those of TechnoServe, Aid to Artisans Ghana, and the Center for Policy Analysis).  Section II explores food aid and equity in Ghana, touching on the distribution of poverty and the individual contributions of the Title I, Title II, and Title III programs.  Section III examines the direct, indirect, and enabling effects of food aid on political stability, while Sections IV through VI, respectively, outline the evaluation methodology, provide figures and data on food aid, and examine the efficiency of USAID food aid to Ghana.  In general, the short-lived Title I program was not a reliable and continuing development resource for Ghana.  Title I/II was a second-best resource, next to cash transfers, for both product selection and ease of local currency generation.  Because food aid comes from a budget category separate and additive to regular USAID assistance, U.S. was able to provide Ghana with substantial additional assistance that would not have been available otherwise.  Title I generally provided Ghana with appropriate commodities.  The one exception was vegetable oil, which the United States wanted to unload and which Ghana agreed to accept even though it meets most needs in this area from domestic production and imports from other countries.  Finally, the United States faced significant logistical problems moving the commodities within Ghana due to infrastructural adequacies. However, USAID was able to use its policy leverage to bring about the replacement of public food import and distribution systems with private ones.

"Evaluates project to strengthen the efforts of NGOs and government organizations to assist youth aged 8-17 in three cities in northeastern Brazil (Salvador, Recife, and Fortaleza) who are involved in, or at risk of, delinquency, substance abuse, prostitution or sexual exploitation, and human rights violations (POMMAR project).  Interim evaluation covers the period 9/94-11/96.  Partners of the Americas is implementing the project. Implementation has suffered from a serious lack of systematic selection criteria for subgrants and a lack of indicators for monitoring performance.  This, together with delays in awarding the first subgrants, has made it nearly impossible to demonstrate a concrete impact on the lives of children and adolescent beneficiaries.  Partners of the Americas was very slow in acknowledging the project's serious implementation problems and in replacing the project director and modifying the project's administrative structure.  USAID/Brazil was forced to assume a much more active role in project management than normal, but had to do so if the project was to continue. Despite these problems, POMMAR's distinctive characteristics -- its focus on institutional strengthening and in coalition building -- are giving it a greater impact than its limited funds would imply.  POMMAR has also collaborated effectively with other entities, and NGOs and governmental organizations alike have repeatedly cited POMMAR's importance in uniting diverse entities in a more coordinated approach to the complex problems of at-risk children and adolescents.  In addition, subgrant recipients, even those receiving only a very small part of their budget from POMMAR, repeatedly cited the supported interventions as strategically important for their institutions. The four original programmatic areas remain appropriate.  Health activities, the only significant addition proposed in the 9/96 extension, are a welcome addition and should, where possible, include family planning, AIDS prevention, and access to services.  Since health activities should be held to the same standards of impact and sustainability as other activities, it would be unwise to pay salaries directly with project funds.  Instead, the team recommends stimulating collaboration between subgrant recipients and existing health programs. Vocational training projects have the greatest potential to demonstrate direct impact and sustainability.  Yet almost no systematic efforts have been made in the area of job placement (on-the-job training) and collaboration with the private sector.  POMMAR should consider taking advantage of the local Partners network, as well as service organizations such as Rotary and Lions Clubs, to stimulate these activities. Family preservation has been a problematic area. Although POMMAR has been instrumental in placing family issues on the national agenda, it has not funded successful projects in this area.  Future efforts should support existing projects that incorporate work with families for the benefit of children and adolescents, but POMMAR should continue its policy of not supporting projects aimed at individual family therapy. Projects for street girls face especially complex challenges.  POMMAR has played a key role in stimulating national debate on sexual exploitation, abuse, and violence and has supported important projects in these areas.  Many preventive projects for at-risk girls are in operation, several with POMMAR support, and are demonstrating effectiveness.  The issues surrounding girls involved in prostitution are more difficult, and successful projects are rare.  POMMAR should focus on supporting projects for these girls, even at a relatively high cost. Projects aimed at affecting public policy face the greatest difficulties in demonstrating direct impact. Nonetheless, POMMAR has been instrumental in getting more than 1,000 out-of-school children into public school.  POMMAR should expand its roles in representing and disseminating the lessons learned from these projects.  POMMAR's decision to avoid defending individual juvenile offenders was wise; this responsibility is best left to the public sector.  POMMAR should instead seek out projects in which adolescents participate as advocates for their own rights.  Also, projects with broad community support and consensus, such as the right to public school, are more likely to achieve earlier results than those concentrating on more complex issues, such as adoption.","Project no. listed on cover as 936-6004.69","Special Evaluation","Documents","HRN-6004-C-00-5004-00","","11/1/1996 12:00:00 AM","","Child welfare services|Beneficiary targeting|Disadvantaged groups|Youth|Public sector|Indigenous private voluntary organizations|Women|Social impact|Street children|Girls|At-risk groups","Brazil","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABN853.pdf","153 KB","003366 - TvT Associates","","008291 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to provide community-based interventions to protect and empower children and adolescents affected by AIDS in three peri-urban communities (Mangochi Boma, Namwera, and Monkey Bay) in Mangochi District, Malawi (COPE program).  The project is being implemented by Save the Children Federation.  The evaluation covers the period 4/95-10/96, against a PACR of 4/97. COPE, which is planning to expand beyond the initial target area in Mangochi town to Namwera, has an elaborate management information system for measuring needs and assessing impact and is on track for achieving numerical targets for most key objectives.  The project, operated by a highly dedicated staff, is seen positively by the majority of community members and leaders, and government and nongovernmental personnel. However, COPE's multiple interventions appear to be too expensive to implement at scale: cost per beneficiary (a total of 4,154 household members, 58% of them children) is $162. To increase household income, COPE is operating a microenterprise credit scheme using village-bank methodology called Group-Guaranteed Lending and Savings (GGLS) for groups of 15-20 women, and is also supporting gardening on wetland (dimba) plots.  As of 9/96, 343 individuals had participated in GGLS (292) or gardening (51); the target is 500.  It is not clear whether these interventions, which have reached 36% of targeted households, have made sustainable improvements in the households' economic situation.  While participants said the programs had enabled them to buy better quality food, the interventions may not be reaching (and may not be possible for) the most vulnerable households, whose labor capacities are extremely limited.  Community support may be the best hope for aiding such households.  However, in comparison to other NGO credit programs in Malawi, GGLS appears to be reaching the deepest into the survival economy. COPE's primary health intervention has been to train caregivers and community volunteers to treat common ailments and make patients as comfortable as possible.  Home-based care training appears to be having a very positive impact, including indirect benefits for children.  As of 9/96, 201 household caregivers had been trained in home-based care; the target of 500 will not likely be reached by the end of the current program.  COPE has also trained 257 others (e.g., religious leaders, community volunteers) in home-based care and 15 as home-based care trainers.  Care of at-home patients has been measurably improved in 95 households against a target of 100.  Thirty-nine children had been referred to under-five clinics and 45 to the hospital. To promote psychosocial well-being, COPE has secured matching donations for secondary school expenses of adolescents for primary-target families and has supported structured recreation, as well as drama groups and skills training linked with other nonformal education.  Skills training has been the slowest to get off the ground. Scholarships have been provided to 94 of a targeted 100 secondary school students, the most tangible benefit of the program's psychosocial activities. In the area of advocacy and training, COPE has helped develop the government's ""Orphan Care Program: 1996-98"", helped orient the National Task on Orphans toward community-based action, and sensitized businessmen and parliament members to needs of the community, including scholarships.  An intern has begun advising other Malawi organizations how to protect the inheritance rights of widows and orphans.  COPE has also secured cash or in-kind contributions from 9 of a targeted 20 private-sector institutions and individuals; trained 123 of a targeted 200 government service providers and policymakers, NGO staff, and community members in children's psychosocial development; and secured admission to government schools for 14 COPE students. Given expected substantial increases in the number of AIDS-affected children and families over the next several years, COPE should focus more on catalyzing community-based groups with a commitment to serve the most vulnerable children and families; currently, COPE is dependent on the short-term involvement of the program's 11 paid field workers. The following are lessons learned.  (1) In Namwera, it will be important to work more with existing structures, institutions, and organizations. (2) The program must seek to engender community ownership in interventions.  (3) Planning for community involvement must begin at the outset.  One important step is encouraging communities to identify their problems and ways to address them.  (4) In planning interventions, it is important to pay attention to the seasons when people have more time available for new activities (March-August in Mangochi). (5) Modeling behavior can help change behavior.  Concrete actions can be models and catalysts.  (6) GGLS has worked to meet the needs of some categories of COPE families.  (7) Home-based care has been welcomed in the communities where training has been done and has had a substantial multiplier effect. (8) Approaches are needed that can be taken to scale. Program interventions should not only address the needs of the immediate community, but also consider the overall scope of the problems in the country.  (9) Calculating and monitoring cost-per-beneficiary figures for different interventions can be an important management tool. Budgeting, accounting, and other information systems need to be designed to facilitate calculation of such figures.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","HRN-6004-C-00-5004-00","","10/1/1996 12:00:00 AM","","HIV/AIDS|Disease prevention and control|Community health care|Child health care|Family health care","Malawi","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABN855.pdf","141 KB","003366 - TvT Associates","","008291 - USAID.

PATH remodeled facilities, procured and installed equipment for production, trained LAPROMED staff to secure high quality of production, implemented standard operating procedures, developed a manual for ORS quality control, developed a quality audit protocol, and established a mechanism to develop annual action plans.  Currently, LAPROMED's production facilities could compete, in terms of ORS production, with any national or international laboratory.  To date, LAPROMED has produced a total of 2,093,567 ORS packets and sold 1,981,518 of them, earning Ql,509,189.60. On the down side, promotion and distribution of ORS at the community level is still low.  The MOH distributed 67,300 packets to the health areas in 1995, but only 77,000 as of 4/30/1996, and some 30,000 packets remain in the DGSS's warehouse.  Distribution and marketing of ORS is currently one of LAPROMED's major problems.  The MOH's decentralization of its procurement mechanisms has overly complicated the ORS procurement process, with responsibility now in the hands of 27 health areas instead of one central office. During the first 10 months of 1996, the health areas have not shown any interest in buying from LAPROMED.  Instead, it seems that health area chiefs are buying from other vendors at higher prices.  This is due to three problems.  First, LAPROMED lacks the facilities to transport the product to each of the 27 areas.  Second, LAPROMED is not registered as a qualified provider with the Ministry of Finance (MOF), because LAPROMED is part of San Carlos University and is not an owner -- the first condition for obtaining MOF approval to become a provider to the public sector.  Third, the MOH is not honoring its agreement with LAPROMED to buy 80% of LAPROMED's production.  LAPROMED will require TA to develop its marketing and negotiation skills and find other potential clients to ensure project sustainability. In an effort to expand its client base, LAPROMED is selling ORS to the Guatemalan Social Security Institute (IGSS), which has become LAPROMED's most important client.  However, this is not enough to allow LAPROMED to reach its break even point and thus secure its sustainability.  LAPROMED will continue producing ORS for ADAMED (a private sector firm) and is taking some steps to sell ORS packages to NGOs.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","11/1/1996 12:00:00 AM","","Pharmaceuticals|Pharmacies|Medical laboratories|Oral rehydration therapy|Mass production|Universities and colleges|Local level|Diarrhea|Child survival activities","Guatemala","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABN988.pdf","1,395 KB","008550 - USAID.

"This report describes the village-level impacts of road rehabilitation undertaken in Guinea by the National Rural Infrastructure Project (PNIR).  Impact on agricultural markets has been considerable; now that villages are linked to the world year round, marketing traffic has increased six-fold and volume of products sold has increased five-fold.  Agricultural productivity has also improved; land under cultivation has increased by 61% and volume of commodities sold has increased by 113%.  Villagers have also enjoyed increased access to health care and education: percentages of villages with health posts has increased from 29% to 77%, with deep bore holes with drinkable water from 34% to 86%, and with schools from 46% to 95%.  Reduced time and transportation costs have led to a sixfold increase in weekly commerce. There has also been an increase in the number of small- and medium-scale enterprises.  These have been provided with training to improve their negotiation skills for competitively bidding on contracts with the Guinean National Directorate for Rural Engineering (DNGR) to rebuild rural roads. More training is needed, however, since only a few businesses are truly performing.  The project has improved the institutional capacities of the DNGR itself, which has completed dozens of surveys to solicit bids on major road lots, and signed contracts with large companies and for the performance of communal work. Out of a projected total of 5,600 km of roads to be rebuilt, over 3,900 km are now finished.  Environmental impact of road rehabilitation has been minimal.  Reforestation activities have diminished any detrimental effect on forests where it has occurred, and the risk of erosion has been diminished through improvement of drainage systems.  The only environmental liability has been the blowing of dust into houses by speeding vehicles during the dry season.

"For the past 3 years, the Institute for Public Management and Community Service at Florida International University has been conducting a USAID-funded democratic development project in Paraguay and Chile.  The project has been characterized by an unusually high level of flexibility, aimed at enabling project staff to work simultaneously at the central, local, and grassroots levels, as well as by a high number of counterpart relationships between host country and U.S. local government practitioners.  This report documents successes of and lessons learned to date from the project, with particular emphasis on the role of international donors in building strong municipal government in newly emerging democracies. The project itself has had some unique successes, including in Paraguay: (1) initiating and guiding the first public hearing ever held on the national budget; (2) establishment of the nation's first municipal-based public/private citizen advisory councils; (3) initiating the first public hearing by a Committee of the Congress, the Municipal Committee of the Chamber of Deputies; and (4) creation of the country's first citizens' commission designed to achieve policy consensus among contending political interests on a civic project. In Chile, at USAID's direction, the project was much narrower in scope, and worked through Chilean NGOs. Nevertheless, there also were noticeable successes, including the professionalization of the position of the city manager and the promotion of interest in new methods of local revenue generation. Key lessons learned are as follows.  (1) Effecting significant institutional reform toward the goal of decentralization requires the commitment of a strong host country leader (e.g., a mayor, a Ministry head), who is willing to take political risks by promoting an often unpopular process.  It also requires a period of time in which to build a relationship of trust. (2) Strengthening local government requires changes at the central level.  (3) Since institutional and policy reform are ultimately political acts, it is necessary to work closely and extensively with political leaders and elected officials.  (4) It is necessary to maintain flexibility in project design and implementation in order to be open to opportunities for reform as they arise. (5) Contrary to some opinions, foreign, in this case U.S., decentralization models, can have relevance to local conditions in the developing world. Often, as in this case, those foreign models are of great interest to local politicians in decentralizing countries.  (6) The use of high-level U.S. practitioners has been very successful, since U.S. municipal officials face problems similar to those faced by their Latin counterparts and thus can readily win the latter's trust and responsiveness.  (7) For politicians, all relationships are exchange relationships; if politicians of senior administrators are asked to give up authority in the process of decentralization, then they should gain other resources, such as political advancement, recognition, or publicity.  (8) Since most people, whether elected or appointed, are quite reluctant to relinquish political authority, the mobilization of locally based elites and leaders is usually an important step in bringing about decentralization.  (9) Most local government institutions require strengthening before they can operate effectively in a decentralized environment.  (10) Local NGOs are often not very effective in delivering TA to local government since typically they lack the technical expertise and are seen by the local government -- which in any case generally suspects their motives -- as competitors for scarce resources.  (11) The ability to influence policy and practice need not require large budgets.  This project demonstrates that often what is needed is the capacity to build trust, good judgement, and perseverance.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","598-0799-C-00-3325-00","","11/1/1996 12:00:00 AM","","Democratization|Governance|Local level|Public administration|Decentralization|Municipal level|Case studies|Political systems in transition|Institution building","Paraguay|Chile|Latin America","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNACA512.pdf","749 KB","009567 - Florida International University (FIU).

"Evaluates the nontraditional agricultural export (NTAE) marketing component of a project to develop alternative sources of income and employment for people within Bolivia's Cochabamba Department and associated areas of influence.  Interim evaluation covers the period 6/92-10/96.  Development Alternatives Inc. (DAI) is implementing the project. Despite significant constraints, DAI has done much valuable work. Among the prioritized crops, banana has received the vast majority of emphasis, followed by pineapple.  A lack of production volume of palm heart, passion fruit, and black pepper justifiably limit DAI's marketing efforts to minor involvement.  The project is focusing on the right crops, with the exception of passion fruit.  The real constraint to export market development is lack of consistent volume of high quality product. DAI's provision of TA to the banana and pineapple associations, improving product quality, improving post-harvest handling, offering export incentives, and facilitating market identification and penetration has been the catalyst in the development of the banana and pineapple export industry.  Farm family incomes in the Chapare derived from alternative crops increased from $280 in 1993 to $520 in 1996, with farm gate value of alternative crops rising by an estimated 91%.  DAI's promotion efforts have resulted in a number of new private sector investments in the Chapare.  There are 14 private investors of significant scale in the Chapare with a total of $3.295 million directly committed to Chapare endeavors.  While private sector sustainability in the banana export business is still several years away, DAI's activities have laid a foundation for improved agribusiness activity, export diversification and growth, and increased value-added agriculture, and have demonstrated that private sector agribusiness efforts should benefit the small farmer. Lessons learned are as follows.  (1)The key ingredient for successful entry into international markets is almost always the presence of a catalyst, defined as an individual or company or a public agency, or combination of these, that (a) pioneers the process of development, (b) packages the needed know-how with domestic endowments and external financing, and (c) diffuses its experience and know-how to others.  (2) NTAE businesses are high-risk ventures, and have a high failure rate because of these risks.  (3) Smaller, streamlined field packingsheds, built with grower input, have proven to be more utilized and efficient than large, overcapacity, high operating cost structures.  (4) Improvement in product quality and development of the export market have a positive effect on local market prices paid to the grower.  (5) Credit availability is a necessary element of any alternative agriculture development program.  The lack of available credit in the Chapare is a constraint to the growth of agricultural exports.  (6) It is not possible to export bananas to Argentina without refrigerated container transport.","Delivery order no. 3","Special Evaluation","Documents","LAG-0807-Q-00-3036-00","","10/1/1996 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural product marketing|Nontraditional agricultural exports|Agribusiness","Bolivia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABP144.pdf","3,519 KB","001335 - Chemonics International Consulting Div.","","008515 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to develop support networks to assist new small- and medium-scale businesses in Ukraine, Moldova, and Belarus (NewBizNet project). The evaluation covers the period 9/94-8/96 and focuses on the performance of the four current Business Service Center (BSC) subcontractors (Lviv, Odesa, Balti-Moldova, and Kharkiv).  The project is implemented by Development Alternatives, Inc. (DAI). Due to the shortage of statistical information on BSC performance, the evaluators had to be more subjective in their judgement than should have been necessary.  Nevertheless, there was general consensus in the overall assessment of BSC performance. Overall, Lviv, even with its problems, was ranked well ahead of Kharkiv, which was closely followed by Odesa.  Moldova was a clear fourth and well behind Odesa.  The NEWBIZNET name and logo is not prominent in either the BSCs' facilities or their literature.  Neither do the BSCs' internal organizational structures reflect that of the project as a whole.  In addition, NEWBIZNET-funded positions, including that of the Director, are not always filled by full-time employees, and the quality of the staff in funded positions varies widely.  The BSC directors feel that the BSCs inability to extend commercial credit to potential clients is the major factor preventing BSCs from attracting more clients, particularly for business advisory services. Business advisory services have not been emphasized due to the skill levels of the BSC staff, services offered to clients vary widely from BSC to BSC, coordination and exchange of ideas between the BSCs and the Kyiv office is lacking, and business planning skills are generally weak. Business registration assistance is the most popular service requested by BSC clients. Business education and training is the strongest activity throughout the BSCs.  However, there is little exchange of training course information between the BSC training managers and a common core range of training courses is not available for the centers. Finally, although the basics of the business information network (BIN) were established in May 1996, there is still a general lack of understanding of what is available and of how to use Lotus Notes.

"Final evaluation of a project (9/91-9/96) to improve the quality and efficiency of primary education in Lesotho through policy reforms and improved teacher instruction (PEP project). Though shortened by a year due to the closing of the USAID Mission, the project was a success.  Major achievements include the enactment of the far-reaching Education Act of 1995, first published 1/17/96; a significant reduction in the number of underage children in Standard 1; progress in reducing the number of overage children in primary education; and establishment of a policy to restrict the number of repetitions in Standards 1-7. In addition, PEP completed the first 3.5 year cycle of training uncertified practicing teachers, adding 450 qualified teachers to the Teaching Service, and completed the first 3-year cycle of training unqualified head teachers, adding 105 qualified head teachers to the primary education system.  The structure of the National Teacher Training College was reorganized to include three divisions:  primary education, junior secondary education, and inservice education, each staffed with coordinators.  PEP also increased the capacity of the Educational Management Information System (EMIS), which provides data on primary education for use in policymaking and budgeting. Finally, PEP helped construct new and refurbish some existing primary school classrooms in 5 of the 10 districts, revise and pilot test in 50 schools the syllabi for Standards 1-7, and plan a new curriculum database that will help the National Curriculum Development Centre to improve syllabi instructional materials and inservice programs for teachers.  A Standard 3 Achievement test was developed that can be used to monitor effectiveness of primary school curriculum midway through its course.  Procedures and programs for the Primary School Leaving Examination were updated. The following lessons were learned.  (1) The greater the initial collaboration between donor and host government in determining Conditions Precedent (CPs), the greater the possibility of partnership. To this end, the donor should provide TA to the recipient throughout the project and not merely serve as an inspector.  (2) Flexibility in determining host country compliance with CPs should be encouraged where political developments have taken place in the host country.  At times, the CPs should be reworked.  In the present case, the change from a military to a democratic government more than a year into the Education Program appeared to penalize the Government of Lesotho (GOL) and the Ministry of Education (MOE); the practice of democracy requires more extensive consultation to pass new legislation than do the practices of non-democratic governments.  In general, there was nearly total support for requiring CPs for increments of donor funding, and for considering such CPs as essential to implementing educational reform. (3) When donors impose policy and institutional reforms requiring incremental changes but then withdraw support prematurely (as in this project), the host country is left without the wherewithal to complete its agenda. (4) USAID refilled the project officer position 6 times during the PEP's 5-year lifetime.  This confused the MOE, as the six officers had varying views of how strictly to judge compliance with CPs.  In this case, minutes of meetings between donor(s) and GOL/MOE is essential to reducing confusion of both parties on interpretation of CPs.  (5) In multi-donor projects, it is important that collaboration and consultation occur on a regular, face-to-face basis between donors, and between donor(s) and recipients throughout the life of the project to foster and sustain a spirit of partnership.  USAID/World Bank collaboration during the last 4 years was not as close as during the preparatory years.","Delivery order #11","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","HNE-5832-I-00-4015-00","","9/1/1996 12:00:00 AM","","Primary education|Educational development|Educational policy","Lesotho","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABP351.pdf","5,241 KB","000223 - Academy for Educational Development, Inc.

"Final evaluation of a child survival (CS) project (10/93-9/96) implemented by Save the Children (SC) in two Departments in Cameroon's Far North Province, Mayo Danay and Mayo Kani. The project focused on using training to build local capacity to promote access and use of services for four CS interventions: immunization, diarrhea disease control, nutrition, and vitamin A.  Using training curricula and materials developed in collaboration with Ministry of Health (MOH), the project trained health workers from the Ministries of Agriculture/Community Development (MoAg/DC) and Social and Family Affairs (MINESCOF) and from Community Health Committees (COSA), who then conducted awareness raising activities among mothers and women of child bearing age.  In addition, the project provided health centers with scales, cold boxes, vaccination/growth cards, information, education, and communications (IEC) materials, nutrition demonstration equipment and, unexpectedly, vaccines. The project also repaired some health center refrigerators. Despite being delayed 9 months, due to an overlap with a complementary Mission-funded operational program grant, the project achieved many of its objectives.  Of note is the vaccination coverage among children 0-11 months, which increased from 21.6% to 60%, and the increase from 18.8% to 53% of women of child bearing age receiving tetanus toxoid immunizations.  While progress was made toward the other objectives, full attainment was hampered by many factors, including personnel overload, poor management during most of the first 2 years, and a lack of expected inputs. A significant and noteworthy achievement was the project's ability to work collaboratively not only with the MOH but also with the MoAg/DC and the MINESCOF, both of which have mother and child health mandates.  The project not only worked effectively with these three ministries, but also promoted collaboration between them to the point where a Department-level Coordinating Committee (CC) was established to coordinate and oversee their joint child survival activities. Interviews with committee members revealed a commitment to continue the work of the CC even after donor funding ends.  Pursuant to this, provincial government officials have committed funds, materials, and human resources to maintain the achievements of the project. The following lessons were learned.  (1) A child survival project is much more likely to be sustainable if, as in this project, it focuses on strengthening existing delivery systems rather than on creating parallel systems.  (2) A structure for coordinating partner's efforts and resources is needed to ensure effective implementation.  (3) Collaboration enables each partner to take advantage of the strengths of the other, but also exposes it to the other's weaknesses.  In this case, the MOH depended on UNICEF for vaccines for the project. When the supply was interrupted, this project objective was put in jeopardy, from which, fortunately, it was bailed out by SC using private funds.  (4) Training is very effective in promoting sustainability, especially training mothers and trainers of mothers in ways to change their child care behaviors. Nonetheless, changing feeding practices, especially within traditional ethnic groups, poses a formidable and time-consuming challenge. (5) A CS project should address the health problems in the area in which it is working.  USAID should control more stringently for this in reviewing proposals.  In the present case, there seems to have been no need for a Vitamin A intervention.  (6) Personnel and financial management skills are just as important in a project manager as technical knowledge about CS issues.  (7) Knowledge, Practice, and Coverage (KPC) survey results should be used not only for monitoring and evaluation purposes, but also to confirm or amend project objectives and indicators.  (8) A policy that promotes the achievement of one CS intervention may work against the achievement of another that is equally as important; in this project, USAID's policy to use disposable needles to prevent the spread of AIDS worked against the project's vaccination efforts as the need to purchase syringes and needles drove the cost of being fully vaccinated beyond the means of most Cameroonians.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","FAO-0500-A-00-3026-00","","10/1/1996 12:00:00 AM","","Child survival activities|Maternal child health care|Immunizations|Disease prevention and control|Diarrhea|Nutrition improvement|Vitamin A|Health professional education|Human capacity development|Government departments|Host government departmental coordination|IEC|Mothers|Project sustainability","Cameroon","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABP492.pdf","166 KB","001407 - Save the Children (U.S.)","","007746 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of a project (5/94-6/96) to promote microenterprise development in Nizhny Novgorod Oblast, Russia, by creating an alliance of 10-15 NGOs serving microenterprises in the target area.  The project was implemented by Opportunity International (OI), under a subgrant from World Learning, and Vozmozhnost, a local NGO. The project's principal accomplishment has been the establishment of a strong working partnership between OI, Vozmozhnost, and Slyzhenia, the NGO alliance created under this agreement, which now exists as a legally registered association. Both Slyzhenia's capacity and that of its members has been strengthened; each has set its own visions, objectives, and priorities in a participatory manner.  Ownership of Slyzhenia has come to rest in its members, with its day-to-day tasks vested in a fully functioning and competent voluntary board and an effective executive director. Slyzhenia has established a regional training center, which has an extensive, ongoing program of seminars, networking opportunities, and information distribution.  This is valued by Slyzhenia's members, as witnessed by high participation rates.  In all, 23 of a targeted 25 training seminars have been conducted with 392 participants.  However, effective measures of this development and training impact remain undeveloped. The Job Creation Programme initiated as a result of the 2/96 grant revision is at the forefront of Slyzhenia's service program.  This program has enhanced participating NGOs' vision, capacities, employment, and incomes, making a major contribution (if initial results can be sustained) to members' long-term viability.  Slyzhenia is meeting its job creation obligations under both the initial and revised proposal. The Programme has created 46 new jobs, vs. a target of 60, and improved the incomes of 17 NGOs, vs. a target of 10-15, by 15-100% in a 6-month period.  This has had a significant impact on their long-term viability. However, progress towards sustainability (i.e., without reliance on external grants) has been limited.  In this vein, only two-thirds of Slyzhenia's members pay regular (and only nominal) membership dues and Slyzhenia continues to provide services free.  However, Slyzhenia has diversified funding and developed a coherent, if unproved, short- to medium- term funding strategy, comprised of external grants, social contracts, and slowly rising membership dues.  Overall, it is the opinion of the evaluators that Slyzhenia will survive beyond the closure of the grant because of the commitment of its members and the quality of the services it aims to provide -- even if it must do so on a reduced budget. The implementation of the project was beset by a number of misunderstandings, which delayed a restructuring that was needed to more clearly focus the program.  All involved failed to understand the difficulty in implementing the original micro-enterprise strategy.  This misunderstanding was persistent, as the mid-term evaluation sought to reinforce rather than re-think the strategy.  Even after the original strategy was rethought, it took 3 months for OI and World Learning to agree on a revision, possibly because of their differing organizational structures.  In 2/96, the grant was revised and extended for 3 months, with the possibility of a further 3-month extension based on measurable progress.  World Learning decided not to approve the second extension, although even 2 additional months might have given Slyzhenia enough time to show the effective results of the Job Creation Programme.  World Learning has still not given Slyzhenia a coherent account of this decision, and this has generated an atmosphere of mistrust.  A lesson learned is that great care must be taken to establish trust with one's partners, as the experience sets a precedent for the tone of future development partnerships.","Subgrant agreement no.

"Evaluates the performance of CH2m Hill International Services Inc. (CH), the main contractor on a project to foster sound environmental policy, promote the use of environmental technology, and enhance public participation in environment management in the New Independent States (NIS).  Mid-term evaluation covers the period 9/93-4/96. Despite initial start-up problems, the project is making good progress toward addressing environmental problems that are serious threats to human health and economic growth in the former Soviet Union. To date, most efforts have focused on technology transfer interventions, such as improving water systems technologies in the Central Asian Republics (CAR), demonstrating methods to reduce air pollution in Novokuznetsk, developing a training module for fighting forest fires in the Russian Far East (RFE), and demonstrating improved tilling methods aimed at reducing soil erosion in Moldova.  Follow-on TA, financed by the host government, private sector, or donors, will be needed to sustain these initiatives. Efforts at policy and institutional development have received less focus.  Exceptions include most of the RFE work; Delivery Order (DO) 8, which is aimed at regional cooperation on water policy in the CAR; and the Ukrainian-American Work Groups in the Western NIS.  Many CH DOs have policy or institutional tasks that have not been initiated.  These need to be carried out not just for their intrinsic value but because they are needed to sustain the introduction of new environmental technologies.  With most of its engineering work already completed, CH should in its last 2 years focus on policy and institutional development.  At the same time, USAID needs to sort out responsibilities in these areas among CH and the other project contractors, especially the Harvard Institute for International Development (HIID). In a project as large and complex as this, it can be expected that some activities are progressing more rapidly and effectively than others, and that there will be some management problems.  None of these are insuperable; those in need of most attention are as follows.  (1) Project management for several of the regions is overly centralized in Washington, though CH has already taken some steps taken to devolve management authority to the field level, notably in RFE DOs, one CAR DO, and most NIS tasks.  (2) Relatedly, CH needs to manage the DOs more strategically to ensure they are collectively working toward the project's overall objectives.  To this end, CH will need to appoint managers for most DOs, which should be treated as mini-projects, and to consolidate tasks from some DOs where appropriate.  (3) The large number of tasks and subtasks in the immense territory of the RFE lack focus and coherence.  This is partly the result of the project's design, but also partly the result of CH's task-oriented approach to managing RFE (and other project) activities. The contractor is saddled with the management of not just its own activities but also those of other project contractors.  More assistance is required from USAID/Moscow to deal with this workload.","V.2. Russia annexes: PD-ABP-575|V.3. Western Newly Independent States annexes: PD-ABP-576|V.4.

"Evaluates Cooperative Agreement (CA) with the International Foundation for Education and Self-Help (IFESH) to implement three assistance programs in Africa: (1) a Debt for Development program for 3-5 countries; (2) The Best and Brightest, a short-term training program for bankers; and (3) a Teachers for Africa program, aimed at fielding U.S. teachers for stays of up to 1 year in 12 sub-Saharan African countries.  Interim evaluation covers the period 3/92-1/96. IFESH has made considerable progress in implementing the CA.  In general, the Foundation has established a presence in sub-Saharan Africa as an organization capable of implementing development projects.  IFESH officials' negotiations with the heads of African governments and of the United States resulted in formal country agreements with Kenya, Nigeria, Gabon, and Benin.  IFESH has particularly demonstrated its capacity to initiate and maintain contact at the highest levels of government, and to negotiate and implement programs on the ground. More tangible progress includes establishing a regional office in Nigeria, selecting Country Representatives to facilitate the Teachers for Africa program, and disseminating information concerning the Banker Training program.  Under the Teachers for Africa program, which is recognized as important and distinct from the U.S. Peace Corps and programs funded by other multi-national or other bilateral organizations, U.S. teachers have filled nine positions in African countries. The Best and Brightest program has trained 194 mid-level bankers, 25% of whom were women, from 12 countries in some of the most prestigious commercial banks in the United States.  Topics covered include accounting, corporate finance, banking analysis, fundamentals of banking, credit analysis, international banking, financial and risk analysis, principles of capital markets, and fundamentals of foreign exchange.  Several trainees received important promotions following their training.  IFESH has also negotiated and is implementing a Debt for Development program in Nigeria, through which it has leveraged $1.6 million into more than $6 million in local currency.  This further contributes to IFESH's reputation as a reliable funding source of local development activities in Nigeria. Not all has gone smoothly, however. Implementation of the Debt for Development program experienced delays in the conversion and transfer of local currencies to subgrantees.  Changes in governments, strikes, and other problems have placed great administrative pressures on the Teachers for Africa program.  The Best and Brightest program has proven much more expensive than anticipated.  And cutting across all IFESH programs are administrative and management concerns that should be addressed in order to reinforce the progress already accomplished.  In particular, IFESH must ensure that its management structure is transparent and supports a clear  decisionmaking process responsive to its growing overseas needs and responsibilities.

"Evaluates the African Economic Research Consortium (AERC) Research Program to enhance Africa's capacity for high-quality economic research and its relevance to economic policy concerns of the region. Evaluation covers the period 1988-1995. AERC has achieved an amazing esprit de corps among researchers and other network participants, and can be thought of as the cement that holds African economic researchers together.  Notable achievements and shortcomings are as follows. AERC has funded 164 research proposals, the final reports for 106 of which have been accepted, 97% of which have received positive external reviews.  In addition, 34 AERC Research Papers have been published, along with 44 project-generated journal articles and books.  There is evidence that research quality has improved while progressing through the various stages and filters of the research process, although researchers have agreed that the quality of the data gathered is unreliable and a major effort to improve it is needed. Since 1988, the scope of the research topics has broadened as has the research domain and output of projects completed by the same sets of investigators over time.  Proposals seem to be fairly representative of the African region and its many languages.  Women, however, are under-represented within the researcher pool.  Most studies have been deductive, examining existing techniques and models related to policy within Africa. Only a few projects have adopted an inductive approach, namely, the projects on informal and formal financial markets and interlinkages.  The results of these have been widely cited in development literature as they improve understanding of African financial markets. In terms of the policy relevance of thematic projects, the evidence is mixed:  an AERC-commissioned report in 1994 concluded that the projects were not relevant, while 70% of respondents to a questionnaire on the subject felt the opposite.  Network researchers strongly endorse the National Policy Workshops as one of the best marketing vehicles for AERC research outputs. Finally, while it is obvious that AERC has made an enormous effort to ensure the relevance of its research, relevance has to be linked to the themes and issues emphasized in the research portfolio; the titles of the four research themes (and corresponding groups) do not reflect accurately the topics that come under their respective umbrellas.  The researchers feel that individual research group cultures prevail and that the present four thematic areas, while on target at the program's outset, are too limiting and should be expanded to include topics related to poverty alleviation.","French ed.: PN-ACB-357","Special Evaluation","Documents","AOT-0546-G-00-3181-00","","1/1/1996 12:00:00 AM","","Economic research|Economic studies|Regional level|Research collaboration","Africa south of Sahara","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNACB356.pdf","4,165 KB","009723 - African Economic Research Consortium (AERC)","","008308 - USAID.

"Reviews USAID/Morocco programs in housing and urban development, with a focus on the evolution and impact of two Housing Guaranty (HG) projects:  Tetouan Urban Development (HG-001/6080194) and National Upgrading Agency (ANHI) Low-Income Housing (HG-003/6080200). The experimental Tetouan project, authorized in 1985, aimed at creating an urban development model applicable in other municipalities. Efforts included upgrading the informal Dersa-Samsa neighborhood of Tetouan, which has had a direct effect on nearly one third of the city's population, and improving the city government's capacity to deal with housing and land development activity.  Specifically, HG-001 supported financing for:   upgrading 7,500 lots on 158 hectares housing 9,500 households; development of a 140-hectare special development zone (ZAC), to be developed through a partnership of public and private sector organizations; municipal government development of 60 hectares of serviced lots for moderate income households (to forestall informal land development in the area, and to cross-subsidize the upgrading component); and off-site infrastructure.  The Tetouan program also developed innovations in municipal government organization, computerization of certain key management functions, and cost recovery for such programs.  Through a twinning arrangement, the City of Raleigh in North Carolina helped Tetouan train and equip technicians to monitor wastewater collection systems and water quality at sewer discharge points.  The collaboration has strengthened Tetouan's ability to support both the day-to-day business of waste management and the establishment of long-term strategies.  Tetouan's medical chief has reported a spectacular decrease in contagious diseases in the Dersa-Samsa, one of the sites upgraded through the project. The ANHI Low-Income Housing Project was directed at expanding ANHI's program in serviced land development to nationwide coverage, and at extending the experience gained in HG-001 to other local governments. HG financing has enabled ANHI to produce an additional 2,000 low-income plots per year, to the benefit of some 25,000 people each year.  In fact, ANHI's progress has been better than anticipated.  Using both HG and other resources, ANHI is now producing some 10,000 plots per year; in the nearly 10 years of its life, it has produced over 100,000 plots in over 80 sites, and has a pipeline of 100 new projects.  ANHI has also adapted the Tetouan urban upgrading model to other cities, including Azrou, Fes, and Tangiers. Beyond the quantitative shelter condition improvements carried out under HG-001 and the real production increases under HG-003, the two programs have had an impact at a higher strategic level.  The TA provided under HG-001 strengthened the ability of participating institutions to implement a large-scale urban development project. Tangible results include the provision of automation equipment and software, a geographic information system, and training in the fields of cost recovery, municipal finance, and financial analysis.  Seminars were held to enable other municipalities to benefit from activities carried out at Tetouan.  The TA provided under HG-003 provided, inter alia, professional training and automation equipment, and, more importantly, facilitated a shift in strategy at ANHI to improve its effectiveness in working with local governments, banks, and private developers.  This experience has shown that coordinated, concerted efforts can have a positive effect on the provision of low-income shelter opportunities. The report includes a description of the two components of the current program (project 6080221) -- Land Development and Financing, and Urban Infrastructure and Environmental Services.","RFS no. 31","Special Evaluation","Documents","PCE-1008-C-00-5001-00","","12/1/1996 12:00:00 AM","","Housing investment guaranty|Housing markets|Urban development|Pilot projects|Municipal level|Low cost housing|Institution building","Morocco","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNACB577.pdf","716 KB","007625 - International City/County Management Association (ICMA)","","008579 - USAID.

"Mid-term evaluation of the Dhaka urban integrated child survival project (DUICSP).  Evaluation covers the period 10/94-8/96.  The project is being implemented by World Vision/Bangladesh. DUICSP is one of the more, if not the most, successful of urban health projects in Bangladesh.  Its value extends far beyond its direct health effects to its success in empowerment at the community level and its framework as a viable strategic option for urban health. The project has achieved a remarkable partnership with the community (e.g., neighborhood health committees, focus mothers, traditional birth attendants, and community volunteers), project staff, the Dhaka City Corporation, and the Government of Bangladesh (GOB). Health delivery is decentralized to the cluster (i.e., 400 family) level.  Certain services, such as semi-annual distribution of Vitamin A, registration, and health promotion, are delivered door-to-door; other services (polio National Immunization Days and measles tetanus campaigns to immunize defaulters) are delivered at collecting points; while still others (immunization, and maternal care and treatment of minor illness) are provided at the four project health facilities.  The community has assumed a remarkable degree of ownership of the project, making significant inputs in cost recovery and volunteer labor. Quality of preventive and treatment services has been excellent, and good progress has been made toward project objectives, with the observed rates of night blindness and reported cases of disease preventable by immunization falling.  However, the project needs to be strengthened in a number of areas, including the addition of family planning services, the integration of service delivery, and the rationalization of a burdensome information system to ensure the availability and use of data at the local level.  Moreover, considering the high percentage of urban poor within the catchment area, it is unreasonable to expect that the project can be financially self-sustaining.  However, two major urban health projects are expected to begin in the next 24 months: an African Development Bank loan for urban health and an USAID urban health service project.  In the meantime, it is strongly recommended that a search be made for bridge funding to ensure momentum pending these new funds.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","FAO-0500-A-00-4049-00","","8/1/1996 12:00:00 AM","","Integrated health care|Community participation|Community based delivery|Health outreach services|Child survival activities|Urban areas","Bangladesh","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABP898.pdf","1,580 KB","003794 - World Vision Relief and Development, Inc.","","007746 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of a child survival (CS) project (10/92-9/96) implemented by World Vision in Ogbomoso South, Oyo State, Nigeria. This project is an excellent example of the potential for working though PVOs to encourage community, local NGO, and local government collaboration.  Targets were surpassed with regard to immunization coverage, control of diarrheal disease, nutrition and growth monitoring, and family planning.  Targets for percentage of births attended by a trained person and for malaria prevention were not met, although progress was made. Local communities demonstrated a remarkable capacity and willingness to work with the project. Community Development Committees described dramatic reductions in morbidity and mortality for fever, convulsions, diarrhea, measles, and bleeding at birth.  Almost all of the interventions can be sustained by the communities with a minimum of supervision and in-service training from a local NGO (the Baptist Medical Center) and the local government.  However, the immunization program, which the community considers the most important intervention, requires technical resources and support not available at the community level.  Meetings with the implementing partners during the final evaluation demonstrated that the elements and commitment for sustaining the program are available, but have yet to be fully implemented.  The next year will determine if co-management of health services by communities, local government, and local NGOs can be firmly established and sustained.  The results of this effort could establish an important model of collaboration for other areas of Nigeria. Included among the appendices is a report on a 9/96 Knowledge, Practice, and Coverage Survey showing that project objectives were in many instances met or exceeded.","Contract no. listed on cover as: FAO-0500-A-2042-00|A final Knowledge, Practice, and Coverage Survey is included as|Annex F.","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","FAO-0500-A-00-2042-00","","12/1/1996 12:00:00 AM","","Child survival activities|Community participation|Private voluntary organizations","Nigeria","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABP901.pdf","771 KB","003794 - World Vision Relief and Development, Inc.","","007746 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of a child survival project (9/93-9/96) implemented by World Vision Relief and Development in Bundibugyo, Uganda. Data from the concluding Knowledge, Practice, and Coverage survey (annexed to the evaluation) indicate that of the project's 15 objectives, 11 were surpassed, 2 were slightly below end-of-term target (percentage of mothers receiving two doses of tetanus toxoid and providing sufficient fluids during diarrheal episodes), and 2 were considerably below end-of-term target (immunization coverage for children, percentage of mothers able to name modes of HIV transmission). Reasons given for not meeting the immunization coverage objective include periodic shortages of the vaccines, the conditions of the roads (especially during the rainy season when transport becomes impossible), the influx of immigrants from Zaire, problems with vehicles, and security issues.  The project's accomplishments, however, are considerable.  World Vision's presence in Bundibugyo has dramatically changed the demography of the area -- families are now larger because children are no longer dying.  Demand for health services has increased, compounds are cleaner, water sources are protected, income-generating activities have been introduced and are showing results, communities recognize their responsibility to be involved, and local leaders, governmental officials, and bilateral agencies all recognize and acknowledge World Vision's remarkable accomplishments in the area. Large numbers of community volunteers and health personnel have been trained over the years, and the collaboration between these groups is remarkable The fundamental problems that brought World Vision to the area have not changed, however.  Bundibugyo is still one of the poorest districts in Uganda, the population continues to be largely underserved, no other NGOs are operating in the district, and the conditions of the roads, which affect the transport of goods and persons, remain unacceptable. The project's immunization activities will likely continue with the assistance of UNICEF and Germany's Society for Technical Cooperation (GTZ), but most of the supervisory visits and training programs will cease.  A skeletal World Vision staff will, however, remain in the area to plan for potential greater involvement in the future.

"Final evaluation of Phase II of CARE's Resources in Community Health Education Support Project (RICHES II) (9/93-9/96), a community-based child survival (CS) program for isolated communities in Haiti.  RICHES II was preceded by RICHES I (1989-93) and by Community Integrated Nutrition and Education Centers Outreach (CINECO -- 1985-88). Over the past decade, CARE's CS projects in Haiti have become less widely disbursed and more regionally consolidated, increasingly focused on community involvement and control, and less involved in direct service provision and more in the provision of technical and managerial assistance. Although the projects have often been criticized for their relatively high cost per capita, they have probably expended at least as many resources developing appropriate CS technologies and models for Haiti as they have for service delivery.  The results of these expenditures are:  (1) an acclaimed health education package for persons with low or no literacy that has been adopted by many other health organizations; (2) a community-based family planning model that has produced possibly the nation's highest rural contraceptive prevalence rate and which is being assessed for replication; and (3) a sexually transmitted diseases and AIDS prevention program that has probably achieved the highest knowledge levels nationally. In RICHES II, which was implemented in 263 isolated western Grand Anse localities, CARE/Haiti collaborated with the Ministry of Public Health (MSP) and key NGOs to develop community-based human resources to promote and carry out a diverse menu of services:  immunizations, oral rehydration therapy promotion, growth monitoring and promotion, screening for high-risk pregnancy, vitamin A and iron supplementation, community-based contraceptives distribution, and health and family planning education. Beneficiaries totaled 37,000 women and children for basic CS activities, and 33,000 women and men for FP activities. Although immunization coverage was much lower than planned, the project's educational package was highly touted.  In addition, the project's staff are highly trained and motivated, and community participants are generally knowledgeable health service consumers who display many positive health seeking behaviors at significantly higher levels than the national average.  Since RICHES II communities are not yet ready to assume responsibility for continuing CS services, the Haitian Health Foundation (HHF) has proposed to take over the catchment area currently served by the project.  The MSP and the donor community should be made aware, however, that if the HHF does not assume this responsibility, these communities, on which so many resources have been expended and in which so much has been achieved, will be abandoned. It is recommended that CARE/Haiti, given its past achievements in developing success models for rural preventive health care, develop a community devolvement model as its next major CS task.

"PACR of a project (6/90-4/95) to develop self-managed rural enterprises in El Salvador and assist institutions that service these enterprises.  The project was implemented by Technoserve.  NOTE:  Some of the findings and all of the lessons learned noted below derive from the final external evaluation of the project (XD-ABQ-356-A) conducted by Agricultural Development Consultants, Inc. (AGRIDEC). TechnoServe reached or exceeded the levels put forth in the Cooperative Agreement in terms of employment, income, and area cultivated.  However, in view of the method used by TechnoServe to measure its performance, it is unclear how many new benefits were generated.  The AGRIDEC team attempted to analyze the impact of TechnoServe's efforts by tracking several indicators -- sugar and coffee productivity, cooperative profits, cooperative net worth, cooperatives' managerial capacity, and employment for men and women. Results were inconclusive. TechnoServe successfully assisted 65 cooperatives, of which 44 were ""graduated"" to a degree of organizational maturity.  Primary benefits have resulted from the installation of management information, control, and planning systems, including basic accounting and budgetary control procedures.  These basic management development efforts have paid off over the long term.  For example, many of the Cooperative League of the USA's (CLUSA) successful cooperatives currently producing and exporting non-traditional (NT) crops have been assisted by TechnoServe.  However, the cooperatives did not, generally speaking, change their production patterns as a result of Technoserve's interventions.  The effectiveness of the new management skills learned by the participating cooperative must be measured in light of this situation. TechnoServe's impact on the production and export of NT crops was small, but the requirement was introduced during the fifth year of the project, and neither objectives nor performance indicators were established for NT crop production under the new requirement. The problem of frequent changes in cooperative leadership was a major obstacle to the successful completion of TechnoServe's program. TechnoServe's investments in time and energy for institutional strengthening of the cooperatives were often lost with the arrival of new cooperative management.  TechnoServe has had to dedicate too many of its resources to overcome this problem. Lessons learned are as follows:  (1) The project's goals, strategy, performance measures, and indicators should be consistent.  TechnoServe stated that its goals were to increase rural employment, income, and production through working with self-managed enterprises.  Results cannot be measured because performance measures were designed to track process, not progress.  (2) The problem with working toward a standard set of broad goals is that there may be occasions when these goals and the strategy for achieving them become inconsistent.  TechnoServe's strategy for institutional development of client cooperatives was to help improve management systems and to control costs.  Given this strategy, employment could be expected to decline, at least in the near term.  (3) When an environment that cannot be changed adversely affects progress, it may become necessary to change the strategy for project implementation.  This was particularly applicable to the problem of rotating cooperative leadership.  The evaluation team heard repeatedly that frequent turnover of cooperative decisionmakers meant that the cooperatives either could not graduate, or otherwise would drop recommended policies once the board of directors changed.  TechnoServe could have made stable management a pre-condition for providing services. Possible solutions might have been to insist, as part of the agreement with a cooperative, on their providing stable management for a fixed period of time, or to nominate a permanent steering committee to manage crop production.","Attachment: XD-ABQ-356-A","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","519-0382-A-00-0226-00","","12/1/1996 12:00:00 AM","","Rural development|Agricultural enterprises|Agricultural cooperatives|Institution building|Management development|Self management|Nontraditional agricultural exports|Private voluntary organizations|Employment|Income|Cultivated land","El Salvador","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABQ356.pdf","2,860 KB","008540 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of the Black Integrated Commercial Support Project (BICSN -- 1993-4/96), a pioneering effort to promote equitable participation of blacks in South Africa's economy. The BICSN project as restructured and re-staffed was dynamic, focused, and results-oriented.  It succeeded in adhering to its reformulated mission to assist a core of high-potential black enterprises (BEs) achieve accelerated growth and linkages with the large enterprise sector and to function as models for other BEs.  It also fulfilled four interrelated objectives to:  (1) develop greater access to markets for black-owned enterprises by forging profitable commercial linkages with corporations and other business entities in South Africa; (2) improve the managerial capabilities of targeted BEs; (3) increase long-term employment and wealth creation potential of BEs; and (4) achieve long-term self-sustainability in many targeted BEs by transforming them into professionally managed formal businesses. The project broke new ground by bringing BEs into important business areas from which they had been almost entirely excluded up to the time of majority rule.  BICSN therefore was instrumental in opening the formal establishment to the concept as well as the reality of greater economic participation for blacks through its focused products in corporate procurement, franchising and growth, mergers, and acquisitions.  Moreover, BICSN has shown that well-conceived and competently executed private-sector-based efforts can have immeasurable impact in paving the way toward a new economic order. BICSN was particularly well served by its three senior executives, who had both the will and the ability to fulfill their mandate.  Had BICSN had the resources to hire more educated upwardly mobile South African understudies, the benefits of on-the-job training in BICSN's various technical areas would have been of even greater significance to long-term sustainability. The reorientation of the project's TA Fund, or TAF, to a client co-payment for technical services is viewed by the evaluation team as a sound approach and proved to be a useful filter to determine the seriousness of prospective clients.  BICSN clients were equally well served by the project's extensive program of conferences, seminars, and workshops. Given the resistance of the South African business environment, BICSN's equity fund component was unfulfillable as planned.  The lack of equity moneys represented a continuing constraint to the project and limited its impact in many areas.  Nevertheless, BICSN went on to succeed and to pave the way for a USAID follow-on equity fund/TA project that will be set in a better time frame and that can benefit from its predecessor's experience. The BICSN experience indicates that future donor efforts of this kind need to create re-flow and recapturing mechanisms, possibly through an assigned trust entity to enable continuing rotation of moneys. Equity fund projects allow especially interesting possibilities for the creation of re-flows.

"Reviews activities of the Information and Referral Service (IRS) and Provincial Fund (PF) on demobilized soldiers in Mozambique for the period 4/94-11/95.  The IRS provides counseling and assistance to the demobilized and is implemented by the International Organisation for Migration (IOM).  The PF provides funding for projects and is implemented by IOM (northern and southern regions) and by the Gesellschaft fuer Technische Zusammenarbeit (GTZ) (in the central region). With the aid of flexible mechanisms and well documented administrative procedures, the PF started up rapidly and attended to a large number of demobilized soldiers in a relatively short period of time, reaching all quantitative targets for PF implementation, including numbers of demobilized soldiers reached, delivery rate on budget expenditures, and average expenditures per demobilized soldier.  In sum, about 20% of all demobilized soldiers (close to 10,000) have participated in over 650 PF projects in 6 provinces.  Also, demobilized soldiers represent more than half of the participants in PF projects, thus meeting or exceeding the 50% demobilized solider inclusion criterion for PF funding.  Implementing agencies have by and large been successful in completing their projects. Collaboration with partner organizations has generally been productive and successful.  According to their own accounts and those of various stakeholders contacted during the assessment, the majority of demobilized soldiers in Mozambique consider themselves as successfully reintegrated soldiers or as civilians.

"Final evaluation of a project (6/93-6/96) of The Asia Foundation (TAF) to strengthen Mongolia's nascent democracy in the areas of representative government, legal reform and education, and popular participation. The project exhibited many strengths, such as its sound strategy, high-quality programming, consistent selection of a satisfactory level of participants, few and relatively minor problems, inclusion of women, and the provision of probably as much assistance as was feasible in making NGOs more self-sufficient.  Overwhelmingly, grantees rated TAF's flexibility and responsiveness highly.  On the down side, TAF, for internal management and analytical purposes and to ease its requirement to respond to USAID, might have focused management of the program more on results. Although the initiatives made to strengthen representative government were small in number, they indicate that it is possible to make strategic interventions with modest amounts of money, and that work with Parliament (directly or through NGOs) should be reconsidered.  In the area of legal education and reform, the work with the Chief Justice and Supreme Court was probably strategically significant, and the early exposure to change of a large number of judges from across the country useful.  Overall, however, the legal reform and education program was small and tried to cover too many themes.  In the area of population participation/civil society, considerable headway has been made, particularly among women's organizations.  Effects have been immediate and also may be long-term for many people, particularly in rural areas. For example, there has been some institutional strengthening, and some interlinked effects in work on elections, Parliamentary responsiveness, press freedom, and other areas.  With the results of the most recent election, a number of initiatives such as the work with the Parliamentary Secretariat, the draft media, and NGO laws have a very high likelihood of making progress.  The June 30 election reflects well on the work of TAF:  25 TAF grantees ran for Parliament, 9 of whom were women; 10 of the male candidates and 7 of the women were elected to office. The ratio of administrative to program cost of the USAID grant appears high and the program moved slowly.  However, this gradualist approach to the management of a program in such a new environment and with such fragile institutions seems warranted.  Based on the state of the local institutions on which the program had to be built, results achieved, particularly in the area of civil society, and the value added by TAF, USAID has received a good return on its money.  The program is a credit to both USAID and TAF. Recommendations suggest means for substantively increasing program impacts through cost-effective or cost-saving techniques such as electronic media or training as a means to more training rather than an end; stress the need for strategic planning, problem analysis, and results monitoring; and offer ideas for enhancing program quality.","Cited in the 1997 Agency Performance Report: bibliography of|chapter 'Evaluation findings and lessons'","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","7/1/1996 12:00:00 AM","","Democratization|Institution building|Representative democracy|Legal reform|Legal education|Popular participation|Societies in transition","Mongolia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABQ617.pdf","1,786 KB","000278 - The Asia Foundation (TAF)","","008578 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of the Development Studies Project (DSP) (1983-95) to improve the Government of Indonesia's (GOI) economic policies through the finance of analytical studies and economic advisors. The project was extremely successful, significantly improving economic policy in Indonesia in a cost-effective manner; a rough estimate places the project's benefits at $492 million vs. a cost of $21 million.  Specifically, DSP improved the productivity of the GOI's National Development Planning Agency (BAPPENAS) in making sound economic policy decisions.  For example, an economic model has improved BAPPENAS' capability to ensure consistency among macro aggregates and improved overall GOI decisionmaking on macroeconomic, particularly budget, issues.  Policy advice and short-term studies armed policymakers with sounder bases for decisions.  There are difficulties in identifying specific impacts, but policy areas where the project provided input that seems to have improved (or prevented deterioration of) GOI policy include trade, regional development, allocation of INPRES funds, regulation of foreign investment, health and education policy, and rural credit reform.  Also, DSP has significantly improved the quality of the factual basis for policy decisions, leading to improved policies. The DSP's most unique contribution has been to improve the quality of statistics.  The GOI, other donors, economic researchers, and the private sector all have benefitted from the ""informational public goods"" created by this aspect of the project.  The linkage between producers and consumers of statistics encouraged better statistics production. The TA provided under the project appears to have been unusually productive.  Reasons for this include:  the high quality of BAPPENAS counterparts, due to advanced training in the United States; strong BAPPENAS input and management; strong sense of purpose by advisors; triangular interaction between DSP, USAID and BAPPENAS; effective means for developing good relationships between long-term advisors and BAPPENAS staff; and effective project management by USAID.  The quality of USAID-provided experts and the confidence placed in them by host government officials were the keys to success of the DSP advisors.  The size of the resident team (4-6 people) was appropriate. The project also contributed to the effectiveness of the rest of the USAID portfolio by putting the Mission's Economic Policy Support Office (EPSO) in closer touch with economic policy issues, contributing to USAID's ability to design an appropriate mission strategy; providing EPSO staff and mission management with opportunities to work closely with senior BAPPENAS staff, thereby creating opportunities for policy dialogue and greater responsiveness to key GOI needs; and providing linkages to BAPPENAS in the technical sectors where USAID had projects, thereby strengthening USAID links to policy formation in those sectors. Lessons learned are as follows:  (1) Economic advice can have a high payoff for USAID missions; long-term advisors who can gain the confidence of economic policymakers are important to this result.  (2) Economic advice need not be linked to external resources or to conditionality to be effective; indeed, some of the project's effectiveness resulted from the perception that the advice was objective and independent of other donor goals.  (3) Improving the quality of government economic statistics is a neglected area for donor assistance that can have important economic payoffs.  (4) USAID Missions should be cautious in supporting large economic models intended to help host government policymaking in that they require a good deal of technical input and data.  Simple models are preferred; if need be, these can gradually be made more sophisticated.","Cited in the 1997 Agency Performance Report: bibliography of|chapter 'Evaluation findings and lessons'","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1996 12:00:00 AM","","Development policy|Policy making|Policy analysis|Technical assistance|Government departments|Economic studies|Statistical data|Economic policy","Indonesia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABQ619.pdf","2,687 KB","","","008558 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of the Future of Romania (FOR) Children Project (7/92-11/96), designed to reduce child abandonment and unnecessary institutionalization of children.  The project was implemented by Holt International (HI). HI's International Children's Services used both a development (capacity building) and a modeling (demonstration) approach in implementing the FOR Children project.  Due to the paucity of trained social assistants in Romania in 1992, Holt initiated a program to train Social Assistants in local Romanian child-welfare institutions to provide direct services to children at risk of abandonment according to professional standards of social work practice. Efforts were made to network within the greater social welfare community in Romania and to share experience gained and lessons learned over the life of the project.  Special emphasis was placed on strengthening cooperation with and support to the European Commission's PHARE Child Protection Project, UNICEF, and other NGO programs offering services to children and families. To date, over 3,500 children have been served.  New concepts in permanency planning for homeless children have been modeled and innovative social services demonstrated.  These services include: temporary foster care, domestic adoption, support to families with HIV+ children, foster care for HIV+ children, shelter care, support to mothers at risk of abandoning their children, and pregnancy counseling. One of the objectives of HI has been to create a Romanian NGO.  Holt Romania's strength lies in its human resources and the quality of its service delivery.  The program staff of Holt are dedicated, hardworking individuals who bring enthusiasm and commitment to the families and children with whom they work.  Their individual and collective efforts have enabled Holt to establish a reputation among clients and in the community as leaders in assisting children and families in difficult circumstances. Lessons learned are as follows:  (1) PVOs engaged in capacity-building activities in Romania are playing a significant role in building civil society in the country.  (2) Combining a development with a modeling approach has been very successful in prevention and permanency planning activities in Romania.  Such efforts should now be replicated at the district level across sectors and should involve as many governmental and nongovernmental entities as possible.  (3) The impact of the political and economic changes in Romania are having unanticipated social repercussions.  Adequate time and resources must be made available to make the necessary modifications and to reallocate or develop the material and human resources required to make the transition to a democratic society with a free-market economy.  (5) Due to the past isolation of Romanian professionals and decisionmakers, pilot projects may play a greater role in Romania than in other parts of the world. Models adapted to the local context and particular needs demonstrate the feasibility of certain innovative approaches.  Exposure to practices in other countries can also convey new ideas and methods.  Given the low level of education among the population, adoptions are easily made when coupled with the motivation to make the changes.  (6) Although continued advocacy with those who resist reform is needed, donors should give greater emphasis to identifying and backing individuals and institutions committed to and working toward change for families and children.  Such a strategy presupposes increased collaboration with grassroots, NGO, and private groups as well as selected government programs.  (7) Collaborative projects are facilitated at the outset if partners clarify roles, responsibilities, and lines of authority and establish collaborative mechanisms for communication and decisionmaking.  (8) Projects will meet their objectives and facilitate broader systemic change only when they understand and build upon the local system and its context.

"Final evaluation of a grant to UNICEF (1993-95) to improve children's well-being in Romania. The grant has provided a major impetus to UNICEF's commitment to assist the Government of Romania (GOR) during the transition period and has laid the foundation for the current UNICEF country program.  The grant facilitated partnership between UNICEF and the National Committee for Child Protection (NCPC) and helped mobilize additional resources. Projects addressed identified needs, were consistent with GOR reform objectives, and were implemented in collaboration with an extensive array of governmental and nongovernmental partners. Significant progress was made towards meeting program objectives in the pilot areas.  The foundation for expansion throughout the country has been laid, although mechanisms to coordinate program components must be developed before geographic expansion of project activities. Important changes in knowledge, attitudes, and practices affecting the health, education, and well-being of young children have occurred among authorities, professionals, and parents, and there is now explicit recognition of the need for alternatives to institutionalizing children with special needs.  Many successful demonstrations by NGOs and governmental agencies have been implemented.  The majority of institutions have decreased in size and improved their physical conditions. However, systems changes are not yet universal, and there is widespread frustration that little progress is being made despite substantial inputs and local changes.  In the present political context, local actions appear to offer the greatest opportunity for achieving change. Use of the mass media should be greatly intensified. In the Early Childhood Development and Family Education component, parents and private community and local leaders are increasingly involved in the education of children. A national curriculum based on the program has spread to almost half of Romania's kindergartens. Parent centers are also being established.  Adapting the existing Romanian system made the program readily accepted, and prospects for long-term sustainability look good. Social work has taken root in Romania.  The profession is gaining recognition within the Ministries, social work centers are being established, and there is increased collaboration among universities, NGOs, and local government. Practical training and field placements are beginning to complement the theoretical curriculum at the universities. Activities for handicapped children are making steady progress.  The new Law on Education calls for handicapped children to attend normal schools and those who attend special schools to be evaluated by a new Pedagogic Commission before institutional placement to ensure that educational potential and community integration are maximized. Activities to combat the institutionalization of children are breaking new ground but face many constraints. Encouraging steps have been taken to change the attitudes and practices of the Tutelary Authorities and members of the county Commissions for the Protection of Minors.  However, new approaches have not yet been integrated at the local level. Lessons learned are as follows: (1) The changes required by the transition in Romania have been more radical than anticipated and require adequate time to develop.  (2) Because Romanian professionals and decisionmakers have been isolated for many years, pilot projects may play a greater role in Romania than elsewhere.  Given the population's high level of education, adaptations are easily made when coupled with the motivation to make the changes.  (3) While continued advocacy with opponents of reform is needed, greater emphasis should be given to identifying and backing those committed to change.  This presupposes increased collaboration with grassroots, NGO, and private groups -- support for which should be intensified -- as well as selected government programs.  (4) Using a consistent group of consultants for the life of the project is an effective strategy.  (5) Collaborative projects are facilitated at the outset if partners clarify roles and lines of authority and establish collaborative mechanisms for communication and decisionmaking. The role of the NCPC has been compromised by controversies regarding its role and mandate.  (6) Projects meet their objectives and facilitate broader systemic change only when they build on the local system.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","EUR-0032-G-00-3039-00","","6/1/1996 12:00:00 AM","","Societies in transition|Child welfare services|Orphans|Orphanages|Handicapped persons|Laws and legislation|International organizations|Development cooperation|Local level|Host country cooperation|Community participation|Social workers|Indigenous private voluntary organizations|Attitude|Pilot projects|Preschool education|Social reform|Educational reform","Romania","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABR978.pdf","4,205 KB","002326 - U.N.

"Final evaluation of a Participating Agency Service Agreement (PASA) with the Division of Reproductive Health of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC/DRH) to provide TA in family planning logistics management, surveys, reproductive health epidemiology (RHE), and clinic management.  The evaluation covers the period 8/91-6/96 against an extended PACD of 9/97. CDC has provided TA in logistics management to more than 40 countries, and has prepared 109 contraceptive procurement tables for Ministries of Health, social security institutes, NGOs, cooperating agencies (CAs), international organizations, social marketing groups, and HIV/AIDS-prevention programs.  CDC logistics advisors helped some countries graduate from reliance on TA.  Graduation events should receive credit and become the object of planned TA interventions.  A new constellation of staffing skills among logistics advisors at CDC serve a wider community in addition to the Family Planning Logistics Management Project at John Snow, Inc.  These skills can be shared through collaboration, which was effective in the past and should be restored. Vertical distribution systems have provided a direct means of transporting contraceptives.  In a context of diminished resources, CDC should demonstrate two models, one in which contraceptives are distributed by central medical stores, and the other in which RH commodities are incrementally added to an existing distribution system for contraceptives. The objective of linking information gathered from surveys with logistics management was not achieved to the degree planned.  The technical challenges in linking two data systems that serve different purposes may be considerable, but the benefits could be substantial. CDC provided major TA for 15 surveys, with a median size of about 5,000 respondents, in the Caribbean, Central America, South America, and Eastern Europe.  Most were RH surveys, with content going substantially beyond the measurement of contraceptive prevalence; several included samples of males or emphasized the RH of young adults.  CDC assists in virtually all the phases of survey operations.  The quality of these surveys is very high, and there is strong evidence of collaboration with in- country counterparts and technology transfer.  CDC's TA for the surveys, which complement those of the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) project in important ways, has generally been initiated by USAID Missions and has typically occurred in a medium priority country with at least a moderately well-developed capacity for survey work.  CDC staff are praised for ""facilitating rather than directing"" the surveys they support. CDC is well positioned to improve the comparability with DHS surveys, make the data more generally available to other researchers, and develop more innovative designs for special purposes. Because no other CA has as great a potential as CDC to identify useful connections between logistics and surveys, it is especially important for CDC to pursue possible linkages in the future.  CDC also has a unique potential to develop and apply the indicators systematized by The EVALUATION Project. Training in RHE has been a unique and valuable activity by CDC.  No other agency provides this training. Changes in staff reduced the level of effort for this activity from 10% to about 5%, but CDC plans to devote more effort in the future to RHE training.  CDC held five RHE training courses (2 weeks each for about 20 trainees) in Bangladesh, Czech Republic, Mexico, and India.  Some trainees have become major contributors in international RH, and others developed high-quality research proposals that lead to sound published studies.  RHE training will also benefit staff from USAID and other agencies.  USAID and CDC can complement each other in ways that should be publicly acknowledged. Clinic management and patient flow analysis (PFA) activities decreased during the PASA as the DRH shifted to domestic HIV work. International service programs continue to use PFA to assess costs of services and to improve client satisfaction.  USAID's efforts to assess the cost-effectiveness of new RH services may be well served by these tools.","Project title: Family planning logistics management (FPLM)|Project title: Population technical assistance (POPTECH)","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","CCP-3024-Q-00-3012-00","","6/1/1996 12:00:00 AM","","Family planning promotion programs|Health care administration|Logistics|Procurement|Contraceptive agents and devices|Family planning clinics|Reproductive health|Epidemiology|Health professional education|Demographic surveys|Information networking|Development cooperation|Personnel|Client satisfaction","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABS935.pdf","217 KB","010110 - BHM International, Inc.|001131 - The Futures Group International, Inc.
