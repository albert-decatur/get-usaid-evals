"<p>The Strengthening Political Parties, Electoral and Legislative Processes (SPPELP) project operates on the hypotheses that: (1) strong electoral institutions and processes are fundamental to an inclusive, stable and lasting democracy in Nepal; (2) if parties were more representative and able to implement effective competitive electoral campaigns and the population had access to better information of policy differences, the political parties can better contribute to the democratic process in Nepal; (3) more comprehensive election monitoring and better informed media to cover election related issues will enable civil society initiatives to more effectively contribute to transparent electoral processes; and (4) more effective reviews and deliberation of bills of the Constituent Assembly (CA) incorporating input from constituents will make the the legislative process more transparent and will help the CA more effectively fulfill its democratic functions.&nbsp; With the SPPELP, USAID thereby tried to address: (1) what was perceived as weaknesses of the young Nepali democracy; (2)&nbsp; the capacity of political parties to run party organizations and to participate in competitive electoral campaigns; (3)&nbsp; the capacity of civil society to have better oversight of the political process; and (3) the institutional capacity of the CA and the Election Commission, Nepal (ECN).&nbsp; The summary of key evaluation questions are: (1) given two-and-half years of the program, do the objectives of the project remain relevant to Nepal's political development [and] are there new challenges which are not addressed by the program [and] what adjustments to the program are recommended; (2) to what extent is the project on track to reach its intermediate results and overall goals; (3) how effective is the program in engaging women, youth, Dalits, and other marginalized groups to contribute to development of national politics; (4) how effective is the relationship between the Consortium of Elections and Political Processes Strengthening (CEPPS) partners and key stakeholders?&nbsp; The evaluation showed that the SPPELP project is still on track to reach its goal even with the challenges that the political situation in Nepal has provided.&nbsp; (Excerpt, modified)</p>","'Solicitation Number: SOL-367-13-000007'|Evaluated project title: Nepal’s strengthening political parties, electoral and legislative processes (SPPELP)","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","12/1/2013 12:00:00 AM","","Political parties|Political participation|Elections|Electoral systems|Laws and legislation|Democratization|Youth|Women|Public awareness|Transparency|Accountability","Nepal","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00JZTD.pdf","1,484 KB","040828 - Organization Development Centre Inc.

"The Judicial Strengthening Project (JSP) in Macedonia is the third in a series of USAID-funded projects focused on the judicial sector and is designed to address both the demand and supply sides of judicial independence, effectiveness, and accountability.&nbsp; The project is organized into three components: (1) to support the development of organizations outside the judicial branch to advocate for policies to enhance the rule of law and the independence of the judicial sector (demand); (2) to partially build on the Judicial Reform Implementation Project (JRIP -- second project in the series) work with leading judicial branch actors on developing policies to strengthen judicial independence and improving operations to raise the quality of court processes (supply); and (3) to continue court room automation and judicial training (supply).&nbsp; The project operates in a highly politicized environment dominated by a single party in which continued judicial branch reform is a challenge.&nbsp;&nbsp;The evaluation team sought to provide answers to the following questions: (1) what is the progress to date on the stated project results; (2) how effective has been the project approach and interventions in achieving the expected results to date; (3) how well is the project communicating and collaborating with beneficiaries and&nbsp; counterparts in the implementation of project interventions; (4) based on results to date, is the project likely to engender sustainable and systematic development impacts after USAID funding has stopped [and] what should the implementer do to ensure sustainability and transfer of know-how; (5) given the progress to date, provide recommendation if the optional one year extension of JSP should be exercised; (6) does the project approach need to be modified in order to reflect the current justice sector environment [and] if so, how; (7) which selected actions and cross-cutting themes and corresponding activities should be further emphasized, modified or eliminated and why; and (8) what alternative approaches exist which could lead to better results and greater cost efficiency?&nbsp; The team concluded that, overall, JSP met the targets under the evaluation's specified requirements, as seen in the project's monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E) Plan.&nbsp; Nonetheless, the indicators included in the plan do not fully recognize or capture key project activities relevant to the overall goal of the project.&nbsp; The team concluded that targets were not very ambitious, or were tailored to match actual conditions.&nbsp; By contrast, the results are over-ambitious and at a much higher level of effect than the underlying activities could ever achieve.&nbsp; This is due in large part to the specification of results in the request for proposal and subsequent contract, which are quite difficult for USAID to change, but also to the lack of an explicit and systematically applied theory of change.&nbsp; (Excerpt, modified)","Evaluated project title: Judicial strengthening project (JSP)","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID-OAA-M-13-00011","","4/1/2014 12:00:00 AM","","Judicial reform|Access to justice|Civil society|Courts|Accountability|Professional training","Macedonia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00JZWR.pdf","576 KB","011933 - Social Impact, Inc.","","009560 - USAID.

"Schools in Macedonia have traditionally been divided along linguistic lines, eliminating the opportunity for children from different ethnic and language groups to interact and develop norms of trust and reciprocity.&nbsp; Instead, separation and division threatens to reduce accurate information flow across ethnic lines and to perpetuate stereotypes about ""other"" groups.&nbsp; The Interethnic Integration in Education project&nbsp;(IIEP) acts to build broad public understanding of the benefits of an integrated educational system in Macedonia.&nbsp; It works with a variety of actors to create ""the political, social, and economic environment needed for Macedonia to achieve sustained interethnic integration in schools, in other educational institutions and eventually all of society.""&nbsp; The project is implemented through four interrelated components that target all primary and secondary schools across Macedonia and build the capacity of the Ministry of Education and Science (MoES), the Bureau for Development of Education (BDE), the State Education Inspectorate (SEI), and the Vocational Education and Training Center (VETC) to support IIE activities.&nbsp; This evaluation provides answers to two types of questions: (1) determining if the project has met its objectives and (2) recommendation questions aimed at improving the current project implementation and informing future USAID efforts in interethnic educational integration.&nbsp; Evaluation questions are: (1) what are the progress and the effectiveness of the project's interventions to date on the project objectives; (2) how well is the project communicating with beneficiaries, the Government of Macedonia, other donors, and NGOs in the area of ethnic integration; (3) does the project approach need to be modified in order to reflect the reality of current ethnic relations [and] if so, how; (4) which selected actions and/or cross-cutting themes and corresponding activities should be further emphasized, modified, or eliminated, and why; (5) what should the implementer do to ensure sustainability; and (6) what existing alternative approaches could lead to better results?&nbsp; An overall conclusion follows the detailed project component analyses.&nbsp; Considering the size and complexity of the issue that the project seeks to address -- the interethnic integration of all schools at the primary and secondary level -- the project is performing remarkably well.&nbsp; The project is relevant and responsive to the context and ethnic realities present in Macedonia today; however, the disruptive influence of politics in school life, limited financing and opportunities for fundraising for activities, the segregating nature of the education system, and the lack of concrete professional and/or financial incentives to continually motivate teachers threatens the project's sustainability in the long term.

"The Ghana National Strategic Plan (NSP) for HIV and AIDS aims to reach 80% of all key populations by 2015 with a comprehensive package of HIV services, including prevention, treatment, and support.&nbsp; Under the strategy, a number of evidence-based services have been rolled out to key populations nationwide by the Ghana Aids Commission (GAC) and implementing partners.&nbsp; This evaluation, therefore, was conducted as a mid-point assessment in order to describe the achievements and challenges of the ongoing implementation of the National HIV Prevention Program for female sex workers (FSW) and men who have sex with men (MSM) in Ghana.&nbsp; This performance evaluation employed a mixed-methods approach in order to assess the following key study aims: (1) describe how services are being delivered; (2) document barriers and facilitators to accessing health services for MSM and FSW as well as the larger structural influences on sexual and health seeking behaviors such as stigma and discrimination; (3) assess whether organizations directly providing services to FSW and MSM have standard operating procedures, functional supervision mechanisms, monitoring and reporting systems, and administrative, management, and planning capacity; and (5) document efforts to increase stakeholder and organizational coordination and to address social, cultural, religious, political, and legal barriers to HIV prevention efforts among FSW and MSM.&nbsp; Study findings suggest that leadership provided by the GAC and the Technical Working Group (TWG) are strong, and while some greater capacity building and standardization could improve data collection and reporting and standardize service availability, organizations are striving to adhere to the service package and to provide a high quality product.&nbsp; This effort has resulted in high demand for services and a positive reputation for respectful treatment and confidentiality among FSW and MSM.&nbsp; Overall, recommendations focus on the ways in which the program can continue to be strengthened and expanded to better meet demand for services without sacrificing the reputation for service quality upon which that demand is predicated.&nbsp; (Excerpt, modified)","Also known as: A performance evaluation of the national HIV prevention program for female sex workers and men who have sex with men in Ghana|Project title: MEASURE evaluation phase III","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","GHA-A-00-08-00003-00","","7/1/2014 12:00:00 AM","","","Ghana","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00K265.pdf","2,433 KB","000821 - University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

"The Programme de Bonne Gouvernance (PBG) is a five-year project (2009-2014).&nbsp; PBG focused on three tracks -- civil society, parliaments and local government -- that correspond to the three Intermediate Results: (1) citizens demand accountability; (2) selected parliaments are more democratic and effective; and (3) laws, policies and procedures for decentralization are established and implemented.&nbsp; By mid-course in the project, PBG concentrated on support to revenue management by twelve Decentralized Territorial Entities (Entites territoriales decentralisees or&nbsp;ETDs) with citizen participation.&nbsp; As specified in the scope of work, the main evaluation objectives are to determine answers to the following two questions: (1) what is the performance of the program in strengthening institutions and increasing citizen demand; and (2) to what extent is the project theory of change valid that strengthened institutions and increased demand result in better service delivery? &nbsp;In addition, this performance evaluation seeks to answer the following evaluation questions: (1) do institutions have increased capacity and strength; (2) has there been an increased citizen demand for accountable governance; (3) were there improvements in delivery of public services in the target local governments; (4) what lessons have been learned regarding implementation strategies; and (5) what are findings related to cross-cutting themes of gender and urban-rural impact?&nbsp; Some key evaluation questions address the effectiveness of revenue generation among the ETDs or Decentralized Territorial Entity (Entites territoriales decentralisees), and the most effective methods to achieve these results.&nbsp; The overall evaluation conclusion is that the project was very well-managed despite a highly challenging context and vast project scope.&nbsp; It was also concluded that working with local government on a pilot basis has tentatively confirmed the fundamental principle of citizen participation for effective decentralization.

"The Chitral Child Survival Project (CCSP) was implemented from 2008 to 2014.&nbsp; The CCSP's strategic objective was to reduce maternal and neonatal mortality and morbidity by increasing the access to and utilization of the obstetric and neonatal continuum of care in the target communities.&nbsp; The four intermediate results were envisaged to contribute to the project purpose through: (1) increased awareness of obstetric and neonatal complications, increased utilization of &nbsp;'Birth Preparedness and Complications Readiness' (BPCR) plans, and an improved enabling environment for maternal, neonatal and child health (MNCH); (2) strengthened community midwife (CMW) referral linkages for obstetric and neonatal services; (3) increased availability of trained CMWs; and, (4) reduced financial barriers to&nbsp;accessing obstetric and neonatal continuum of care.&nbsp; Data from the end line survey report, the Community Based Savings Group (CBSG) assessment reports, and project Management Information System (MIS) show that the project has achieved remarkable results in terms of overall outcomes and outputs particularly in improving skilled birth attendance, continuum of care and increasing use of maternal care services by women participating in CBSGs.&nbsp; These improvements will contribute to reducing morbidity and mortality of mothers and neonates in the program population, however, overall impact on maternal and infant deaths has to be measured in the longer run.&nbsp; (Excerpt, modified)","Cover title: Final evaluation : Chitral child survival project, Chitral, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan|Project title: Chitral child survival program (CCSP)","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","GHN-A-00-08-00010-00|AID-GHN-A-00-08-00010","","6/1/2014 12:00:00 AM","","","Pakistan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00K2GC.pdf","14,054 KB","006077 - Aga Khan Foundation U.S.A.","","011222 - USAID.
