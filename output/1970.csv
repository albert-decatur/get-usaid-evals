"EVALUATES THE PERFORMANCE OF THE STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK  (SUNY) CONTRACT EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH TEAM IN THE BRAZILIAN ELEMENTARY EDUACATION PROJECT. PURPOSE OF PROJECT WAS TO IMPROVE PRIMARY AND BASIC EDUCATION BY RESEARCHING PROBLEM AREAS IN EDUCATION AND ASSISTING INDIVIDUAL STATES WITH THE DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF PROBLEM-CORRECTIVE PROGRAMS. ONE PROBLEM AREA TO BE FOCUSSED ON BY THE TEAM WAS THE CAUSES FOR DROP-OUT & REPETITION IN BRAZILIAN PRIMARY SCHOOLS. A NUMBER OF DIFFICULTIES HAMPERED THE PROJECT, INCLUDING A DELAY IN THE SELECTION OF THE BRAZILIAN COUNTERPARTS AND THE LANGUAGE FACILITY OF THE US TECHS. THE SHORT DURATION OF THE SUNY CONTRACT (2 YRS)LIMITED THE AMOUNT OT TECH ASSISTANCE THISTEAM WAS ABLE TO PROVIDE. NEVERTHELESS,THE SUNY TEAM ACHIEVED A NUMBER OF OBJECTIVES. THE CRITICAL PROBLEMS OF DROP-OUT/REPEATS WERE SUCCESSFULLY BROUGHT TO THE ATTENTION OF OFFICIALS IN THE FEDERAL MINISTRY OF EDUC AND IN THE STATES. THE TEAM PRESENTED STATISTICAL DATA TO THESE OFFICIALS,IDENTIFIED THE CAUSES OF THIS PROBLEM,AND DISCUSSED THIS INFORMATION THROUGH STATE MEETINGS,REGIONAL SEMINARS & A NATL CONFERENCE. A BULLETIN ON THIS PROBLEM WAS PREPARED & DISTRIBUTED. A MODEL PLAN TO REDUCE DROP-OUT/REPEATS WAS DEVELOPED AND TRIED-OUT IN SELECTED SCHOOLS IN RECIFE,PORTO ALEGRE,MACEIO,CURITIBA,AND GOIANIA. MANY OTHER SCHOOLS FOLLOWED SUIT. A VERY FRUITFUL STUDY WAS MADE OF THE FIRST GRADE IN PORTO ALEGRE. THE INFORMATION GAINED IN THIS STUDY HAS AIDED THE STATE TO FORMULATE NEW EDUCATIONAL POLICIES. UNDER A NEW PROJECT,THE STUDY WILL BE EXTENDED TO COVER THE WHOLE STATE OF RIO GRANDE DE SUL. THE PARTICIPANTS TRAINED UNDER THE PROJECT WERE WELL-SELECTED AND HAVE RETURNED TO PROVIDE TRAINING TO TEACHER TRAINERS,TO SERVE ON THE FACULTIES OOF EDUCATION IN UNIVERSIIES,AND TO WORK WITH STATE COUNCILS OF EDUCATION OR IN SECRETARIATS OF EDUCATION.

"Special evaluation by joint Philippine-American team of 1968-70 operations of Provincial Development Assistance Project (PDAP). Project undertaken to help provincial governments do better job in planning/executing programs in agriculture, infrastructure/public works & financial development priority areas. Team assessed PDAP headquarters operations & status of dvlp programs in 8 PDAP-pilot provinces. Varying levels of achievement observed in provinces; most progress evident in public works/equipment area due largely to USAID assistance in US surplus acquisitions.  Agricultural efforts beset by shortage of field technicians & lack of coordination efforts with national/provincial agricultural authorities.  Financial area most deficient with great need to improve provincial budgeting & implement/enforce real property tax assessment/collections, thereby increasing revenue. Evaluators emphasize that strong commitment of provincial governors critical to project success.  Provincial Dvlp Councils, previously unwieldy & inactive, must be streamlined.  Dvlp Staffs require PDAP training & full-time directors to develop/manage quality programs. Integrated comprehensive approaches based on feasibility assessment must replace hastily-conceived, narrow action programs. Team judges PDAP headquarters emphasis on pilot province operations wise, but faults PDAP for not fully utilizing staff/resources, particularly in training/research.  Evaluators call for more dynamic/concerted approach. Recommendations include:  1) PDAP Planning/Coordinating Committee should be converted into Exec Committee to meet monthly & act as strong policy arm; 2) National Econ Council (NEC) Chairman should no longer serve as Project Director; rather NEC rep should be appointed director & full-time deputy director should oversee operations/supervise staff; 3) Deputy director should develop 12-18 month action program with specific targets; 4) Organizational units should be created to offer field expertise in consultation/training/policy research; 5) Ongoing activities should be replaced by one-year coop agreements with provinces; prior surveys; target objectives.","Evaluation period: 1 Jan1968-4 Sep1970","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","9/1/1970 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural extension|TAX COLLECTION|Taxation|Government policy|RICE|Public works|Agricultural policy|Agricultural planning|Economic planning|Fiscal policy|Financial management|Provinces|Development planning|Project change|Limited data plus","Philippines","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAA414A1.pdf","526 KB","008592 - USAID.

"EVALUATES PROGRESS OF A TEXTBOOK PLANNING PROGRAM FROM 1966 TO 6/70. PROGRAM WAS DESIGNED TO ESTABLISH IN THE AFGHANISTAN MINISTRY OF EDUCATION A CAPABILITY FOR CREATION AND CONTINUED PRODUCTION OF MODERN PRIMARY SCHOOL TEXTBOOKS, TEACHERS' GUIDES AND SUPPLEMENTARY TEACHING MATERIALS IN SUPPORT OF THE NEW CURRICULUM DEVELOPED IN THE PROJECT. EVALUATION WAS CONDUCTED THROUGH ON-SITE INSPECTION AT KABUL. THE EDUCATION PRESS, MANAGED BY THE FRANKLIN BOOK PROGRAM & THE GOVT PRINTING PRESS, HAVE THE EQUIPMENT TO PRODUCE THE TEXTBOOKS AND TEACHERS' GUIDES, BUT WILL REQUIRE A SCHEDULE OF MANUFACTURING REQUIREMENTS TO PLAN COMPOSITION AND PRESSWORK AND TO ORDER PAPER. PAPER MUST BE IMPORTED, REQUIRING AN ORDERING LEAD TIME OF AT LEAST 9 MONTHS. DISTRIBUTION METHODS ARE HAMPERED BY NONAVAILABILITY OF TRANSPORT AND THE FACT THAT THE SCHOOLS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR TRANSPORTING TEXTS. EVALUATION RECOMMENDS ESTABLISHMENT OF A BOOK PRODUCTION FACILITY TO GATHER AND ORGANIZE NECESSARY STATISTICS GOVERNING TEXTBOOK REQUIREMENTS, TO ADVISE/DIRECT ILLUSTRATORS AND TYPOGRAPHERS OF CALLIGRAPHERS ON BOOK PRODUCTION REQUIREMENTS, TO PLAN & DESIGN TEXTBOOK FORMATS, TO PLAN PRODUCTION SCHEDULES WITH POSSIBLE ADAPTATION TO NEW TECHNOLOGIES, TO DEVISE STORAGE AND DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES,AND TO MAINTAIN FISCAL CONTROL. ALSO RECOMMENDS ASSIGNMENT OF AN EXPERIENCED BOOK PRODUCTION MANAGER TO DIRECT THE FACILITY AND TO TRAIN AN AFGHAN AS SUCCESSOR.

"Evaluates project to establish a police telecommunicatns system in Costa Rica from 1966 to 1970. On-site observatns were made. Evaluator judges overall proj performance poor &amp; recommends considerable changes as soon as time &amp; funds permit. Indicated statn locatns are not necessarily correct &amp; some are not operating. The 13 police telecommunicatns networks reflect a lack of long-range planning for maximum coverage utilizing the minimum number of radios and providing flexibility for expansn and cross communicatn compatibility. The administrative command and single sideband nets all are on different frequencies and should be placed on one frequency since they all service the same elements of the police and often have the radios located in the same room. Single sidebands nets are presently restricted to daytime use due to unusable nighttime frequencies. Radios of various nets are not in use due to a lack of ability to use them, lack of spare parts for repairs, and/or a preference not to use radios. Although the central warehouse is clean and orderly and stock control cards are accurate and up-to-date, the quantity of radios and other electronic equipmt not in use is excessive; the repair sectn is a confusion of spare parts; small hand tools are limited; work orders on equipmt deadlined or repaired are non-existant; and funds for repairs are limited and difficult to obtain. Recommendatns are to replace the present tech with a Spanish-speaking telecommunicatns advisor who will submit monthly reports and be under PSD supervisn. One frequency near the center of the assigned block should be country-wide frequency with one channel of all radios tuned to it. All low-band nets should be replaced with high bands on the same block of frequencies and consolidated into a single integrated country-wide backbone system linking San Jose with all sectns of Costa Rica. The number of statns should be increased; trng programs instituted; and lighted maps installed in control rooms. Further, implementatn should not commence until the Govt of Costa Rica has given assurance that it will comply with its part of the plan.","Evaluation period: 1 Jan 1966-18 May 1970","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","5/1/1970 12:00:00 AM","","PUBLIC SAFETY|Equipment maintenance|Radio|Telecommunications technology|Police services|Public administration","Costa Rica","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAR415.pdf","869 KB","003222 - USAID.

"EVALUATES PROGRESS FROM MAY 1967 TO TERMINATION IN DEC 1969 OF SUBPROJECT DESIGNED TO OFFER VOCATIONAL TRAINING TO UNEMPLOYED SLUM DWELLERS IN PANAMA UNDER USAID MANPOWER TRAINING & UTILIZATION PROJECT. EXAMINATION INCLUDED VISITS TO TRAINING CENTERS,DISCUSSIONS WITH TRAINEES & WITH HEADS OF 2 TRADE ASSOCIATIONS. TRAINING WAS PROVIDED FOR 830 UNEMPLOYED HEADS OF FAMILIES IN AN ""ACCELERATED SKILLED & SEMI-SKILLED TRAINING PROGRAM"" COMPRISING 47 COURSES AT 6 LOCATIONS. THE INSTITUTO PARA LA FORMACION Y APROVECHAMIENTO DE RECURSOS HUMANOS (IFARHU), A NATIONAL AGENCY FOR PROMOTING EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITY,BECAME THE INSTITUTIONAL BASE FOR ADULT VOCATIONAL TRNG AND CONTINUED THIS TRNG AFTER THE SUBPROJECT ENDED. HOWEVER,TRNG ALLOWANCES GIVEN TO PARTICIPANTS FOR FAMILY SUPPORT WERE DISCONTINUED AT THE END OF THE PROJ,RESULTING IN AN INCREASED DROPOUT RATE. SUBPROJ EMPHASIS WAS ON TRNG FOR EMPLOYMENT,WITH COURSES BEING TAILORED TO FILL RECOGNIZED JOB VACANCIES. TRNG WAS OFFERED IN THE VICINITY OF GREATEST DEMAND FOR WORK,NOTABLY IN PANAMA CITY & COLON,BUT ALSO IN 4 PROVINCIAL CITIES. A NOTABLE PROJ ACHIEVEMENT WAS THE COOPERATION PARTICIPATION OF EMPLOYERS' ASSOCIATIONS. CREATION & CONTINUATION OF THE SERVICIO DE EMPLEO(SENE) WAS ONE OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL ELEMENTS OF THE PROJ,PROVIDING A CONTINUING PLACEMENT SERVICE FOR TRAINEES. SENE IS NOW SUPPORTED BY THE MINISTRY OF LABOR. GOOD MEDIA PUBLICITY INCREASED AWARENESS OF THE  TRNG PROGRAM. RECOMMENDATIONS HAVE BEEN MADE FOR FUTURE PROJS THAT WOULD DRAW ON SUCCESSFUL PROG ELEMENTS,AND ON PERSONNEL FROM THE ACCELERATED TRNG PROGRAM. ADDITIONAL TECH ASSISTANCE WOULD IMPROVE THE JOB DVLP,COUNSELING,& TESTING ACTIVITIES OF SENE. EVALUATOR RECOMMENDS THAT FULL-TIME PROJ COORDINATOR BE APPOINTED FOR FUTURE PROJS,THAT FOLLOW-UP TECHNIQUES BE ADOPTED TO TRACK GRADUATE TRAINEES,THAT BUDGET INFO BE DEVELOPED TO PROVIDE UNIT COSTS OF TRNG BY COURSE AND BY TR AINEE,AND THAT DROP-OUT PERCENTAGES BE CALULATED.

"Evaluates Mississippi State Univ (MSU)'s performance in assisting LDC's with seed processing & testing from 3/57 to 6/70.  Proj purposes were to:  1. assess present LDC seed needs & improve LDC programs; 2. develop task order financing methods & future program funding requirements, and 3. develop seed & crop improvement project proposals responsive to LDC's changing needs. Evaluatn methodology undefined. Evaluatn team feels MSU assistance has resulted in steadily increasing budgets over the past 12 years.  MSU has assembled and trained a staff of qualified people on all phases of work and been responsive to technical assistance & training requests. Program has resulted in the development of a prototype seed dryer & handbook on seed drying, seed processing installatn plans, seed testing equipment, and seed processing handbook.  Other beneficial activities have been a seed storage & packaging study; design & specificatn of seed facilities; advice on seed programs; design & testing of low-cost walk-in germinators; assistance of missions, contractors, and sponsored visitors; seed improvements; officer sector training; etc. Team feels that past MSU performance warrants that contract activities be renewed, redefined, and expanded.  Recommendations are that:  1. the 5/27/70 speech of ""Changing Seed Program Needs of LDC's"" be edited & distributed to all USAID's; 2. an in-depth evaluation be made of 2 Latin American countries assisted by MSU; 3. a study and report be made of successes & failures of seed programs in 3 AID-assisted countries; 4. examples identified of profitability which offer sufficient inducement as well as too-low profitability; 5. rural devel, food, and agricultural personnel receive adequate briefing concerning seed programs at regional meetings; and 6. missions receive policy guidelines & implementation instructions on all phases of LDC changing seed program needs and on any ""New Contract Instrument with MSU"".","Evaluation period: 18 Mar 1957-31 Jun 1970","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","6/1/1970 12:00:00 AM","","Seed production|Agribusiness|Seeds|CROP YIELD|Varietal research|Financial management|SEED TESTING|Agricultural storage facilities|Technical assistance|Project change","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAC616C1.pdf","6,811 KB","000035 - U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)","","","English","application/pdf","Sector level evaluation|Pre evaluation data|Multi country evaluation|Evaluation team|Indepth evaluation","","TIBBUTT, THEODORE V.|MONCADA, FRANCIS J.|et al.","","31 Jun 1970","","AID/W-607","","REPORT OF THE SPECIAL TASK FORCE ESTABLISHED TO REVIEW & EVALUATE THE MISSISSIPPI STATE UNIVERSITY SEED PROJECT - AID/607 : SEED PROCESSING & TESTING (ON CAMPUS REVIEW)","","PD-AAC-616-C1","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc1MzU0","Technical Assistance","9310203"
"EVALUATES THE AID-FINANCED PROGRAM OF THE AMERICAN INSTITUTE FOR FREE LABOR DEVELOPMENT IN GUYANA FROM 1962 TO 7/70. EVALUATION INCLUDED INTERVIEWS WITH LOCAL OFFICIALS AND LABOR LEADERS AND OBSERVATION OF TRAINING. THE ALFLD PROGRAM CONTINUES TO PROVIDE EFFECTIVE SUPPORT FOR THE FREE LABOR MOVEMENT IN GUYANA. ITS MOST SOLID IMPACT HAS BEEN IN THE TRAINING OF LABOR LEADERS IN THE US. THE IMPACT OF IN-COUNTRY LABOR EDUCATION AND THE SMALL SOCIAL PROJECTS HAVE FALLEN SHORT OF THE POTENTIAL THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN REALIZED. HOWEVER, THE VOCATIONAL EDUCATION PROGRAM AT THE GUYANA INDUSTRIAL TRAINING CENTER IS HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL. THE LABOR EDUCATION PROGRAM IN GUYANA HAS NOT BEEN ORGANIZED WITH SUFFICIENT THOROUGHNESS: THERE ARE DEFICIENCIES IN OVERALL COURSE PLANNING, INSTRUCTION, AND AVAILABILITY OF TEXTBOOKS AND OTHER COURSE MATERIALS,AND EDUCATION OF THE RANK AND FILE HAS BEEN NEGLECTED. FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO THE INADEQUATE DEVELOPMENT OF LABOR EDUCATION IN GUYANA INCLUDE: THE ABSENCE OF A REALISTIC PLAN AGREED UPON BY THE GUYANA TRADE UNION COUNCIL (TUC) AND AIFLD; INSUFFICIENT DEPTH OF PROFESSIONAL SUPPORT BY AIFLD; CONFUSION AND FINANCIAL COMPLICATIONS CAUSED BY THE CREATION OFTHE CRITCHLOW LABOR COLLEGE; AND MISUNDERSTANDINGS AND DIFFERENCES OF OPINION BETWEEN AIFLD AND USAID/G. A MAJOR SOURCE OF THE PROBLEM IS THE FINANCIAL STRAIN ON TUC TO MAINTAIN AND OPERATE CRITCHLOW LABOR COLLEGE. THUS, THE TUC ENCOURAGES THE FLOW OF AIFLD FUNDS TO CRITCHLOW AND DISCOURAGES THEIR USE FOR EDUCATION IN THE FIELD. THE SOLUTION LIES IN THE ROUGH PLANNING OF A PROGRAM, BASED ON A FRESH ASSESSMENT OF NEEDS, IN WHICH WORKER EDUCATION AT THE GRASS ROOTS AND COURSES AT CRITCHLOW PLAY COMPLEMENTARY ROLES. THE SMALL SOCIAL IMPACT PROJECTS HAVE BEEN GENERALLY SUCCESSFUL BUT THE OVERALL PROGRAM HAS BEEN TOO LIMITED TO ACHIEVE ANY MAJOR IMPACT. CONSEQUENTLY, USAID AND ALFLD ARE NOT DEVELOPING ANY NEW IMPACT PROJECTS. ALFLD PROGRAM MGMT IS HAMPERED BY A LACK OF MUTUAL CONFIDENCE BETWEEN USAID/G AND ALFLD. ALFLD SHOULD REVISE ITS ANNUAL ""COUNTRY LABOR PLAN"" PROCEDURE TO MAKE IT A MORE REALISTIC TOOL FOR PROG PLNG & NEGOTIATION WITH USAID/G.","Attached to PD-AAB-044|Evaluation period: Through 1 Jul 1970","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","7/1/1970 12:00:00 AM","","Vocational training|Institution building|Labor unions|Top level managers|Management training|Worker participation","Guyana","","","000256 - American Technical Assistance Corp.

"EVALUATES THE AID-FINANCED PROGRAM OF THE AMERICAN INSTITUTE FOR FREE LABOR DEVELOPMENT (AIFLD) IN BRAZIL, FROM 1963 TO 7/70. AIFLD PROVIDES LABOR EDUCATION TO ASSIST IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF FREE AND DEMOCRATIC TRADE UNIONS. EVALUATION INCLUDED INTERVIEWS WITH USAID OFFICIALS, BRAZILIAN GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, AND LABOR LEADERS. CURRENT POLITICAL CONDITIONS IN  BRAZIL ARE NOT CONDUCIVE TO DEVELOPMENT OF FREE AND DEMOCRATIC TRADE UNIONS. GIVEN THE LIMITED OPTIONS AVAILABLE TO THE US, THE AIFLD PROGRAM HAS ACHIEVED A CONSIDERABLE IMPACT ON THE LABOR MOVEMENT WITH MODERATE RESOURCES, AND PARTICULARLY ON LABOR LEADERSHIP. AIFLD HAS SUCCEEDED IN DEVELOPING AN EFFICIENT AND PROFESSIONAL UNION LEADERSHIP EDUCATION PROGRAM. AIFLD HAS ALSO PROVIDED SPECIAL TRAINING IN COOPERATIVES AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT AS A MEANS OF STRENGHTENING THE ORGANIZATION OF RURAL WORKERS. THE SMALL PROJECTS PROGRAM OF AIFLD (MAINLY CONSTRUCTION OR PURCHASE OF UNION HALLS FOR UNION AND SOCIAL SERVICES) IS EXCELLENTLY MANAGED. THE NORTHEAST PROGRAM OF AIFLD, WHILE OVERLY AMBITIONS AT FIRST, IS STEADILY GAINING IN EFFECTIVENESS. THE EXPERIMENTAL PROGRAM IN THE SOUTHERN PART OF THE COUNTRY, CHIEFLY CONDUCTING COURSES IN RURAL DEVELOPMENT AND AGRICULTURE, IS JUDGED HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL. THE IMPACT OF THE AIFLD PROGRAM TENDS TO BE WEAKEST IN THE MAJOR URBAN CENTERS AND IN THE KEY UNIONS. REASONS FOR THE LESSEND IMPACT OF THE AIFLD PROGRAM INCLUDE: (1)  AFFILIATION OF SOME UNIONS WITH THE NON-AFL-CIO WING OF AMERICAN LABOR; (2) GREATER SOPHISTICATION OF CITY UNIONISTS, MAKING LABOR TRAINING COURSES OF LESS INTEREST TO THEM; (3) RELUCTANCE ON THE PART OF SOME UNION LEADERS (WITH LEFT-LEANING MEMBERSHIP) OF MAINTAINING TOO CLOSE RELATIONS WITH AIFLD. LESS CONSERVATIVE POINTS OF VIEW AND SHORTER, MORE SOPHISTICATED COURSES SHOULD BE INCORPORATED INTO THE URBAN PROGRAMS. EVALUATORS RECOMMEND THAT AIFLD CONTINUE TO MAINTAIN AN EFFECTIVE BALANCE IN ITS LABOR EDUCATION ACTIVITIES BETWEEN THE TEACHING OF A GENERAL FREE TRADE UNIONIST PHILOSOPHY AND THE TEACHING PF PRACTICAL SUBJECTS PARTICULARLY APPLICABLE TO THE CONDUCT OF UNION AFFAIRS IN BRAZIL.","Attached to PD-AAB-044|Evaluation period: Through 1 Jul 1970","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/LA-633","","7/1/1970 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural development|Agricultural education|Community development|Institution building|Collective bargaining|Technical training|Labor unions|Top level managers|Management training|Worker participation","Brazil","","","000256 - American Technical Assistance Corp.

"REPORT CONTAINS A DETAILED SURVEY OF ECUADOR'S POLICE FORCES, THE NATIONAL CIVIL POLICE (NCP), AND THE CUSTOMS POLICE (CP), AS WELL AS AN EVALUATION OF AID'S PUBLIC SAFETY PROGRAM IN THAT COUNTRY, FROM 1959 TO 1969. THE AID PUBLIC SAFETY PROGRAM CONSISTS OF TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE, COMMODITIES, AND PARTICIPANT TRAINING DESIGNED TO ESTABLIHED AN ADEQUATE LEVEL O LAW ENFORCEMENT AND INTERNAL SECURITY FOR ORDERLY POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. SOME IMPORTANT OBJECTIVES OF THE PUBLIC SAFETY PROGRAM HAVE BEEN REACHED. SINCE THE INITIAL PUBLIC SAFETY SURVEY OF 1959, THE NCP HAS IMPROVED IN ALMOST ALL RESPECTS. THE KEY TO THIS IMPROVEMENT HAS BEEN THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A SOUND SYSTEM OF PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT WHICH PERMITTED NCP TO PROTECT ITSELF FROM HARMFUL OUTSIED INTERFERENCES IN PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT. THE AID PROGRAM HAS CONTRIBUTED TO OTHER ADVANCES SUCH AS THE ESTABLISHMENT OF BETTER NCP ORGANIZATION, THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A CAPABILITY FOR THE CONTROL OF URBAN CIVIL DISTURBANCES, AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE NCP TRAINING INSTITUTION. NCP CAN MEET ABOUT HALF OF THE PROJECTED LAW ENFORCEMENT NEEDS OF ECUADOR. THE CP, ON THE OTHER HAND, HAS MADE FEW ADVANCES SINCE 1959. THE USAID DECISION TO TERMINATE PUBLIC SAFETY SUPPORT TO THIS UNIT IN 1966 WAS SOUND. THE CP MUST FIRST ESTABLISH A PERSONNEL SYSTEM SIMILAR TO THAT OF THE NCP BEFORE IT WILL BE ABLE TO PERMANENTLY IMPROVE ITS CONDITION. OTHER OBJECTIVES OF THE PUBLIC SAFETY PROGRAM ARE ONLY ABOUT 50% ACHIEVED. THESE INCLUDE DEVELOPMENT OF ADEQUATE RURAL POLICE CAPABILITIES, ADEQUATE EQUIPMENT FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND MOBILITY, IMPROVEMENT OF CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIVE PROCEDURES, CIVIL INTELLIGNECE, AND IMPROVED PATROL OPERATIONS. THERE ARE SOME AREAS IN WHICH NEW INITIATIVES MUST BE MADE AND GREATER EMPHASIS BE PLACED, SUCH AS PLANNING AND RESEARCH, INSPECTIONS, BUDGETING YOUTH DELINQUENCY AND CRIME PREVENTION, CORRECTIONS, PROBATION, AND PAROLE. IN SPITE OF THESE IMPROVEMENTS, THE REPORT ASSESSES THE JUSTICE AND ORDER SITUATION IN ECUADOR AS BEING ONE ON INCREASING COMMON CRIME AND CIVIL DISTURBANCE IN THE FORM OF RIOTS, LAND INVASIONS, AND URBAN TERROR.","Evaluation period: 1 Jan 1959-1 Sep 1969","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","2/1/1970 12:00:00 AM","","Counterinsurgency|Customs operations|Police|Vocational training|Police services|Public administration|Public safety|Training","Ecuador","","","003222 - USAID.

"EVALUATES PROGRAM OF THE AMERICAN INSTITUTE FOR FREE LABOR DEVELOPMENT (AIFLD) IN HONDURAS FROM INCEPTION IN 1/63 TO 7/70. AIFLD PROVIDES LABOR EDUCATION TO ASSIST IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF FREE AND DEMOCRATIC TRADE UNIONS. EVALUATION INCLUDED INTERVIEWS WITH USAID PERSONNEL, HOST GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, AND LABOR LEADERS. THE HONDURAN PROGRAM WAS AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE CENTRAL AMERICAN LABOR EDUCATION INSTITUTE (IESCA), THE USAID-SPONSORED, AIFLD-OPERATED EDUCATION PROGRAM FOR TRADE UNIONISTS FROM ALL OF CENTRAL AMERICA. IESCA WAS MOVED FROM HONDURAS TO GUATEMALA EARLY IN 1970 AND THE HONDURAN NATIONAL AIFLD PROGRAM, THAT SHARED ITS INSTRUCTORS AND ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPORT, NOW OPERATES INDEPENDENTLY WITH A MUCH-REDUCED STAFF. IN GENERAL, AIFLD HAS BEEN AN IMPORTANT INFLUENCE IN DEVELOPING TRADE UNION LEADERSHIP. THE 2 PRINCIPAL REGIONAL LABOR FEDERATIONS NOW HAVE THE INSTRUCTIONAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE ABILITY TO OPERATE THEIR OWN EDUCATION PROGRAMS. THEIR SEVERELY LIMITED FINANCIAL RESOURCES, HOWEVER, WILL MAKE THIS UNLIKELY DURING THE NEXT 5 YEARS. AUTHORS RECOMMEND THAT AIFLD CONCENTRATE ON: (1) PROVIDING ASSISTANCE AT MORE SOPHISTICATED LEVELS, WHILE (2) AIDING THE FEDERATIONS IN FINANCING AND ADMINISTERING THEIR OWN BASIC LABOR EDUCATION PROGRAMS, AND (3) TRAINING INSTRUCTORS TO PROFESSIONALIZE THE TEACHING OF BASIC COURSES. EVALUATORS FURTHER RECOMMEND THAT AIFLD SET SPECIFIC GOALS FOR LABOR EDUCATION AND IDENTIFY ALTERNATIVES FOR REACHING THEM. TO DATE, AIFLD HAS OPERATED WITH THE IMPRESSION THAT IT WILL GIVE COURSE AFTER COURSE INDEFINITELY. AIFLD'S SOCIAL PROJECTS HAVE HAD SIGNIFICANT IMPACT. THE THIRD WEEK OF EACH 4-WEEK REGIONAL COURSE FOR CAMPESINOS IS ""ACTION WEEK"" WHEREIN STUDENTS GET PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE ASSISTING LOCAL COMMUNITIES WITH SOCIAL PROJECTS. SINCE 1964, 21 CONSTRUCTION EFFORTS HAVE BEEN COMPLETED INCLUDING SCHOOLS, ROADS, AND WATER SYSTEMS, WITH WORK AND FUNDING COMING PRIMARILY FROM THE COURSE PARTICIPANTS AND COMMUNITIES. THE AIFLD CONTRIBUTION AVERAGES LESS THAN $250 PER COURSE FOR THE PROJECT WORK.","Attached to PD-AAB-044|Evaluation period: Through 1 Jul 1970","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","7/1/1970 12:00:00 AM","","Community development|Collective bargaining|Technical training|Institution building|Labor unions|Top level managers|Management training|Worker participation|Project change","Honduras","","","000256 - American Technical Assistance Corp.

"EVALUATES PROGRAM EFFECTIVENESS AND MANAGEMENT OF THE AMERICAN INSTITUTE FOR FREE LABOR DEVELOPMENT (AIFLD) IN PROMOTING FREE, DEMOCRATIC LABOR UNIONS IN SOUTH AMERICA, FROM 1962 T0 7/70. TO REPRESENT AIFLD'S PROGRAM AS A WHOLE, THE REPORT EVALUATES AIFLD OPERATIONS IN 3 COUNTRIES: BRAZIL, GUYANA, AND HONDURAS. EVALUATION INCLUDED INTERVIEWS WITH USAID PERSONNEL, HOST GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, AND LABOR LEADERS AS WELL AS OBSERVATION OF TRAINING AND REVIEW OF PROJECT DOCUMENTATION. (FOR DETAILS OF THE COUNTRY-SPECIFIC SECTIONS OF THIS REPORT, SEE XD-AAB-044-A, XD-AAB-044-B1.) IN ALL 3 COUNTRIES, THE AIFLD LABOR EDUCATION PROGRAM AND SOCIAL PROJECTS HAVE GENERALLY CONTRIBUTED TO THE GROWTH IN UNION ACTIVITY. MAJOR IMPROVEMENTS IN AIFLD MANAGEMENT ARE CALLED FOR. THE MOST SERIOUS SHORTCOMINGS IN AIFLD MANAGEMENT ARE THE ABSENCE OF CLEAR OPERATIONAL OBJECTIVES,A TIME FRAME FOR ACHIEVING THEM, AN EXPLICIT STRATEGY, A CONSIDERATION OF ALTERNATIVE PROGRAMS, AND AN INFORMATION SYSTEM FOR SELF-EVALUATION AND PROGRAM MODIFICATION. AUTHORS RECOMMEND THAT AIFLD CREATE A SENIOR STAFF POSITION FOR PLANNING, EVALUATION, AND CONTROL. REPORT ALSO CONTAINS VARIOUS BUDGETARY, FINANCIAL CONTROL, AND INTERNAL MANAGEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS. THE EDUCATION PROGRAMS IN ALL 3 COUNTRIES HAVE HAD SUFFICIENT IMPACT TO WARRANT CHANGES IN EMPHASIS AND DIRECTION. GOALS OF THE AIFLD EDUCATION PROGRAM SHOULD PRIMARILY BE TO (1) ENCOURAGE LOCAL UNIONS AND FEDERATIONS TO ASSUME RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCING AND OPERATING THE BASIC WORKER ORIENTATION COURSES, AND (2) CONCENTRATE AIFLD RESOURCES ON FILLING SPECIALIZED TRAINING NEEDS, INCLUDING ADVANCED LEADERSHIP TRAINING. REPORT FURTHER RECOMMENDS THAT RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCING AND OPERATING ALL SOCIAL PROJECT ACTIVITIES SHOULD BE TRANSFERRED TO LOCAL LABOR GROUPS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. USAID SHOULD CONTINUE TO SUPPORT AIFLD'S ROLE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF RURAL OR CAMPESINO UNIONS.","Evaluation period: Through 1 Jul 1970","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","7/1/1970 12:00:00 AM","","Institution building|Labor unions|Top level managers|Management training|Collective bargaining|Technical training|Worker participation|Project change","Brazil|Guatemala|Guyana|Honduras","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAB044A1.pdf","22,840 KB","000256 - American Technical Assistance Corp.

"Evaluates performance of the Intn'l Planned Parenthood Federatn (IPPF) in 64 countries from 1/67 to 12/70.  Purpose of IPPF is to enhance family planning (FP) activities in devel countries.  Report was prepared by proj manager. As more countries enter into FP, proposals are carefully reviewed and coordinated with the relevant Regional bureau, population officer and desk, Mission/Embassy, and other officers to assure appropriate use of AID funds, and that funds do not duplicate what has been done by other donors. Guidelines, workshops, seminars, and specialized trng are in progress to aid planning, implementation & admin improvements. Since the demand for FP is a head of govt action in most LDC's, IPPF is expanding its staffs, strengthening and refining programs devel, info, education, mgmt, and staff evaluation capabilities. No major issues need to be resolved.  AID and IPPF have worked together to establish an appropriate framework for assuring the soundness of IPPF programs and AID funds.  IPPF performance has been satisfactory and its contribution to policy and program development and implementation have been a significant stimulus to FP programs and concerted action to population problems.  IPPF has submitted comprehensive and detailed reports in a timely manner.  The policy of obtaining reviews and comments from Missions/Embassies receiving copies of grants, approved programs, and reports have generally been constructive.  In Korea, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Ghana where the program has been in operation for several years, IPPF's influence has begun to have effect on natn'l policy and action programs.  The mobilization of local leadership, and the international and private charactistics of IPPF which is attractive to local governments and peoples has enabled it to function successfully and expand in many politically and culturally sensitive situations. Continued funding is recommended.  Also, additional guidelines are being prepared & an increased number of workshops, seminars & individual trng sponsored to professionalize program planning.","Evaluation period: 1 Jan 1967-1 Jan 1970","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/csd-1837","","3/1/1970 12:00:00 AM","","Population programs|Contraceptive agents and devices|Family planning services|Associations|Delivery systems|Management training|Information storage and retrieval systems|Family planning promotion programs|Development program evaluation|FAMILY PLANNING|Technical assistance|Public data","","","","000639 - International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF)","","","English","","Multi country evaluation|Indepth evaluation","","WALKER, IRENE B.|RAVENHOLT, R.

"Evaluates contract with the Vinnell Corp. to assist the Royal Thai Government (RTG) to establish and staff a regional repair and maintenance shop (ROS) as part of its Accelerated Rural Development (ARD) Program.  This final evaluation covers the period from 6/64 to 5/70.  No evaluation methodology is indicated. With substantial help from Vinnell, a regional overhaul shop (ROS) was built at the Northeast ARD center in Korat, and less elaborate shop complexes have been set up in each province in which ARD is operative. The Vinnell training courses at Korat were very important, since trained personnel in the operation of heavy equipment were essentail to the project. On-the-job training  however, had mixed results. Also with Vinnell help, the ROS repaired $10 million worth of equipment. Activities at the provincial level are harder to quantify, although Vinnell has been active at that level also.  With the help of ROS, ARD has been able to construct 2,400 kms of standard roads; 1,500 kms of service tracks, village streets, and access roads, and to engage in numerous other construction projects.  The biggest disappointment was the failure to convince RTG officials of the value of maintenance and supply management. Also, management problems that had existed within ARD from the start continued and inadequate supervision was visible at all levels.  This was reflected in equipment nonuse and misuse, and a depression of individual morale and loss of whatever spirit ARD personnel had achieved during their training experiences with Vinnell. The non-availability of repair parts caused project delays and was often a result of fiscal management difficulties.  After 1966 there was a let down on the part of the contractor, particularly at the management level, due to the dissolution of contractor training, the deterioration of ARD support, and the degradation of all parties.  The separation of contract representatives from the contractor's operational area made communication difficult and reduced their effectiveness.  Also, contracts should not be made on a fixed price basis and repeated short-term extensions should be avoided.","Evaluation period: 1 Jun 1964-1 May 1970","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","5/1/1970 12:00:00 AM","","Labor intensive technology|PUBLIC SERVICES|Road maintenance|Vehicles|Roads|Transportation system design|Public works|Road construction|Access roads|Indigenous education|Institution building|Technicians|Technical training|Limited data","Thailand","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAM267.pdf","884 KB","008613 - USAID.
