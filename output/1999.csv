"Evaluates the American Bar Association's rule of law program in Central and Eastern Europe and the New Independent States (NIS) (ABA/CEELI program).  The evaluation covers the period 1992-12/98 and focuses on activities in Russia, Ukraine, Georgia, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), Macedonia, and Poland. From 1992 to 1995, CEELI aimed to mobilize U.S. lawyers and other legal experts to assist newly independent countries, with a focus on educating and organizing legal reformers and identifying partners for long-term relationships. Since 1995, the program has stressed long-term strategies for strengthening the institutional capacity of local partners to advance their own reform objectives with CEELI support. CEELI has met, or made substantial progress towards meeting, its stated objectives at the country and program level. Partners and clients consistently praised CEELI's contribution for being responsive, entrepreneurial, effective, and appropriate.  Program highlights are as follows:  (1) CEELI has strengthened judiciaries and their independence by:  providing judges and others with workshops and seminars on judicial reform; making judicial associations stronger and more educated; establishing judicial training centers, with complex institutional structures, that are now on the road to sustainability; and introducing judicial qualifying procedures that are seen as models in the region. (2) Despite obstacles, CEELI has helped develop independent professional legal associations.  In some countries, CEELI has focused on forging partnerships with progressive professionals at regional levels or those associated with special interests, such as women, commercial lawyers, or law students.  (3) CEELI has organized highly praised continuing legal education (CLE) programs that have directly reached more than 7,500 members of the legal profession through more than 256 major events, such as workshops, conferences, conventions, and study tours, small seminars, and lectures.  CEELI's success in establishing sustainable indigenous CLE programs has been variable.  (4) Although stimulating reform in formerly Soviet law schools has proven mostly unattainable, CEELI has successfully educated and organized reform-minded faculty members and law students through training efforts, sister city programs, the establishment of law clinics, and law student associations. (5) CEELI's legislative assistance program, initially intended to provide assistance in the early stages of legislative and constitutional reform, has been well received. It has mobilized several thousand American and European legal experts to provide well-organized, timely, and high-quality consultations.  (6) CEELI commercial law programs have been limited to countries where USAID missions have recognized the important linkage between rule of law reform and commercial law development.  Successful commercial law efforts have been implemented through a popular and widespread CLE program in Russia, establishment of a Commercial Law Center in Poland, and assistance in developing codes and in providing training in other countries.  (7) Special USAID-approved initiatives -- e.g., the Environmental Public Advocacy Centers (EPACS) in the western NIS, assistance to the Russian jury trial initiative, and women and law and constitutional assistance efforts in several countries -- demonstrate one of CEELI's key strengths: targeting special needs, mobilizing experts, and forging partnerships with reformers to generate movements for change.  Several of these efforts also serve as examples of successful programs that facilitate linkages between rule of law and other policy concerns.  The EPACS, covered extensively in the attached Ukraine Country Report, is a particularly impressive achievement.  (8) CEELI regional initiatives include multi-country workshops; placement of a paid Regional Institution Building Advisor (RIBA), who worked in several countries; and posting of a regional judicial specialist to the CEE from 1996 to 1998. Regarding program management, CEELI has a consistently positive record of leveraging funds from other resources, as well as for operating frugally.  Also, despite criticisms, CEELI's volunteer liaisons are highly motivated and competent legal professionals who also bring other business, organizational, and management skills to their work.  On the negative side, the elaborate system of reporting and documentation required by USAID is inefficient, burdensome, and detracts from time and resources that could be dedicated to program implementation.","Delivery order no. 13|Project title: Strengthening elections and political processes","Special Evaluation","Documents","AEP-I-00-96-90006-00|AEP-5468-I-00-6006-00","","1/1/1999 12:00:00 AM","","Political systems in transition|Rule of law|Administration of law|Legal reform|Legal education|Partnerships|Professionals|Institution building|Professional standards","Central and Eastern Europe|New Independent States","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABR070.pdf","5,594 KB","003970 - Management Systems International, Inc.

"Final evaluation of a project (11/96-12/98) to promote the demobilization and economic and social reintegration of guerilla forces in Guatemala.  The project was implemented by the International Office of Migration (IOM) under the aegis of USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (USAID/OTI) and the U.N. Development Program (UNDP). Overall, the program was a success.  Ex-combatants have been effectively demobilized and resettled in viable or potentially viable settings and have been accepted by surrounding communities.  Stability has been established throughout the countryside, the emergency is over, and conditions for truly sustainable development are in place, given adequate follow-through by the Government of Guatemala (GOG) and the donor community on the reform plan established by the Peace Accords. In the emergency phase (1-5/97), the project built 26,000 sq m of quality living and working space in 8 demobilization camps capable of housing over 3,000 combatants, demobilized and documented 2,940 guerrillas in the camps over a 2-month period, and provided them training through a highly efficient team effort by the international community.  In the initial incorporation phase (5/97-11/98), the project:  resettled former combatants from the camps to final destinations throughout the country, including 323 people ""without destination"" who were placed in halfway hostels prepared for this purpose; provided technical vocational training to 1,148 ex-combatants; placed and gave initial assistance to 277 ex-combatants on cooperative farms purchased by the GOG; provided productive enterprise assistance to 419 ex-combatants through 220 individual projects; provided literacy and basic education training to 3,338 beneficiaries (including a community civilian participation of close to 40%); conducted, for a cross-section of 1,375 participants from the demobilized and community-based sectors, a country-wide social communication campaign that explained the Peace Accords and the rights of returning ex-combatants and facilitated reconciliation; provided essential assistance in the return and incorporation of 151 families (493 persons) of Unidada Revolucionaria Nacional Guatemalteco (URNG) supporters from Mexico and other countries; provided 953 demobilized military police with technical vocational training, tool kits, and apprenticeships with local companies, directly resulting in the employment of 126 military ex-combatants; helped relocate and resettle one ""Community of Populations in Resistance"" in the mountains of Quiche to a cooperative farm, involving 250 families with 890 individuals; and provided critically needed infrastructure and medical supplies to two other communities. USAID/OTI and its funding partner, UNDP, were recognized as the two most important donor contributors to the transition process by all major stakeholders, including the URNG, the GOG, the United Nations, and the donor community in general. Further, USAID/OTI, together with UNDP and IOM, exhibited outstanding leadership, commitment, and good sense throughout the project in the face of exceedingly severe political, logistical, and other constraints.  The fact that USAID/OTI entered at the beginning and left at the end of the transitional effort, having successfully completed its mission, is an exceedingly rare and important accomplishment and should serve as a model for future programs. The most important factor in the project's success was its personnel: the project was blessed with a unique confluence of exceptional leadership on both the donor and Guatemalan sides.  Other success factors included donor and GOG flexibility, the coordinating role of the Special Incorporation Commission, the positive relationship with the URNG, and the relatively small size (3,000) of the force to be demobilized. Constraints included lack of planning, the political nature and technical shortfalls of the Fundacion Guillermo Toriello, the absence of a role for the private sector, and a severe lack of information management.  More specific lessons are include in the report.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1999 12:00:00 AM","","Post conflict societies|Demobilization|Guerrillas|Excombatants|Economic and social reintegration|Political reconciliation","Guatemala","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABR112.pdf","7,177 KB","","","008865 - USAID.

"This study examines how USAID and other donors are trying to help reconcile ethnic conflicts in Bosnia Herzegovina and, to a lesser extent, Croatia -- two countries that suffered vicious ethnic conflict after declaring their independence from Yugoslavia earlier this decade. It describes the ethnic situations before the 1991-95 wars of Yugoslav secession and analyzes the approaches that have succeeded since in reaching across the current ethnic divisions, particularly at the community level.  The study focuses on three broad categories of projects and programs:  private sector reactivation through support to microenterprises and small businesses, financial intermediaries, business associations, and basic utilities and infrastructure; support for alternative, i.e., politically independent media; and civil society and NGO strengthening. One general fact emerged clearly from the study:  all ethnic factions in the communities of Bosnia Herzegovina and Croatia have a strong and active desire for an enduring peace.  Specific lessons learned are as follows:  (1) Small private business organizations, financial intermediaries, professional associations, and businesses that have an integrated leadership and organizational structure promote interethnic cooperation.  Ethnically blind business behavior promotes cooperation between factions.  Building associations, companies, or linkages that promote trade, commerce, or marketing with other associations -- particularly across ethnic geographic boundaries -- help break down restrictions on trade and communications.  Removing factional leaders from the situational, geographic, and political conditions can also help break down barriers.  (2) The economic viability and income potential of enterprises is linked directly to their success in attracting and retaining interethnic members.  Having boards made up of various ethnic factions helps ensure that each group's interests will be represented. Production chains that rely on various ethnic minorities create permanent links between ethnic groups, as long as the enterprises are successful.  (3) A long-term media strategy that promotes open and credible alternative sources of news must concentrate on building democratic, sustainable media with professional journalists.  Permanent communication networks are essential for initiating and maintaining linkages, especially those channels that cannot be controlled by outside political forces.  (4) A highly nationalistic, strongly separatist political leadership is one of the greatest obstacles to reconciliation, at both the community and national levels.  The establishment of ethnically based states from the former Yugoslavia and strong nationalistic political leadership has led to political and economic interests that are rooted in the continued separation.  These leaders create barriers through control of policy, regulations, and laws.  More importantly, control by these leaders extends down to cities, towns, and even the village level.

"Evaluates project to apply a community-based coastal resource management (CRM) approach in addressing the problems of overfishing and the imminent collapse of fisheries in Philippine coastal waters. Operating in Palawan, the Visayas, and Mindanao, the project focuses on fishers in municipal waters and on local government units (LGUs), which have administrative jurisdiction over coastal resources.  Interim evaluation covers the period 1996-1/99.  The Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) is the implementing agency, with Tetra Tech EMI, Inc., the prime contractor. Major project achievements to date are as follows: (1) The project has developed a reputation throughout the country and the donor community as a source of state-of-the-art knowledge of CRM implementation.  (2) Interviews conducted for this evaluation, as well as the high degree of cohesiveness and unity observed among fishers in most areas visited, suggest that the project has significantly increased awareness of the importance of resource conservation and protection among the coastal communities in which it operates.  The CRM concept is now widely accepted in most project learning sites and is expanding to other barangays and municipalities.  (3) The project has provided impetus to new and innovative CRM policy and thought at both the national and LGU levels.  (4) The project has helped create a wider agreement among officials that community stakeholders must play a substantial role in resource development and management. (5) The project has used a participatory approach to assist community group members in analyzing their constraints and opportunities.  Participants at all levels are appreciative of its approach and potential impact.  (6) The project has increased awareness of the resource depletion problem among stakeholders, thereby stimulating active participation in CRM activities. Organized participants at all levels are beginning to experiment enthusiastically with their new roles and responsibilities. (7) The project has made considerable progress in institutionalizing CRM implementation within the LGU structure.  (8) The project has also stimulated a synergy between national and local CRM initiatives to ensure both that local initiatives are consistent with national policy and that national policy is responsive to field-level needs.  (9) The project has been instrumental in including CRM as an integral part of the food security initiative in the Philippines.  This effort will enable LGUs (identified in the 1998 Agricultural and Fisheries Modernization Act as the stewards of food security) to include a CRM plan for achieving food security. The project, now about half over, is at a crucial point of implementation, and its achievements will not be sustained if the remaining project tasks cannot be completed.  A 2-year extension to ensure project institutionalization is therefore highly recommended. This is consistent with the project design, which viewed the project as a 7-year, not a 5-year effort.

"This report assesses Phases I and II of a USAID project (1991-98) which provided both nonproject and project assistance to increase girls' access to basic education and literacy in Malawi (GABLE project). Important features of GABLE I were a fee-waiver program to attract and retain non-repeating primary school girls, and a Social Mobilization Campaign (SMC) to encourage parents and community leaders to send girls to school.  GABLE II was designed to increase the long-term financial base for education and to improve the system of primary education and its relevance for girls.  GABLE II also continued the SMC and instituted a secondary scholarship program for non-repeating primary girls. Achievements of the GABLE project included the following:  (1) Fee waivers under GABLE I (extended prior to GABLE II to boys and girls alike) have helped increase girls' primary enrollments and persistence. Between 1990-91 and 1995-96, girls' primary enrollment almost doubled (from 772,000 to 1.528 million); girls' enrollment as an overall percentage of enrollments rose from 45% to 47% and of grade 8 enrollments from 36% to 39%.  Reducing school costs for girls and promoting community mobilization appears to have contributed to the sharp increase.  (2) GABLE budget support and conditionalities, along with other donor contributions, have fueled increased funding for education.  The government has increased the educational budget from 10% of the total in 1991 92 to 23% in 1997-98.  (3) Girls' education is high on the national agenda.  Everyone in Malawi seems to have heard of GABLE, and attitudes towards its goals are generally positive.  The SMC has very effectively promoted (among chiefs, initiation counselors, teachers, parents, and students) attitudinal and behavioral change about the importance of sending girls to school; fostered development of a cadre of community researchers and the next generation of change agents who are committed to girls' education; and introduced diverse female role models for primary girls. There were also shortcomings:  (1) Skyrocketing primary enrollments over the course of the 1993-94 and 1994-95 school years, when school fees were eliminated for primary students, attenuated the quality and efficiency of basic education.  The flood of students overwhelmed facilities and necessitated recruitment and posting of inexperienced and minimally trained teachers.  The supply of instructional materials for students and teachers became inconsistent.  (2) Fee waivers and scholarships increase access but may threaten quality and sustainability.  The cost of quality universal primary education is beyond the means of the Malawian government.  About 40% of costs are donor-supported.  Secondary scholarships may be creating pressures for universal free access at the secondary level.  Rapid enrollment increases have overburdened the capacity of the education sector to provide adequate services.  (3) Policy dialogue has been difficult. Malawi's transition to democracy in 1994 generated a political rush to implement ""education for all"" and eliminated the time needed to strengthen and prepare the education sector for expansion.  USAID did not respond as flexibly as it might have; it imposed some conditionalities that were not supported by the government, resulting in a strategy, on some issues, of enforcement rather than dialogue.  (4) In quality of schooling, demand has outpaced supply.  Provision of quality school services has failed to keep pace with community demand stimulated in part by the SMC.  This incongruity could threaten the sustainability of girls' increased access to schooling and of community participation. (5) Poor integration among program initiatives, between program and policy initiatives, and of USAID-supported initiatives with other Ministry of Education (MOE) and donor activities resulted in missed opportunities for synergy.  (6) Sustainability of program efforts was not maximized.  Weak integration, communication, monitoring, and evaluation, as well as the lack of emphasis on strengthening local leadership and institutions may have reduced the likelihood of local ownership and sustained outcomes, especially for the SMC. GABLE taught, among other things, the importance of:  policy dialogue and local initiative; working with change agents and with leaders at all levels; reaching beyond the MOE to address gender issues; context and timing; and analyzing the potential adverse consequences of new interventions.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","3/1/1999 12:00:00 AM","","Access to education|Primary education|Girls|Educational policy|Policy dialogue|Policy reform|IEC|Educational administrators|Community participation|Educational costs","Malawi","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNACA916.pdf","197 KB","008058 - USAID.

"This report presents and elaborates the findings of three case studies undertaken by USAID's Center for Development Information and Evaluation (CDIE) of social reconciliation activities supported by the Agency and other donors.  The first study (PN-ACA-910) investigated the nature, functions, and achievements of peace committees established in South Africa to prevent violence and promote peace in pursuance of the 9/91 National Peace Accords.  The second study (PN-ACA-907), on interstate conflict, assessed the extent to which scientific collaboration between Israel and its Arab neighbors succeeded in creating and sustaining the attitudes, perceptions, and institutional relationships conducive to peace.  The third study (PN-ACA-920) examined the role of peace media in promoting interethnic reconciliation in Bosnia and Herzegovina; more importantly, it analyzed the effects of economic development initiatives in fostering ethnic tolerance. Section I defines the construct of social reconciliation as used in this study and identifies strategies that the international community has adopted to promote the process in post-conflict societies.  Section 2 presents an overview of the main findings and conclusions of the case studies.  Section 3 suggests the following lessons for USAID and other international donor organizations:  (1) Social reconciliation interventions, whether directly or indirectly supported by the international community, generally have a positive impact on post-conflict societies.  All three social reconciliation strategies -- creating and supporting grassroots peace structures, peace media, and collaborative projects -- have some value.  Their overall impact, however, is modest.  (2) Three environmental variables -- political commitment, indigenous ownership, and perceived fairness -- are critical to the effectiveness of social reconciliation interventions.  (3) Despite the importance of local ownership, the involvement of a neutral third party can be useful in deeply divided societies.  (4) Because of the social, cultural, and political sensibilities involved, it is essential that designers of social reconciliation projects consider factors not always salient in traditional development interventions. They should pay attention to local culture power structures, seek to lower the level of public visibility, and consider the singular problems that intergroup hostilities pose for project staff and participants. (5) To enhance opportunities for social reconciliation, innovative strategies and instruments should channel technical and financial assistance to indigenous organizations without forcing them to compromise their legitimacy, autonomy, and flexibility.  (6) Carefully designed economic development interventions can foster varying levels of cooperation and tolerance among antagonistic groups.  (7) As far as possible, the international community should support interventions that are informed by a social reconciliation approach.  Such an approach requires that:  designers critically examine all possible consequences of the proposed intervention; as far as possible, design and implement initiatives that augment social capital -- norms of tolerance, cooperation, and trust -- in that society; and expose project and program staff to conflict management and resolution techniques.","One in series of CDIE case studies of the role played by|international assistance in the democratic reconstruction of|post-conflict societies.

"Case studies of USAID capital market development projects in Kenya and Morocco are presented.  The report covers the country situations in which the projects were implemented, the projects themselves and their expected and actual economic effects, and the different approaches to capital market development that governed the projects.  Detailed project-specific findings and general lessons learned are presented in conclusion. Overall, the stock exchanges of both Kenya and Morocco have been transformed.  They and their regulatory authorities are now able to guide modernization of the capital markets to their countries' benefit. USAID support, at a very modest cost, provided critical technical assistance that made this transformation possible.  Among other accomplishments, the projects helped install sound, well-managed capital market institutions such as regulatory agencies and stock-trading exchanges, and helped instill good corporate governance in listed companies, protecting stockholders from managerial venality.  As to problem areas, there seems to be little inclination on the part of Kenyan commercial bankers to advance the development of the capital market (in contrast to bankers in Morocco).  Also USAID planners in both countries underestimated the reluctance of companies (for a variety of proprietary reasons) to list on stock exchanges. The following lessons were learned:  (1) Capital market development need not be an expensive undertaking.  The Kenya activity was clearly a development bargain.  A basic exchange and regulatory structure now operate at a modest cost to both the government of Kenya and USAID.  (2) Privatization programs give a boost to equity market projects.  Share offerings of state-owned enterprises give the market something to work with as the institutions tool up.  Retail investors are more easily attracted by offerings of well-known national flagship companies. It can safely be concluded that privatizations through the stock market aided efforts to develop capital markets.  (3) A commercial banking sector willing to innovate will magnify the positive effects of donor-funded development activities. Morocco's commercial banks are more innovative than Kenya's.  The range of financial services and products available to companies of all sizes is greater in Morocco.  Analysis of capital market development design should include an assessment of the likely response of the commercial banking sector to new opportunities. (4) Missions undertaking capital market projects should be held accountable for the quality of the institutions they assist but not for the level of market activity.  Stock and bond markets reflect the state of the national economy, which itself is the result of host government economic policies, the underlying structure of the economy, and external factors. Market indices will rise and fall during and after USAID activity, the goal of which should be to help put in place institutions capable of meeting the financial intermediation demands of the private sector. (5) USAID designers underestimated the reluctance of firms to list on stock exchanges.  Promotional efforts in both activities were directed to attracting retail investors to the market.  Because these promotional efforts succeeded, the demand for securities increased.  Meanwhile, however, the only supply increase came from the privatization programs. The combined result:  an overall shortage in the supply of securities relative to demand.  Activity designers need to examine the attitudes of and the incentives accorded private firms considering entry into the stock exchange.  (6) Activity implementors should take a flexible attitude toward adopting the American model for the capital market regulatory structure, which relies heavily on self-regulatory organizations.  Delegation of regulatory functions to NGOs may not be acceptable to governments outside the Anglo-American legal tradition. The decision on the type of regulatory framework need not be an either or decision.  (7) An active stock exchange imposes managerial discipline in widely held listed firms.  Managers of listed firms in both Kenya and Morocco said that stockholder oversight, while not always welcome, did induce them to increase the efficiency of their plant and equipment. Efficiency gains occurred in, but were not limited to, privatized firms.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","4/1/1999 12:00:00 AM","","Capital markets|Development projects|Case studies|Comparative studies|Economic impact|Development strategies|Economic participation","Kenya|Morocco","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNACA928.pdf","218 KB","008058 - USAID.

"This document reports on the continuing effects of a project implemented a quarter-century ago (1971-1976) to promote adult nonformal education (NFE) in Ecuador. The project heavily involved client populations in developing, testing, and implementing a wide variety of innovative approaches to NFE.  Its principles included grounding learning in the daily realities of the learners; using nonprofessionals as local facilitators of learning and action; employing a wide variety of innovative learning materials that were fun to use, involving, and stimulating; and making learners and facilitators the principal source of new ideas for materials.  The results of project experimentation with methods and materials were distributed to NFE practitioners around the world, where there is clear evidence of the project's impact. On the human level, the companionship experienced in the NFE project did away with dependence, domination, and abuse; helped people face life; and gave them self-respect and a sense of security and cultural identity.  Strengthening of personality has made room for the education of leaders, who serve as endogenous promoters of development, trainers of their fellows, and links to the outside world.  Leaders that have been educated now represent their communities in political spheres and were active in overthrowing Bucaram's government.  The project's most effective and lasting impact has been to instill in community facilitators a continuing commitment to the challenge of social change. The facilitators kept the ideas of NFE alive.  Those who survived the project's abrupt termination committed themselves to the cause of their fellows and found a purpose in their lives.  They have also taken advantage of openings in the formal structure.  Today, 90% of those from Manabi are adult educators, teachers, supervisors, university professors, and directors of technical schools.  In the highlands, the majority of people who currently work at the National Bilingual Intercultural Education Department (DINEIB) of the Ministry of Education and Culture were the NFE facilitators of yesterday.  Additionally, the application of NFE strengthened bilingualism in education, now the central concern of grassroots organizations that defend the rights of indigenous people. The learning materials and the pedagogies pioneered by the project have been absorbed by a range of NGOs, and in many cases have been taken over by the adult education section of the Ministry of Education; the spread and persistence of the ideas is part of the project's legacy.  On the down side, the materials given to institutions did not fare well: in some cases they were left in storage for a long time, while in other cases it is not known what happened to them.  Apparently, counterpart institutions were more interested in project funds than in project materials, preferring to use their own.  It is only in Manabi that all of the materials continued to be used through 1988.  The photo novel magazines and stories survived, so much so that UNESCO has been interested in producing more of them in Manabi.  Radio programs have lasted longest and still have a certain future, particularly in rural areas; although not structured as they used to be, they have followed the same philosophy in which campesinos manage them, produce their materials, and are nourished by the experiences of NFE. The continuation of NFE became evident in the campesino child care centers of FODERUMA (Marginal Rural Development Fund), an Ecuadorian Central Bank program implemented from 1978 to 1992.  After the program ended, the government organized the Community Network, which cared for poor children under 6 years of age for the first time.  Unfortunately, the next government, antagonistic to its predecessor, terminated the program and created the Organization for Children's Rescue, which has been accused of misappropriation of funds.  NFE is also part of the approach followed by COMUNIDEC, an NGO established by Carlos Moreno that has applied the experiences of NFE very effectively.","Spanish ed.: PN-ACF-476|Related Spanish document: PN-ACH-138|Project title: Advancing basic education and literacy 2 (ABEL 2)","Special Evaluation","Documents","HNE-5832-Q-00-4076-00|HNE-Q-00-94-00076-00","","2/1/1999 12:00:00 AM","","Adult education|Nonformal education|Disadvantaged groups|Beneficiary targeting|Access to education|Community based delivery|Social impact|Impact assessment|Social development","Ecuador","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNACE637.pdf","866 KB","","","","English","application/pdf","Facilitators","","Muzo, Enrique Tasiguano","Basic education","Feb 1999","","","","Ecuador NFE [non-formal education] project : literacy's rainbow twenty-five years later","","PN-ACE-637","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MjUyNzcx","Ecuador","5180075|9365832"
"Since 1985, USAID has financed three programs to support capital market reform in India:  the Program for Acceleration of Commercial Technology (PACT), designed to promote external funding for Indian commercial ventures; a series of housing guaranty (HG) programs with India's Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC); and the Financial Institutions Reform and Expansion (FIRE) project, designed to support India's 1991 shift to economic liberalization by improving the country's securities markets (regulatory component) and by demonstrating the commercial viability of selected urban infrastructure projects (debt component).  This study examines the impact of these projects. The projects have been very successful.  Each project:  significantly improved the operation of India's capital markets; experimented with promising activities; pushed the policy environment in a favorable direction; and established or strengthened institutions that have evolved to solve real development problems.  PACT helped launch the venture capital industry and demonstrated the value of close collaboration between Indian and U.S. companies at a time when policymakers were skeptical.  HDFC provided HG money for housing finance, helping launch the industry, which has since provided billions of dollars of long-term financing for private housing.  FIRE/regulatory has increased the transparency of the securities markets and improved oversight by the Securities and Exchange Board, making India more attractive for foreign and domestic investment.  FIRE/debt has introduced municipal bonds to finance local infrastructure activities -- an innovative approach that has created great interest.  If the many obstacles to its general use can be overcome, it could channel billions of dollars into critically needed urban infrastructure. Other findings include the following:  (1) In capital markets, USAID/India has been able to achieve substantial impact and visibility with small projects in a large country.  This may be due to the fact that capital markets activity is concentrated geographically and operates with a relatively small number of participants.  (2) Despite its lack of specialized knowledge, USAID's staff has been able to manage an activity requiring highly specialized expertise, including excellent technical contractors.  (3) Government oversight is critical to developing an efficient stock market, since it requires disclosure of relevant financial information, limits transactions costs for securities trading, and promotes transparency of market operation.  Companies are reluctant to disclose financial information, while brokers (who control most stock exchanges) prefer arrangements that make stock transactions non-transparent and high-cost.  Disclosure and transparency are also important for avoiding the problems, such as the recent ""Asia flu"", caused by excessive dependency on foreign financing through loans. Looking to the future, capital markets development is essential to poverty alleviation in India.  (Despite USAID's preference for activities having tangible links to poverty alleviation, in India's case, there is simply too much to be done for micro-level activities to make any dent in the problem.)  India needs to grow at 8-9% a year in order to eliminate pervasive poverty within a generation.  It cannot do this without better capital markets; past reliance on government investment and bank lending has produced poor results.  Improving capital markets in India would have two important effects.  First, it would increase the quality of investment in the economy.  India's economic growth problem in the past half-century has been due more to the quality of national investment than to its quantity.  In fact, India would have substantially less poverty today if its government had given more attention to capital markets efficiency and less to directly intervening in the economy, often in the name of poverty alleviation. Second, efficient and transparent capital markets can attract increased foreign savings to India (billions of dollars a year) to finance additional investment in public infrastructure; such investment is essential for both faster economic growth and poverty reduction.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","4/1/1999 12:00:00 AM","","Capital markets|Sector restructuring|Economic reform|Economic policy|Policy reform|Financial institutions|Economic growth|Poverty|Development strategies|Municipal bonds|Poverty reduction","India","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNACA922.pdf","152 KB","008058 - USAID.

"Despite a 1-year suspension, a truncated time frame, and a sharply reduced budget, USAID's Primary Education Development (PED) program (1989-94), designed to promote access to primary education, particularly for rural girls, in Pakistan's North-West Frontier Province (NWFP) and Balochistan Province, was a stunning success.  PED increased the number of girls' schools by 2,100 (a 70% increase), as well as girls' access to primary schools from 348,000 in grades 1-5 in 1989 to 761,300 in 1996. Boys' enrollment also increased over that period, from 1.3 million to 1.6 million. PED achieved the rapid gains in primary school participation by negotiating policies that developed and strengthened new primary institutions and supported new programs.  Three strategies were especially effective:  (1) communicating one clear goal -- enrolling girls in primary school; (2) opening more schools for girls through construction grants and innovative strategies such as the Community Support Program and promotion of ""fellowship schools"" (private urban nonformal schools for girls) in Balochistan and ""genderless"" schools in NWFP; and (3) recruiting and training more female teachers for rural schools.  At project end, counterparts repeatedly bemoaned the loss of USAID's leadership, which was characterized by long-term active engagement, policy dialogue, clear direction without micro-management, technical savvy, and strategic systems thinking. On the negative side, policy discussions about school quality were minimal.  Program initiatives were hampered by the absence of a shared vision of what quality education should look like and who was responsible for making it happen.  Nonetheless, there were some notable programmatic achievements, including:  a phonetic approach to teaching Urdu, the national language, incorporated in the national curriculum; improved instructional materials in both provinces; extensive teacher training using condensed versions of existing training programs; and achievement testing in NWFP.  However, the sustainability of PED achievements faces several threats.  These include the continued poor quality of girls' classroom experiences, the large number of communities still needing the assistance of NGOs to organize parent education committees, fast-growing populations, scarce financial resources, and the lack of role models and opportunities for educated girls. Lessons learned are as follows:  (1) Commitment to educating girls, communicated consistently by diverse leaders through multiple channels to a wide range of audiences, appears to have been critical to broad increases in girls' education.  (2) Goal-centeredness facilitates decentralization, community participation, and innovation.  The latter two are probably necessary to achieve the shifts in social norms required to change practices related to gender roles in traditional societies.  (3) Without incentives for change, a program approach in an unchanged policy environment may not have a systemwide impact on the quality of education.  (4) Policy emphasis on quality might have helped institutionalize quality improvements, thereby fostering the sustainability of PED gains in girls' access to schooling.  (5) Unrealistically high standards for teacher and student achievement do not lead to better performance, but reinforce notions that girls are not capable and contribute to patterns of high dropout and repetition rates. (6) Gender discrimination distorts supply and demand and limits the effectiveness and efficiency of strategies for system reform.  Policy and program actions that require changes in gender role norms reduce these distortions.  (7) Initiatives like the Community Support Program demonstrate a three-way partnership between villagers, NGOs, and government that empowers more stakeholders, facilitates innovation, and minimizes deadlock better than do two-way government-community partnerships.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","5/1/1999 12:00:00 AM","","Access to education|Primary education|Beneficiary targeting|Disadvantaged groups|Girls|Social impact","Pakistan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNACA925.pdf","255 KB","008058 - USAID.

"This evaluation assesses the effectiveness of emergency assistance provided by USAID in response to Haiti's complex humanitarian emergency from 1991 to 1996.  The assistance focused on:  saving lives and alleviating suffering; political tensions associated with the complex emergency; and Haiti's long-term economic development. Conclusions are as follows:  (1) In contrast to other countries, ethnic hostility or civil war was not the basis of Haiti's complex emergency.  The economic embargo imposed by the international community in response to the 1991 coup d'etat created the urgent need for humanitarian assistance.  (2) USAID and U.S. NGOs have the capacity to deliver sufficient, appropriately targeted emergency assistance to help ensure the survival of a country's vulnerable poor.  As many as one in seven Haitians were receiving food aid during the 1991-96 period.  In addition, USAID-funded NGOs were providing three fourths of the health care in the country.  These actions helped control malnutrition, and although health conditions worsened, epidemics did not break out.  In the absence of emergency assistance, more Haitians would have fled Haiti, risking boat passage to seek refuge in the United States or swelling the refugee camp at Guantanamo Bay.  (3) Emergency assistance can help maintain social calm and mitigate political instability.  The massive quantities of emergency assistance (especially food aid) provided by the international community helped offset the drop in incomes, increase in food prices, and the temporary closure of donor- funded development activities caused by the embargo.  The food aid acted as a steam valve; it reduced the probability of food riots and arguably eased political tensions, especially in Port-au-Prince, where the poor who lost their jobs had few economic options.  However, emergency assistance may have had the unintended negative effect of reducing pressure on the repressive military regime, thereby working against the purpose of the embargo.  It also may have delayed the external military intervention that finally took place in October 1994. (4) Distribution of emergency food aid requires organization and control in order to prevent theft, guard against political manipulation, and protect beneficiaries.  The large quantity of food aid provided Haiti became a source of violent competition -- both for its value for consumption and as a source of political power for those controlling access.  Violent elements hijacked food supplies in some areas.  Urban homes and community buildings used to stockpile food supplies were looted. Some local authorities such as mayors used food as political favors or for personal aggrandizement.  Fighting among beneficiaries sometimes erupted when food was delivered in urban neighborhoods.  The NGOs addressed these problems by stocking and distributing food aid in more neutral settings (schools, factory yards), using ration cards to track the receipt of food aid, and having police or agency personnel present to control beneficiaries.  (5) Employment in Haiti dropped dramatically because of the embargo.  In response, USAID initiated the Jobs Creation project both to create employment and to rehabilitate productive infrastructure (roads, irrigation).  Some 500,000 person-months of short-term jobs were created during the project, and up to 20,000 people (including at least 20% women) were employed.  The project was less successful in promoting long-term development, because the infrastructure often did not meet technical standards or was not adequately maintained. (6) Emergency provision of agricultural production inputs contributes to long-term economic development if it enables rural households to reduce farm decapitalization and dependency on food aid.  Because some Haitian farmers had been forced to sell their agricultural assets in order to survive, some NGOs provided seeds and tools along with food commodities.  This helped beneficiaries resume or maintain agricultural production and decrease their dependence on food relief.  (7) The urgency of the moment relegated forward planning to the back burner.  In particular, no efforts were made to train a core of technocratic managers (e.g., in public administration and economics) in anticipation of post-conflict governance needs.  Although USAID funded more than 1,900 microprojects to support democratic processes and reinforce local governmental structures, Haiti's public sector and institutional infrastructure still lacked the capacity, even in 1998, to manage the country's development.

"Evaluates as of 7/98 the impact of grants provided by USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) to support democratization in Bosnia by developing a free and independent media as an alternative to the state-controlled media. The alternative media are having a positive impact on Bosnia's social and political situation.  Editors and journalists in both the Bosnian Federation and the Republika Srpska report objective information and inform the public of the actions and abuses of government officials. Alternative media outlets offer candidates with moderate or pro-democracy platforms an opportunity to communicate their positions -- something not allowed them by  government-controlled outlets. Alternative media offer the only opportunity for moderate voices to reach large numbers of people. Reactions to the alternative media have been mixed.  While the news coverage they afford is appreciated, they are not accepted as readily as are state-controlled media, and many lack credibility.  Public mistrust of media content can be attributed to a societal attitude toward media that goes back to the days of propaganda from the Tito regime.  During the war, communist propaganda turned nationalist in tone and content. Because of this, Bosnians harbor deep suspicions of all media messages, though research suggests that these messages can still influence their ideologies and perceptions of events. The alternative media need to adhere to higher standards of objectivity and fairness than do the state media in order to dispel the widespread belief that they are tools of opposition groups and the mouthpiece of the international community. Alternative media contribute to peace and democracy because they provide an outlet for citizens to discuss public issues and policies, something impossible in the former political system.  To foster an open communication process in Bosnia, OTI- supported radio and television stations now have programs, called ""contact programs"", which allow political candidates and elected officials to communicate their positions to a wide audience and which also let the public call in to ask questions.  Moreover, broadcast contact shows offer opposition candidates media exposure that the state-controlled media refuse to provide. Besides funding alternative media, OTI supports many NGOs with civil society initiatives.  These NGOs create grassroots projects to build peace and democracy via roundtables, fora, and public meetings.  Media coverage of NGO activities amplifies the impact of pro-democracy and peace activities. Improved cooperative relationships between OTI-funded NGOs and OTI-funded alternative media will be mutually beneficial.  OTI staff need to work to ensure that alternative media and civil society organizations support each other's activities and objectives. On the down side, many Bosnians are not ready for the critical messages communicated by alternative media.  They are weary of negative stories, investigative reporting, overtly political content, and the scandal mentality of the alternative media.  Because Bosnians are not yet sophisticated consumers of media, messages that may appear to Westerners to be part of normal journalism are creating a backlash on the credibility of the alternative media.  Moreover, because Yugoslavia's best journalists left or were killed during the war, a large number of journalists are young, inexperienced, and lack professional standards.  The public is also suspicious of established journalists who were once communists, then nationalists, and now democrats. Many media grantees (about 80% of those interviewed) are still dependent on OTI funding.  Alternative media need to develop marketing strategies and forge relationships with other organizations to ensure the survivability of their news organizations and their informational messages. Contains numerous lessons learned.

"Part of a series of country studies on the subject, this report assesses the effectiveness of USAID's assistance for capital market development in the Philippines, largely under the Capital Markets Development Project (4920447 -- 1993-98).  The project featured separate but complementary public and private components.  The public sector component was to provide assistance to restructure the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  The private sector component was to be managed by an umbrella association of private sector financial institutions, the Financial Executives Institute of the Philippines (FINEX).  The project sought to enhance the integrity and capacity of the capital markets to facilitate an increase in the number and types of equity and debt securities.  That would, in turn, encourage savings mobilization and increase the quantity and quality of private investment.  A separate project provided TA for the privatization of major government-owned companies, leading to their listing on the stock exchange, while another USAID-financed activity helped the Philippine Board of Investment keep American firms informed of the improving environment for foreign portfolio investment in the Philippine market. The Capital Market Development project was a clear success.  It contributed substantially to the development of the Philippine capital market both by improving oversight by the SEC and by encouraging a variety of actions to upgrade the operation of the equity market, including the creation of a central securities depository, which permitted scripless trading.  USAID acted as a catalyst for change by contributing analyses, encouragement, and pressure to undertake steps to increase the transparency and efficiency of the capital market.  USAID clearly sped up the rate at which improvements were made in these markets.  In the most extreme case, USAID pressure was instrumental in clearing the way for new leadership for the SEC, an important step in developing the capital market.  The combination of public- and private-sector elements in the assistance package contributed to the success of the overall effort.  If the project had limited itself to the public sector alone, it would almost certainly have been less successful; it might well have failed entirely. The bond market continues to be underdeveloped, except for national government issues.  Passage of the pending capital markets legislation should help somewhat, but the recent macroeconomic instability has postponed the day when interest rates will come down to where long-term corporate debt financing is likely to be an active part of the market. The USAID effort to promote development of a market for municipal bonds is (at best) premature.  Most economists oppose granting tax-free status to municipal bonds.  Some, though, have argued that it provides a relatively low-cost means for transferring resources from national governments to municipalities.  The Agency should develop a position on the desirability of using this tool. With a number of problems still confronting the Philippine capital market, USAID assistance can continue to play an important catalytic role and have a high payoff, at least for several more years.  Areas needing attention include:  passage of the two pieces of pending legislation on capital markets; further strengthening of the SEC in its core capital market functions; continued efforts to increase protection for investors in publicly traded stocks in areas where the stock exchange is unlikely to take necessary steps on its own; and continued education of market participants, including encouraging the development of new products that can increase market liquidity.

"Final evaluation of a grant to Delphi International (4/98-2/99) to conduct a Strategies, Training, and Advocacy for Reconciliation (STAR) program in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY) aimed at fostering women's participation in the development of civil society. Delphi/STAR did not seek to direct the work that women did in the community.  Instead, it helped the groups identify local needs and opportunities for civil initiatives that the groups were skilled in and interested in addressing.  Common to all the groups was a desire to establish themselves as contributing members of their community and thereby position themselves to be seen as credible when addressing civil issues. Delphi/STAR sought to achieve the project purpose by providing subgrants for NGO projects and by conducting skills training workshops. Given its limited operating time, the project made notable contributions by providing concrete, high- quality opportunities for NGOs to become stronger internally and to better establish themselves in their communities.  The Delphi/STAR team designed and carried out a subgrant process that can be viewed as a model for other projects; 34 subgrants valued at $92,000 were awarded for advocacy-oriented project activities. On the whole, women reported that the subgrant process and the workshops helped them to build skills and confidence for future projects and for negotiations with less engaged donors. Interviews with NGO leaders both in and outside of Belgrade, local resource NGOs, and representatives of other international NGO (INGOs) revealed that the concept of advocacy was not adequately understood. While some women have long been activists, very few consider their work to be public policy advocacy.  Many projects were being carried out without achieving their potential impact because leaders lacked the vision and strategic thinking needed to make an activity a tool for societal change.  Experience in other Delphi/STAR projects indicates that the steps taken in FRY were useful first steps, but need to be followed by a holistic, focused 2-3 year project to develop and ground public policy advocacy competency. In a very short period, Delphi/STAR identified and supported competent subgrantees that were positioned to carry out women's economic empowerment activities.  As a result of the perceived success of the ""Women in Business"" seminar carried out by the University of Podgorica, the Montenegro government sponsored a second course for women in another area of the Republic.  The project supported the Vojvodina Women's Initiative for self-employment, which stirred a keen desire in participants to start businesses.  Additionally, four women's microenterprise projects received subgrants that provided the stability the enterprises needed to establish customer and financial bases. Even in the project's short period, women recognized and benefitted from initiating contacts and strengthening linkages between individuals and groups -- a central project objective.  As a result of these linkages, women gained new ideas, got to know potential women collaborators, and established relationships that helped move projects forward or solve problems.  Of importance was the linking of Serbian and Kosovar women during project-sponsored workshops and of Kosovar, Serbian, and Yugoslav Successor State (YSS) women.  The project was recognized by USAID and other INGOs as providing the rare opportunities for Serbian and Kosovar women to meet and learn about each other in this highly charged and uncertain environment.

"This study assesses the humanitarian, political, and economic effectiveness of USAID's emergency assistance to Mozambique from 1987 through 1995.  It covers the final years of the civil war, a major drought, the implementation of a peace accord, and the transition from relief to development. USAID and U.S. PVOs know how to run an effective relief program.  In Mozambique they were able to manage a long- term emergency, which at its peak affected more than 6 million people.  While other donors were slow to act during the worst part of the famine, USAID creatively diverted P.L. 480 shipments from other countries to Mozambique.  USAID food poured into the country and U.S. PVOs delivered massive amounts of food and other aid to those in need.  U.S. assistance helped mitigate the effects of a major human catastrophe. The food aid did not significantly affect the course of the war, which was fueled by external politics and military aid from abroad and which ended when both sides lost their foreign financial backers and arms suppliers.  After the General Peace Accord of 1992 and the end of the drought, people began a massive movement and resettlement.  More than a third of Mozambique's population was resettled in a little over 2 years.  U.S. assistance supported the resettlement effort by helping avert conflicts, reduce social tensions, and cement the peace process down to the village level.  It helped maintain social calm and prevent political instability by providing food aid to farmers and helping them reestablish their livelihoods. Lessons learned include the following:  (1) The host government's emergency management agency lacked the technical expertise to plan, organize, and manage massive relief aid.  There were reports of corruption, theft, and political or personal favoritism.  Target populations did not always receive timely and sufficient food aid. USAID had to take action to save lives and ended up managing much of the logistics.  (2) At times, donor efforts overlapped or were at cross-purposes.  Nor was there a universal transition from relief to rehabilitation or development programs.  This lack of coordination confused beneficiaries and undermined efforts to reduce dependency.  (3) USAID economic policy reform programs, development projects, and non-emergency food aid all bolstered relief efforts.  Conversely, some relief programs also helped support economic development.  This demonstrates the need for a coherent U.S. approach in which each type of aid not only accomplishes its own goals, but supports other aid efforts as well.  Conversely, split responsibilities for aid increases the risk that programs will lack coherence and may even waste U.S. funds.  (4) Relief assistance creates dependency, particularly during a long-term emergency.  Humanitarian aid should include assistance that helps people support themselves.  (5) Using expatriates to operate relief programs is expensive and marginalizes local nationals.  A training component should be included in emergency relief efforts.  (6) Rapid demobilization and reintegration into civilian life is essential for the transition from relief to recovery.  (7) At the end of the emergency, refugee return programs need both a push to move people out of camps and a pull to draw them back home.  In the present case, cutting off food aid helped push refugees and internally displaced persons out of the camps, while a resettlement package of food, seeds, farming tools, and household goods helped draw them back to their home villages and begin producing their own food.  Free food aid until the first harvest was an important element.  (8) The transition from relief to development is often the most difficult phase of complex humanitarian emergencies.  Both aspects must be funded in order to reduce the usual gap in assistance.  USAID and NGOs need to work creatively with USAID regulations.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","6/1/1999 12:00:00 AM","","Post conflict societies|Humanitarian assistance|Complex emergency|Emergency relief|War relief|Disaster relief|Disaster recovery|Economic development|Economic impact|Social impact|Political aspects|Impact assessment","Mozambique","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNACA935.pdf","457 KB","008058 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (5/90-3/98) to promote democratic labor unions in El Salvador.  The American Institute for Free Labor Development (AIFLD) implemented the project. Up to the signing of the peace accords in 1/92, AIFLD technical and administrative assistance helped create and maintain labor and rural cooperative organizations that were independent of the political left. During this period, AIFLD was successful in maintaining a network of independent organizations, under the umbrella of the Union Nacional Obrero Campesino (UNOC). In the immediate postwar period, emphasis shifted to creating an enabling environment for collective bargaining by independent unions.  The focus of these activities was a series of tripartite political negotiations that ultimately led to the reform of the existing labor code in 1994. Unfortunately, once the code was enacted, the Salvadoran economy entered a period of rapid transition characterized by the growth of the export assembly (maquiladora) industries and the contraction of the public sector.  The focus of AIFLD's support for the Democratic Workers Center (CTD -- successor to UNOC) shifted, accordingly, to defense of the rights of maquiladora workers and assistance to public sector unions that were attempting to redefine their roles in the face of privatization.  During this period AIFLD helped the CTD form a number of new federations and continued to provide legal assistance for maquila workers fired as a result of union organizing campaigns.  These efforts have been continued with the Confederacion Nacional de Trabajadores Salvadorenos (CNTS) and broadened to include other unions working in the export processing zones.  At the same time, AIFLD provided basic trade union education to maquila workers and sought to educate the labor movement about new tactics, such as codes of conduct and independent monitoring, that began to appear at this time.  In the first quarter of 1998, the Solidarity Center organized a conference on independent monitoring and codes of conduct.  AIFLD and the Solidarity Center also developed a database on the maquila industry for use in worker education projects.  With respect to privatization, AIFLD supported an initiative to create a worker-managed Pension Fund Administrator under the new pension law, and assisted workers in the telecommunications sector who were seeking a negotiated outcome for the privatization process in their industry. TA to rural organizations, which had been the largest components of AIFLD assistance before and during the war, declined thereafter.  The village bank program, which benefitted 3,200 campesinos in 1994 alone, became self-sufficient using proceeds from prior loans.  The mobile clinic program provided medical training and assistance to 1,900 agricultural workers through 47 health training courses before it was discontinued. AIFLD also supported a pesticide management training project and a program to support agricultural exports.  Even after these programs were discontinued, AIFLD continued an extensive program of training for both urban and rural worker organizations, especially in the areas relating to land reform. Throughout the period of the agreement, AIFLD undertook a number of initiatives to promote labor-management cooperation.  The most significant endeavor in this area was the Fundacion Obrero Empresarial Salvadorena (FOES), a joint labor- management foundation established under the AIFLD Cooperative Agreement to promote labor-management dialogue and provide institutional support to rural and urban worker organizations. In addition, AIFLD supported training programs on industrial relations with the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service (FMCS). In the area of vocational education, from 1988 to 1996 AIFLD supported the Instituto Obrero-Empresarial de la Construccion (IOPIC), a training institution for the construction trades established by the International Masonry Institute/International Union of Bricklayers. During the period of the agreement, IOPIC graduated 2,000 skilled carpenters, bricklayers, painters, plumbers, and electricians, most of whom found well-paying employment in the unionized construction sector. The key lesson learned is that it is far more difficult to create a democratic labor culture than it is to sustain independent unions as political actors.

"Evaluates project to develop sustainable water and wastewater (W/WW) facilities in selected secondary cities in Egypt.  Interim evaluation covers the period 8/95-4/99. Overall performance of the project has been excellent, with substantial progress being made toward meeting individual objectives. At the end of Phase I in June 1998, three of the four project governorates had achieved all conditions precedent (CPs) and Project Implementation Letters (PILs) were signed, enabling construction activities to begin; 88% of all key benchmarks had been achieved at that time.  By the time of this evaluation, all project sites had fully met their CP targets. Participating utilities have come a long way since project inception.  Qualitative and significant changes have occurred in key areas central to the development of autonomous entities, such as organization and staffing, finance and administration, operations and maintenance, management systems, and training. Particularly impressive progress has been achieved in revenue retention.  In comparison to non-project sites, the participating utilities show marked differences and are often envied by the surrounding areas. The contractor and USAID have performed well, exhibiting a remarkable flexibility to the evolving and unique needs of the individual cities. No delays in implementation resulted from the action or inaction of either the contractor or USAID.  What delays have taken place result from the Government of Egypt's (GOE) efforts to resolve sector reform issues on a national basis, rather than addressing individual Public Economic Authority (PEA) ration plans at this stage. Performance-based contracting is an effective mechanism, saving 1 year in project length.  Benchmarks established for each governorate's action plan provided the means for measuring the success of the institutional strengthening activities.  The contractor completed a significant majority of the required Phase I tasks on or ahead of schedule.  The clarity and structure of this performance-based approach, combined with a cost-plus-award-fee incentive mechanism, was a major factor in Phase I success.  The result is cost savings and increased cost- effectiveness. Principal recommendations are as follows:  (1) Encourage the GOE to develop realistic options for capital financing of W/WW infrastructure, which is currently constrained by high interest rates.  Under transitionary status, PEAs could be enabled to finance capped amounts of up to LE 2 million for small capital projects (i.e., rolling stock, small extensions to systems) as zero-interest loans.  After transition, enable the capital costs for small items to be financed at concessionary rates.  (2) Expedite the procurement of bulk metering equipment. The transfer of authority for providing bulk meters has delayed the ability of all utilities to measure their influents and effluents accurately. (3) Expedite the procurement of leak detection equipment.  Project data indicate a weighted project- wide average of 40% unaccounted for water relative to total production.  System efficiency can be dramatically increased if system leakages and illegal connections are reduced.  (4) Expedite the service metering program and formally extend it, including installation, testing, and repair, to include all classes of consumers. Conservation is a normal result of metering and provides more trust and consumer confidence in billing.  (5) Revise staffing plans to focus on areas where shortages currently exist, and urge the GOE to expedite approval of new personnel needs.  Some sites are overstaffed with low- skilled personnel, while key positions such as engineers and accountants are in short supply.  The difficulty of obtaining GOE approvals for new positions remains an obstacle.  (Author abstract, modified)","Includes executive summary in Arabic|Task order no.

"This report assesses the impact of a Girls Education Program (GEP) that was added in 1993 to USAID/Guatemala's Basic Education Strengthening (BEST) project (1989-97).  Under the BEST/GEP umbrella several new strategies were tried, most notably mobilizing the private sector on behalf of girls' education and testing targeted interventions to improve the education of indigenous rural girls. BEST faced great challenges:  the education system was inequitable, and the number of schools, especially in rural indigenous areas, was inadequate, as was government investment in education.  Moreover, the government failed to meet key counterpart staffing commitments and the target of 3% of GNP for education investment, and did not institutionalize and scale up successful models demonstrated by BEST and GEP.  Meanwhile, the U.S. government announced a phased pullout from the education sector and shifted its regional priorities from Central America. Nevertheless, BEST and GEP did score some successes.  Two approaches -- improving quality and offering scholarships -- improved girls' participation.  Evaluations of BEST's Nueva Escuela Unitaria (NEU) project confirmed that the use of participatory learning methods in the classroom, accompanied by motivational materials, increased girls' classroom participation and their persistence in higher primary grades. The improved quality of schooling had greater effects on girls than on boys.  Scholarships to sensitize parents to the importance of education increased participation by both girls and boys. On the down side, scholarships are an unlikely long-term strategy to achieve universal basic education.  In Guatemala they raised per student costs by 90% and channeled scarce resources to the benefit of a few. But scholarships do effectively reach out-of-school girls, are highly visible, and are attractive to governments as political gestures.  By contrast, the NEU program is less targeted and potentially sustainable. Although costs per NEU student per year are 58% higher than in standard government schools, the improved quality of NEU schooling, better student performance, and reduced repetition and dropout rates result in a 15% drop in total per student costs for completing the primary cycle. Two other approaches that were tested as part of a pilot project called Eduque a la Nina (Educate the Girl) -- creating parents' committees supported by social promoters, and providing gender-sensitive educational materials to teachers -- did not in and of themselves improve girls' participation. USAID's efforts with the private sector gave national visibility to issues of girls' education, resulted in visible private sector leadership and advocacy for girls' education, and catalyzed Ministry of Education outsourcing of scholarship management.  Private sector advocacy and USAID policy dialogue appear to have contributed to an increase in ministry policy statements pledging commitment to education of rural indigenous girls.  Although the overall education sector budget failed to increase as promised, the percent dedicated to primary education almost doubled, and the percent dedicated to rural education more than doubled. Overall, however, the systemic effects of BEST and GEP fell short of expectations.  During its history, BEST evolved from a system orientation toward activities that were not tightly integrated and did not build on strong institutional and civil society support.  Some of the more ambitious system-level initiatives, such as a project called Franja Curricular or integrated curriculum guidelines, were not implemented.  Some effective pilot initiatives, such as NEU, were not replicated and scaled up to the extent expected.  Major stakeholders, such as women's and Mayan groups, were not part of BEST/GEP implementation.  The program failed to integrate and institutionalize system-wide GEP-sponsored gender-sensitive curriculum and teacher training.  The private sector contributed new expertise and resources, but it did not -- and could not -- substitute for public sector engagement.

"This report evaluates U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) efforts to improve basic education for girls.  The evaluation drew on field studies in: Guatemala, Guinea, Malawi, Nepal, and Pakistan; a country desk study of Egypt; issue-oriented research on Bolivia and Thailand; and a literature review.  Findings indicate that effective strategies for getting girls into schools included increasing the proportion of national investments in primary education, strengthening institutions responsible for primary education, increasing the supply of schools near girls, designing schools to be acceptable places for girls, engaging the community, and addressing such obstacles as threats to girls' security and school costs.  Although various USAID-supported programs were successful in improving educational quality, they were not scaled up because of a lack of a common definition of quality and lack of political support and policy frameworks to facilitate improvements.  Effective strategies to help girls complete a basic education included changing school and community cultures from selection to inclusion, reducing costs to families, changing cultural perceptions of girls' potential, working with traditional leaders, and developing girl-friendly regulations and schools.  Boys clearly and consistently benefited from initiatives aimed at girls' schooling needs.  In all countries studied, USAID targeted and benefited not only girls, but also other children vulnerable to exclusion; those in remote rural communities, those from poor families, language minorities, and disenfranchised ethnic groups.  Factors that may contribute to sustainability of outcomes are discussed.  Appendices include field studies and basic data on Guatemala, Guinea, Malawi, Nepal, and Pakistan, and data on USAID funding for girls' education.

"Final evaluation of a project (9/93-12/99) to promote the adoption of disaster mitigation and preparedness measures in the Caribbean. The project conducted a number of pilot projects and replication initiatives in 11 different countries.  Achievements were as follows: (1) Efforts to establish the framework for developing regional and national mitigation plans took place principally in St. Lucia and Jamaica and were successful.  This activity should be supported in future Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) programs.  (2) Efforts to support community- based preparedness and prevention initiatives were successful in the Dominican Republic, much less so in Haiti.  Community- oriented activities should be a major future emphasis.  (3) The project worked with governments, associations of electricity power companies, and the hotel industry to develop information, manuals, and model retrofit options to reduce the vulnerability of key lifeline infrastructure.  This component raised awareness about the benefits of this approach; its most important lesson is the need to ensure that potential users are committed to using audit results.  (4) Efforts to promulgate new building codes and the retrofitting of low-cost housing had mixed results.  However, the project was able to initiate building code promulgation in four countries and to test a number of housing retrofit approaches.  Future initiatives should be part of comprehensive efforts to alter basically the building culture. (5) The project successfully demonstrated the Arbiter of Storms (TAOS) storm surge model, but the regional seismic mapping effort generally suffered from many delays and has had limited country impact thus far.  Hazard assessments need to ensure upfront government support. (6) Work with the insurance industry to reduce losses from disasters and mitigate hazards faltered because of regional economic realities, but has encouraged a number of private sector initiatives.  (7) Post- disaster recovery mitigation efforts were a practical response to aid reconstruction while exposing victims to mitigation issues and tools. Integrating mitigation principles into post-disaster recovery efforts provided a number of lessons useful for future OFDA efforts.  With continuing education, this component has the potential to become a part of the standard operating procedures of disaster management agencies. (8) The project worked closely with the Caribbean Development Bank (CDB) and the World Bank on mitigation policy development.  These institutions will continue to support the policies adopted.  (9) Training was a primary ingredient in all components and a key tool for raising awareness and for training a corps of Caribbean professionals.  Most countries will continue with these activities, and OFDA should continue to support them. Programs that seem likely to continue on their own include:  the community preparedness program in the Dominican Republic, the housing retrofit program in St. Lucia, and the mitigation policy work in Jamaica and St. Lucia.  Modification of the building codes in several countries will also likely be successfully  concluded by these countries.  The vulnerability and risk audits stream, insofar as its shelter program and collaboration with the hotel association are concerned, will also continue.  Further, the project's longer-term impact is likely to be more positive than is evidenced at this moment. The following are among the lessons learned:  (1) The private sector can be a valuable part of the solution to disaster mitigation issues, but will be more effective if it operates within a framework established by the government that actively promotes mitigation programs.  (2) There is an abundance of donors and major NGOs in the region, but little systematic coordination.  (3) The project attempted to do too much with very few resources.  This approach cannot substantially affect or jump-start similar initiatives in other countries.  However, the sharing of information is important and serves to validate fledgling approaches. (3) To generate political will, a public relations effort should be a priority in future projects.  (4) Since central governments are generally strapped for resources, there is a need to find outside drivers; the project attempted this with the insurance stream and through its work with hotel associations.  Local community efforts and local authorities, with all their drawbacks, are also are potential avenues to explore.

"In 1993, USAID's Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA). began to fund economic rehabilitation activities in Sudan's West Bank, an area comprising all parts of Equatoria province lying west of the Nile, and one enjoying increased stability and security as a result of military advances made by the Sudan Peoples Liberation Army (SPLA). This case study traces the evolution of this rehabilitation program and summarizes its impact and lessons. Rehabilitation activities supported under the program have ranged from road repair to small grants to community groups, and each activity has generated valuable lessons, some of them relevant to all rehabilitation-oriented activities.  Opportunities that arise in the ever-evolving transition context must be seized as quickly as possible, so that intervention, if warranted, can have the greatest impact; flexible funding mechanisms that allow for quick response are therefore critical.  It is also clear that knowledgeable people in the field are the best placed to identify these opportunities and should thus be empowered to make decisions and implement innovative programs on the ground.  The West Bank experience has also shown that, in order for an activity to be as effective as possible, the implementing partner must make frequent impact assessments (with special attention to economic impact) and coordinate activities with both local authorities and others active in the area.  Finally, the sharing of lessons learned from these innovative activities must be improved so that future activities are even more effective. Overall, the West Bank experience provides evidence of USAID's success in promoting economic and political transition through targeted interventions.  Complex emergencies and conflicts are not absolute terms.  Even in a situation of ongoing conflict, there are often pockets of stability and potential for transition that can benefit from rehabilitation-oriented programs.  If programmed properly, a small amount of assistance (in this case, only 4% of USAID's total assistance to Sudan over the past 6 years) can go a long way toward restoring people's coping mechanisms and enabling them to reengage in economic activities.  These interventions serve to jump start the market economy, promote the development of civil society, and further the creation of a functional, transparent, and accountable civil administration. Ultimately, these types of transition programs foster the transition to resilient development and community self-sufficiency, preventing or mitigating the effects of current and future complex emergencies, and reducing the overall costs of relief interventions.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","9/1/1999 12:00:00 AM","","Emergency relief|Complex emergency|Humanitarian assistance|Disaster rehabilitation|Economic development|Political systems in transition|Development strategies|Economies in transition|Development program management|Decision making|Development finance|Impact assessment","Sudan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNACF763.pdf","555 KB","","","008308 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (1990-98) to expand community-based maternal health and child survival (MH/CS) services through NGOs in underserved areas of El Salvador (PROSAMI project). PROSAMI had three major components.  (1) The delivery of MH/CS services component included:  prenatal and neonatal health promotion, nutritional supplementation and promotion of breastfeeding for the first 6 months of life, growth monitoring, control of diarrheal diseases and acute respiratory infections, reproductive health, and vaccines for 6 preventable diseases.  (2) The NGO institutional development component provided TA in training, monitoring and evaluation, technical information, and management training in finance and logistics.  Among other benefits, this training enabled NGOs to:  organize national workshops and conferences, including local and international participation; prepare workplans and strategies for sustaining and strengthening institutional capacity; and develop linkages between the participating NGOs and the donor community.  (3) The policy development and research component provided a forum and mechanism for coordinating health sector activities and included collaboration with international institutions such as UNICEF, PLAN INTERNATIONAL, PAHO/WHO, UNFPA, WFP/FAO, and with the Government of El Salvador (GOES).  Under this component, the NGOs implemented agreements such as revolving funds for essential medicines (based on UNICEF's BAMACO Initiative).  Other coordination efforts included agreements with other NGOs for service delivery, including an agreement with the Salvadoran Demographic Association for family planning; coordination with the National University; and participation in the 1998 health survey, (FESAL 1998). All but 5 of the 30 participating NGOs continue to provide MH/CS services.  However, service delivery has been reduced.  Either the NGOs have reduced the number of people they serve or have altered the types of services they provide, or the health promoters have become volunteers.  Seven of the NGOs are receiving funds from other donors. Quantitative achievements of PROSAMI were as follows:  (1) The project strengthened the technical and management performance of more than 150 NGOs in El Salvador and at one point developed a network of 36 local health service-related NGOs.  (2) PROSAMI provided health services to some 440,000 rural Salvadorans, 100,000 above target.  (3) A total of 180,000 women and children had access to high-quality MH/CS services delivered through Salvadoran NGOs.  (4) The infant mortality rate in the project areas was reduced from 40 to 12 per 1000 live births, and deaths due to acute respiratory infections declines from 20 to 3 per 10,000. (5) The maternal mortality rate was reduced to 0 in 1997 and has remained there through mid-1998.  (6) The project trained 602 community health workers, 500 traditional birth attendants (TBAs), and 600 community health committees.  (7) A total of 450 rural community clinics were in full operation throughout the country as a result of project assistance.  (8) Many of the NGOs developed new mechanisms to sustain their programs, such as establishing and operating small businesses and small factories, marketing training programs, consulting services, and other enterprises. Lessons and recommendations include the following:  (1) A flexible system of sound administration, planning, and finance can be adapted to NGOs' differing styles and abilities. (2) A diverse group of indigenous NGOs can be organized into a coherent and collaborative network to effectively provide specific technical services.  (3) The network of health promoters and TBAs should focus not only on CS activities, but also on environmental health, education, and the eradication of diseases such as toxoplasmosis.  (4) Through continuing education and close supervision, community personnel with little formal education can successfully deliver a relatively complex package of primary health care services.  (5) Maternal and child mortality and morbidity rates can be significantly reduced through active case detection, opportune referrals, and health education and counseling, especially when this is associated with adequate basic training and regular supervision.  (6) In order to maintain the lowered rates of maternal and child mortality and morbidity, it is necessary to continue to provide monitoring, training, and evaluation of the health promoter and supervisory personnel.","Attachment: XD-ABR-624-A","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","7/1/1999 12:00:00 AM","","Maternal child health care|Child survival activities|Indigenous private voluntary organizations|Community based delivery|Health delivery|Institution building|Health policy|Health research","El Salvador","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABR624.pdf","2,834 KB","008540 - USAID.

"Evaluates the Title II program in Bolivia, being implemented by three Cooperating Sponsors (CSs) -- Adventist Development and Relief Agency (ADRA), Food for the Hungry International (FHI), and Project Concern International (PCI). The program has four components:  maternal and child health (MCH); community water and sanitation (W&S); agricultural production; and food for education (FFE).  Interim evaluation covers the period 1997-7/99. In MCH, PCI has developed good collaboration with the Ministry of Health (MOH); PCI also emphasizes the importance of communication in the native language.  However, a good information system is not being used by the MOH or the community. FHI has developed an excellent 5-year strategy, coupled with a sound community education program, but budget cuts have adversely affected its MCH program.  ADRA has a good educational program linking community health workers (CHWs) to the MOH; how these activities will continue after ADRA leaves is unclear. In W&S, PCI has two basic weaknesses, lack of a strategic focus and low budget support.  FHI has a strong cadre of water staff and a very good product.  ADRA's activities in W&S are small and receive low budget support.  All three CSs are successfully promoting village water committees and tariffs. Weaknesses include unfamiliarity with Bolivian norms of rural water system construction and lack of attention to sustainability.  In summary, FHI is delivering a high quality product. PCI and ADRA need to dedicate more budget, staff, and longer presence in the community to improve their W&S portfolios. In agriculture, a major strength of PCI is its institutional collaboration; a weakness is operation and maintenance of irrigation systems.  FHI's greatest strength is a five-phase approach to activities and strong technical staff. However, FHI appears to be relatively less disposed to collaborate with other institutions.  One ADRA strength is a solid basis in community plans; another is food-for-work activities; infrastructure is a weak area.  All three CSs are weak in marketing.  In summary, the agricultural program is basically sound.  Approaches differ, but all the CSs address the root causes of food insecurity. In FFE, there are not many program differences. Warehouse management and food distribution take place smoothly and there were numerous comments that the ration could be increased.  The environmental damage of cooking the ration with firewood in tree-scarce Bolivia could be considerable.  Some schools serve the ""breakfast"" at 11:30 with good results.  In almost every school, some negative factor is affecting girls' enrollment; until now, the CSs have not directed attention to this issue.  In summary, the FFE component is accomplishing its goals: overall, girls' enrollment and retention are up, and the school dropout rate is down for both sexes. Promulgation of the Law of Public Participation has given the CSs more opportunity to interact with municipal authorities; good coordination, interchange, and financial support are being achieved. All CSs are working to foster community participation and linkages with local institutions. Environmental awareness is growing in each of the CSs. In terms of program management, it is recommended that senior leadership of each CS travel more frequently to the field and that each CS hire an organizational development consultant to deal with issues of rapid portfolio expansion. Staff morale, work performance, and ""burn out"" are issues in several CSs, as are decentralization, discipline, internal communication, human resource management, monetization, and Call Forwards. The Bolivia Title II program is achieving many of its objectives; concentrating resources in areas of greatest poverty has brought significant improvements in program impact. The originally envisaged synergy between health, water, agriculture and education is achieving important goals. An indirect outcome of the mid-term evaluation has been a sharing among CSs rarely achieved in Bolivia.  The evaluators were also impressed with the Mission's ability to focus on key management issues while not interfering with the day-to-day operations of the CSs.  This relationship between partners has not been widely seen in Latin America.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","7/1/1999 12:00:00 AM","","Food for Peace Title II|Private voluntary organizations|Maternal child health care|Water supply|Sanitation|Agricultural production|School feeding programs|Development program management","Bolivia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABR666.pdf","2,792 KB","006302 - Adventist Development and Relief Agency International (ADRA)|000989 - Project Concern International|005271 - Food for the Hungry International (FHI)","","008515 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of Phase II (1/93-3/96) of a child survival project implemented by Africare in the Dioro District of Lebanon. Thanks to the social mobilization and information, education, and communication (IEC) strategies implemented in Phase II villages, the project was able to accomplish a large majority of its objectives in maternal health and child survival, community participation, and women's health-related empowerment. This accomplishment has led to the acquisition of strong health- related knowledge and skills by village health teams and health committees, as well as by mothers and fathers. The strengthening of the number and the multi-disciplinary nature of the village health teams, supported by the Africare field agents, allowed the routine implementation of all project activities.  The IEC strategies were successful because they were based on the results of operational research and on innovative solutions using local traditional resources. Involving men in health activities and involving women in making decisions about their health and that of their children allowed the project to increase and broaden its coverage of maternal health and child survival.  Because of the project's enlightened and encouraging leadership, the skills of project staff were strengthened through on-the-job training.  The collaboration of the staff with local counterparts allowed the project to implement a multi-sectoral approach. The documentation of project activities permitted them to be shared with all collaborators, NGOs and other donors.  The project's sustainability, already well advanced, will be completely assured by its integration into the national health policy plans to which the project will bring its ""know-how"" in community participation and IEC. Project weaknesses are due to its failure to continue following the specific community participation strategy that was developed in Phase II villages.  This specific strategy determines the outcome of the composition and the quality of work of the health committees, the selection of the village health workers and their commitment to preventive health activities, and, finally, the communities' payment of service fees for child birth deliveries. It is recommended that the project be extended at least 2 years. Lessons learned are as follows:  (1) The full participation of the community can be attained if the community understands the benefits of what it is being offered and its role as partner and key player, and so long as its own priorities are taken into account and its social structure and customs are respected.  (2) Women's participation in decisionmaking is not necessarily perceived as a threat to men's authority if the latter understand their own roles and the role of women in child survival activities.  (3) IEC messages must be designed for men as well as for women.  Men's roles are extremely important in maternal and child health activities, and men must understand why and how to participate in them.  (4) A multi-disciplinary team, carefully chosen, trained, and regularly supervised, can play an extremely important role in preventive health activities at the village level.   (5) It is not necessary to be an ""expert"" to be effective.  By encouraging a leadership that knew how to validate, consolidate, and mobilize its talents, the Dioro team, with a moderate level of training, knew how to meet the challenge of community participation, IEC, and supervision. (6) The members of the community are capable of taking care of malnourished children.  In this context, the function of role model mothers is especially important.  (7) Project results must be disseminated in order to raise interest among beneficiaries, collaborators, and counterparts and mobilize resources.  (8) The project's intervention strategies assured the sustainability of all interventions except vaccination and, to some degree, growth promotion.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","10/1/1999 12:00:00 AM","","Child survival activities|Maternal child health care|Vaccinations|Nutrition improvement|Infant nutrition|Child nutrition|Growth monitoring|Disease prevention and control|Diarrhea|Oral rehydration therapy|Maternal health care|Family planning|HIV/AIDS|Health education|IEC|Women|Community participation|KAP surveys|Project sustainability|Private voluntary organizations","Lebanon","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABR688.pdf","293 KB","002037 - Young Men's Christian Association.

"PACR of a project (PACD: 12/98) to improve public trolleybus transportation in Ukrainian cities.  The project was implemented by Research Triangle Institute (RTI). RTI, and its subcontractor Development Group International (DGI), either met or exceeded the majority of project goals.  One of the major goals, improved service delivery, was exceeded.  Under the improved management component, two major goals were exceeded -- increase in revenues and the number of individuals trained; one goal, a decrease in city subsidy, was met for the most part; and two goals, a reduction in the number of employees per vehicle and an increase in the availability ratio, were met in principle by an overall decrease and increase, respectively.  In terms of improved financial planning, the goals of developing 5-year transportation plans and having these plans adopted by the project cities were met.  DGI even exceeded the goal by developing not only the long-term plan but also very useful business plans for two cities.  On the down side, the goal of establishing inventory control and fleet management in each city was not met.  A decision not to establish a capital repair facility was agreed to by the Cognizant Technical Officer (CTO). An important element of the project was the cost share by each participating city.  All cities except one met the targets for trolleybus fleet improvements, with parts or trolleybuses purchased according to the matching funds agreements ($100,000 for all cities except Lviv, which matched with $200,000).  All parts purchased with USAID funds were also delivered to the cities in full. The following lessons were learned:  (1) This project was an excellent example of the successes that can be achieved with the roll-out of a results-oriented pilot project. The pilot helped prove where results could be achieved, as well as at what level.  In addition, a careful selection process, in which cities had to compete against each other, increased the commitment of the chosen cities to this project. (2) The requirement of matching funds to USAID funds also was a great incentive for the cities and trolleybus enterprises to remain committed to the success of the project.  However, any project that requires cost share of any kind must give enough lead time to allow the cities to budget the matching funds.  (3) Properly targeted training and TA to trolleybus and other public enterprises are very effective and should be continued as much as possible.  This project showed the benefits of short-term training and TA, as well as what can be gained in the long run from multi-year plans that are individualized for each city.  (4) Regional training workshops were invaluable for educating management staff and for interesting other cities in what can be accomplished at their trolleybus enterprises.  (5) An important unforseen benefit of a project such as this is that a visible improvement in trolleybus service visibly improved citizens' public perception of how effective local government could be. This underscores the need for future projects to focus not only on areas where training and TA will have the greatest impact, but also on areas in which improvements are readily apparent to the citizens.  (6) Several project goals might have been overlooked if the CTO had not carefully reviewed the contract documents, work plan, and monthly reports.  For instance, RTI's recommendation not to establish a capital repair facility was prompted by the CTO asking repeatedly about the status of this activity.  (7) A resident advisor is absolutely necessary, particularly when many cities are part of the project.  In addition, the grooming and use of Ukrainian staff have additional benefits to other USAID projects and the communities.  For instance, ex-project staff are now consultants in this and similar fields.

"In an attempt to help former Soviet-bloc nations move from a centrally planned economy to a market economy at the end of the Cold War, President Bush proposed a new concept, enterprise funds -- nonprofit corporations that would use a U.S. government grant to make equity investments and loans to medium- and small-sized enterprises. The funds would be managed by private individuals with extensive business or country experience and would seek to stimulate the growth of the private sector in a specific country or region.  This study examines the experience of the 11 existing enterprise funds to determine the suitability of this approach for future USAID programs. The original four enterprise funds, all in eastern Europe, have been operating for more than 7 years.  One, the Polish fund, has been an enormous success, while the performance of a second has been awful.  A third, following serious conflict with the U.S. government, seems bound for modest success, while the fourth found suitable investments only in its sixth and seventh years of operation.  Despite this mixed record, the funds probably played a key role in the early transition from communism to market economies.  They demonstrated U.S. support for private sector development and, in the Polish case, helped shape that transition.  They also made many good investments in emerging companies and helped them grow, and catalyzed the interest of private investors in eastern Europe. The other seven enterprise funds, which have been in operation 4-7 years, have uniformly been much slower in making investments than the early funds.  In their first 42 months of operation, the eight newest funds disbursed only 24% of their capital for investments, compared with 60% for the first three funds during an equivalent period.  The newer funds have also found the costs of operation to be much higher than did the early funds.  This slower start appears to be due to two factors: more difficult economic conditions, including weaker macroeconomic policies and a much less developed institutional base for the growth of the private sector; and substantially increased competition from private investors, who have begun to make massive investments in the countries of the former Soviet bloc.  Enterprise funds have thus moved from a situation in which they were a creative and potentially highly effective tool to one in which they have found greater difficulties finding a proper niche.  This changed situation obviates part of the original rationale for enterprise funds:  to serve as catalyst for private investment. Should USAID use enterprise funds in additional countries?  The evidence to date indicates that this question be answered with a qualified no.  The stunning success of Poland is not being repeated, and the results in other countries are still inconclusive.  The validity of this conclusion should be reviewed in 2 years.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","10/1/1999 12:00:00 AM","","Private sector|Economic development|Private enterprises|Market economy|Economies in transition|Small scale enterprises|Joint ventures|Business support services|Development strategies|Investment promotion|Economic conditions|Economic competition","USA|Poland|Hungary|Czech Republic|Slovakia|Bulgaria|Russia|Baltic States|Romania|Central Asia|New Independent States|Albania|Southern Africa","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNACA931.pdf","2,213 KB","008058 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of a matching grant to Freedom from Hunger (FFH) for a project (1994-98) to support FFH's Credit with Education (CWE) program, which blends the provision of micro-credit via the village banking model with health and nutrition education in an effort to improve maternal child health (MCH). The CWE program has achieved an organizational sustainability that is reasonably compliant with the grant's intent, and results appear broadly supportive of the strategic objectives of the Office of Private and Voluntary Cooperation.  FFH is strongly committed to sustainability and deserves substantial credit for beginning to address the implications of focusing on sustainability and ""bottom line"" performance at the expense of social purpose objectives. The CWE approach, a distinctive FFH product, fills an important niche in the micro-credit field by emphasizing social impact, the need to reach poor women in remote areas, and a lending and education package tailored to the needs of the poor.  The direct monetary cost of the educational component is quite modest, though whether or not either of the program's two components suffers because of its linkage with the other remains to be seen.  A serious potential deficiency of FFH's micro-credit approach is that significant shares of borrowed funds are being allocated to non-productive household consumption rather than to capital formation and enterprise development. In-country management ability is the key indicator of program success.  Management of a micro-credit program, difficult to begin with, is made doubly so by the addition of an education component and the decision to work in remote rural areas and with very poor women.  A serious long-term issue is whether independent local organizations will have the ability to manage both a credit and an education program. FFH has made a very serious effort to build strong local partnerships, though with mixed success due in good part to the tensions inherent in the model.  The record suggests that the decision to gradually move away from a direct operational role is a wise one. FFH has a clear and focused sense of mission and purpose, and there is broad consensus regarding strategy, objectives, and future difficulties and opportunities.  FFH will have to continually balance its identity between being a ""bottom-line"" credit organization and a poverty-oriented development agency.  In this regard it can serve an extremely valuable role by continuing to challenge outside scepticism about the benefits of integrating education with credit.  Strategic dangers include insularity of perspective, a narrowness of approach, and the absence of direct operational experience. FFH takes planning very seriously.  The Practitioner Services Business Plan is a thoughtful and well-developed strategy for moving toward financial independence.  Leadership appears to be strong, internal tension and dysfunctional behavior quite low.  While difficult to document, the current staff seems somewhat below the optimal level needed for what FFH is attempting to accomplish.  Senior management appears to be stretched too thin, but the team-based structure is, on balance, appropriate for what FFH does. FFH is very much a ""learning organization"" and gives considerable emphasis to internal self-examination, evaluation, and impact research. One of the most important functions that FFH should continue to play is that of provocateur to the micro-finance movement.  To do this convincingly, FFH will need to maintain a strong analytical capacity.","Contract listed on document as: FAO-0158-A-00-2044-00","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","FAO-0158-A-00-3044-00","","3/1/1999 12:00:00 AM","","Matching funds|Private voluntary organizations|Microenterprises|Credit|Health education|Nutrition education|Maternal child health care|Rural areas|Women|Beneficiary targeting|Institution building|Development program design","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABR798.pdf","3,087 KB","006190 - AMA Technologies, Inc.","","007746 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of a project (10/95-10/99) implemented by World Vision to reduce maternal, infant, and child morbidity and mortality among neglected populations in the Bergville area of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, and to build the management capacity of the District Health Services (DHS). Specific objectives focused on improvements in nutrition (growth monitoring and breastfeeding); HIV/AIDS (awareness among school children and adolescents); control of diarrheal diseases (continued feeding, oral rehydration therapy [ORT], home-available fluids, and case management); immunization (increased coverage and reduced drop-outs, and disease surveillance); acute respiratory infection (ARI) (caretakers' health-seeking behavior for childhood respiratory infection); and maternal health and family planning (improved antenatal services, mothers' awareness of danger signs, and strengthening of referral services).  The project's approach to achieving these objectives was to strengthen the nascent DHS in KwaZulu-Natal and develop community-based health partnerships. By mid-term, the project had developed a highly successful community-based program in development, with major contributions to the development of the DHS just starting to emerge.  The technical impact on health facilities was less dramatic, probably because of the established and sometimes entrenched nature of clinic and hospital services.  At the final evaluation further substantial changes had occurred.  The community health workers (CHWs) have been widely recognized both locally and nationally for their contribution to the communities and are now becoming an important part of the formal health system.  Their success has generated rising pressure for them to provide additional services to the community, at the risk of diluting their effectiveness.  There is considerable scope for further strengthening of the community partnerships. Perhaps the most remarkable achievement has been the project's contribution to the development of the DHS, which is now having a major impact on the management of health services in the Bergville area, with further development in process. Bergville was recently named South Africa's best rural health service.  The project played a major role in the development of the DHS by introducing the concepts of objectives, indicators, surveys, data collection and use, and the principles of quality assurance.  In fact, the project and the DHS are so closely integrated that many interviewees had difficulty differentiating them. Further evidence of the project's sustainable impact has been World Vision's selection of Bergville for an Area Development Program. Lagging behind have been several technical issues in the health facilities and the supervision system, which need major attention. The project's impact on HIV/AIDS awareness, through training teachers and peer-educators, has been substantial, as measured recently in a detailed qualitative study.  Evidence of behavior change is harder to find, and additional or alternative methods are recommended for the follow-on HIV project.  The qualitative survey methods used will make it possible to monitor project impact.  Several technical interventions have been incorporated into an integrated management of childhood illness (IMCI) package.  Immunization objectives were all met, and most of the ARI and nutritional objectives as well.  The diarrhea objectives were mostly not met; it is not exactly clear why. Although IMCI is now adopted, the pace for training has been generally slow and should be accelerated.  Maternal health objectives, too, have been too limited to have much impact, although positive change was noted in a number of indicators. Achieving major impact will require improving access to maternity services and strengthening the capacity of trained staff to reduce perinatal deaths.  Numerous lessons learned are detailed.

"Final external evaluation of the Collaborative Agribusiness Support Program (CASP -- 1993-98), designed to demonstrate and disseminate technology to reduce post-harvest losses and resolve related problems in public and private agribusinesses.  CASP was implemented by Mississippi State University, the lead entity (seed processing and storage); Kansas State University (grain storage); the University of Illinois (soybeans); and the University of Idaho (perishable crops). Profound changes within USAID had notable effects on CASP.  The grant agreement was never funded at the original, estimated level and an expected Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) was never executed.  Performance of the member universities is difficult to measure in this changing environment.  Notification of annual contributions to the grant agreement came at the eleventh hour, turning annual budgets and plans into guessing games.  Annual planning cycles were reduced to days or weeks.  At one point, a decision to cancel the program was made and retracted within weeks, reflecting not only the implications of agency-wide budget and program changes but also the political pressures put on USAID managers to continue the CASP.  Political influence on behalf of the four universities became a common theme (a situation not unique to CASP).  The expectation that CASP would continue unchanged because of support from the Hill was openly expressed by some in the university community. Against this background, the performance of the member universities has to be measured less against initial performance indicators than in terms of their efforts to maintain, under shifting conditions, a higher level of activity than could reasonably be expected.  In this regard, the evaluation team applauds the efforts made by many individuals associated with CASP to continue to respond to requests for assistance. Even with the unexpected changes, however, university performance could have been better, especially in regard to collaboration among the four universities, each of which, in general, continued with the agenda that existed before CASP.  The rare exception was a later, fifth member of the program, the PanAmerican Agriculture School in Zamorano, Honduras, which demonstrated the value of the CASP concept of a regional development center.  Some of the CASP members worked individually with Zamorano on activities in Central America. The next step is to examine more closely the working environment for ""food businesses"" supported by a USAID follow-on grant and the particulars of working with U.S. universities toward this end.  In the initial briefing by USAID, the evaluation team was informed that a new project would be re-bid and would be limited to U.S. universities.  The evaluators concurred with this decision, with caveats. Lessons learned and recommendations are as follows: (1) The absence of stable and predictable financial support had a strong negative impact on CASP operations.  The assumption that USAID missions would execute an independent procurement action proved to be invalid.  A BOA is critical for any new program. (2) Policy shifts favoring trade and unregulated markets have created a new working environment for CASP.  Opportunities to stimulate profitable food businesses require substantial technical information on food production, processing, and marketing.  A focus on food businesses and not physical losses for specific commodities is needed.  (3) A U.S. land grant university remains the preferred lead institutional link between USAID and private countries abroad. Technical issues are deeply science-intensive (seed DNA, testing recommended technology, and market analysis).  Additionally, such universities have long experience in building ties to other universities, commodity and trade associations, and other private companies engaged in the food business.  (4) The Request for Assistance (RFA) should permit, as much as possible, creative approaches to stimulating food businesses in USAID target countries.  An overly prescriptive design and RFA is not indicated for a new project. (5) RFAs should require respondents to describe in detail the management structure (not merely the administrative steps) they want to use.  The traditional ""Principal Investigator"" does not match the interdisciplinary team concept required.

"Final evaluation of health care organizational partnerships operated by the American International Health Alliance (AIHA) between U.S. health care organizations and universities and their Slovak counterparts between 1995 and 1998. AIHA operated five partnerships during the evaluation period.  The final three will conclude with the 10/30/99 termination of the AIHA program in Slovakia.  The partnership program has supported reform of the health system by improving hospital clinical practice and management, establishing community health initiatives, and developing educational programs in health care management. Several valuable lessons on the partnership process have been learned.  (1) The political process in the Slovak Republic has not fully supported the changes learned through the AIHA partnership projects; penetration at the ministerial and parliamentary levels has been limited.  This has constrained the dissemination and replication of results, since many of the projects are demonstrations.  (2) Improving hospital quality at substantial cost savings is possible, as evident through the Ko ice-Providence partnership.  Simple infection control procedures associated with evidence-based used of antibiotics can have dramatic effects on outcomes and at a reduced cost.  (3) Upgrading nursing practice and encouraging interdisciplinary team approaches to clinical care produces a work force that is more motivated and less likely to backtrack from progress made.  (4) Volunteerism is possible within the Slovak Republic, as evidenced by the partnerships in Petralka, Turianske Teplice, and Banska Bystrica.  Project sustainability will require voluntary effort and creative financing/fund-raising, especially where NGOs serve as partners.  It is necessary, however, that ""volunteers"" receive something in return; this is a major issue for Slovak NGOs in view of declining donor support. Also, strategies to build volunteerism in transition countries must recognize that volunteerism thrives on mutual benefit. (5) Partnerships take longer to develop than do consultancies, but appear to have greater impact due to the organizational commitment built in the process.  Almost universally, the partnerships demonstrated a commitment to project sustainability, largely due to the deeper learning process engendered by the collegiality of the relationship.  (6) Partnership exchanges should penetrate into the organization and provide a ""critical mass"" of individuals who have been directly exposed to the lessons of the projects and who consequently have changed their way of thinking.  This is a key difference between a partnership and a consultancy.  (7) Internet connectivity is critical for facilitating communications, but, more importantly, for providing access to clinical and health systems information. Internet connectivity is more likely to result in project sustainability and partnership durability when built on the personal relations established in the partnership process.  (8) Dissemination conferences were useful in demonstrating partnership results and providing visibility for conference sponsors. (9) Key issues that would benefit from additional support include: legislation to recognize changes in nursing practice; legislative and voluntary efforts to reduce domestic violence; and municipal and other legislative actions for anti- smoking laws and regulations.  (10) Projects that support system improvement deserve special support from USAID so that they may provide credibility and opportunity to their Slovak partner. Examples include the Center for Health Policy and Strategy, the Center for Smoking Cessation in Martin; the Faculty Hospital in Ko ice; and the project in Turianske-Teplice.  (11) Project sustainability and partnership durability must be clearly distinguished. The latter is possible when the partners continue to need or desire continued partnership beyond the scope of the projects in which they were engaged.  Project sustainability, however, is more directly connected to the Slovak partners' success, empowerment, and commitment to pursuing the projects. Multilateral partnerships within the country and the region may provide more ongoing support for projects than would bilateral relations with U.S. partners.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","11/1/1999 12:00:00 AM","","Societies in transition|Partnerships|Health care|Health delivery|Health care administration|Organizations|Management reform|Indigenous private voluntary organizations|Project sustainability|Internet","Slovakia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABR881.pdf","141 KB","","","008603 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to combat AIDS and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in Honduras.  Interim evaluation covers the period 7/97-11/99. In general, the project is well-designed, combining behavior change, condom distribution, and an STI control program. The choice of the private sector-focused National Center for AIDS Awareness and Prevention as an implementation mechanism is sound. The Center is run by Fundacion Fomento en Salud (FFS).  FFS has a knowledgeable, innovative, and motivated staff and provides excellent administrative assistance to participating NGOs, which have set up several distribution points for condoms.  However, all FFS staff are based in Tegucigalpa, and not one has intimate, first-hand knowledge of the high-risk behavior groups. Furthermore, the referral system from NGO to STI services, set up primarily through peer educators, is weak. The Ministry of Health (MOH) has implemented a national second-generation surveillance system, and its HIV case reporting system is providing improved data.  Also, a large number of distribution points for condoms have been set up. However, little training has been provided in syndromic management and STI service implementation, and there is poor monitoring, supervision, and evaluation. According to the AIDS Policy Environment Score (APES) developed by Programa Accion SIDA de Centro America (PASCA), Honduras has the most resources, research, policy support, and policy formulation in Central America, but it has a low score in program components.  It is important to note that Honduras made significant progress in two key areas of policy dialogue during 1999.  The MOH presented its national strategic plan in August 1999, and the AIDS law, which had been pending for over a year, was passed on September 9, 1999. A large gap in the project is the limited coordination among key stakeholders, a core reason for USAID support.  There are no joint planning processes between FFS and the MOH, and many opportunities are being missed to bring NGOs together with each other.  Also, there is no coordination between NGOs and the state or among donors, resulting in many overlapping activities. A new structure and direction for the project is advisable and feasible not only in the content of specific areas, but also in reconceptualizing needed services and products and how they are used and delivered.  It is necessary not only to revise the format and content of educational materials, for example, but to develop utilization strategies that go beyond dissemination.  It is also necessary to rethink HIV-related activities and to respond to the overwhelming perceived need to integrate HIV prevention and other priorities of the target populations.  This means addressing sex workers as mothers with maternal and child health needs and not just as people in need of STI care; and promoting adolescents' need for community involvement and not just their use of condoms.  Such changes will have to address key issues such as stigma, representation, the potential impact of interventions, and the perceived needs of NGOs and their staffs.  FFS administration has expressed an openness and readiness to explore alternatives internally and to receive external TA where necessary.

"This pamphlet discusses lessons learned by USAID about the impact and sustainability of development assistance efforts in Europe and Eurasia. To have impact, a project or program must influence policy and achieve change.  Some accomplishments, such as passage of new legislation, are only a means to an end; true impact takes place only when the end result of the new legislation has become observable.  To be sustainable, a project or program must be able to renew and support itself independently of donor funding.  If a product or idea is used by commercial ventures, training institutions, or the like, it is sustainable whether or not the institution that originally promoted it continues to exist. Two ways that donors can achieve impact and ensure sustainability are by promoting sustainable institutions and by funding dissemination activities.  Sustainable institutions actively participate in the transfer of development concepts and advocate their implementation within the host country.  When donors partner with local institutions, they can undertake several measures to ensure that their development assistance agenda achieves maximum impact:  (1) Develop a comprehensive assistance plan.  (2) Commit sufficient TA and funding over a sufficient time period.   (3) Study the institutional context and culture.  (4) Study the political context.  (5) Study the programs of other donors. (6) Identify and monitor organizational vision, leadership, management, and constituency. (7) Phase out donor assistance according to a clearly articulated plan. Dissemination includes a wide range of activities that promote the adoption of new ideas and reinforce development assistance agendas. Dissemination approaches in Europe and Eurasia have made use of the news media in addition to training, print media, broadcast, and online media products developed for specific projects.  Donors can greatly enhance the impact of dissemination by adopting the following principles:  (1) Write clear and inclusive scopes of work.  (2) Allocate sufficient resources for dissemination.  (3) Clarify expected results and impact. (4) Tailor dissemination materials to specific audiences.  (5) Ensure that local counterparts ""own"" the dissemination approach.  (6) Encourage the use of professional services.  (7) Promote interagency communications.

"Evaluates Project 2000, designed to increase the use of maternal and child health (MCH) interventions in 12 areas in Peru.  Interim evaluation covers the period 9/93-4/99. Pathfinder International is the implementing agency. While Project 2000's overall thrust remains unchanged, a shift in emphasis from service utilization and service outputs to functional outputs and process activities requires that the project's objectives and scope be modified, and that service utilization and service outputs link functional and process activities with anticipated changes in utilization of health services, health status, and sustainability. The notable success of Project 2000 is PCMI, the training/service quality program in reproductive, maternal, perinatal, and child health. In PCMI, Project 2000 is piloting a model combining innovative approaches to human resources development and quality improvement for MCH services in 89 health establishments in the 12 targeted regions. Phase I is proceeding successfully at the basic qualification level, and is showing evidence of improving quality of MCH services and increasing their utilization, although the training schedule is about 2 years behind schedule, since the shift in core activities delayed the roll-out of the PCMI until a little more than 1.5 years ago. The PCMI is now at a critical juncture for deciding whether to focus on vertical increases in levels of quality or a horizontal spread of minimal quality improvements to the 2,500 establishments in those regions.  To support PCMI, Project 2000 has improved drug management, evaluated the national health information system, and developed supervisory approaches for the PCMI program in the 89 hospitals.  An information, education and communication (IEC) component to the project started late and needs strengthening. In the project's financial management and health financing components, the Budget Programming System (SPP) is the most significant output; it is a powerful and flexible electronic spreadsheet-based software program for estimating both unit and total costs of Ministry of Health (MOH) facility activities and represents an important break with the top-down methods of the past.  The second significant output is the Cost and Income Information System (SICI), a step-down cost analysis software tool implemented in three hospitals.  The SICI system is designed to be compatible with the SPP.  However, while there are several indicators of the potential sustainability of the SPP and SICI, more networking with Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) personnel is needed to ensure that the systems are adapted to MEF's needs and requirements. The prospects for PCMI's sustainability appear strong.  On the level of individual service institutions, the potential for sustainability is excellent.  Regional authorities, hospital directors, and service providers ""own"" the improvements. Also, patients and their families are recognizing and appreciating the positive changes in PCMI-assisted hospitals; much more work is needed, however, before communities are knowledgeable about healthy behaviors, danger signs, and when to seek help, and routinely demand high-quality MCH services. Finally, the fact that the Government of Peru and the MOH more than made up for a shortfall in P.L. 480 funding for the PCMI, together with the MOH's universally enthusiastic support for the PCMI augur well for the financial sustainability of project interventions. Two factors have led to delays and conflict.  The first is the complex structure of the project.  Pathfinder's counterpart is a Special MOH Unit (UEP 2000) that reports to the MOH's Office of Financing, Investment and External Cooperation rather than to MCH line departments. Pathfinder itself has two main subcontractors that in turn have further subcontracts. Second, the UEP 2000 takes literally a statement in the Project Agreement and Pathfinder contract that the MOH will personally approve all project documents that authorize procurement of services and will participate fully with USAID in guiding and monitoring the project.","SO3-Improved health, including family planning, of high risk|populations|Proyecto 2000 (Project 2000)","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","5/1/1999 12:00:00 AM","","Maternal child health care|Public health care|Health delivery|Health facilities|Human capacity development|Health professional education|Pilot projects|Health care administration|Project sustainability|Economic self sufficiency","Peru","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABR918.pdf","6,919 KB","010110 - BHM International, Inc.","","008591 - USAID.

"PACR of the CLASP (Caribbean and Latin American Scholarship) II project in El Salvador (7/90-9/98), designed to equip a broad base of Salvadoran leaders with leadership capability, an appreciation of democratic processes in a free market economy, and technical skills and academic training. Over the life of the project, a total of 1,514 Salvadorans, vs. a target of 1,500, received training in the United States in democratic practices and diverse technical and academic fields.  CLASP II also funded:  short U.S. visits to acquaint support groups for the education, labor leader, and health care reform programs with the contents of the training programs; attendance by four participants to the 1995 Beijing World Conference; and four in-country training events -- a workshop for members of the Board of Directors of the Initiative for the Americas Fund (FIAES), and three high-impact training workshops in preparation for the newly approved Human Capacity Development (HCD) Activity (5190432). The project exceeded targets in all areas -- including targets for women participants and training at Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) -- except long-term training.  Program management, with the concurrence of USAID/W, decided to limit long-term training, especially academic, based on the expense of such programs, participant tendency to focus on their own benefit rather than on that of their institutions or communities, and stakeholder demand for shorter and more specialized programs geared to specific objectives.  In addition, CLASP recruited candidates from a number of special groups, including scholars living or working outside the San Salvador metropolitan area; youth (those under age 30 years) or those working with youth; and those contributing to the national reconstruction program.  CLASP II also coordinated specific training programs with Mission strategic objectives in economic growth, democracy, health, environment, and national reconstruction. Lessons were learned in the three areas noted below. Lessons for host country ownership:  (1) Involve host country institutions in all stages of the training cycle.  (2) Recruit from committed host country institutions that support the application of new skills and knowledge by returning scholars.  (3) Enlist the participation of supervisors, decision-makers, and other key stakeholders in training programs. Lessons for program design and management:  (1) Establish and adhere to a timetable adequate for each step in the interrelated process of integrated participant training programs. (2) Facilitate communication and cooperation among all stakeholders from pre-departure of scholars through the training provider visit.  (3) Sharpen training program objectives with specific measurable outcomes.  (4) Develop a critical mass of scholars through repeat programs.  (5) Strive for homogeneous training groups.  (6) Develop an effective working partnership between the programming agency and the training provider.  (7) Select training institutions sensitive to and capable of meeting special needs of scholars from post-war circumstances. Lessons for sustainability of follow-on activities:  (1) Decentralize follow-on activities to the regional level in order to enhance scholar networking and participation.  (2) Encourage scholar responsibility and shared ownership for undertaking follow-on activities.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","11/1/1999 12:00:00 AM","","Education for development|Participants|Leadership training|Democratization|Technical training|Management training|Beneficiary targeting|Project sustainability","El Salvador","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABR931.pdf","565 KB","008540 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to address USAID/Brazil's special objective concerning at-risk youth (POMMAR project).  Interim evaluation covers the period 9/94-9/99.  The project is being implemented by Partners of the Americas in three cities in Brazil's economically depressed Northeast Region (Fortaleza, Recife, and Salvador) and, at Mission request, in Brasilia. In keeping with a 1998 refinement of the Mission's strategic objective for at-risk youth, POMMAR redefined its strategy to focus on: protection and rights, with special emphasis on sexual exploitation and abuse, especially among girls; and vocational training, including incentives for formal general education as a necessary prerequisite. POMMAR also defined two cross-cutting issues:  health, including improving access to health services for adolescents, with an emphasis on reproductive health (RH)/HIV/AIDS; and youth participation in policy and programs. POMMAR has overcome most of the problems noted in the 1996 evaluation (PD-ABN-853).  A more directed approach to subgrant selection has largely solved the problem of a lack of subgrant criteria, and the subgrant approval process is much quicker than before.  Monitoring of subgrant recipients is much tighter and systematic, and subgrant funds are reaching recipient organizations.  As recommended, follow-on grants are being used to extend the time and amount of subgrants, and travel and study grants, along with the Technical Advisory Group, have been eliminated.  Research and training are now more closely linked to subgrant recipient and project needs than before. In all, POMMAR has provided 29 subgrants to 24 different NGOs. Nearly all beneficiary organizations cite POMMAR's active role in program and institutional development, efforts that currently focus on individualized TA.  POMMAR has been especially effective in networking. It participates actively in inter-institutional councils for at-risk youth issues in all three cities in the Northeast and has stimulated the participation of subgrant recipients on these councils.  The placement of permanent staff in each target city increased the ability to build links among NGOs, governmental agencies, and other funding agencies, as is evident from POMMAR's ability to directly obtain some $800,000 for subgrant recipients from other agencies, as well as from its success in leveraging additional funds. POMMAR has taken steps to improve impact measurement, but more is needed.  POMMAR can document 3,449 direct and 6,898 indirect beneficiaries of programs it supports. In addition, 84% of direct beneficiaries have been reached by health-related prevention and service programs, nearly all beneficiaries are in formal school, and 85% of these were promoted to the next grade level last year.  Of youth finishing vocational courses, 26% are employed.  There have been 101 grievances for sexual exploitation and abuse lodged, 107 young people are receiving legal support, and 774 are receiving psychosocial support. The average length of sentences for rights violations has risen, and 8 organizations have documented their methodology and shared it with others.  While an improvement over 3 years ago, however, this effort to measure impact is not enough.  Data collection has generally been external to the projects, rather than built into their design, and a lack of baseline data hampers data interpretation.  Likewise, no systematic effort has been made to objectively measure institutional improvement of subgrant recipients. Other areas needing improvement include POMMAR's lackluster performance in job placement of vocational trainees and its poor record on financial sustainability of subgrant activities (especially microenterprise development).  In addition, wide variations exist in targeting resources toward those truly at risk.  Promising methods of targeting exist and should be used. POMMAR, ABCA (Partner's Brazilian office), and USAID/Brazil have improved their working relationship and are generally fulfilling their roles and responsibilities. Partners/Washington, however, has fulfilled very few of its obligations as defined in the project proposal, including the provision of promised matching funds.  The ""value added"" to the project by Partners/Washington is very low given its relatively high indirect cost rate.  This should be taken into serious consideration when designing the grant mechanism for an extension to 2003.","Project title: Displaced Children and Orphans Fund (DCOF) and|Patrick J.

"During the 1990s, the Republic of Guinea restructured its education system to increase primary school access for the long-neglected majority of its children, especially girls.  As a result, the percentage of girls enrolled in primary school rose from 17% in 1989 to 37% in 1997.  Now growing at 16% annually, girls' educational participation in Guinea ranks first among African countries for sustained growth.  Gender disparity, while still acute, is diminishing, as girls' enrollment grows faster than does boys'.  But girls still lag behind boys in persistence and achievement.  In 1997, only 57% of girls vs. 73% of boys reached the final year of primary school, and only 33% of girls passed the seventh grade entry exam, vs. 44% of boys. Guinea's reform program has also resuscitated demand for schooling in a country where enrollments had been declining.  Notably, this demand includes schooling for girls, owing in large part to activity spurred by the former education minister and an awareness campaign carried out by the Ministry of Pre-University Education (MEPU).  Highly visible policy and institutional changes (such as latrines, female teachers, and a liberalized pregnancy policy) have signaled parents that their daughters are welcome in school.  They also have reduced some obstacles to girls' educational participation.  The Equity Committee established by MEPU to launch its education initiative for girls has increased awareness of girls' participation, though its efforts have remained outside the mainstream of MEPU operations. USAID has played a leading role in supporting these changes.  Through its Education Sector Reform program (6750222/6750223), the Fundamental Quality and Equity Levels project (6750230), and the centrally-funded Girls and Women's Education project (9365848), the Agency provided budgetary and technical support in areas essential to reforming the education system:  policy, financial management, and planning and information systems development.  It introduced girls' education to the Guinean government's agenda, as well as to other donors' agendas, creating a climate of support for girls' education through careful use of performance conditions, technical assistance, and project support for training and non-routine activities, such as research and the awareness campaign.  USAID helped MEPU build the head of steam needed to drive its reform efforts. The Guinean government now faces three major challenges to advancing girls' education:  (1) responding to the demand created by the awareness campaign; (2) coordinating the donors who wish to participate in Guinea's successful reform effort; and (3) integrating the needs of girls and other vulnerable groups into mainstream educational services instead of supporting special projects.  The government also must concentrate more on school quality to improve efficiency and sustainability. Guinea's experience demonstrates that a unified message delivered through activist national leadership, media, and local leadership -- made concrete in new schools with visible policy changes -- can go far in setting the stage for increasing girls' education.  Basic education reform, coupled with girl-specific policies and programs, are powerful and effective tools for improving girls' participation. Other lessons learned include the following:  (1) Baseline assessment and analysis are requirements for gender-aware policy and program design.  (2) A coherent education policy and investment framework must be applied to girls' education initiatives.  (3) The most important changes regarding gender roles take place on the local level.  (4) A mix of conditionality and projectized support was effective in putting girls' education on the agenda.  (5) Sustained, integrated support is necessary to consolidate MEPU's early efforts in girls' education.  (6) Efforts to improve quality and enhance equity must proceed in tandem.

"Final evaluation of Phase I of a cooperative agreement with CARE to institutionalize its Partnership and Household Livelihood Security (PHLS) methodology in CARE country programming in Bolivia, Mali, Peru, and Tanzania.  Evaluation covers the period 10/96-2/99 against a PACD of 9/99. CARE proposed to use four different approaches in its pilot countries:  Bolivia was to work with established, formal NGOs; Peru with sector-based partnerships; Mali with formal, beneficiary-owned organizations; and Tanzania with local organizations and indirect service delivery.  Overall progress has been satisfactory, and it is expected that all objectives will be met by the PACD.  CARE pilot countries have been most successful in establishing viable partnerships of various kinds, while much slower progress has been made in applying the HLS framework to existing and future interventions. Some weaknesses remain.  Monitoring and evaluation of PHLS activities have lagged well behind other accomplishments in all countries except Mali.  Implementation has been hampered by donor focus on sector-specific project implementation, the inability to redesign existing projects to conform to the multi-dimensional paradigm of PHLS, the scarcity of new project design opportunities, the need to strengthen partners institutionally, and the difficulty of defining an appropriate mix of development impact indicators in addition to those required by donor agencies.  Nevertheless, the pilot countries have all made progress in these areas. The most impressive progress in applying the HLS concept has been made in Peru, while partnership with other implementing organizations has been the focus of the Bolivia country program.  CARE/Mali has made considerable progress in establishing monitoring and evaluation baselines and partnerships with beneficiary organizations, and Tanzania appears to have excelled in both local-level partnership and HLS assessment.  It is expected, though not assured, that the Monitoring, Evaluating, and Reporting (MER) system will be functional in all pilot countries by the PACD. Partnership has been interpreted differently in pilot countries.  In Bolivia and Peru it is applied to relationships with other implementing organizations, whether governmental or nongovernmental, and tends not to include beneficiary organizations, although this is far more true of Bolivia than Peru.  CARE/Mali, on the other hand, has taken great care to partner with beneficiary-owned organizations, neglecting partnerships with NGOs.  CARE/Tanzania appears to have involved both types of partner organizations in its urban assessment process in Dar Es Salaam. Defining, operationalizing, and, in particular, measuring the concept of household livelihood security has not been easy for CARE.  The definition and monitoring of impact has been a preoccupation for many donor agencies for at least two decades, and projects embracing the concept of basic human needs have been in existence since the early 1980s.  What is new in PHLS is the packaging of all these elements in an empirically based theoretical framework.  Nonetheless, if household livelihood security is to have more meaning, there should be greater understanding of the intra-household dynamics of the population of a given area.  The HLS literature devotes little attention to gender relations, local social values, and other aspects of household welfare strategies, although some of the broader economic and political constraints are becoming clearer as CARE works with community-based organizations.  The principal contradiction in the conceptual framework of HLS is that most interventions remain sectorally focused and community oriented, and multi-sectoral household focus only becomes a reality in impact measurement.  Clustering projects in the same geographic area is not the same as focusing these projects on the same households.  Although the difference may appear trivial, it has importance for the meaning of HLS as a development methodology. A 2-year extension, as originally envisaged, is recommended.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","FAO-A-00-96-90051-00|FAO-0158-A-00-6051-00","","2/1/1999 12:00:00 AM","","Development strategies|Partnerships|Households|Household based delivery|Pilot projects|Basic needs|Economic models|Development project monitoring|Private voluntary organizations|Indigenous private voluntary organizations|Community based delivery|Local groups|Economic sectors|Impact assessment|Beneficiary targeting","Bolivia|Mali|Peru|Tanzania","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABR994.pdf","2,828 KB","006190 - AMA Technologies, Inc.|007518 - CARE International","","007746 - USAID.

"PACR of a cooperative agreement with CARE to rehabilitate water and sanitation facilities damaged by Hurricane Mitch in El Salvador (MAREAS project, ended 6/99). The time-line for the MAREAS project was extremely short and required a fast-paced implementation strategy.  This accelerated project start-up and implementation schedule may be without precedent in the history of U.S.-funded water and sanitation emergency interventions in El Salvador. The project exceeded its goals, and its health impact has been recognized by doctors and nurses of the health units within the target areas, according to whom the number of cases of skin and water-borne diseases decreased evidently after MAREAS. Specific achievements included:  disinfection of 4,626 hand-dug wells and 4,750 latrines; rehabilitation/construction of 550 latrines; improvement of 650 wells (200 with only a sanitary seal and a protecting wall); and rehabilitation of 4 water systems and construction of 5 others.  Complementary infrastructure works to ensure sustainability of the provided services included:  construction of three vaults in the road to El Flor and El Porvenir communities; filling and compacting of 40 sq m of selected material around the eroded area of the health clinic in Puerto Parada; provision of new wells, protecting walls, sanitary seals,  and rope pumps to public schools in Babilonia and Chacastera in Canton San Antonio Potrerios and Nuevo Amanecer in Canton Zamoran, Municipality of Jiquilisco, Usulutan; repair of the existing MARK II handpump at the health clinic in La Canoa and in public wells at Mata de Pina and La Papalota in Canton San Marcos, Municipality of Jiquilisco, Usulutan; construction of 50 meters of wire-reinforced rock walls (gabions) in El Borbollon, Canton El Jocotal, Municipality of El Transito, San Miguel; and installation of a wound steel cable (50 meters) over the Grande de San Miguel River for residents of Canton El Obrajuelo. Additional and complementary water and sanitation activities are being funded under project 5190450 (MAS). Lessons learned are as follows:  (1) An accelerated implementation schedule, even though imperative, as in this project, has a negative effect on the community education and development process.  (2) Initial planning with Ministry of Public Health representatives permitted smooth and efficient coordination among the different entities and donors helping Hurricane Mitch victims.  (3) Awarding emergency projects to responsive entities that already have a presence in the country, and especially in the target areas, allows rapid and successful implementation.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","12/1/1999 12:00:00 AM","","Emergency relief|Disaster relief|Public services|Water supply structures|Potable water|Water sanitation|Dug wells|Outdoor toilet facilities","El Salvador","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABS002.pdf","211 KB","008540 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (1989-98) to establish the Center for Technology Development (CTD) as a private organization for stimulating technology development and commercialization in the Karnataka region of India. The project achieved its purpose.  The CTD has been legally established as a non-profit autonomous institution and has served as a forum through which leaders from business, financial institutions, government, and academia have worked to strengthen and coordinate Karnataka's technology infrastructure. CTD activities were focused in four areas:  food processing, informatics, new materials, and dry land development.  To achieve its goal of regional economic development, CTD has established a network of organizations that links diverse parties, identifies shared interests, and develops opportunities of mutual benefit. CTD has leveraged a key resource -- retired executives from the Indian civil service -- to create economic development activity, combining expertise with low cost and personal altruism with clear organizational benefits. CTD's goal is to commercialize laboratory-level scientific knowledge into market-driven goods and services for the global marketplace.  To this end, it concentrates on commercializing technology after the basic research is over, i.e., on applied research.  To promote industry-institute interaction, CTD promoted two non-profit companies under Section 25 of the Indian Companies Act for the commercialization of technologies developed at leading scientific institutions.  One such company, Agricultural Technologies and Services Private Limited (Agritech) has commercialized and marketed agricultural, horticultural, and allied technologies developed by various research and development (R&D) organizations. CTD has a Governing Board of representatives from industry, R&D institutions, academia, the Government of Karnataka, and financial institutions, as well as executive and finance committees.  CTD does innovative co-financing with other financial institutions, especially for venture capital to accelerate the commercial introduction of the new technologies. This venture capital window, the National Venture Capital Forum (NVCF), is the main reason why the CTD has already become sustainable.  CTD's replicability in the region, a key project objective, is evident from its establishment of the Kumaon Development Center (KDC) as an independent society for the development of the Kumaon Division of Uttar Pradesh. Key lessons learned include the following:  (1) Regional development is a process, not a project.  (2) Concentrated effort in a few focused thrust areas yields quick results.  (3) Leveraging of funds by coordinating with multiple financing agencies is essential.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","11/1/1999 12:00:00 AM","","Regional development|Technological development|Applied research|Technology applications|High technology|Institution building|Private sector|Commercialization","India","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABS006.pdf","1,736 KB","008557 - USAID.

"Evaluates activities under USAID/Angola's Democracy and Governance (D&G) strategic objective (SO), aimed at strengthening civil society organizations and political institutions.  Evaluation covers the period 1996-12/99. When USAID's D&G SO (SO 2) was developed (1995-96), optimism about the peace process appeared justified, and USAID and its partners worked with political parties and parliamentarians toward this objective. Seminars, workshops, and theatrical plays provided training in pluralism and tolerance and were aimed at shaping attitudes favorable to national reconciliation.  USAID's program assisted political parties in strengthening their organizations. For example, three parties reported reorganizations following USAID-sponsored training.  The renewed outbreak of war in late 1998 invalidated the reconciliation aspect of the Mission's SO and constrained, but did not stop, efforts to prepare political parties, parliamentarians, and civil society for meaningful participation in a democratic political system. Despite the resumption of war in several parts of the country, USAID's partnership activities with NGOs appear to have been effective in strengthening civil society groups.  The activities aimed at changing attitudes, some of which have broad radio and TV audiences in addition to the participants and live audiences, have continued. Some government officials attend and participate in these activities.  Much of the data on these matters, however, is anecdotal or is testimony obtained during focus group meetings with participants and beneficiaries.  Only two of USAID's partners conduct pre- and post-activity evaluations of target groups/participants. For the future, consideration should be given to revising SO 2 to more fully connect with current realities.  With an active war going on, national reconciliation is at best a long-term possibility that would require a strategy for ending the war and actively working with both sides of the conflict.  This appears to be beyond the scope and resources of the D&G project.  However, the activities being implemented contribute in important ways to the elements of SO 2 that focus on strengthening civil society and Angolan political institutions.  A forward- looking program that continues USAID's focus on these two objectives, perhaps as separate SOs, appears to be well justified. Additionally, USAID is encouraged to include new program elements that can enhance its ability to realize progress in both the civil society and political institutions aspects of its D&G program. A dual transition is underway in Angola.  First, the  country is moving from a Marxist-Leninist political system toward a democratic multiparty system -- not an easy transition.  While not all leaders of the ruling party favor this move, they recognize that with the demise of the Soviet Union and the conditions on economic assistance imposed by Western financial institutions, they must, however reluctantly, take that road.  It should not be surprising, therefore, if progress is uneven.  The second transition, which is temporarily stalled due to the war, is the transition from a 30-year environment of war to peace and stability.  In these circumstances, attention might well be given to working for change by focusing on ""targets of opportunity"" --  some leaders in the ruling party and government appear willing to work towards democracy and a pluralist system.

"Evaluates the Latin American and the Caribbean Maternal Mortality (LAMM) initiative, aimed at improving the delivery of essential obstetric care (EOC) in the region. Interim evaluation covers the period 12/96-9/99. The LAMM initiative had a somewhat unusual beginning because it did not have a Project Paper, had a staggered start-up, and had three implementing agencies and various contracting mechanisms. Despite considerable efforts to overcome these obstacles, conceptual clarity is still lacking in key elements of the initiative, leaving LAMM implementers without the guidance needed to weigh technically complex programming and intervention alternatives.  Also, giving each partner exclusive responsibility for one intermediate results (IR) has produced clear lines of responsibility but has unduly separated the three components.  Also, four strategic  EOC issues are not yet included in the LAMM results package -- holistically oriented service models, unmet need, and improvements in obstetric data collection and in training of nurses and auxiliary nurses. Findings regarding IRs are as follows: (1) In IR 1  -- increased community capacity  to recognize and respond to pregnancy-related complications by accessing health services -- LAMM is making substantial progress in one pilot country in increasing the percentage of adults who can name danger signs during pregnancy and who specify an intent to use services in the event of an obstetric emergency.  Also, progress is being made in preparing community emergency evacuation plans and improving linkages between community groups and health workers.  In other pilot countries, the quality of information, education, and communication (IEC) materials is high, but community mobilization is not far advanced.   (2) In IR2 -- improved quality of care at the first level of obstetric referral -- learning is taking place in one pilot country in developing, testing, and disseminating protocols, standards, and guidelines, and significant, replicable gains are occurring in improved EOC.  In another country, fewer gains are being achieved, although activities are underway to improve patient reception and flow. Energetic Ministry of Health (MOH) commitment to the improvement process is essential; where it exists, gains will likely take place.  Also, some projects seem to be addressing peripheral rather than substantive obstetric issues.  Additional focus on the four essential obstetric emergencies -- hemorrhage, sepsis, hypertension/eclampsia, and obstructed delivery  -- would help address this. (3) In IR 3 -- intensive implementation of the EOC aspects of the Regional Plan for the Reduction of Maternal Mortality -- substantial gains have been achieved in high-level political support to reduced maternal mortality at the country level.  Adequate progress is being made in reviewing existing strategies and legislative/regulatory policy changes, though country coordinating committees need to be strengthened.  Enhanced communication between PAHO country program managers and better informed regional program staff are areas needing improvement.  Also, except in isolated cases, PAHO staff appears to be concerned with pure policy formulation and is disconnected from what is taking place in the field. Success stories should be given wide exposure throughout LAMM, and the four neglected strategic EOC issues mentioned above should receive additional policy attention.

"Evaluates project to develop the capacity of Mayan NGOs to provide primary health care services, particularly reproductive health services, in 20 targeted municipalities in USAID/G CAP priority areas.  Mid-term evaluation covers the period 9/97-9/99.  Project Concern International (PCI) is the implementing agency. To date, PCI has established strategic alliances with six Mayan NGOs, five of which are currently receiving funding, training, and TA to improve their institutional and technical capacity to deliver health services.  The first year and a half of the project were devoted to NGO identification and strengthening and to NGO hiring of personnel (usually nurses) to manage service delivery and work with community volunteers (usually educators).  The project's Mayan partner, Rxiin T'namet, also conducted introductory training for NGO staff.  Clinical services began in March 1999; the NGOs working with PCI currently cover a population of 67,369. The project has a number of strengths.  PCI's Guatemala office has good relations in the field and especially with Ministry of Health (MOH) leadership in departments where the project is active.  It also has strength in management and administration and in some promising technical areas, including community pharmacies.  The project also has a good baseline and a new project director who has personal credibility with USAID partners and Guatemalan health officials in the MOH and in rural areas. Overall, however, the project has not performed as expected, having failed to make significant progress in any of the intermediate results (IRs) and lower-level results (LLRs) specified in the agreement.  The project currently has little programming specific to the community or household, access to clinical services has not increased significantly, and there are no indicators to suggest that quality of services has improved.  The project has also been unable to report much progress on most indicators; even those for which data exist fall far below the anticipated annual targets.  These findings are disappointing, especially in light of the project's size and budget. The reasons for the lack of progress are complex.  A number of operational and management problems during the first 2 years had a strong negative impact on the project.  Two other factors also contributed significantly:  PCI assumed that its successful, long-term relationship with Rxiin T'namet constituted a model replicable with other Mayan organizations and that this replication was feasible as a strategy to meet program objectives.  Probably neither was accurate, for reasons both particular to the PCI-Rxiin T'namet partnership and to the characteristics of Rxiin T'namet as an organization. Additionally, the PCI country team restricted itself when it limited counterparts to women-oriented and women-managed grassroots Mayan NGOs in indigenous rural communities.  These decisions had long-range implications for performance.  Even if PCI had been successful in identifying and strengthening 10 NGOs, as it had originally proposed, the project could never approach the coverage goals described in the proposal, nor could it make much progress on the agreement's results and indicators.  PCI's current NGOs still require major investments in creating or upgrading technical skills and are still far from the competency levels necessary for providing quality health services, even in small populations. The evaluation provides options which PCI can use to set priorities and restructure activities to achieve results within the remaining time frame and budget.  These include continuing the current program with more realistic expectations; modifying the original strategy to increase coverage while retaining the focus on Mayan NGOs; expanding the program to focus on service delivery; and expanding activities in prevention and family health, while retaining some clinical and administrative activities.

"Evaluates partnership grant between the U.S.-based National Pollution Prevention Roundtable (NPPR) and the U.S.- Asian Environmental Partnership (USAEP) to create up to eight country-level pollution prevention and clean production (P2/CP) roundtables in Asia and make them functionally sustainable. Final evaluation covers the period 1/97 to 3/99, the end of the original period of the grant, which has been extended 1 year. Roundtables were established in three countries (Indonesia, the Philippines, and Thailand) and are in varying degrees of formation in six others.  Sustainability is moderate to high in the roundtables in Indonesia and the Philippines. Although the grantee did not establishing eight country-level roundtables, as targeted, use of a more flexible definition of roundtable, ranging from networks of active CP professionals at one end, to a more formal roundtable-like organization capable of hosting an annual meeting at the other, indicates that NPPR fully met the cooperative agreement's primary intent.  There appears to have been a working understanding between USAEP and NPPR that the form of the roundtable could vary in accordance with individual countries needs, emerging country CP trends, the availability and interest of roundtable advocates, and the presence of other CP- like organizations. Also, the probability of formal roundtable establishment depends on a range of variables, many outside the scope of the cooperative agreement, such as the Asian economic crisis, turnover of key roundtable advocates and sponsors, and shifts in host-country government and ministry interests.  For example, lower-than-expected demand for Asian P2/CP (unrelated to the economic downturn), the real ""exportability"" to Asia of the U.S.-based NPPR model (annual meeting, secretariat, membership dues, etc.), country-specific hesitation to form new organizations, and the emergence of other P2/CP forums appears to have undercut NPPR's strong efforts. NPPR actively advanced pollution prevention awareness in targeted Asia countries and nurtured roundtable organizational capacity-building. Most respondents had very favorable feedback about grantee field support, and interviewees also rated NPPR's US-based national conferences as very valuable. NPPR also nurtured development of the first regional-level roundtable in Bangkok (11/97) and the second meeting in Brisbane (4/99).  By most accounts, NPPR support was instrumental in making these meetings a reality.  The importance of establishing a region-wide roundtable was noted in the grant agreement and its success may provide a greater dividend than anticipated. Recommendations are to:  (1) align NPPR's field implementation efforts more closely with the status of country- level roundtable formation and development; (2) adopt a more strategic approach during the extension period in order to maximize limited funding and staff resources; and (3) use more frequent NPPR communication with USAEP to improve coordination with USAEP's many partners.  Discussions with USAEP and NPPR indicate that many of these recommendations are already underway.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","AEP-0015-A-00-6033-00|AEP-0015-A-00-5003-00","","9/1/1999 12:00:00 AM","","Environmental protection|Pollution control|Environmental technologies|Partnerships|Meetings|Information dissemination|National level|Regional level|Institution building|Public awareness|Institutional sustainability","Asia|USA","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABS080.pdf","339 KB","003433 - USAID.

"Evaluates the Agro-based Industries and Technology Development Project (ATDP), designed to expand and strengthen private agribusiness in Bangladesh by increasing access to policy, technology, and credit. Interim evaluation covers the period 1/95-10/98. ATDP has significantly helped create public awareness of the potential of agribusiness development in the country, and its performance in terms of six agreed-upon results indicators seems impressive.  However, the validity of these indicators is open to debate and should be refined for precision and clarity.  Also, the project has suffered from a lack of sector and geographic focus, and project management has been deficient in the areas of staffing, reporting, coordination, and delegation of authority. On the positive side, the overall access by the private sector to credit, technology, and information through the project has been good. ATDP's efforts in promoting U.S. Government poultry and dairy through Government of Bangladesh (GOB) agencies, NGOs, agribusiness companies, and private entrepreneurs are notable initiatives of institutional collaboration.  The contribution of the policy unit to agribusiness development has been positive, although the project's efforts in policy analysis seem inadequate to a part of the evaluation team. The Ministry of Agriculture, however, feels that the lack of emphasis on analytical research was appropriate. The Agribusiness Credit Fund (ACF) has been a valuable source of short-term financing for certain agribusinesses.  However, it has had limited success in creating new agribusinesses, largely because of a focus on financing working capital and trading loans to existing entrepreneurs.  Includes recommendations.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","3/1/1999 12:00:00 AM","","Agribusiness|Agricultural enterprises|Access to services|Agricultural credit|Information services|Agricultural technology|Agricultural policy|Policy analysis|Performance indicators|Development project management|Development project design|Economic sectors","Bangladesh","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABS327.pdf","312 KB","","","006928 - Bangladesh.

"Evaluates the Global Excellence in Management (GEM) Initiative, designed to build the organizational capacities of PVOs and NGOs to deliver effective development programs.  Interim evaluation covers the period 1997-11/99.  GEM is implemented by Case Western Reserve University (CWRU). GEM's activities occur on four levels -- the individual, the organizational, the inter-organizational, and the system-wide -- united by a common emphasis on improving organizational performance.  The centerpiece of the GEM approach is called Appreciative Inquiry (AI), a capacity-building process that focuses on existing strengths rather than on problems. GEM's emphases parallel key elements in current management thinking about attributes of leadership and effective organizations. The reaction to AI as a workshop or retreat approach is overwhelmingly positive.  AI, as used by GEM, also works especially well in multi-cultural contexts and with a wide variety of organizational agendas.  PVOs/NGOs also view AI as a tool for their own use, but only in conjunction with other approaches more rooted in operational systems and procedures, and they believe it is unrealistic to avoid addressing real problems. On the negative side, concerns have been expressed, particularly by those who experience GEM on a one-time basis, about the applicability of GEM concepts in an actual organizational setting.  Many cite a need for more follow-up, more support for post-event networking, and a more interactive website that would allow for ""help desk"" type services. There also is support for more focused training of selected staff of organizations who will be involved in follow-up implementation of GEM-based initiatives.  GEM is, in fact, moving in these directions in response to its own feedback systems.  Many also feel that GEM training itself needs to address management skills, at least those related to the application of GEM approaches. Some see avoidance of ""problemsolving"" as a lack of attention to the systems and procedures that are the lifeblood of organizations. The most consistently reported GEM impact was GEM's effectiveness in helping organizations take a forward-looking approach to planning.  The methods and techniques are viewed as particularly enabling in making transitions within an organization around leadership change, decisionmaking processes, teamwork, and interpersonal issues.  A second overall impact was the clear impetus that GEM program participants felt to actually transfer and adapt the methods and techniques to their own work situation. Lessons learned include the following:  (1) GEM's approach and methods are most useful in visioning, goal setting, and strategic planning and less helpful in implementing organizational change.  (2) Due to its focus on inward values and its reluctance to address ""problems"", GEM's approach does not adequately address exogenous structural elements.  (3) Continuity of consultation relationships is effective in supporting organizational change.  (4) Focused, sustained support for partnership development has paid off.  In the most mature customized partnerships, there is good reason to believe that GEM initiatives will have a significant multiplier effect and broad impact at the grassroots level.  Moreover, there is a good chance these positive outcomes will be sustainable. (5) Focusing on positive achievements is an effective way of mobilizing resources for development at the community level.  Examples were given of how, after use of AI, community members implemented programs primarily using their own time and other resources.  (6) GEM monitoring and evaluation primarily looks at anecdotal information to relay qualitative information about the impact of programs.  Some of the participant organizations, however, are beginning to find ways to quantify results.  Although there is a concern among GEM staff that quantitative methods do not capture the process of what happens, quantitative and qualitative methods can complement each other.  (7) There is an untapped lode of experience among PVOs and NGOs in applying AI to their own agendas, with and without GEM assistance (though usually triggered by GEM programs).  (8) There is considerable hope in the PVO community that PVC will continue its support for innovation.  A corollary of this role is the need to define results and determine indicators in terms of the dynamics of organizational change and capacity.

"Close-out report on a project to develop the Center for Management Technology and Business Training (MTC), Kaunas Technological University-Panevezys (KTU/P), Lithuania, as a center of excellence in management education in the region.  The project was part of the Management Training and Economics Education Project (MTEEP).  The report covers the period 9/97-9/99 against a PACD of 6/00. As the only management training center in the Panevezys region, MTC is well- positioned to serve as a catalyst for developing strategic alliances and collaboration between KTU/P, other educational institutions in the country, and the business community that can further the economic development and integration of the region with the rest of the country. During the last academic year, over 1,642 participants took part in MTC training activities, and the rate of female participation, which ranged from 47% to 60% in 1998 and 1999, is one of the highest in the MTEEP portfolio.  In terms of sustainability, MTC has developed a business plan and identified a group of 32 prospective trainers, 14 of whom have completed MTC's 300-hour Entrepreneurial Training Program.  Of the 32, 5 are KTU/P faculty, though only 1 has completed training. Additionally, with the help of an International Executive Service Corps (IESC) volunteer, MTC has completed a business plan through the year 2000 that includes course offerings in three programmatic areas -- management, English, and computer training -- and a projection of revenues. On the down side, although MTC offers a variety of management-related courses, there does not appear to be a structured progression of courses from beginning to more advanced, and management training, which is supposed to be the centerpiece of course offerings, lags behind in terms of income generation and enrollments.  Further, only 3 of the 32 potential MTC instructors represent the business community (banking, agricultural company, and stock company). Programmatic sustainability, an important challenge for the immediate future, could be significantly enhanced by developing collaborative relations with other educational institutions and engaging business executives in training delivery.  In its quest for sustainability, MTC needs to articulate a strategic vision/plan to guide the development of core programs that will enable it to establish a programmatic niche and maintain a competitive edge. Securing a well-qualified pool of instructors will remain the crucial component of this process. In terms of financial sustainability, MTC has made some significant gains in revenue generation over the past four quarters, but its performance is still characterized by large quarterly fluctuations in revenue levels.  It is doubtful that MTC will achieve financial sustainability by the end of the USAID grant period, though it will most likely do quite well.  A key challenge will be to reconcile the financial outlays needed for program development with the inability of the small- and medium-scale enterprise (SME) sector, currently MTC's preferred client, to pay the required market rate for program delivery. To counteract this trend, MTC could develop modules for groups of companies with common interests; a very successful model for this kind of training has been developed by the Management Development Center in Budapest.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","EEU-O-00-99-00025-00","","9/1/1999 12:00:00 AM","","Economies in transition|Management education|Universities and colleges|Institution building|Faculty|Teacher training|Project sustainability|Economic self sufficiency|Women|Enrollment|Revenues|Curriculum|Development planning|Beneficiary targeting|Small scale enterprises|Medium scale enterprises|User fees|Business planning","Lithuania","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABS401.pdf","117 KB","010468 - LF International","","010258 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of a matching grant (9/96-9/99) to increase the ability of Mercy Corps International (MCI) to link the building of civil society (CS) with sustainable development in its international programs. The project was implemented in Lebanon and Honduras. In Lebanon, 54 people were trained at the Ministry of Social Affairs (MOSA), which now includes CS training in its regular curriculum. Training was also provided to 22 female church leaders, as well as to 360 civil education teachers who are following the approach in their own classes.  MC Lebanon also participated in 7 national events (conferences and workshops) and developed 23 democratically elected village committees (which have included women); it is now recognized as a leader in CS issues.  The Civil Literacy Program for women trained 233 women and 18 women community leaders.  The project also trained 22 teachers in environmental awareness, and reached 5,737 students through an environmental awareness campaign in village schools. In cooperation with local civil and international organizations and government institutions, training was provided in nursing aid (15 women), industrial sewing (15 women), and business awareness (54 women).  Workshop participants were more than planned and included 67 NGOs (vs. a target of 15) and representatives from government (mostly from MOSA) and the media. In Honduras, Project Global Village (PAG) did an excellent job organizing local development committees, which it galvanized through small seed grants for CS activities, trained in basic CS principles, and helped in defining their goals. Communication among committee members has been a key problem; many of the communities where PAG operates are virtually inaccessible due to poor roads (especially during the rainy season) and limited or non-existent phone service.  PAG also worked with regional subcommittees, helping launch Meeting 97, which gave the committees an opportunity to organize and to which local officials were invited in this election year to present their plans for the local municipalities -- a first in Honduras. Meeting 97 was considered a success, although a proposed super- regional committee to work with the private and government sectors never materialized. In Lebanon, awareness of CS principles increased as a result of the project; a 6/99 report based on a sample of 31 participant organizations showed that trainees at a minimum understood the concepts learned.  The report also indicated that the training reinforced existing knowledge and provided new knowledge and motivation to use existing knowledge. Those interviewed said that the major impacts of the training were changes in program orientation to incorporate CS concepts and the development of new programs based on CS principles.  In addition, three coalitions were formed from the workshop participants to sustain development activities using CS principles learned through the project, and seed grants were provided to some of the NGOs in these  coalitions. The project also benefitted MCI, which has integrated CS principles with sustainable development in its overall program design, although it is not yet possible to quantify lasting impacts. In Honduras, the CS team mediated disputes over endangerment of the Mayan Copan ruins, water contamination (in connection with coffee production), and the burning and cutting of important forest resources. In much of the PAG's operational region, roads and bridges were washed out, crops and animals lost, and numerous lives lost as a result of Hurricane Mitch. According to PAG's director, however, Hurricane Mitch also created conditions that required more community interaction and cooperation.  Lobbying and advocacy became important skills, and leadership and decisionmaking were amply demonstrated in community after community.  The resulting lessons of civic action established examples which these local communities continue to follow.  Many of the organizations receiving seed grants were involved with local community issues such as street gangs, helping single mothers and abused women, the rights of children, and exposing poor children to computer training. The project also promoted accountability among public officials, who are now far more conscious of public scrutiny; more persons are being prosecuted for corruption or misuse of office. Under a new 3-year matching grant, MCI will continue its CS program in Honduras, but not in Lebanon.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","FAO-0539-C-00-5036-00|FAO-C-00-95-00036-00","","9/1/1999 12:00:00 AM","","Development program planning|Private voluntary organizations|Matching funds|Institution building|Civil society|Sustainable development","Lebanon|Honduras","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABS435.pdf","6,579 KB","006190 - AMA Technologies, Inc.","","007746 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of a project to reform the housing sector in Russia (HSRP -- 9/92-9/98). Over the life of the project, HSRP participated in or sponsored 287 training courses, seminars, and conferences, which were attended by 28,600 Russians from 103 cities; conducted 51 U.S. study tours for 442 Russians from 44 cities; and produced a vast array of training materials, how-to manuals, studies, brochures and other informational materials, publishing 201 products on housing and urban development and distributing some 400,000 copies during the project.  HSRP addressed the dearth of official data on housing and urban development through independent surveys and analysis of government raw data sources. Most importantly, HSRP evaluated the implementation of housing reforms to effect needed strategy and implementation changes. Developing appropriate policies and legislation was essential to overall reform.  Over the life of the project, project staff had input into 160 individual Russian Federation (RF) laws, Presidential decrees and resolutions, and directly drafted 37 legislative acts.  HSRP also assisted many oblasts and municipalities, directly and through information dissemination, to draft local implementation legislation for the broad framework enacted at the RF level.  All officials interviewed emphasized the vital HSRP inputs in policy and legislative development. HSRP produced its most impressive results in these areas. HSRP was extraordinarily successful both in meeting project indicators of performance and in effecting a framework for housing reforms in Russia, and has had a pervasive and profound affect on the direction and structure of Russia's housing and urban development reforms.  HSRP's achievements are particularly remarkable in light of the almost total dependence on the State for economic production and for housing during the Soviet period and the very unfavorable macroeconomic conditions that obtained during the project period.  Despite its success, however, the project was only a beginning; it will require many more years to complete the transformation from a centralized, socialist system to a market-based economy. Lessons learned are as follows:  (1) Transformation of a socialist society to free market principles is a long-term process.  (2) HSRP demonstrates the importance of a flexible project design.  It also demonstrates that a firm contracted to both design and implement a project can achieve a seamless transition from the one to the other and perform significantly in the conduct of the project.  (3) TA should be demand-driven. Also, Russian technical capacity-building should be a high priority, with the objective of having in place technical capacity to continue assistance goals after project termination. HSRP demonstrated that this is very possible in Russia.  (4) In- county demonstration projects are often necessary to provide local experience with reforms prior to their dissemination.  (5) Widespread and long-term dissemination of information is necessary to encourage adoption of changes.  It is not enough to assume that an implementation agency is able to disseminate information after the project is completed.  (6) Monitoring and evaluating a sector are essential for measuring progress and providing the basis for future strategies.  Official data sources are often inadequate for these purposes.  (7) U.S. experience requires substantial adaptation and modification in the Russian context.  (8) Hard currency borrowing must be carefully assessed. Hard currency debt in developing nations often becomes onerous due to deteriorating exchange rates.  (9) Continuity in filling key positions is critical. HSRP benefitted greatly from the presence of the highly qualified Chief of Project throughout the project.  (10) Projects must have clear objectives and measurable indicators and then aggressively manage for their achievement. HSRP did.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","OUT-PCE-I-808-97-00014-00|PCE-I-00-97-00014-00","","11/1/1999 12:00:00 AM","","Economies in transition|Housing|Housing markets|Economic policy|Policy reform|Laws and legislation|Legal reform|Information dissemination|Market economy|Human capacity development|National level|Municipal level","Russia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABS542.pdf","5,361 KB","000354 - Carana Corp.","","008597 - USAID.

"Evaluates matching grant to PLAN International to implement a new credit and microenterprise development (credit/MED) model and strategy developed under a previous USAID grant.  Mid-term evaluation covers the period 9/96-8/99. PLAN's microfinance program today differs from its past programs in that it:  (1) uses poverty lending models that are guided by core principles instead of providing an undifferentiated mix of financial and non-financial services; (2) consciously works in partnership with specialized service providers instead of building PLAN's own direct service capacity; (3) pilot tests national programs in a limited number of strategically located PLAN countries (those in Bolivia, Mali, and the Philippines are discussed in the report) as the foundation for future replication and institutional support; (4) addresses non-program elements (national office marketing strategies and human resource policies that constrain the pursuit of higher impact and sustainable programs); (5) includes a central technical unit and supports its efforts to actively push high performance models and standards at the upper level of PLAN; and (6) improves capacity in high-performance programming at the field level by hiring and training one local staff person at each pilot site to serve as the national credit/MED coordinator. Each of the above changes has improved PLAN's credit/MED programming capacity in qualitative terms.  Another aspect of improved capacity is expanded outreach, which lends itself to more quantitative measurement. Progress toward accomplishing matching grant targets (number of partnerships, number of pilot and non-pilot program countries adopting high performance credit/MED programming, and number of clients reached) is on track and should be accomplished by the end of the grant. While there is still room for improvement, the overall direction being pursued is valid.  Valid for USAID, because PLAN is implementing a program design that allows it to reach the indicators put forth in the grant proposal.  Valid for PLAN, because efforts at institutional strengthening are resulting in improved microfinance programs in the field and in increased ability through the organization to sustain the new approach.  And valid for the microfinance industry, because PLAN is playing a role in building local institutional capacity for high performance microfinance programming.  Contains numerous recommendations.

"Final evaluation of a matching grant to the Salesian Missions (9/94-9/99) to (1) strengthen Salesian institutional capacity to design and implement development projects assisting poor youth; and (2) demonstrate and improve the effectiveness of Salesian programs to rescue abandoned children and provide technical training to out-of-school youth. The project was a success.  Over the life of the grant, Salesian Missions provided TA to establish project offices and demonstration projects in four countries (Ethiopia, Guatemala, Haiti, and the Philippines).  The development of project offices has had a profound impact on the Salesian Society; they are fast becoming models that many other Salesian Provinces would like to replicate, especially those Provinces striving to generate more resources for development projects. In the view of the evaluation team, the USAID matching grant has contributed to institutionalizing the concept of project offices. These offices are now capable of designing, planning, and implementing projects.  Project goals and objectives are clearer, indicators are more measurable, and office management is more professional.  Budgeting procedures have shown the greatest improvement. Project offices are now capable of seeking out other resources to support their development efforts, enabling the Salesian Provinces to compete for development funds internationally.  Specifically, the USAID grant has enabled the new Salesian project offices to raise an impressive $43,481,530 in new project money.  This is a ratio of $14.49 for each $1.00 of USAID grant money.  By project end, the amount may reach $45 million. Despite these successes, there are still some areas that could be strengthened, such as better and more relevant baseline data collection, the implementation of monitoring and evaluation methodologies, and the establishment of local foundations to assist in sustaining local projects.

"Final evaluation of a child survival project (9/95-9/99) implemented by Adventist Development and Relief Agency (ADRA) in the Hais, Khokha, and Jabal Ras districts of Hodeidah Governorate, Yemen. The project has built a sound, community-based foundation.  Its detailed implementation plan (DIP), goals, objectives, and strategies were appropriate for the project area, and its components and management processes were based on research results and local participation.  The child survival interventions and community development components have met the priority needs and demands of the local communities.  The supplementary activities, such as the cost-sharing/drug revolving fund (CS/DRF), women's literacy/small enterprise development (WL/SED), Vitamin A, laboratory services, and supervision system have furthered project implementation.  The CS/DRF was vital in overcoming the chronic shortage of drugs and supplies in the health units (HUs); it also became a source of co-financing for the HUs.  The project intentionally linked the CS/DRF to implementation of the main CS interventions. The building local management capacity, one of the major goals achieved, increases the likelihood of project sustainability.  The communities are now actively engaged in literacy, health education, and small enterprise development.  Women participate enthusiastically in the implementation of all interventions, and women's groups are almost capable of managing their own literacy classes, health education, and loans, though they continue to receive supervision and support services from ADRA.  Community organization of men is in the form of local health facility committees (HFCs), which are charged with planning, support, and monitoring of health workers within the HUs and in their catchment areas; documenting vital events; maintaining a health information system; organizing vaccination campaigns; and recruiting health trainees and volunteers.  At present there are 14 active HFCs, representing about 30% of the targeted population; of these, 9 are participating in the CS/DRF, and 8 have completely renovated their HUs or are helping build new ones. The project also promoted sustainability by developing an extensive training program for local health manpower, reviving existing health facilities, and strengthening facility supervision and provision of services.  Finally, the project broadened primary health care services by introducing interventions, such as control of diarrheal diseases (CDD) and nutrition, at the household level.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","FAO-0500-A-00-5025-00","","12/1/1999 12:00:00 AM","","Child survival activities|Community participation|Private voluntary organizations|Human capacity development|Community development|Project sustainability|Health facilities|Volunteers|Medical education|Women|Men|Local groups|Income generation|Microenterprises|Literacy instruction|Health education|Credit|Revolving fund|Pharmaceuticals|Health care administration","Yemen","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABS925.pdf","1,983 KB","006302 - Adventist Development and Relief Agency International (ADRA)","","007746 - USAID.

"Evaluates the sustainability of a project to support primary education in Cameroon, principally by upgrading five teacher training colleges (TTCs) (SPE project, 1984-89).  The bulk of the report discusses the impact of SPE's termination and the subsequent closure of the TTCs. Despite the Government of Cameroon (GOC)'s acceptance of USAID proposals to scale back SPE, the project was terminated in 1/89, and at the end of the 1989-90 academic year the GOC closed all public TTCs for 5 years.  During this period, many teachers in the northern region were reassigned to secondary schools in the southern Francophone region. Caretaking at the TTCs was also a problem, with vandalism becoming increasingly routine.  The closure of the TTCs permitted the Ministry of Education (MINEDUC) to hire unqualified teachers at about half the salary paid to qualified teachers.  Parents became increasingly dissatisfied, and enrollments, especially in primary schools, began to drop, especially in the northern provinces -- the region in Cameroon that has historically been the furthest behind. The TTC closure decision is one in a chain of events that has wreaked havoc on Cameroon's primary education system. Other causes include rampant corruption and a dwindling pool of qualified teachers.  It is estimated that at least 70% of primary school teachers are unqualified, and that there is a need for at least 15,000 qualified primary school teachers throughout the country.  The lack of teachers in rural areas, especially in the northern region, is striking, and it is not unusual to have student-teacher ratios of 175:1 in rural primary schools. Textbooks and classroom teaching materials are almost nonexistent, and the physical condition of the schools is often a threat to the well-being of the children. It will be extremely difficult to recover from the debacle caused by the GOC's crippling of the primary school system, as evidenced by recent figures of enrollment ratios in SPE provinces and the significant erosion in the quality of education -- a fact that Cameroonian educators are constantly emphasizing.  Some TTCs began to reopen in 9/95, but MINEDUC now requires students to pay for their schooling and find their own teaching jobs upon graduation, and has apparently provided school officials no help or authority regarding recruitment and hiring of new teachers.  Not one teacher graduating from the TTCs in Bamenda (Anglophone zone) or Nagaoundere (northern region) was hired to teach. The private education sector also continues to be seriously hurt by this GOC practice. Given the deterioration of the primary school system between 1990 and 1995, educators in the SPE provinces greatly desire to revitalize the project, which is more needed today than when it was launched in 1984. SPE has the advantage of a trained cadre of Cameroonians available to participate in its implementation and is supported by significant Cameroon-specific project materials at the ready.  Further, despite the 5-year shut-down, the project TTCs are now operational despite the unrepaired property damage.  Most of the TTCs are currently attempting to enroll the maximum number of students, about 300 each, but most lack sufficient faculty and student accommodations.  Each TTC in the project's provinces lacks about one-third of the approved teacher-staffing pattern.  In other words, even though the TTCs are open again, they are not receiving the financial support they are entitled to by MINEDUC's own standards.  On the positive side, a considerable number of SPE's counterparts, some of whom were TTC teachers and administrators during SPE, remain at the training colleges, some in very important positions.  A significantly larger proportion of inspectors who worked with SPE remain in the project's provinces.  And since the TTCs reopened, the number of inspectors greatly increased because of the government's decision to assign inspectors to the arrondissement (subdivisional) level.  Even delegates who had no former connection to SPE expressed support for the project and a strong desire for its return.  Also, all project TTCs are being directed by Cameroonian counterparts who had worked with SPE prior to termination, and who remain fully committed to its goals, processes, and practices.  Finally, the GOC is now committed to promote decentralization, for which SPE could serve as a model. Includes lessons learned and suggestions for reinforcement of SPE sustainability.","Project title: Research and reference services (R&RS)","Special Evaluation","Documents","AEP-0232-C-00-4035-00|AEP-C-00-94-00035-00","","4/1/1999 12:00:00 AM","","Primary education|Teacher education|Teacher training|Teachers' colleges|Institution building|Building construction|Host country cooperation|Educational administration|Decentralization|Educational finance|Occupational qualifications|Faculty|Wages|Enrollment|Rural areas|Educational materials|Educational inspections|Project sustainability|Quality of education","Cameroon","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABS980.pdf","627 KB","000223 - Academy for Educational Development, Inc.

"This report documents achievements of the Community Health and Family Planning Project (CHFP), designed to develop a culturally appropriate and administratively feasible system for community-based delivery of health in rural Ghana, with emphasis on family planning (FP) and reproductive health (RH) services. Chapters describe the experimental design of the study, the social setting, and constraints on reproductive change, findings from the implementation of the pilot phase of the study, and project impact on FP use and fertility.  Preliminary results indicate that the project is having an impact on reproductive motives, contraceptive behavior, and fertility.  The project has undertaken extensive work on integrating RH services into the regimen of rural health services in the Kassena-Nankana District of northern Ghana.  Results of this effort are described.  The report concludes with a summary of lessons for Ministry of Health policy, possible strategies for scaling up elements of the experiment into a national community health and FP program, and implications for international health and population policy. Key lessons include the following:  (1) Despite economic and social conditions that are unfavorable to the introduction of FP, fertility will decline if programs are appropriately designed and sensitive to cultural conditions and needs.  When communities are consulted about their preferences, they provide advice on the management of care and communication strategies that is crucial to the design of community health care.  Mobilizing all sectors of the society at the peripheral level (community systems, health care systems, and political systems) contributes to sustainability and impact.  Communities will donate labor, leadership, and materials if the health program provides training, technology, and clinical expertise. (2) An integrated approach to service delivery (health and FP) is more desirable than a categorical delivery of component services. Although the design of the experiment does not specify treatments to evaluate this proposition, baseline social research indicated that the demand for health care was so prominent that there was no point in testing the integration hypothesis.  The case for delivery of integrated services was made repeatedly and powerfully by all age groups, both genders, and by leaders of communities to be served by the project. When an integrated service package was implemented at the village level by a multi- purpose provider working with community institutions, more health service was provided than is provided at fixed ""Level B"" facilities.  The integrated approach of the CHFP involves the health and FP service regimen described in chapter 2. (3) A system-wide approach is more appropriate for developing operations than a component approach.  The CHFP project identified problems affecting the health sector as a whole.  It did not set up parallel systems and vertical service delivery structures that would be difficult to replicate.  At all stages in this investigation, the CHFP has operated as a complete model health service delivery system.

"PACR of a project (9/90-9/94) to:  strengthen the capacity of the Salvadoran Federation of Bar Associations (SFBA) to take a more active role as a professional, independent monitor of the judiciary; and provide legal education and establish professional standards for legal practitioners.  The project was implemented by the Inter-American Bar Foundation. The SFBA has substantially increased its presence in Salvadoran society and the services offered to associates and the legal community in general.  Official institutions such as the Ministry of Justice and the Institute for Liberty and Progress have used the SFBA as the dissemination channel for important government programs.  Private institutions have also begun requesting SFBA cooperation in the organization of seminars on critical issues.  The SFBA is, for the first time in its history, offering its associates access to up-to-date reference materials, including special printing of new legislation.  A library open to all the legal community is now functioning at SFBA headquarters. While in the  past, meetings or seminars were generally held in judicial facilities, today the SFBA headquarters is considered the ideal place for these events. The SFBA has continued to expand its services to, and thus presence in, the wider community through its law-related education program and legal clinic.  The former provides information (through television and radio programs) on the law in response to real-life problems described in viewers' letters, using the volunteer services of several prestigious lawyers.  The write-in clinic delivers a similar service through a local newspaper.  Additionally, the program has distributed wallet-size cards that enumerate individuals' rights. In 1994 the SFBA stepped up its efforts to introduce a constitutional amendment to make membership in a national bar obligatory for all lawyers in the association rather than just those on the Supreme Court. The SFBA also became active in sponsoring discussions on other proposed constitutional amendments aimed at increasing judicial independence. Finally, the SFBA conducts elections among its members to elect representatives to the National Council of the Judiciary and to present a slate of Supreme Court candidates to the General Assembly that selects these magistrates. Nonetheless, despite some advances, the SFBA has not overcome the institutional weaknesses required to transform itself into a self-sustaining organization that can take an independent role in promoting legal reform and public service, as well as in representing professional interests.  The project has provided information to the SFBA and other members of the legal community on how such goals have been reached by bars in other countries, but to date has not been able to generate the momentum either within or outside of the SFBA to carry such actions forward.  While the project has undeniably reinforced the image and activities of the SFBA, most observers (and the project's evaluators) concur that the further transition to a self-sustaining, independent institution with an active role in development of the legal sector may require much more time, or in the end be achieved only by a different organization.  The latter seems most likely, since most versions of the proposed constitutional amendment dealing with a compulsory bar now no longer mention the Federation, but ""some such entity"".

"PACR of a project (9/94-12/98) to support and strengthen a network of NGOs committed to serving high-risk street and displaced children in El Salvador (PROCIPOTES project).  The project was implemented by Medical Service Corporation International (MSCI). The project's integrated model of service delivery, comprising education/recreation, health care, socioeconomic support,  community participation, and intersectoral coordination, proved effective in rehabilitating children, reuniting them with their families, and reintegrating them into society.  PROCIPOTES was also able to improve the children's living conditions and health status and to reduce the social and educational risk factors that favored their return to the street.  Specifically, under the project:   168 children recovered from drug addictions and never relapsed; 1,106 children received complete scholarships; 1,066 children completed and passed their school grade; 656 beneficiaries completed vocational training and work; 1,883 children in crisis corrected their behavioral problems through therapy; 3,500 children benefitted from medical consultation and treatment; 1,965 boys and girls were organized into children's committees; 1,423 parents were organized into parents' committees; 420 institutions and organizations participated in committees; 20,508 beneficiaries participated in health education activities; and 30,252 people participated in activities that promoted children's rights. (Statistical data taken from the annexed final report by MSCI [XD-ABR-623-A]).  The project also:  developed an effective NGO service delivery network; created a motivated field staff through ongoing supervision and training; designed and implemented innovative and appropriate strategies and methods for dealing with street children's problems; and mobilized extensive community participation in the project. The following lessons were learned:  (1) Investing in institutional strengthening pays off.  Of the five NGOs who participated in the project, four continue to provide services, although at a reduced level or in altered form.  (2) Personnel development and training is important.  The level of personnel turnover was costly to the program. (3) Community participation, including the use of volunteers and the donation by city halls of space and personnel, was key to achieving results.  (4) Individual therapies for the children were costly and were not more effective than group interventions.  (6) Halfway houses did not prove to be a worthwhile strategy.  (7) The project has only limited sustainability.  The ongoing efforts of participating NGOs do not address displaced youths' larger needs, nor have efforts to meet these needs been institutionalized by the Government of El Salvador.","Attachment: XD-ABR-623-A","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","8/1/1999 12:00:00 AM","","Child welfare services|Street children|Orphans|Homeless|Private voluntary organizations|Indigenous private voluntary organizations|Networks|Institution building|Project sustainability|Parents","El Salvador","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABR623.pdf","2,843 KB","008540 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of a project (1994-99) to privatize the Federation of Egyptian Industries (FEI).  The Center for International Private Enterprise (CIPE) was the implementing agency The project had a weak beginning due to a lack of private sector business association experience in Egypt, CIPE's inexperience with state-controlled business associations, and the initial absence of a knowledgeable CIPE manager.  As a result of these and other factors, the project collapsed completely in 1/97, when all almost all the USAID-funded CIPE Egyptian professional staff were fired.  The catharsis of the firings led to a replacement of the CIPE country director and a change in CIPE project management in Washington.  The new FEI leadership hired new and highly qualified staff, improved the institutional arrangement by creating a Project Management Unit, and gave greater control to the FEI, leaving CIPE to act essentially as a facilitator of FEI initiatives. Since these changes, the project has facilitated FEI's rapid (but still transitional) institutional improvement.  A highlight of the renewed project was the development, with training and TA from CIPE, of a ""Business Agenda 2000"" stating FEI's formal positions on major issues facing Egyptian industry, and the publication of the agenda at a highly attended conference in 5/99.  Currently, the FEI is the major representative of all Egyptian industry, and its strong and increasingly important advisory role with the Government of Egypt is expected to increase given the economic orientation of the new Prime Minister.  FEI has a strong relationship with the United States, is one of the most effective lobbies for positive private-sector reforms, and provides extremely valuable services, including lobbying for policy reforms, training staffs of private sector business associations, supporting efforts in marketing and exporting, and strengthening management skills. FEI also has a new program to develop skills accreditation in conjunction with partnerships with developed country counterparts, an economic and commercial computerized information gathering system, and a program to help members comply with the Environmental Law of 2/98. The FEI provides substantial services to smaller- and medium-sized businesses, including those owned and operated by women.  For example, the leadership of the 2-year-old Egyptian Business Women Association (EBWA), which represents some 150 businesswomen, called FEI their most important resource at this critical early point in the association's development.  The EBWA leadership also said they intend to join FEI as a dues- paying associate member when it is formally allowed. The FEI is taking full advantage of the economic orientation of the new Prime Minister and Cabinet to push for an acceleration of economic policy reforms that will improve the overall business climate and in particular make it easier for new U.S. investments and for existing U.S. businesses.  While FEI has not yet been privatized, it certainly acts like a private sector business association and provides key services similar to a private sector business association.  The Chairman of the Board expects FEI to be privatized by June 2000.  Passage of the new law has been postponed because of political uproar and FEI's spent political capital on positive reform efforts taking place within the Egyptian Chambers of Commerce. If the FEI law is passed, this project will have led to the privatization of not only the FEI, with its estimated 15,000 industrial firms, but also the Egyptian Chamber of Commerce with its 3 million members, which will also be augmented with the admission of women members for the first time in Egyptian history. In sum, the FEI is now one of the most dynamic business associations in Egypt.  Its importance for U.S. business, for example, was reflected by the new Executive Director of the American Chamber of Commerce, who said that AmCham's effectiveness would be substantially curtailed if FEI, their partner in reform, cut back its services and lobbying efforts and was allowed to regress to its pre-CIPE state.  Cutting back U.S. support at this critical point in FEI transition could lead to a collapse of this still transforming and vulnerable business association. The major recommendation is to continue USAID support of FEI, which soon expects to be self-sustaining.  Other donors, including the European Community and in particular Germany, are already positioning themselves to fill the expected vacuum that would occur with curtailment of the CIPE program.  Numerous lessons learned are detailed.","Contract no. listed on cover as: 263-0225-A-4083-00","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","263-0225-A-00-4083-00","","12/1/1999 12:00:00 AM","","Business associations|Business enterprises|Industry|Privatization|Institution building|Economies in transition|Economic policy|Policy reform|Host country cooperation|Sector planning","Egypt","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABS077.pdf","1,922 KB","004939 - Center for International Private Enterprise (CIPE)","","008539 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of the Sustainable Development Services Project (SDS), designed to build the program and financial capacity of PVO and NGOs.  The project was implemented by a consortium composed of the Institute for Development Research, Freedom from Hunger, and Lassen Associates.  The evaluation covers the period 1995-11/99 against a PACD of 2/00. The project originally targeted PVOs/NGOs involved in health, nutrition, and population (HNP) programs, but was later expanded to include all interested PVOs/NGOs.  Principal findings are as follows: (1) Development of a standard and coherent definition of sustainability was a singular success. (2) Blending theory and practice with the effort to address financial sustainability through a conceptual framework has been a solid achievement.  (3) SDS was partly effective in overcoming PVO resistance to the legitimacy of cost-recovery and revenue- generating techniques.  (4) Sustained provision of tailored TA was effective in changing attitudes and introducing techniques for change. (5) The two-step approach of workshops and tailored TA proved effective and workable.  (6) Reports from participating PVOs show a marked increase in organizational commitment to financial sustainability and related changes at headquarters and in the field.  (7) Workshops were professionally managed, encouraged more serious and creative attention to financial sustainability, and generally, though not always, were tailored to participants' needs.  (8) Respondents found assistance in business planning effective and useful.  (9) The SDS program has strong potential for smaller, emergent NGOs that tend to be open to innovative practices.  (10) Client organizations registered some concern regarding inadequate follow-up and lack of trained SDS staff to assist in putting concepts and recommendations into effect.  (11) The overall SDS approach to sustainability was sometimes perceived by participants as rigid and doctrinaire, a reaction in part shaped by resistance to the perceived norms implicit in cost-recovery and revenue-generation. Central lessons learned are as follows:  (1) Interventions to introduce the concepts and techniques of sustainability can occur at any place within the organization. (2) Comprehensive organizational transformation and fundamental changes in norms and attitudes require the interest and support of leadership.  (3) Self-assessment of a PVO's current financial situation can provide a powerful incentive for change and can help overcome concerns about whether moving toward financial sustainability is counter to an organization's mission and values. There is no secret formula for improved financial sustainability.  (4) Transition is difficult and takes time and, probably, ongoing mentoring. (5) Microenterprise-based experience provides important insights, but broader models and tools are required, and the effort needs to be sustained for a longer period of time than the 4-year SDS effort. Issues requiring further discussion include: the importance of PVO/NGO financial sustainability; whether to continue the SDS program or something like it; and the role of the Office of Private and Voluntary Cooperation (PVC) in providing management assistance to the voluntary sector both at home and abroad.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","11/1/1999 12:00:00 AM","","Private voluntary organizations|Indigenous private voluntary organizations|Institution building|Technical assistance|Management training|Workshops|Project sustainability|Economic self sufficiency","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABS130.pdf","2,103 KB","006190 - AMA Technologies, Inc.","","007746 - USAID.

"Participatory impact evaluation of two completed projects implemented by Research Triangle Institute in Ukraine: Urban Transportation Improvement (UPTI:  9/97-12/98) and Effective Local Government (ELG: 9/97-11/98). UPTI.  All nine UPTI cities used project funds to acquire spare parts for trolleybuses, new vehicles, and information technology equipment, though not all provided the matching funds they had pledged.  The spare parts improved vehicle availability by 2%.  Significant improvements in service levels were primarily due to restructuring (a direct result of this and predecessor projects) and a shift to motorized transport, mostly minibuses.  Trolleybus management frequently stressed that workshops and discussions with consultants had given their enterprise a public service orientation.  The increased participation of private operators, usually with minibuses, greatly improved service levels.  In line with project recommendations, several public transportation enterprises have entered (or are about to enter) contractual relations with private operators to integrate services.  Fare collection improved dramatically between 1996 and 1998, although the project's contribution is difficult to assess.  In aggregate, fare revenue increased by a factor of 6, largely due to putting conductors on each trolleybus and taking steps to keep ""leakage"" to a minimum.  Financial sustainability will require fare increases; a Presidential decree holding fares at the July 1998 level is a constraint in this regard.  Since there is greater flexibility regarding fares on mini and midi-buses, increased deployment of these vehicles can raise the average fare.  Largely thanks to the project, several public transportation providers have made progress in controlling and reducing operating costs, though some have shown little initiative in this regard. ELG.  (a) Vodokanal companies.  The implementation of the Citizen Involvement or Consumer Participatory Outreach (CI/CPO) model in two cities proved effective, but was resource- intensive.  The model involved advisory committees, focus group interviews, large-scale sample surveys and analysis, and financial analysis, culminating in public hearings.  In the two cities, attitudes and relationships reportedly improved greatly between the water company, its customers, and city government. Better understanding of residents concerns may have accelerated priority investments and management changes.  Real improvements, however, will require capital investments.  On the customer side, improved communications have improved payment somewhat and reportedly changed attitudes toward water use and conservation, though public hearings were not institutionalized.  The impact of the Water Enterprise Financial Analysis Model (FAM) was limited. (b) Association of Ukrainian Cities (AUC).  Project training and TA strengthened AUC's role as a policy advocate on behalf of the country's municipalities, and its capabilities in consultancy and training.  The project helped AUC publish its bimonthly journal and communicate with its members through a website, as well as through workshops and conferences.  A prevailing attitude, according to one mayor, is that AUC is the only organization at the national level that stands up for municipal governments and defends their interests.  (c) Municipal finance management.  Of the five participating cities, only two had worked more or less intensively with the project's FAM in budget preparation and presentation, and none were aware of the FAM's Capital Improvement Program (CIP).  There were also problems with the FAM's ""static"" nature in the face of changing legislation and regulations. While the transparency of city budgets may have improved somewhat as a result of the project, formal citizen participation generally remained limited. External constraints, especially continued adherence to top-down budget allocation, and the slow progress in devolving financial responsibility to cities, have impeded progress. Three cross-cutting lessons were learned:  (1) Despite many difficulties, there is sufficient flexibility to move forward with innovative and creative solutions.  (2) The demonstration effect of sustained work with municipal governments and service providers can be substantial.  Trying to include too many cities can spread project resources too thin.  (3) Progress in municipal government often has a ""serendipitous"" or opportunistic element.  Includes general and specific recommendations, including continued USAID assistance in the projects' subject areas.","Task order OUT-EEU-I-99-00001-00|ENI local government indefinite quantity contract|Project title: Urban ppublic transportation improvement (UPTI)|Project title: Effective local government (ELG)","Special Evaluation","Documents","EEU-00-99-00001-00","","12/1/1999 12:00:00 AM","","Economies in transition|Societies in transition|Political systems in transition|Governance|Local level|Municipal level|Public administration|Public transportation|Water utilities","Ukraine","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABS220.pdf","5,926 KB","006381 - Abt Associates, Inc.|002508 - MetaMetrics, Inc.","","011039 - USAID.

"Evaluates the Women in Transition (WIT) Initiative, designed  to help women and other disadvantaged groups in Rwanda rebuild their lives. Interim evaluation covers the period 9/95-5/99. WIT has made an important contribution to rebuilding women's lives in Rwanda.  It has worked in 86 communes, funded 1,460 projects, reached 29,254 association members, and assisted over 160,000 people -- all with modest funding and low administrative costs.  WIT has been effective in meeting the needs of poor and vulnerable -- working directly with rural women's associations in small livestock, agricultural, and microenterprise activities.  It has reduced community tensions by helping women and the vulnerable build homes, feed themselves, and restart their lives economically.  It has helped build unity and create space for reconciliation by bringing women together in associations. The real problem exists between widows and the wives of men in prison who have been accused of genocide. Even between these there are examples of reconciliation, e.g., in Commune Runyinya, where, in a religious context, women are coming together in forgiveness. WIT has contributed to women's political participation.  The Ministry of Gender created local women's committees to assist in WIT implementation and monitoring; WIT projects gave women opportunities to participate in local decisionmaking as part of these committees. Leaders of WIT-funded and other associations were recently elected to local councils (4 of whose 10 elected members must be women), and there is a anecdotal evidence that women are being elected to seats not reserved specifically for women.  The development of Women's Communal Funds (WCF) to support economic growth is another important aspect of WIT's contribution to the empowerment of Rwandan women. The unusual partnership between the Ministry and USAID has been an important factor in the success of WIT.  Ministry support at the commune level has ensured WIT's effectiveness, while the USAID umbrella has enabled WIT to act independently and provided the resources needed to carry the program to the most isolated rural areas.  WIT's small size has helped keep it flexible.  WIT systems, which require women leaders to step out of traditional roles, travel long distances, and interact with officials, has taught women and their communities that women are capable leaders.  WIT's management structures have ensured the effective use of resources and created an organization that can adapt to evolving situations. WIT is positioned to contribute to the achievement of USAID's local government and household food security strategic objectives, but must be tied more closely with USAID training and program planning.  WIT is most effective as a program that draws on both the Ministry and USAID, but remains essentially independent of both.  This unique position has empowered WIT and enabled it to do more than it could have done in another form. Lessons learned are as follows:  (1) Activities that promote and increase women's economic empowerment can lead to political participation. (2) Economic activities, particularly in groups and associations, help reduce tension and create unity in post-conflict settings.  (3) Activities that require women to assume non-traditional roles in one area help them to acquire the necessary confidence and self-esteem to take on non-traditional roles in other areas.  (4) When women are seen as leaders and as capable of helping others address their problems, they can be elected to positions that would otherwise be filled by men.  (5) Targeting rural women's associations in post-conflict settings is a viable addition to, but does not replace, targeting national, urban-based NGOs, which continue to play a role in directly addressing government on their level, e.g., on women's legal rights.  (6) Local control of resources through mechanisms like the woman-managed WCF can be models for future transition and development programming.  (7) Many current mechanisms of the Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) provide USAID a model for working in transition environments.  (8) USAID needs to develop more flexible implementation mechanisms.  One-time inputs may be insufficient to launch particularly vulnerable and impoverished groups into a development phase. Groups with problems should be studied, and follow-up assistance provided under certain conditions.","Project title: WIDSTRAT|Project title: Women in development technical assistance (WIDTECH)","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1999 12:00:00 AM","","Post conflict societies|Women in development|Disadvantaged groups|Economic growth|Political participation|Local groups|Associations|Elections|Political leadership|Political reconciliation|Economic participation","Rwanda","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABS264.pdf","268 KB","008076 - USAID.

"Evaluates PRE -- the Program to Strengthen Human Resources in Microfinance Institutions, Bolivia's first effort to institutionalize microfinance training.  Interim evaluation covers the year 1998, the program's pilot year of implementation. PRE received financial and material support from La Fundacion para la Produccion (FUNDA-PRO), USAID, and Plan International (PLAN).  It was administered by the Bolivian Institute for Business Studies (IBEE) and accredited with diploma status by the Catholic University. Interviews with PRE students revealed a high opinion of PRE's program structure and academic content.  Because the 22 students varied greatly in their educational backgrounds and professional responsibilities, not all courses were appropriate to all students.  In the future, PRE organizers should consider offering electives as well as the required core courses.  All the students were pleased that PRE had provided them with knowledge and practical tools, which they apply in their jobs. According to students, the quality of instructors was, with a few exceptions, similarly high.  The quality and effectiveness of teaching methodologies and materials varied among courses.  Efforts to prevent this in the future should be made through a more pro-active role by PRE staff in: choosing instructors; providing them guidance on curricula, teaching methodologies and materials, and requiring instructors to provide detailed information in these same areas; and providing feedback to instructors in developing their teaching programs.  Students expressed a strong preference for practical training exercises as opposed to theory.  They also learned a great deal by interacting with their student colleagues.  These facts should be considered in designing future programs. The involvement by multiple institutions and individuals in assuring a successful PRE 1998 may have inadvertently detracted from the institutionalization process. PRE organizers compensated for IBEE's lack of technical capacity in microfinance by hiring an outside consultant to act as PRE coordinator.  They also became involved in technical issues themselves.  Furthermore, roles, responsibilities, and reporting relationships were not clearly organized and defined among these institutions and individuals.  This led to misunderstandings and significant tension among parties, especially between the PRE coordinator and IBEE's general manager.  Problems such as these should be avoided in the future by taking an institutional approach towards implementation and by clearly defining roles and lines of authority and communication. According to students, the only major problem with PRE 1998 was the frequent changes in dates and instructors.  This problem worsened as the program progressed, and left a negative overall impression of PRE with a few of the students.  Although many of the changes may not have been entirely preventable, efforts in the future can be made to limit them by:  (1) securing more definitive commitments from instructors, (2) arranging for alternate instructors, and (3) announcing course dates and instructors on a semester or trimester basis. IBEE and the PRE Coordinators carried out the logistics for individual courses adequately.  The IBEE secretary, in particular, was successful in maintaining open lines of communication with and providing excellent service to the students.  The IBEE classroom, complained students, was small and uncomfortable.  Alternative classroom settings should be considered for future programs. IBEE implements a wide variety of business courses, apart from PRE, with a small staff of seven.  The functions of the two professional staff members are mostly administrative. They lack the professional qualifications to manage a sector focused business-training program. For IBEE to competently manage PRE in the future, two major decisions are necessary: (1) the prioritization of microfinance among IBEE's principal institutional goals, and (2) the strengthening of IBEE's leadership and microfinance capacity.

"Evaluates the impact and sustainability of the Basic Education and Skills Training (BEST) program in Zimbabwe (1983-90). Several things set BEST apart from the normal USAID project of that era.  (1) BEST was one of the first USAID programs to use the Commodity Import Program (CIP) mechanism to provide education sector support, and one of the first to combine CIP-generated local currency and foreign exchange for this purpose.  (2) BEST was a forerunner of the nonproject assistance (NAP) approach to development finance, insofar as USAID supported Zimbabwe's policies and judged it to have well-formulated plans and the management capacity to carry out the program.  (3) The degree to which the BEST Working Group, rather than USAID or other contractors, made the decisions, was unusual for USAID programs at the time or since. Zimbabwe's need for fast, flexible programming of resources required USAID to work constructively within a policy environment and sensitively within local decisionmaking processes.  (4) BEST's facilitative rather than directive approach empowered Zimbabwe's decisionmakers and contributed to democratization in Zimbabwe.  USAID staff is remembered by nearly all those associated with the project for their insistence on documenting decisions and for their helpful, collegial manner.  Though some thought USAID made things unnecessarily difficult by not telling them what it was willing to support, they ultimately felt that the experience strengthened their own work habits. (5) The BEST Working Group was the key instrument in project development and in the approval process.  It made decisions regarding allocation of funds, applied criteria for project approval, and enforced requirements for proposals.  Moreover, BEST projects used Government of Zimbabwe (GOZ) standards, not USAID's sometimes more demanding standards. Factors critical to project success included:  the favorable policy context of post-independence Zimbabwe; program coordination across GOZ ministries (also a limiting factor); substantial USAID and GOZ financing; and significant support of long-term training and staff development over the course of a decade.  Factors limiting success included:  lack of a mechanism for ongoing government or external funding of activities such as research, periodic reassessments, and external demand studies; erosion of the innovative climate as Zimbabwe's planning and management grew progressively more prudent; a slower than expected economic growth and consequent job creation; and lack of USAID follow-on assistance. USAID brought BEST support to an end on an ""out is out"" basis without a follow-on strategy or complementary program.  Most other donors phased out or reduced education sector assistance in Zimbabwe at about the same time. BEST differed from general policy and strategy guidance in several ways.  (1) Despite its commitment to  universal basic education, the GOZ focused mainly on secondary education; few BEST resources were actually spent on the primary level.  (2) BEST's building assistance, including non-instructional infrastructure such as offices and university dormitories, and its funding for commodities, including instructional materials and toolkits, was in many ways critical to program success. Most of these expenditures were made in CIP-generated local currency, despite the general guidance that assistance for such end uses be limited and that hard currency inputs be used to leverage local currency budgetary commitments.  (3) Rather than reduce fees and increase subsidies to improve equity, the GOZ reduced subsidies and increased cost recovery to make it feasible to expand rapidly.  It relied extensively on communities to build and maintain schools, used school fees at all levels, required tuition at tertiary levels, offered student loans, and looked to employers to fund much of the technical training. (4) The GOZ has sustained the extraordinarily ambitious reforms supported by BEST for more than a decade and shows every sign of continuing to make education a priority.  Contrary to customary international recommendations, Zimbabwe's experience is that policy-driven reforms taken as political imperatives can force administrative, budgetary, policy, and technical reforms and reallocations that may not have been possible or advisable using conventional planning approaches. Includes suggestions for follow-up and further discussion.","Project title: Research and reference services (R&RS)","Special Evaluation","Documents","AEP-0232-C-00-4035-00|AEP-C-00-94-00035-00","","7/1/1999 12:00:00 AM","","Basic education|Primary education|Nonproject assistance|Commodity import programs|Educational policy|Policy reform|Educational reform|Development project management|Host country cooperation|Participants|Educational finance|Educational materials|Decision making|Economic conditions|Development strategies|Constraints|Subsidies|Cost recovery|User fees|Project sustainability","Zimbabwe","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABS981.pdf","229 KB","000223 - Academy for Educational Development, Inc.

"Final evaluation of a project (1/95-12/99) to build host country capacity to train primary providers' of family planning and reproductive health (RH) services (PRIME project). The project has successfully completed, or is on track to complete, specified deliverables.  It has also made significant strides in emphasizing the key results areas negotiated with USAID during 1997 and 1998.  Primary accomplishments include: reaching new cadres of RH primary providers; expanding RH services and the mix of services; decentralizing training; focusing on quality through guidelines, training, materials, monitoring and supervision, counseling, and client-provider interaction (CPI); experimenting with innovative learning approaches; building training and resource planning capacity; and initiating a systems approach to training.  In the area of technical leadership, PRIME has:  played a major role in decentralizing post-abortion care (PAC) services and increasing access to services closer to where women live; made an important contribution in linking policies, guidelines, and standards with training and the follow-up of provider performance; and promoted the performance improvement approach (PIA) in provider training. Important strides have been made in training primary providers. A major accomplishment has been to decentralize training and to extend high-quality performance-based training into new areas of RH and to new levels of service providers. PRIME has prepared curricula and training manuals and trained trainers for auxiliary nurse midwives, indigenous medicine providers, and traditional birth attendants.  A second major accomplishment is the development of capacity for systematic follow-up and monitoring of training, though follow-up visits often focus on data collection rather than on improving performance.  The major problem with PRIME's training programs is that, in reaching out to new cadres and new RH areas, training and follow-up is staff-intensive, expensive, and difficult to sustain.  Other problems include:  lack of a comprehensive strategic plan for training, i.e., one that includes analysis of alternative training strategies, analysis of cost, identification of appropriate exit strategies, trainee selection criteria, and pre-training service performance; insufficient development and testing of alternative learning approaches; lack of focus on pre- service institutions; insufficient attention to men and adolescents as populations with special needs; and limited integration of emergency contraception, female genital cutting, or sexually transmitted infection (STI) prevention in training curricula. PRIME has shown consistent commitment to the maximizing access and quality (MAQ) strategy, which features:  a focus on essential primary personnel; integration of selected RH interventions; addressing provider needs and performance beyond training; policy activities; attention in training to counseling and other CPI skills; replicable and sustainable systems, approaches, and materials; and culturally appropriate strategies. PRIME's limited definition of its technical advisory role may foster a ""disconnection"" between PRIME's goals and its effectiveness in the field.  After delivering TA, PRIME often takes a ""hands off"" approach, encouraging partners to take a major role in implementation.  While fostering local capacity building, this strategy sometimes leads to inadequate or inappropriate monitoring of progress in the field. Despite PRIME's attempts to strengthen capacity at all stages of project development, the sustainability of many training systems remains vulnerable.  In particular, emphasis on systems approaches and performance improvement demands that greater attention be paid to the development of planning and data-based decision-making skills.  Also, although monitoring and evaluation activities are carried out in virtually every PRIME subproject, evaluation indicators and monitoring instruments are not always used effectively.  Finally, PRIME publications fill an important niche by providing baseline materials for the development of more specifically targeted publications.  All the materials reviewed were of good quality, but seemed to be written for a very sophisticated user.  Also, their language level often makes them difficult to use.  PRIME needs to document its accomplishments, successful innovations, and lessons learned in a usable and attractive format.

"Evaluates grants (including four follow-up grants) provided to 7 PVOs to provide humanitarian relief in Honduras in the aftermath of Hurricane Mitch (10/98-7/99).  The grantees were:  Aldea Global (PAG), Catholic Relief Services (CRS), HOPE, Save the Children (STC), World Relief, and World Vision.  The grants focused on immediate disaster relief, food, housing, water/sanitation, and health, but there was also an agricultural component. Overall, the grants were extremely successful, timely, and appropriate to the needs following Hurricane Mitch. The 7 PVOs used their already developed local networks to obtain effective results. Local governments demonstrated their capability for leadership.  The immediate emergency needs for food, shelter, medicine, and health care were met adequately and in a timely manner.  There was good overall cooperation among local communities and national and international organizations with almost no duplication of services. USAID's rapid response in providing funding in the first phase facilitated the effective action of the PVOs.  This rapid response generally continued in the second phase, with the exception of CRS and, more recently, STC, where disbursements have taken up to a month.  USAID funding helped with temporary shelter and (in the second phase of the grants) supported more long-term housing solutions, including about 3,000 (planned) housing units.  Effective action has been taken, although with some delays, towards repairing water and sanitation systems. Local health systems linked to the PVOs received grant support to help stave off epidemics and treat those affected by the disaster. There were no serious epidemics after the disaster. Reconstruction projects (roads, schools) received some support, as did agriculture (tools, seeds).  The Emergency Title II Food for Work (FFW) program, while not directly supported by this project, worked synergistically with it to produce very positive results. There were logistical difficulties in the procurement and distribution of some materials.  Skilled workers were hard to find.  Not all mayors were leaders, but this project demonstrated the overwhelmingly positive impact of strong local networks and institutions.  The generally positive experience of having worked together in the face of disaster, of having seen tangible results, has brought a new positive ""can-do"" spirit to many Honduran communities, a spirit that is still alive and could be used to spark new change and development. In addition to the cooperation shown by the villagers and city-dwellers throughout Honduras, the cooperation and coordination between the seven PVOs and between them and the larger PVO, NGO, and international cooperation community are remarkable.  The dissonant notes sounded in this regard by the PVOs had to do with the World Food Program (WFP), the Honduran Social Investment Fund (FHIS), and, to a lesser extent, COPECO (in the south) and the central government. On the down side, Hurricane Mitch destroyed much infrastructure in Honduras, including cropland, agricultural development, businesses, and roads, and if the economic outlook of Honduras does not improve, unemployment will soar.  Also, it is highly unlikely that the self-confidence and the positive community spirit which came from the rebuilding efforts is sustainable. Includes reports on the individual PVOs.

"Reviews project to reduce fertility and the risk of HIV/AIDS transmission in Kenya through sustainable, integrated family planning (FP) and health services (APHIA project).  A child survival initiative in Bungoma District was added in 1997. Mid-term review covers the period 8/95-5/99. Despite a one-third decline in funding, APHIA has made notable gains in each of the major program areas.  (1) Between 1983 and 1998, modern contraceptive prevalence among married women has more than tripled from 10% to 32%, one of the most rapid and sustained increases in the world. Among African countries, only South Africa and Zimbabwe have higher prevalence. Due principally to this increase in prevalence, the total fertility rate (TFR) has fallen dramatically over the past 20 years, from an estimated 8.1 to 4.7 children per woman between 1976 and 1996. This 40% decline in fertility eases the pressures of population growth on Kenya's society, economy, and environment.  (2) While the HIV/AIDS epidemic is expanding, there are signs that sexual and reproductive attitudes and behavior are changing.  Nearly all reproductive-age women and men have heard of AIDS; roughly 85% know at least one way of avoiding infection; and nearly 40% know at least two of the four important ways of avoiding infection.  Among men, nearly 50% know that condoms can be used to avoid AIDS, up from 36% in 1993, and 90% report that they have changed their behavior to avoid AIDS, with 50% limiting sex to one partner, 20% using a condom, and 15% abstaining from sex. Among women, 77% report having changed their behavior, with 47% limiting sex to one partner, 3% using a condom, and 19% abstaining from sex.  (3) There have been marked increases in revenues generated through cost-sharing activities, from under $l million in 1990 to over $8 million in 1998.  This initiative has been critical to increasing the sustainability and improving the quality of public health services.  It has also been a cornerstone of national health reform as it has worked to devolve authority and accountability to the district level.  This initiative has also lent support to the privatization of two major hospitals and the sustainability of health NGOs through shared-risk insurance. Continued USAID investment is key to continued progress in these areas, especially given the gaps and constraints that will impede future progress.  These include: the slow growth of contraceptive prevalence among women generally; the shortfalls in couple years of protection targets for USAID-funded programs; limited progress in integrating child survival, HIV/AIDS, and FP services; the slow pace of implementing health sector reforms; the health risks associated with the expansion of private health care; weaknesses in the Ministry of Health's training and supervisory system; societal denial of the socioeconomic and personal impact of the HIV/AIDS epidemic; the limited access of adolescents to reproductive health services; gaps in the delivery of basic reproductive and child health care; the lack of appreciation in Kenyan society of the importance of women and children; the slow growth of the economy; lack of reliable sources for necessary supplies and commodities; and declining support from other donors.","Related document (issue papers): PD-ABR-518","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","5/1/1999 12:00:00 AM","","Integrated health care|Disease prevention and control|HIV/AIDS|Family planning services|Reproductive health|Child survival activities","Kenya","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABR517.pdf","437 KB","008565 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to increase non-traditional agricultural exports (NTAEs) in Uganda (IDEA project).  Interim evaluation covers the period 1995-5/99. The project has generated annual exports of approximately $20 million per year of high-value commodities and $17 million per year (in 1998) of low-value commodities. Increased incomes from maize and bean production in the range of $7 million per year have been achieved.  The project has also developed an innovative system for private sector input supply and technology transfer, as well as a group of exporters of high- value products that provides Uganda with a core of agribusinesses capable of competing in global markets. The project has generate income for rural households.  The high-value export enterprises have generated an estimated 4,000 permanent jobs and increased revenue to 23,650 smallholders and employees.  Efforts to increase the production and trade of maize and beans have benefitted 120,000 small-scale farmers by providing improved production and post-harvest handling technologies, with annual benefits estimated at $50-$200 depending on the amount of land planted with new varieties and managed with improved production techniques.  Also, the project is putting in place structures that can sustain growth without continued donor investment. The project is unquestionably achieving its goal and purpose by increasing household incomes through NTAEs.  All targets are being met or exceeded, which can be attributed to excellent contractor performance.  IDEA interventions are widely known in Uganda.  The low-value (maize and beans) component has developed and widely extended improved technologies and thus done an excellent job of addressing the primary cause of low farmer incomes -- inefficient production practices. More effort should now be devoted to identifying and developing the producer groups most capable of using more efficient technologies to produce quality products for commercial markets.  Effort should also be made to explore the production and marketing of other staple commodities such as confectionery crops (sesame and groundnuts). The high-value component has a sound approach to identifying and developing high-value exports.  It will need to avoid overload by continuing to be rigorous in choosing activities with the highest potential.  The high-value export sector will need support from the project, the Mission, and the Government of Uganda to maintain and increase competitiveness in the global market.  Areas needing particular attention are the use of market information, pesticide use and handling safety, financing and credit mechanisms, and transport and handling efficiency. Developing competitive agriculture sectors has a high potential for payoff to USAID investments.  But full payoff can only be achieved by maintaining the effort for a relatively long period.  The Mission's life of strategy in this area should be a minimum of 10 years.  Shorter-term strategies for increasing incomes will probably neither have broad impact nor be sustainable.  The project should be extended at least through 2004. Except for the grant to the Africa Project Development Facility (APDF), the Mission should, to the extent possible, replace the current USAID-managed grants program with simpler mechanisms such as direct purchase of inputs and fixed fee contracts for services under management of the contractor-run Agribusiness Development Center (ADC).

"Final evaluation of a safe motherhood pilot project (1995-99), aimed at increasing the availability, utilization, and quality of emergency obstetric care (EmOC) in selected hospitals and health centers in Morocco. The overall result of the project is impressive.  The project successfully implemented both basic and comprehensive EmOC in all sites for which definitive plans had been developed, and did so well within the time frame allocated.  As the first decentralized activity of this kind, the project acted as a catalyst for the successful initiation of many other decentralized activities.  In the words of the Regional Delegue: the project ""has been the locomotive driving the train of decentralization"".  Although further work is needed in a number of areas, the project's strong leadership and teamwork at the regional and central levels, combined with timely and appropriate TA from the donor agency, has resulted in a major achievement,  Includes recommendations to ensure both the sustainability and the replicability of the project.

"Evaluates program/project to increase the use of modern family planning (FP) methods and help stabilize the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Ghana (GHANAPA project).  Interim evaluation covers the period 9/94-10/99; it does not assess a child survival component added in 1998. GHANAPA has produced some significant accomplishments, though some fell short of expectations.  (1) Ghana's modern contraceptive prevalence rate (CPR) is over 13%, which, while well short of the project's 20% target, is relatively high for sub-Saharan Africa.  (2) Ghana's policy and regulatory environment for population and FP is very positive. However, while a national policy on AIDS will be released in the very near future, few public leaders or prominent figures have expressed support for a more vigorous Government of Ghana (GOG) response to the threat posed by HIV.  Long-term FP methods are not yet a significant factor in Ghana's FP/reproductive health (RH) program, due to cultural biases, client fears and misperceptions, and the lack of  meaningful information, education and communication (IEC) support.  Two clinical methods, injectables and Norplant, however, show strong promise for the future.  (3)  Ghana's contraceptive management system is orderly, efficient, and effective.  Oral contraceptives and condoms are being marketed at affordable prices by the Ghana Social Marketing Foundation through more than 3,000 outlets. The lessons of a USAID-supported operations research project (Navrongo) have been embraced by the leadership of the Ministry of Health (MOH) as a model for community-based FP/RH programs.  (4) Protocols and guidelines developed for health care providers have the potential to standardize and improve service delivery at all levels of the health care system.  Dissemination of the guidelines is proceeding very slowly, however.  (5) Ghana's total fertility rate (TFR) of 4.6 exceeds the 5.0 GHANAPA target.  Even though this figure is not wholly due to the project, it could not have been attained without it.  (6) Public awareness of HIV/AIDS is high, but has not yet been translated into the necessary level of behavior change, and GOG health education efforts have been inadequate.  (7) The GOG's HIV sentinel surveillance system is in place, and can serve as an accurate early warning system for any upsurge in HIV prevalence.  Current national prevalence, as measured by this system, is approximately 4%. An increasing number of health care practitioners in the public and private sectors have adopted STD-management protocols developed under the project. The project's shortcomings can be attributed in good part to overly ambitious targets, e.g., the expectation that the use of long-term methods and the overall CPR would double in 6 years.  The unmet need for RH services remains high in Ghana, such that a continuing, well-executed assistance program can be expected to produce a steady, if not especially dramatic, increase in prevalence in the years ahead.  The project was also constrained by inadequate GOG support for its own RH program -- support that was expected as a consequence of USAID's nonproject assistance (NPA) agreement with the GOG.  (In fairness to the GOG, USAID/Ghana terminated NPA abruptly in 1997 without prior consultation with the GOG; some resources which the latter had anticipated under the NPA were never provided.) For the future, USAID's assistance program in FP/RH should concentrate on ensuring that all sexually active Ghanaians have access to at least three and preferably four FP methods -- including, at a minimum, pills and condoms.  Special attention should be given to training and service extension efforts, which will expand the availability of injectables and Norplant.  USAID, in partnership with the POLICY project and the GOG, should reorient its policy and advocacy investments to focus on increasing public awareness of the threat posed by HIV/AIDS and measures the public can take to avoid infection.  This initiative should be concentrated on communicating with young adults and adolescents, and should include specific information they need to prevent unwanted pregnancy and to avoid transmission of STDs and HIV, as well as, importantly, strengthened public and private sector efforts to ensure that young adults and youth have improved access to FP/RH services.  USAID support for expanding the Navrongo pilot project should avoid cost-and-capital- intensive items that might complicate the wide-scale replicability of the model.","Delivery order no.

"Evaluates project to accelerate economic growth with equity in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) by effectively applying research to public policy (EAGER project).  Interim evaluation covers the period 1995-2/99 vs. a PACD of 9/99. The strategy of EAGER, which was implemented by a consortium of U.S. and African research organizations led by Associates for International Research and Development (AIRD) and the Harvard Institute for International Development (HIID), was to pair African and expatriate researchers and require them to find local policymakers who would oversee the research to ensure that the results would be of real use in policymaking. In general, the cooperative agents are conducting excellent research and producing excellent results.  By early 1998, AIRD and HIID were involved in more than 50 research studies with some 200 researchers, and a number of important policy changes are at least partly attributable to their work. For example, the Government of Mali revoked an export tax on raw hides and skins after an EAGER-funded study publicized the costs of the tax to the hides and skins industry and to the national economy. Similarly, the Government of Madagascar eliminated the export tax on vanilla following the recommendations of a project study.  In Tanzania, after an EAGER study demonstrated the enormous size of the small-scale mining sector and a correlation between high taxes and a high incidence of smuggling, the Minister of Energy and Minerals abandoned plans to launch a police attack on gold and gem smugglers and instead eliminated almost all taxes on the miners.  At this stage of EAGER, it is not possible to point out the policy effects of all the research components, because in many cases research is still underway. Also, some effects might not be realized until after the end of EAGER because of the long-term nature of actions taken in response to recommendations. Overall, USAID was correct in assuming that enough high-quality African professionals had become available to participate as partners with Americans in a wide range of policy- related research, and that many senior African policymakers had become aware of their need for research results.  The EAGER experience points the way to the design of an EAGER II that will take advantage of the recent increase in the research-management abilities of African institutions partly funded by USAID, both directly and through the African Capacity Building Foundation (ACBF). Major lessons learned are as follows:  (1) If African researchers find their relationship with expatriates unequal, research quality is jeopardized because the African researchers cannot embrace the work. The greater the degree of ownership, the greater the African researchers' commitment and concentration.  (2) The use of the Policy Advisory Committee (PAC) has brought policymakers into the research process early enough to permit them to offer advice on implementation and to serve as informed advocates for the researchers' recommendations. If they are to remain sufficiently involved, however, PAC members must be told of setbacks and delays in the research along with research results.  (3) When EAGER was designed, few African research institutions were ready to manage all the elements in the research process.  Today, research institutions in five or six countries have the potential to play a leading role in managing the African end of joint research.  (4) The more senior and experienced the researcher, the stronger his or her interest in joint research of the type EAGER intended.  (5) To be effective, policy research must be timely.  If African researchers do not have a sound reputation at home, their research results will not be credible to the policymakers.  (6) Policy Briefs appear to be a powerful tool for disseminating research results, but researchers have been slow to produce them. Interim Policy Briefs for the PAC could provide notice of policy change and would keep PAC members involved.  (7) EAGER's biannual workshops have brought together current and prospective researchers and have been highly effective in helping participants improve their own work and understand the work of their peers.  The workshops are also needed to help African researchers in different countries share inter-country comparisons and analysis. Includes recommendations for EAGER II.","Delivery order no. 04|Macro and international economics indefiniite quantity contract","Special Evaluation","Documents","AEP-I-04-96-90028-00|AEP-I-00-96-90028-00","","2/1/1999 12:00:00 AM","","Economic research|Economic growth|Equity|Research collaboration|Research organizations|Economic policy|Economic reform|Economic impact|Development project design|Indigenization","Africa south of Sahara","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABR945.pdf","321 KB","004304 - Nathan Associates, Inc.","","008308 - USAID.

"Evaluates program implemented by the U.N. Development Programme (UNDP) to build the institutional capacity of Support to the People's Housing Process (SPHP), a subsidized housing construction program of the Government of South Africa (GSA).  Interim evaluation covers a period ending 11/99. The program's design is very sound.  The People's Housing Partnership Trust (PHPT), the special vehicle created for implementing the program, is almost in full operation, and the staff is highly qualified and committed.  All substantive objectives of the program -- creating a critical mass of support for SPHP, developing capacity for SPHP at all levels, streamlining procedures for SPHP, facilitating housing support initiatives by local communities, and assisting local organized communities, NGOs, and community-based organizations -- are being achieved at varying rates of effectiveness.  Output targets are being produced effectively and are contributing to the achievement of these objectives. On the down side, due to its very limited resources the PHPT has not taken a sufficiently strategic approach to its mission, particularly with regard to advocacy and capacity building for SPHP.  In these as in other areas, the PHPT should concentrate more on: upstream matters (policies, principles, frameworks, procedures, guidelines); empowering key partners to carry out activities; passing on learning; and monitoring downstream implementation.  Related to this is the postponement, for a variety of reasons, of the decentralization of the key functions relating to the substantive objectives. It is mainly with regard to the program's more instrumental objectives -- establishing the institutional arrangements and linking SPHP to other programs and initiatives, particularly those focused on eliminating poverty -- that the PHPT has experienced difficulties, though these were in most cases beyond the program's control or reflected early growing pains.  The recent appointment of the first Board of Trustees will provide a firmer basis for addressing these issues and for moving forward with the full mandate of the PHPT. Other findings and conclusions are as follows:  (1) The PHPT has contributed to the National Policy on SPHP and in turn benefitted from the clarity and direction the policy brought to the program.  There is, however, a need to address certain areas where the policy does not appear to be sufficiently enabling and effective in guiding SPHP.  (2) The people involved in SPHP are highly committed, competent, and effective in their work at all levels, particularly in relation to communities. Those participating in PHP initiatives understand the process well and are well organized and effective in building their own houses and managing the process.  The pride of ownership, the sense of self-worth, and the hope and inspiration that this remarkable improvement in their quality of life bring to them are in themselves highly significant results of a people-centered program.  (3) The SPHP requires a new mindset of helping people help themselves, as well as a constant flow of information and a synergy to and from the people who are organizing themselves to better their lives.  In this respect, while the SPHP is working quite well, there are several ways in which the process could be made to be more empowering of people and thus more effective. (4) The SPHP helps people build more adequate houses in terms of space and numbers of rooms than could be expected from a developer-driven process.  In fact, if the SPHP could be streamlined and made more empowering of people, the process could lead to a much faster rate of construction and to greater progress in eliminating housing poverty in South Africa.

"This report contributes to the USAID/Senegal life-of-strategic objective assessment of the impact of the seven agriculture and natural resource activities under strategic objective 2 (SO2) in the period 1992-1998. Since 1962, USAID has supported programs in natural resource management in Senegal, however, it recently terminated its environmental SO2, ""Increased crop productivity through improved natural resources management in zones of reliable rainfall."" For the period 1998-2006, the mission has recast SO2 as ""More effective, democratic, and accountable local management of services and resources in targeted areas."" The majority of this report analyzes the Projet de Reboisement du Senegal (Senegal Reforestation Project (SRP)), based mainly on field work in November and December 1998. Following that, the report provides observations on the follow up project to SRP, the Community Based Natural Resource Management (CBNRM) project, on the USGS EROS Data Center environmental monitoring effort, and on the 1998 Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practices Survey.
