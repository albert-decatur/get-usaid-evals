"Presents evaluations of two projects implemented by the International Eye Foundation (IEF) in Malawi's Chikwawa District -- a final evaluation of a project (2/96-9/99) to integrate AIDS and family planning (FP) services (STAFH project), and a mid-term evaluation (4/98-9/99) of the Community Health Partnerships (CHAPS) project. The STAFH project focused on mobilizing behavior change and on assuring ongoing service availability, emphasizing HIV/AIDS prevention and FP.  The project covered a variety of target groups and a variety of partners for reaching them.  CHAPS, by contrast, works exclusively through the Ministry of Health (MOH), with a focus on capacity building and assuring service availability at the community level.  The range of potential interventions is as wide as the MOH itself, but strengthening management and support systems provides the framework for these activities. STAFH was competently implemented and made good progress towards all of its objectives.  Highlights include:  an increased contraceptive prevalence rate, particularly in villages with community-based distribution (CBD) of contraceptives; increased competency of clinical staff in treating sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and in supervising community distributors; increased access to FP methods, both in the community and at health centers; and increased depth and breadth of knowledge about AIDS and FP.  Shortfalls were due more to gaps in project design, particularly unclear definition of objectives and lack of activity support systems, than to implementation problems. Significant accomplishments include:  CBDs trained and active in community distribution of pills and condoms; providers trained and retrained in STD syndromic management; health surveillance assistants (HSAs) trained in HIV/AIDS and FP, including supervision of CBDs; traditional healers trained in HIV/AIDS prevention and modern FP methods; partnerships established supporting peer educators in Sucoma and home-based care (HBC) volunteers and counseling at Montfort Hospital; and pilot efforts in training traditional initiation counselors and educating politicians in HIV/AIDS prevention.  The no-cost extension allowed for a seamless transition of STAFH into CHAPS and its system-strengthening model in partnership with the MOH. General conclusions regarding CHAPS are as follows:  (1) The first year of the project was frustrating for everybody. The District Health Management Team (DHMT) was not functioning and IEF staff had no authority in the District.  Without MOH leadership in the District, it was extremely difficult for the project to move forward.  (2) CHAPS demonstrates a strong sense of ownership on the part of MOH, and the DHMT truly understands that CHAPS is a participatory team process.  (3) The project has focused significantly on DHMT and community-level inputs, but has not addressed the problem of DHMT attrition and turnover.  (4) Most community-level activities are well underway, with concurrent efforts to address supervision and supply systems.  (5) Given the decentralization process occurring in Malawi, the CHAPS design (PVO/MOH partnership, mixed community- and system-level interventions, and mixed process and material inputs) works well and is very appropriate.  (6) CHAPS objectives are appropriate, but 3 years is too short for a project of this scope. The biggest constraint facing CHAPS is the extreme shortage and turnover of human resources in Chikwawa District, particularly in leadership positions.  While the project can help offset this disadvantage by strengthening management systems and policies, it cannot function in a vacuum.  Human resource needs also need to be taken into consideration when assigning personnel at the national level.  More specific recommendations are included.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","690-A-00-98-00125-00","","1/1/2000 12:00:00 AM","","Family planning promotion programs|Disease prevention and control|HIV/AIDS|Sexually transmitted diseases|Integrated health care|Community health care|Partnerships|Public sector|Private sector|Private voluntary organizations|Behavior change|Health education|Human capacity development|Health delivery|Government departments","Malawi","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABR944.pdf","2,829 KB","000627 - International Eye Foundation (IEF)","","008573 - USAID.

"Evaluates grant to Partners of the Americas (POA) to support the Regional Civic Education Project in Latin America. Participatory interim evaluation covers the period 9/93-10/99 and focuses on citizen participation activities carried out in collaboration with the Inter-American Democracy Network (IADN). IADN has evolved into an effective mechanism for engaging citizen participation in the democratic process (though this is difficult to document systematically) and is in a position to consolidate the gains made so far.  Communication and exchanging experience and information across the entire network is a key challenge.  Most IADN members feel it is time to shift from a hierarchical structure, focused on transferring methodologies from Founding Members (FMs) to Associate Members (AMs), to a more horizontal structure.  The existence of two classes of membership has led to resentment among AMs. The deliberation methodology has been successfully transferred to a sizable number of AMs.  However, there are no concrete data showing that the methodology, in and of itself, increases citizen participation.  In nearly all cases, follow-up by network members is key to the sustainability of the activities assisted, the level of confidence engendered among participants, and the accurate assessment of the results obtained. Creation of the Central America sub-network provides insights into a number of aspects of network building.  By creating country chapters, members learned to work together towards a common goal.  However, some chapters are still weak and need help in such areas as strategic planning, team-building, communication, and conflict management if they are to be consolidated.  Further strengthening could be achieved by moving beyond deliberation to incorporate other approaches to citizen participation.  There is also need for more fluid communication and information-sharing mechanisms across countries with less developed technological infrastructures.  Finally, there is potential for greater interaction between IADN members and USAID missions in identifying areas of mutual interest and potential funding opportunities. Lessons learned are as follows:  (1) Networks are established for a variety of reasons, some, like IADN, to address broad, cross-cutting themes, others to focus on more specific concerns.  This initial context affects the network's subsequent development and perhaps also its possibilities for cohesiveness. (2) Latin American civil society organizations (CSOs) working in the democracy area are eager to take advantage of the contacts, support, validation, and opportunities for exchanging information and experience that a network can offer.  (3) A key ingredient for successful creation and operation of any network or partnership is mutual agreement on purpose, roles, responsibilities, decisionmaking, and other procedures.  (4) If forced to choose between providing short-term services to a large number of organizations scattered over a particular geographic area and more in-depth assistance and follow-up to a smaller, more targeted group, the latter approach is preferable if sustainability is a concern.  (5) Within networks or consortia of southern CSOs, members are likely to vary greatly in organizational skills and capacity, making it necessary to provide organizational development assistance to weaker members, as well as to the network itself.  If a network cannot provide this service itself, it should help fragile member organizations locate such assistance.  (6) It is important to decentralize a network's decisionmaking process and governance structure as far as possible.  (7) In countries without a strong CSO sector, forums among organizations already in collaboration offer much more possibility for decisionmaking, while forums among those who have not yet agreed to work together can be effective primarily for educational purposes.  The utility of both purposes should be assessed prior to launching any initiative.  (8) Evaluating civil society programs is difficult, as the definition and indicators of ""success"" are open for interpretation.  Evaluation is even more difficult in the case of a regional network.  Participatory evaluation techniques can help overcome some of these challenges. Also, including an outside facilitator on the evaluation team can counteract the biases to which participatory evaluations may be subject.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/2000 12:00:00 AM","","Regional development|Democratization|Civic education|Political participation|Popular participation|Private voluntary organizations|Civil society|Institutional linkages|Networks|Institution building|Information networking|Organizational structure|Civic action|Development strategies|Indigenous private voluntary organizations|Technology transfer|Performance indicators|Communications aspects","Latin America|Central America","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABS017.pdf","172 KB","","","009348 - USAID.

"Evaluates grant to the American Center for International Labor Solidarity (ACILS) in Egypt, known as the Solidarity Center (SC), to develop the capacity of the Egyptian Trade Union Federation (ETUF) and its major affiliates to represent the interests of  Egyptian workers. Interim evaluation covers the period 9/95-9/99 against a PACD of 3/00. The overarching program objective has not been and cannot be met by the end of the grant period, due to the failure of critical assumptions regarding the pace of privatization, the enactment of a new labor law, and the transition to an open economy. Nonetheless, the program has had an impact on the manner in which union training programs are conducted in Egypt and on the attitudes of trainers and trainees alike.  While the number of beneficiaries is still small, a significant number of key ETUF officers and officials have been reached.  Both ETUF and the SC are fully committed to the success of the program.  ETUF is likely to continue the training so long as a need continues to be felt, though expansion may be difficult without additional funds.  The SC is likely to continue to use its own funds to work with the ETUF, albeit at a more modest level. The management improvement component has introduced new worker education techniques in Egypt and has successfully educated a significant number of Egyptians on subjects they themselves consider important.  The quality of this training is good and the number of trainees is starting to grow.  SC has trained a large number of trainers who have demonstrated their success in delivering various workshops, though 230 trainers require skills upgrading.  Also, despite the training, evidence from other countries making a transition to a market economy suggests that popular attitudes are not easily changed. Although the Vocational Training Center (VTC) had trouble getting underway, it is now the best institute of its kind in Egypt.  The U.S. contribution to the Center is recognized and appreciated.  The Center can become a construction trades ""Center for Excellence"", but financing remains a key issue.  The only way to protect the current investment may be to help the Center expand to cover all 15 construction trades, as insisted on by the Federation of Construction and Building Contractors, a key supporter of the Center.  What is probably required for both expansion and longer-term sustainability is a trust fund to which both construction contractors and the government would contribute.  Unless the problem of sustainability can be solved, it could be unwise to invest additional funds in expanding the VTC. The women's component has supported the ETUF's Women's Committee, and leading ETUF officials believe that the internal elections in 2001 will see a significant increase in the number of women in senior positions. The program's impact on women participants, especially those who attended courses in the United States, seems to have been considerable. There is also evidence of a broader impact, but no firm conclusions can be drawn. In the privatization component, two conferences were held and teaching curricula and  materials prepared for the Workers' University; the latter proved useful in instructing union officials and staff regarding the viability of Employee Stock Ownership Programs (ESOPs) in Egypt. In the area of financial management, the difficulties of merging four diverse AFL/CIO regional international institutes into one smoothly running operation were probably underestimated.    However, the SC's financial management improved over the course of the grant and is now adequate given the size of its operation. Lessons learned are as follows:  (1) Pre-positioning a government-controlled trade union for eventual independence is risky but usually necessary, because a lack of preparedness could be devastating for workers should change suddenly come.  (2) The success of the George Meany Center in adapting U.S. training programs to Egyptian needs based on original research in both administrative and craft fields, including gender-related issues, suggests that the Egyptian SC program may be applicable to other Egyptian training programs and to labor programs in other Arabic countries.  (3) There is little point in insisting on financial management standards that are likely to consistently exceed NGO capacity.  (4) Programs to develop independent trade unions do not always fit easily into traditional frameworks, and thus require flexible management.  Since labor programs naturally include elements related to democracy and governance, as well as economic growth, USAID might consider how the SC can contribute to both sectoral objectives.","Project title: Strengthening elections and political processes","Special Evaluation","Documents","AEP-I-00-96-90006-00|AEP-5468-I-00-6006-00","","1/1/2000 12:00:00 AM","","Trade unions|Labor unions|Public enterprises|Management development|Management training|Advocacy|Vocational training|Training centers|Training personnel|Women in development|Privatization|Economic reform|Financial management|Indigenous private voluntary organizations|Financing|Economic participation","Egypt","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABS032.pdf","134 KB","003970 - Management Systems International, Inc.

"Over a period of 5 years (1995-99), the Urban Initiative of the Family Planning Service Expansion and Technical Support Project (SEATS) helped 10 municipalities in Guinea, Mozambique, Senegal, Zambia, and Zimbabwe implement projects and activities to meet the growing demand for accessible, high- quality family planning (FP) and reproductive health (RH) services.  Elements common to these programs included: data- driven planning; coordination of public and private-sector inputs; partnership with municipal officials; intersectoral advocacy to form coalitions to promote RH; and ""South-to-South"" dissemination.  Two models -- the Best Practices and the Quick Study models -- proved to be flexible and effective approaches for improving access, quality, and sustainability.  Each model increased support for RH programs by municipal officials, knowledge and use of RH data, and access to quality services. Results of the Urban Initiative included services to more than 81,000 new contraceptive users, 221,104 couple years of protection (CYP), and training for 1,702 service providers. Key lessons learned include the following:  (1) Municipal governments can increase the efficiency and effectiveness of FP service delivery programs.  (2) Municipal officials can, at least partially, manage the impact of increasing urbanization on access to and quality of RH services, but they cannot do it alone.  (3) Key to maximizing access in urban areas are two strategies:  (a) identify and mobilize underutilized resources; and (b) be creative in using new, even unconventional, resources.  (4) Urban decisionmakers are often unaware of research findings that could be used to improve planning and resource allocation. (5) Urban areas have more untapped resources available to support RH programs than is commonly believed.  (6) Women in leadership positions can play a key role in advocacy and in expanding services, especially in cities where RH issues are sensitive.  (7) The high diplomatic cost of publicly exposing serious quality of care problems must be weighed against the catalytic potential of this information.","Project title: Family planning service expansion and technical|support (SEATS)","Special Evaluation","Documents","CCP-C-00-94-00004-10|CCP-C-00-94-00004-00","","1/1/2000 12:00:00 AM","","Family planning services|Health delivery|Reproductive health|Urban areas|Access to services|Health care administration|Public health care|Municipal level|Project sustainability|Project replication|Best practices|Quality of care","Guinea|Mozambique|Senegal|Zambia|Zimbabwe","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNACH159.pdf","486 KB","005553 - John Snow, Inc.

"This study documents the lessons learned by the Service Expansion and Technical Support (SEATS) project in applying best practices to improve reproductive health (RH) care for young people in eight countries: Albania, Burkina Faso, Cambodia, Eritrea, Russia, Senegal, Zambia, and Zimbabwe.  Characteristics of SEATS subprojects included:  the use of multiple interventions in multiple settings to address young people's RH problems; clinical services for youth, including contraception, sexually transmitted disease (STD) screening and treatment, and antenatal and delivery care; a focus on urban youth; collaboration among local, national, and international institutions; youth involvement in program design, implementation, management, and evaluation; outreach, including peer education; incorporation of youth RH programming into ongoing program activities; community mobilization and advocacy; and attention to quality and sustainability. Key lessons learned were as follows:  (1) Addressing the special needs of young people does not require a separate project or intervention targeting youth.  (2) The willingness to pioneer new ventures in RH services for young people is not exclusive to the private sector.  (3) Basic human rights -- clients' rights and reproductive rights -- are a compelling rationale for offering RH education and services to young people.  (4) Young people and service providers demand integrated RH interventions.  (5) Integrated RH services that include STD prevention and screening can attract young men.  (6) Health centers can be reconfigured to attract youth seeking information and counseling as well as services.  (7) A ""champion"" for youth within a clinical setting can help maintain a youth-friendly environment.  (8) The costs of referral services are a barrier to access.  (9) Young people prefer contraceptive method choices.  (10) Programs require support, advice, and assistance in addressing community resistance and opposition to youth RH interventions.  (11) Identifying a sustainable and appropriate package of compensation and incentives for peer educators is complicated.  (12) Peer educators can be very resourceful fundraisers. (13) Adult-friendly programming may be as important as youth-friendly services.  (14) Standard family planning and RH monitoring indicators do not capture the results of youth projects.  (15) Evidence of sexual activity among girls 12 and younger points to the need to develop appropriate interventions targeting this age group.  (16) The sensitivity surrounding RH services for young people is not an insurmountable barrier to demonstrating their feasibility.

"The Midwifery Association Partnerships for Sustainability (MAPS), a special initiative of the Family Planning Service Expansion and Technical Support Project (SEATS II), promotes the development of midwives as a way to address unmet needs for family planning and reproductive health (FP/RH) care.  MAPS works with midwives in the private and public sectors through their professional associations. Since its beginning in 1995, MAPS has created and implemented projects in four countries in Africa -- Senegal, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe -- and assisted midwifery associations in Cambodia, Eritrea, and Tanzania.  MAPS has increased access to FP/RH  services by: providing services in communities where public sector services are limited or unavailable (e.g., rural areas); integrating FP into existing RH care services; reducing practice barriers; and providing health care alternatives for clients.  MAPS strategies, which were tailored during implementation to specific country needs, include:  capacity building of associations and their members; creation of more enabling practice environments; promotion of quality and sustainability; creation of model clinics; and development of policy initiatives. To promote sustainability, MAPS:  builds association capacity for self-governance, management, training, advocacy, funding, strategic planning, and marketing; seeks to reduce barriers that prevent private midwives (PMWs) from offering a full range of services, including FP; and supports individual midwives by improving quality of care, strengthening the marketing capability of PMWs, increasing access to FP, and introducing user fees.  The project facilitated outreach activities to make communities more aware of PWM services.  In reaching beyond their clinics to the communities they served, midwives learned a great deal about community needs, perceptions of care, and barriers to access. MAPS included a strong training program to expand midwives' knowledge, skills, and attitudes.  Training covered areas such as mobilizing communities, managing a business, keeping records of service statistics, and monitoring quality of care.  During the MAPS end-of-project evaluations, midwives reported that these activities contributed greatly to their professional growth. Lessons learned included the following:  (1) Barriers to private practice severely limit the potential contribution of midwives to reducing the unmet need for RH services.  (2) RH service delivery points are incomplete without minor curative services and immunization capability.  (3) HIV/AIDS has permanently changed the service delivery environment.  (4) Basic business management skills and community mobilization skills are critical to the viability of private midwives. (5) Monitoring and long-term supervision of midwives on a sustained basis is difficult. The MAPS experience illustrates that, with adequate support, midwives can successfully expand access to RH care, reach underserved populations, and provide high-quality, integrated reproductive health services, including FP.  Two areas that would benefit from continued focus are:  (1) strengthening community mobilization and links with NGOs, and (2) empowering midwives by removing barriers to practice.","Lessons learned from SEATS's MAPS [Midwifery Association|Partnerships for Sustainability] initiative|Project title: Family planning service expansion and technical|support (SEATS)","Special Evaluation","Documents","CCP-C-00-94-00004-10|CCP-C-00-94-00004-00","","1/1/2000 12:00:00 AM","","Health professionals|Nurse midwives|Associations|Institution building|Access to services|Family planning services|Reproductive health|Human capacity development|Public health care|Private health care|Economic self sufficiency|Health policy|Policy reform|Community based delivery|Health facilities|Integrated health care|Advertising|Rural areas|Indigenous private voluntary organizations|Management training|Demand|Constraints|Case studies|Quality of care","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNACH162.pdf","1,111 KB","005553 - John Snow, Inc.

"Evaluates the Maternal and Child Health Initiative (MCHI), a child survival project being implemented in Guinea by Africare.  Interim evaluation covers the period 10/97-11/99. Capitalizing on its comparative advantage as an NGO, MCHI/Africare has undertaken innovative work with the Hearth model, which addresses malnutrition at the community level. Through use of this method, 117 of the 140 children present at the second post-Hearth weighing had been rehabilitated, and mothers had begun to adopt feeding behaviors that should prevent malnutrition from recurring.  Africare's organization of a national seminar on the Hearth model has made many other NGOs and ministries aware of the method, which has quickly become a potential model for malnutrition rehabilitation among other NGOs, including Plan/Guinea, Adventist Development and Relief Agency International (ADRA), and Action against Hunger.  More importantly, the Hearth model has the potential to help the Ministry of Health (MOH) reduce malnutrition rates nationally. In the project's fourth year, Africare will work with the Dabola Director of Health (DPS) on adapting the Hearth model to its community-based strategy. The MCHI project has increased access to primary health care (PHC) services by:  promoting collaboration between community agents and MOH health workers so that more people take part in community-level health activities conducted by health center staff, such as vaccination days; training 48 community agents in nutrition, malaria control and prevention, diarrheal disease control, reproductive health, and information, education, and communication (IEC) skills; implementing growth monitoring and Hearth activities to identify and rehabilitate malnourished children; constructing and renovating health posts; providing motorcycles to MOH agents; supporting and supervising community agents; developing a referral system; improving the emergency evacuation system from health posts to hospitals through the provision of radios to health posts; and working with the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) to develop a community-level emergency evacuation system. MCHI/Africare has developed an excellent working relationship with the DPS and other organizations operating in the area and effectively coordinates its work with these entities.  For example, MCHI is working with: the UNICEF/Maternity without Risk Project to develop an emergency evacuation strategy to complement the project's provision of radios to health centers; Pour Renforcer les Interventions en Sante Reproductive et MST/SIDA (PRISM) and 13 other organizations to standardize and share approaches to IEC in the region: PRISM, the Association Guineenne pour le Bien  tre Familial (AGBEF), and the National Malaria Control Program (PNLP) to standardize the training of health agents.  MCHI is also providing information to PRISM's community-based strategy coordinator to standardize community-level data gathering and supervision tools, and serves as a resource to other NGOs interested in initiating the Hearth model. Finally, MCHI/Africare has provided training and support to increase the capacity of community agents to provide quality care in support of maternal and child health; has developed instruments to track inputs and outcomes; and is advocating for better support and recognition of community-level health activities.

"PACR of a project (9/89-5/98) to relocate three gas turbines from existing power plants to a new site near Hurghada, Egypt.  The project was a component of the Power Sector Support Project I.  The main counterpart agency was the Egyptian Electricity Authority (EEA). The successfully completed project added an additional 85 MW of generating capacity to the EEA generation system (allowing for reduced capacity due to high ambient summer temperatures).  Initially, this power was available only to meet the steadily increasing demand from new developments in the Hurghada area; since 1998, the latter has been connected to the Unified Power System (UPS) and now draws its power from the national grid. The six renovated 24 MW gas turbines at Hurghada (five financed by USAID and one by EEA) are currently used only on a standby basis, since they have not yet been connected to the natural gas system, and, using solar energy, are more expensive to run than are turbines that use natural gas.  However, EEA has applied for a natural gas connection for this plant.  To make this economically feasible, it plans to move an additional 6 turbines to Hurghada and convert all 12 to combined cycle operation.  The addition of one or more heat recover steam generators to the system will boost power output by 50% with no additional fuel requirements.  The resulting power plant will have an operating output of approximately 300 MW and will be available to the entire country (and for export) through the UPS. The project provided the least-cost solution to the shortage of EEA electrical generating capacity in the Hurghada area.  EEA was able to utilize surplus generating equipment from other parts of the country to satisfy growing demand in Hurghada's rapidly developing tourist area at about half the cost of constructing a totally new plant of the same capacity. EEA's participation, through its in-house construction contractor and the use of its own labor and craft workers for the turbine move and refurbishment, resulted in considerable cost savings over the use of offshore contractors. EEA also gained considerable experience, which it will put to use during the next phase of expansion at the Hurghada power plant. In addition, EEA personnel received training in the United States and onsite in the operation of the upgraded plant. Lessons learned are as follows:  (1) In future projects, the initial in-situ survey of the turbine units should include partial disassembly to ensure that the list of replacement and repair parts accurately reflects the condition of the units.  The expenditure of additional time at this stage will avoid later delays caused by waiting for the delivery of offshore parts and equipment.  (2) The process of dismantling and transporting the turbines to their new location needs to be more closely monitored and controlled.  Parts removed from the main unit prior to transportation should be tagged and containerized, and remain in the container until required.  Some parts were lost in transit and additional costs were incurred in replacing them. (3) EEA's use of its own civil works contractor resulted in considerable cost savings.  If used again, however, this model should be implemented under a traditional construction contract package containing commercial terms and conditions, schedules, technical specifications, drawings, and quality control and testing requirements.  In the absence of these, K&M, the technical services contractor, had to interpret local engineering and construction practices in order to monitor and accept the work performed.  (4) Detailed project scheduling responsibilities were not clearly defined in either the GETSCO or Hydelico contract.  Without such schedules, the control and coordination of the overall project is not possible.

"PACR of a project (6/91-6/98) to increase production and marketing of non-traditional agricultural exports (NTAEs) by cooperatives and participating small farmers in El Salvador.  The Cooperative League of the USA (CLUSA) was the implementing agency. Market demand led to a shift in focus from NTAEs to non-traditional agriculture (NTA) in general, as well as from conventionally grown to organically grown NTAEs.  The latter shift also reduced the use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides and had a positive impact on the environment and on farmers. The project had a significant impact on employment generation, production, net earnings, and area planted.  Future Mission activities in these areas should include as much of the CLUSA/El Salvador methodology as possible.  The project also improved the administrative capabilities of its assisted cooperatives, though much remains to be done, especially at the primary level.  Future efforts to support agricultural organizations should include activities in institutional development, management, and organizational strengthening. While many participating secondary organizations have attained acceptable levels of sustainability, the situation with many primary level organizations is less certain.  The sustainability of PROEXSAL has not yet been achieved and will be critical to the survival of many primary organizations with which the project has worked over the past years.  The final evaluation recommended that CLUSA spend the final few months of the project making PROEXSAL and its members as sustainable as possible. The project had a recognized environmental impact, including reducing the use of synthetic agrochemicals and polluting agricultural byproducts, promoting soil conservation techniques, and rationalizing agrochemical policies. Circumstantial evidence indicates that the project helped create public awareness of the dangers of chemical-based agriculture and of the benefits of organ, environmentally friendly agricultural products.  The final evaluation recommended that CLUSA's activities in this direction be continued. Soil and compost testing has not been done either in a consistent manner nor over time.  The same is true of crop- specific soil and compost testing.  Future attempts to improve crop production should begin with extensive soil and soil amendment testing to determine nutrient levels and soil and amendment pH.  Nutrient and pH levels should also be monitored on a regular basis. The project benefitted women significantly in terms of employment, training, and, to a lesser extent, assumption of leadership roles. Women received about 20% of the jobs created by the project and 12% of the training.  In the past, these indicators for women were close to zero.  Future Mission programs should include specific mechanisms that address the role of women and include at least one female technician trained in basic education techniques on its staff. Of all the development strategies that the Mission might adopt for El Salvador's rural sector, CLUSA's organic NTAE and NTA strategy is the one most likely to be successful. The following lessons were learned:  (1) The factor that more than any other led to project success was the flexibility of project management and Mission project officers (2) The Spanish word ""mystica"", which combines dedication to work, a special way of relating to and respecting the people one is trying to assist, working long hours in often uncomfortable situations, and, most of all, enjoying the work, consistently came up whenever respondents explained their relationship with CLUSA staff, or the reasons why they thought CLUSA staff had been successful.  (3) Project success was promoted by the decision to work through an NGO/PVO outside of both government and the many public or private bureaucracies where it could have been located. (4) The role of an expatriate senior manager is a critical factor of project success. If the person is allowed the flexibility, has the mystica, and works outside of normal bureaucratic channels, he/she can often achieve the trust and confidence of the people being assisted, as well as the trust and confidence of power brokers within a particular project.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","3/1/2000 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural production|Agricultural product marketing|Nontraditional agricultural exports|Organic farming|Private voluntary organizations|Development strategies|Institutional sustainability","El Salvador","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABS126.pdf","614 KB","008540 - USAID.

"Close-out report on a project (9/95-2/99) to improve the management of microenterprise credit programs in El Salvador. Catholic Relief Services (CRS) and NGO partners implemented the project. The project's main achievement was providing an opportunity for teamwork and interchange of ideas among the diverse microlending institutions, resulting in a certain level of mutual trust.  In terms of outputs, the project:  designed and implemented the Credit Risk Bureau (CRB) -- which is expected to exist as an independent self-sufficient institution -- for NGOs in seven project institutions (a database of 5,800 delinquent clients); completed the diagnostic of the management information systems; installed an evaluation and impact system in four project institutions; developed training sessions; served as liaison with other institutions regarding research, lobby, TA, and forums for the sector; and completed eight sectorial and other studies. Although 34,463 active customers were being served by participating credit institutions at the PACD, the overall portfolio did not show a great increase of active clients, and some institutions showed fewer clients at the end.  One of the reasons for this is that some institutions implemented write-off exercises.  Also, several institutions dropped out of the program.  For its part, CRS made an important change in its portfolio, in 1997 initiating a new credit program, called ENLACE, in alliance with only 5 of its original 12 counterparts. Overall, project results were more qualitative than quantitative. The main intention of the executive directors of the participating institutions was to improve the quality and variety of the services offered. A follow-on effort by CRS has been approved under the Rural Financial Markets Project (5190435). The following lessons were learned:  (1) For a project to be funded by USAID/Washington and managed by USAID/El Salvador, communication and coordination between the two parties is key.  (2) When different institutions participate in the same project, each must have a clear understanding of the purpose of the project and their participation. Institutions should also share common interests and commit themselves to fulfilling project goals.  (3) Not all projects can be measured by the same indicators, especially when expected results are based on broad and loosely integrated activities and indicators are financial and very specific.  (4) Project reorientation for achieving planned goals or concentrating efforts in fewer areas could have led to better results in less time.  (5) Decisionmaking by the project board took place by consensus or by majority vote.  This allowed the project to be appropriated by its member partners and provided the opportunity to renew commitments to joint ventures. (6) The tactical levels of operation were those most systematized by the project and were regulated by the Board at its monthly meeting.  A strategic approach was taken during the last phase of the project, identifying priorities according to accumulated abilities and to common interest within member partners. This exercise was very productive.  (7) The institutional profiles were important in developing confidence and institutional ties. On the other hand, those leading the coordination effort allowed a full debate within a framework of respect for the game rules established.  (8) Confidence within the partner institutions met with some resistance when it involved sharing information related to the partners' operations.  Good coordination and the development of trust are critical for achieving goals in this type of effort.  (9) Strategies should have been assessed at least once a year in order to adjust the project to both the changing environment and the partners' satisfaction.  The budget should have also been adjusted in order to emphasize strategic activities with greater impact.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","940-0406-A-00-5246-00","","3/1/2000 12:00:00 AM","","Microenterprises|Financial institutions|Commercial credit|Loan administration|Management development|Private voluntary organizations|Indigenous private voluntary organizations|Partnerships|Institution building|Economic risk|Microfinance","El Salvador","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABS127.pdf","432 KB","008540 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to improve the health of migrant families (especially mothers and children) working on coffee estates in five departments of Guatemala.  Interim evaluation covers the period 1997-12/99.  Project HOPE is the implementing agency. The project strategy is to promote collaboration among the coffee estates, Ministry of Health (MOH) offices, Social Security hospitals and health services, and health centers operated by Anacafe (the association of coffee growers) in finding sustainable solutions to the health problems faced by the target population, which is comprised of indigenous peoples. This is a risky venture, and includes at least three cutting-edge issues:  working with migrants, who provide a very small window of opportunity; working with many different indigenous cultures; and working with the commercial enterprises that employ these people. Also challenging is the sheer number of partner organizations, which include 150-200 different coffee estates, three MOH departmental offices (each with an array of district offices and health centers), the Social Security, and NGOs. The project has met or exceeded most of its scheduled targets to date.  It has trained 197 staff from partner health organizations, 473 volunteer health promoters, and 667 traditional midwives in case management and information, education, and communication (IEC), reflecting 83%, 124% and 102%, respectively, of target.  It has convinced 130 coffee estates to join the program; created a series of audio tapes on various common illnesses in Spanish and two Indian languages for broadcasting on radio stations and from the health posts at numerous coffee estates; and gained the full support of the top management of the departmental MOH and Social Security offices. Significant improvements in health services are apparent, as evidenced by increases in vaccination coverage and prenatal visits. Project HOPE is performing very competently, and has a well-functioning financial information system, a project achievement monitoring system, a personalized but systematic effort of contact and communication with the many partner organizations, and the beginning of a set of mini-studies of particular issues.  Key persons from the Ministry, Social Security, and the estates expressed high regard for Project HOPE's technical know-how and professionalism.  The capacity, personality, and long-term relationships of the Project Director is an important element in its credibility. When asked why they committed resources to the program, estate owners and managers generally responded that it was (1) the right thing to do and (2) would increase the long- term stability of their work force and productivity of the enterprise.  None seemed to think it would increase short-term profits.  Other key factors included the credibility of Project HOPE in health care, and the fact that the cost to the estates was not very high. Supplying medications is a major problem.  For example, in some estates medicines are available for children but not for adults, and the relative financial contributions of patients, estates, and the MOH to the costs of medicines differ widely from place to place.  Project HOPE has begun to address this problem by establishing a local NGO which has since been contracted by the MOH to acquire and distribute the needed medicines in a rational fashion.  Other problems include the quality of care being provided by the health workers and the effect on the MOH of the change in government administration that is likely to occur in the near future.  Also, little or no attention has been given to child spacing or family planning. Finally, continued focus needs to be given to arranging sustaining funding for the program. In sum, the project appears on the road to a resounding success.  It may well become a model for Guatemala and internationally as well. Steps should be taken now to make this possible, e.g., by focusing more attention on the final evaluation than is usually done with PVO child survival grants. Project HOPE may want to analyze the cost implications of the program on the budgets of coffee estates of different types.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","HRN-A-00-98-00046-00","","2/1/2000 12:00:00 AM","","Child survival activities|Health care|Health delivery|Private voluntary organizations|Disadvantaged groups|Indigenous populations|Migrant workers|Agricultural laborers|Coffee|Plantations|Project replication|Employer based delivery","Guatemala","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABS131.pdf","2,370 KB","006986 - People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.

"Evaluates project to support the institutional development of the Indonesia Biodiversity Foundation (KEHATI), an independent environmental NGO.  Mid-term evaluation covers the period 3/95-1/00. The first 5 years following the establishment of any new institution are always challenging.  The creation of KEHATI, a new type of Indonesian NGO, has been unusually difficult, requiring visionary leadership, continued dedication, and excellent managerial skills on the part of KEHATI's board, staff, and donor supporters.  According to the evaluation team, KEHATI has made good progress in meeting the 5-year objectives of the USAID cooperative agreement.  These benchmarks have been largely institutional and do not address what impact KEHATI's programs have had on biodiversity in Indonesia.  (This initial focus on institution building rather than on biodiversity is the correct way to evaluate the early years of a new biodiversity foundation with a permanent endowment.)  KEHATI is also proving to be an excellent model as Indonesia's first NGO foundation; it is performing well compared with other conservation trust funds around the world, and both its and USAID's performance is rated good or excellent for all the major factors identified by a 1998 Global Environment Facility (GEF) evaluation of 12 conservation trust funds as ""important for successful trust fund operations"". Nonetheless, KEHATI still faces many challenges. Key areas needing attention include fundraising; improving staff skills and capacity while keeping operating costs at or below 20% to 25% of annual revenues; improving management and oversight of the KEHATI endowment; establishing a monitoring and evaluation system essential for measuring KEHATI's overall impact and for ensuring successful field projects throughout Indonesia (clear indications of KEHATI success will be needed to assist in fundraising); and ensuring that a board of trustees is constituted and structured in the best way to achieve KEHATI's objectives. KEHATI has an important role to play in protecting Indonesia's extraordinary biodiversity while simultaneously encouraging appropriate levels of biodiversity utilization to provide income for Indonesia's citizens.  Its progress to date demonstrates that it has the potential to become one of the world's most effective biodiversity foundations. (Author abstract, modified)","Task order contract no.

"Assesses the impact of the Office of Transition Initiative's (OTI) program in Nigeria, focusing on the good governance and civil-military relations programs and on strategic results and OTI reporting.  The assessment covers a period ending 4/00. The good governance program stimulated an enabling environment for 10,300 elected officials and their constituents.  The conflict resolution module was especially appropriate in preparing leaders at all levels for conflict mediation and resolution.  For its part, the civil-military relations program facilitated the transfer of governance from military to civilian rule; it was the right application at the right time.  The two programs have progressed significantly towards the expected results, which contribute to OTI's goal of ""Nigeria's democratic transformation advanced through rapid, pivotal, catalytic interventions."" Lessons learned are as follows:  (1) Good governance. (a) There is a need to include women in similar training programs.  (b) Training in conflict resolution is clearly useful in dealing with conflict in transition situations.  (c) The informal relationships that the training developed among elected officials before taking office provided an excellent enabling environment for good governance. (2) The civil-military relations program.  (a) A program to enhance civil-military relations where the transfer from military to civilian rule is urgent requires a timely, highly visible jump-start.  Results that are readily visible and directly reduce the potential for repeating the past military record may be critical in a transition such as Nigeria is making.  (b) The absence of a government commitment to adequately fund the continuing needs of the transition could mitigate against long-term results.  Continued commitment to the transition by a government, especially the defense ministry, is imperative.  (c) Balancing hands-on, people-oriented information and more sophisticated, technical concepts was appropriate for the civil-military program, as was the use of senior retired U.S. military officers and the provision of TA in such areas as budgetary oversight and action plan preparation. (d) The need for considerable emphasis on a military orientation to training and TA does not mean that the activities must be implemented in a military style.  A more participatory, adult learning orientation contrasts with the military orientation.  (e) Implementation by OTI of ""rapid, pivotal, and catalytic interventions"" to improve civil-military relations in an unstable political environment can be highly effective. When such interventions do not include strategies for the host country to continue addressing these relations in a transition process that remains tenuous, there may be a cost. (3) Program results and OTI reporting.  (a) The availability of a country strategic plan was essential for this assessment.  This strategy shaped the framework for the methodology, as well as for all of the questions identified for the interview guides.  It also strongly shaped data analysis.  (b) Because this strategic plan had only recently been completed, however, statements of expected results were lacking, so that ""proxy"" results had to be developed to guide the assessment.","Project title: Integrated managing for results (IMR)","Special Evaluation","Documents","AEP-C-00-99-00034-00","","4/1/2000 12:00:00 AM","","Societies in transition|Political systems in transition|Democratization|Governance|Management training|Conflict resolution|Civil society|Military|Managing for results|Strategic objectives|Reporting|Civil-military relations","Nigeria","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNACH680.pdf","121 KB","009973 - PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC)","","008058 - USAID.

"Evaluates the AIDS Prevention and Control (APAC) project, aimed at preventing the spread of  HIV/AIDS by core transmitters (commercial sex workers and their clients, truck drivers and other transportation workers, slum dwellers, and sexually transmitted disease [STD] patients) in the Indian State of Tamil Nadu.  Interim evaluation covers the period 1992-5/00.  The project is being implemented by Indian NGOs (mostly urban) in partnership with state entities. The project is meeting its objectives and has already achieved most of the benchmarks identified in the USAID agreement.  Examination of data from three waves (1996 97 98) of the HIV-Risk Behavioral Surveillance Survey (BSS) in Tamil Nadu and from NGO monthly reports indicate that meaningful behavior change is underway in the state, much of it directly attributable to APAC.  Key behavior changes among target groups include an increase in condom use, an increase in STD treatment-seeking behavior, and decreases in sexual contacts with non-regular partners. Commercial sales of condoms in Tamil Nadu have more than doubled, from 12.6 million pieces in 1995 to 27.9 million pieces in 1999. However, sales plateaued to a modest 4% increase during the 1998 99 period, due to a waning of the project's cooperative effort with an Indian firm to market condoms through additional, nontraditional outlets, weaknesses in condom promotion for NGO staff and marketing training for potential retailers, and the plentiful supply of free condoms in Tamil Nadu.  APAC activities to date have been very effective in making the topic of condoms less sensitive in Tamil Nadu and in introducing the notion of condom use into the popular vocabulary. APAC has developed a comprehensive STD care strategy that focuses on raising demand for STD care and on training a large pool of providers in quality STD case management to meet the increased demand.  Increasing numbers of patients are being referred for STD care and are receiving treatment from medical practitioners associated with and/or trained by the project.  APAC supported NGOs have established strong referral networks with public and private sector treatment facilities.  Some elements of the training and follow-up strategy need refinement; APAC has to ensure that operations research efforts focus on research matters and are not managed as intervention projects. APAC provides a comprehensive package of technical, organizational, and evaluative support for participating NGOs. The management and staff of virtually every NGO contacted by the evaluation team pointed to this intensive, nurturing relationship with APAC as singularly important to improving its competence in HIV prevention and its overall effectiveness as a community-based service organization.  Management of the APAC project is sound and minimizes unsustainable expenses.  The key to its success is its excellent and committed staff, assembled through a rigorous and open recruitment process.  The partnership between Voluntary Health Services (VHS) and the Tamil Nadu State AIDS Control Society (TNSACS) has been mutually supportive, emphasizing complementarity of roles within the overall context of the state STD/HIV/AIDS agenda.  On a national level, the National AIDS Control Organization (NACO) acknowledges APAC's importance and has used the APAC model as a reference point for targeted interventions in India, though its failure to facilitate an uninterrupted flow of funds to the project has been a source of deep concern.  Finally, APAC's partnership with USAID/India has been one of the project's strengths.  The Mission negotiated vigorously with the Government of India over key elements of the APAC agreement and invested much time and energy in helping the project develop its systems and launch its activities, a process generally acknowledged (especially by APAC) to have been critical to its successes. USAID will have to maintain this activist posture vis-a-vis NACO if it is to develop a durable solution to the project's financial problems. APAC is positioned to extend its success to other parts of Tamil Nadu, to reach out to groups not covered by the current activity (e.g., industrial workers), to add services (e.g., community-based care) not currently included in the project, and to improve its diagnosis and treatment capacity through an STD reference laboratory.  The project should be extended to March 2005, at increased funding, to create the means for these new elements.

"Evaluates USAID/Peru's democracy education activities for the period 1997- 4/00. USAID/Peru's decision to emphasize a demand-based strategy for its democracy program during the period leading up to the 2000 elections was sound and greatly enhanced the possibility of achieving its strategic objective (SO)1:  ""broader citizen participation in democratic processes.""  Of current activities examined, human rights efforts have had significant impact on citizen awareness and participation, including male/female and Quechua- speaking subgroups.  Participating organizations have achieved impressive results both on their own and in coordination with one another.  While many other activities seem well on the way to meeting objectives, their ultimate impact depends on political realities and attitudes.  The lowest degree of impact on citizen education and participation belongs to activities that serve individual beneficiaries through conciliation services and free legal assistance and do not undertake policy- related advocacy or dissemination efforts. The desire to institutionalize activities within grantee organizations is strong, but grantees' ability to achieve this is mixed. Most participating NGOs have little funding for this purpose, and many have prepared proposals to obtain additional resources from USAID and other donors.  Organizations that are well established and whose primary mission coincides with the activities underway are most likely to institutionalize results. Increased communication/coordination among all SO1 counterparts could produce more effective results at the SO level by  capitalizing on potential synergies. Meanwhile, there are clear multiplier effects among organizations using methodologies and practices pioneered by other grantees, including, for example, the training methodology of the Peruvian Institute of Education on Human Rights (IPEDEHP) and the election materials produced by Transparencia and Rural Educational Services (SER). The most cost-effective interventions to date have been those related to human rights.  Activities designed by Instituto de Democracia y Propuestas (IDS) to use the electronic media for democracy education have the potential to reach large numbers of citizens cost- effectively, but are too new to have yielded measurable results.  The least cost-effective have been activities that reach very small numbers of beneficiaries while not proactively advocating for policy change (Chamber of Commerce, IPRECON, APENAC, Ministry of Justice, APOYO Institute) and that propose long-term solutions and involve a relatively limited number of beneficiaries (FORO Nacional/Internacional, CIDE/TAREA, Foro Juventud). The diversity of the activities supported makes it infeasible to assess impact at the intermediate results level.  Also, indicators lack consistency across similar programs; different variables are being tracked, which makes comparison especially difficult and creates an ""apples and oranges"" effect.  Moreover, it is not clear that successful completion of the goals, objectives, and expected results of the activities reviewed under IR2 and IR4 will produce the results expected, while activities under IR1 and IR3 are too few to make significant progress toward results as currently stated.  A careful review and revision of IRs is needed.  As for the PARTICIPE program and the SO1 framework, because over two-thirds of available funding is dedicated to election-related indicators (with targets set for 2001), impact cannot yet be accurately assessed. The 5-year post-electoral period will be a crucial time of transition in Peru, marked by both opportunities for and challenges to developing sustainable democratic institutions and strengthening civil society. There is an urgent need for strategies to maximize these opportunities and challenges.  Also, since democratic governance affects all substantive initiatives, the Mission should make a more proactive effort to integrate it into all areas of its portfolio and not rely solely on the disproportionately small budget allocated to SO1.","Task order no. 801","Special Evaluation","Documents","AEP-I-00-99-00040-00","","4/1/2000 12:00:00 AM","","Democratization|Political participation|Civic education|IEC|Public awareness|Human rights|Government departments|Indigenous private voluntary organizations|Development cooperation|Managing for results|Performance measurement|Strategic objectives|Elections|Voting|Legal aid|Advocacy|Women in development|Development planning|Political reconciliation","Peru","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABS285.pdf","425 KB","003970 - Management Systems International, Inc.

"Final evaluation of PROARCA (1995-1/00), designed to improve regional stewardship of key natural resources in Central America. PROARCA's most important achievements, at the highest level, were as follows:   The Comision Centroamericana de Ambiente y Desarrollo (CCAD), USAID-G/CAP's regional counterpart in this project, has been strengthened and is recognized by national authorities in the region as responsible for organizing regional environmental protection and sustainable resources management.  Numerous NGOs, PVOs, and governmental organizations have been technically and organizationally strengthened to confront national environmental issues with a regional vision.  PROARCA has helped reduced the gap between managing terrestrial and coastal marine resources, a condition that had been unnoticed and that requires highly technical and organizational skills.  PROARCA has put in action project implementation processes (e.g., small grants, coalitions) that should yield important results for both the region and the achievement of USAID's regional strategic objective.  Specific accomplishments are noted below. The Central American Protected Areas System (CAPAS), managed by International Resources Group (lead) and The Nature Conservancy (TNC), provides multi-faceted TA in a broad array of project-related topics. It has produced high-quality technical studies and training to 1,500 professionals, contributing to:  improved resource conservation strategies and coalitions and a larger and more capable group of managers associated with protected areas management; broader, more technical approaches for conserving the region's threatened and endangered species; improved strategies for marketing and for environmentally-friendly productive activities, especially forest management, organic coffee, and environmentally-sound tourism; and support to carbon sequestration initiatives.  CAPAS manages a regional web page and disseminates information and numerous project reports, many of which serve as technical manuals and best-practice guides.  CAPAS's widely inclusive small- and genius-grants programs offer financial resources usually not available to NGOs and individual scientists. CAPAS has cooperated with CCAD in biodiversity protection, including the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora & Fauna (CITES) and climate change control initiatives, as well as in policy research on transboundary resource conservation.  Under CAPAS, a widely popular protected areas monitoring system was developed that is being considered for official adoption by several countries. The coastal zone management (Costas) component is managed by TNC (lead), Worldwide Fund for Nature (WWF), and the University of Rhode Island/Coastal Resources Center (URI-CRC).  The Costas approach of building coalitions between stakeholders of varying interests (government, non-government, and community), though still incipient, is yielding positive results in its four sites.  The Trinational Alliances in the Gulfs of Honduras and Fonseca, although fledgling, are seen as promising coalitions for meeting transboundary natural resource management challenges.  Costas has been pivotal in facilitating the declaration of new marine-coastal protected areas, including reserves for fisheries management, and the strengthening of management in areas already protected.  Initiatives promoted through counterparts include ecotourism development, marine port contingency planning, support of community vigilance committees for environmental protection, and community-based conservation of lobster fisheries.   Costas has cooperated with CCAD in developing the Meso-American Barrier Reef Initiative and in analyzing policy for fisheries and coastal resources use. Under the environmental protection and legislation component, CCAD's legislation program (PROLEGIS), with assistance from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), helped elaborate and promulgate environmental framework laws in five countries and conducted follow-on training and technical information dissemination activities for key mid- level professionals in all seven countries, including:  training in environmental law enforcement; training and distribution of manuals in principles of environmental impact assessment, including preparation of Central American professionals to carry out training courses without EPA assistance; and training and information dissemination to government and private industry in responsible pesticide importation, management, and disposal, and to industry and government officials in clean technology. These efforts have led to the creation of networks of professionals with connections to EPA to continue information and TA exchanges.  Under its Biodiversity Protection (PROBIO) program, CCAD has collaborated with CAPAS and Costas, as well as with other international agencies, in promoting international conventions to which most Central American countries are signatory.  PROBIO has also promoted regional biodiversity conservation networks with CCAD's constituency.  Under the Local Environmental Policy and Program Initiative (LEPPI), the Community Housing Foundation, with EPA assistance, has facilitated the prioritization of, and pilot projects in, environmental sanitation in selected municipalities through a highly participatory process.  LEPPI also helped create steering committees of municipal employees and community members to facilitate project design and development, and is helping to establish community and municipal responsibilities in managing the projects, including payments for sanitary services. Several of the projects will be analyzed for replicability elsewhere. Opportunities for improvement and recommendations for the design of PROARCA II are detailed in conclusion.","Task order no. 520-99-P-034|Related document: PD-ABT-243","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","LAG-I-00-99-00013-00","","1/1/2000 12:00:00 AM","","Regional development|Natural resource management|Natural resource conservation|Biological diversity|Protected environmental areas|Environmental protection|Environmental legislation|Development cooperation|National level|Information dissemination|Private sector|Public sector|Institution building|Sector authority","Central America","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABS289.pdf","520 KB","001600 - Associates in Rural Development, Inc.

"Final evaluation of a project (1/97-12/99) to prevent and control HIV/AIDS in Peru (HELP project).  The evaluation focuses on project assistance to the Government of Peru's (GOP) Program for Control of Sexually Transmitted Diseases (PROCETSS). In the last 3 years, PROCETSS has developed a sexually transmitted disease (STD)/HIV prevention program that represents a model for the Andean region.  Peru was one of the first Latin American countries to adopt syndromic management of STDs and begin zidovudine prophylaxis to prevent perinatal HIV transmission.  The program strategy is guided by epidemiological data; interventions are evidence-based and scaled up to cover most medium-sized cities by the end of the year 2000.  The program uses peer educators (PEPs) who work with men who have sex with men (MSM) and female sex workers (FSWs), and, in Lima, Callao, and Iquitos, with youth, to promote condom use and the prompt use of strengthened STD/HIV prevention services.  The behavior change communication (BCC) materials produced are of high quality and are widely used. Behavior change interventions have focused on promoting condom use and encouraging use of STD services among highly sexually active persons.  These interventions have been technically sound, have included the use of printed media and videotapes, and have demonstrated an impressive capacity to deliver face-to-face education/motivation and condoms by both peers and trained counselors.  Evidence to date suggests that this approach has improved condom use behavior and lowered STD rates in high-risk groups, though further analysis is needed. PROCETSS' efforts to stimulate a favorable policy environment seem to have helped increase budgetary support by the Ministry of Health (MOH), but not to have reached other key political and business leaders. The most effective NGOs working with HIV/AIDS prevention are either based in Lima or focus their activities there, although the importance of building community-based programs in other cities of the country is recognized.  PROCETSS has funded several NGO operational research activities, using them mainly to develop BCC materials for high-risk groups.  NGO staff collaborated with PROCETSS to train peer educators and STD counselors and were to some extent included in PROCETSS' training activities. The HIV/STD service delivery system appropriately focuses on primary prevention of transmission and on secondary prevention of opportunistic infections among those infected with HIV.  Funds from the social security and military systems provide antiretroviral treatment for a limited number of persons (300) with AIDS.  The potential cost of antiretroviral drugs for treating 1,000 individuals with AIDS in Peru probably ranges from $7 to 10 million per year for drugs alone, depending on the type of therapy used.  The current system of syndromic management of STDs can cut costs considerably by eliminating treatment for cervical infection from the vaginal discharge algorithm. Financial and institutional sustainability is evidenced by steady increases in GOP funding, which has leveraged considerable regional and local support.  Centro de Referencia de Enfermedades Transmision/Unidad de Atencion Medicas Periodica (UAMPS) services are provided free to FSWs and MSM who voluntarily seek care.  The Peru program emphasizes civil liberties but not cost recovery.  The World Bank has stressed the negative externalities of STD and HIV infection that result from the failure of market forces to ensure delivery of services to those who should receive them.  The public good resulting from rendering an infected person less infectious warrants and dictates the use of public funds for STD treatment throughout the world. The current channeling of USAID support for HIV/AIDS/STD activities via the VIGIA project (Addressing Threats of Emerging and Re-Emerging Infectious Diseases) shifts the locus of control dynamics for USAID support for HIV/AIDS/STD.  VIGIA interacts closely with Oficina General de Epidemiologia (OGE) and the National Institute of Health, as well as with PROCETSS. There is a need to develop an overall consensus between USAID, VIGIA, and PROCETSS on mutual goals and objectives.  Also needed are criteria and processes for prioritizing activities and mechanisms to encourage and coordinate other USAID program activities (e.g., in policy, human rights, youth, women's health, and reproductive health) involving HIV/AIDS/STD prevention and care.","Project title: Synergy project (SynergyAIDS)|Spanish ed.: PD-ABS-318","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","HRN-C-00-99-00005-00","","6/1/2000 12:00:00 AM","","Disease prevention and control|Domestic government programs|Sexually transmitted diseases|HIV/AIDS|Human sexual behavior|Behavior change|Indigenous private voluntary organizations|Peer teaching|Counseling services|Health delivery|Project sustainability|Financial resources|Interpersonal communication|Beneficiary targeting|Prostitution|Cost control|IEC|Educational materials","Peru","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABS317.pdf","187 KB","003366 - TvT Associates|002387 - University of Washington","","008591 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of a 10-year project (1989-99) to promote the growth of community-based natural resource management (CBNRM) in Zambia by supporting Administrative Management Design (ADMADE), the Government of Zambia's official policy for wildlife management in game management areas (GMAs). From 1989 to 1994, USAID provided commodities and TA to help the Ministry of Tourism (MoT) set up and establish ADMADE.  From 1994 to 1995 USAID gave non-operational support under the terms of a co-operative agreement with World Wildlife Fund US.  From 1996 to 1998, the MoT was provided with direct financing via project implementation letters.  From 1998 to 1999, TA was provided through a cooperative agreement with the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS).  During this final phase, what had begun life as a wildlife management program took on a greater food security role. The project strengthened ADMADE; USAID investments were well used. Through research and trial, the project developed a set of community institutions -- democratically elected village area groups (VAGs) and community resource boards (CRBs) -- that show signs of being able to take responsibility for, and make decisions about, wildlife management (including setting quotas for off-take) and community development. The project showed limited success in expanding women's participation. The project has also:  shown that CBNRM is a workable system for wildlife management in at least some GMAs and may be applicable to others; shown that safari hunting is a profitable use of wildlife in GMAs, generating revenue that can be used to improve household living standards; defined the criteria needed to create sustainability of ADMADE programs; established CBNRM programs that are probably self-sustaining in some Luangwa Valley GMAs where ADMADE is active; shown that ADMADE can produce local employment opportunities and raise incomes; set up monitoring programs that may demonstrate a positive link between living standards and optimal sustained wildlife yields; influenced government wildlife policy, resulting in the inclusion of CBNRM provisions in the new Zambia Wildlife Act; and begun testing the linkage between wildlife management and food security. Problems noted in midterm evaluations regarding management of the Wildlife Conservation Revolving Fund have been rectified insofar as the new Zambia Wildlife Authority (ZAWA) maintains accurate computerized records of revenue received from hunting.  The management and disbursement of finances intended to fund community resource management and community development are still flawed, however, because some remittances are not being paid in full or in a timely manner.  The problem appears to lie with financial control in the ADMADE units as much as with ZAWA. Ways in which the project has contributed significantly to the Mission's strategic objective # 1 in the areas of land and labor productivity, rural non-farm enterprise (RNFE) sales and service revenue, improved RNFE access to finance, and an improved trade and investment environment are identified in the report, along with numerous lessons learned regarding such issues as community mobilization and organization, the value of democratic over autocratic leadership, the need to fully implement revenue sharing, the expansion of ADMADE's professional capacity, the link between wildlife conservation of food security, training for CBNRM programs, the role of the African College for CBNRM, and the safari hunting industry. ADMADE's future depends on ZAWA's role, capacity to manage, and commitment to CBNRM.  These will remain unknown until ZAWA becomes fully operational.","Project title: Rural and agricultural incomes with a sustainable|environment (RAISE)|Task order 11|Document identifies contract of author with contract evaluated","Special Evaluation","Documents","PCE-I-00-99-00001-00","","5/1/2000 12:00:00 AM","","Natural resource management|Natural resource utilization|Wildlife resources|Community based delivery|Domestic government programs|Institution building|Local groups|Development program management|Revenues|Community development","Zambia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABS343.pdf","961 KB","001600 - Associates in Rural Development, Inc.

"Evaluates project to improve farmer income in Zambia by developing democratically run and sustainable rural group businesses (RGBs). Interim evaluation covers the period 5/96-5/00.  The Cooperative League of the USA (CLUSA) is the implementing agency. The project has made an important contribution to the Mission's strategic objective 1 (SO1) of increasing incomes of selected groups by organizing, training, and developing marketing channels for selected groups of Zambian farmers.  CLUSA has also benefitted Zambia by developing a program with strong linkages to small farmers, other donor- funded programs, and the private sector.  This relationship has benefitted CLUSA's partners, which include the World Bank/SIDA-funded Conservation Farming Unit (CFU) and the privately owned Credit Management Services (CMS) of Kabwe, Zambia, while improving CLUSA's own sustainability potential.  CLUSA also has links to private agribusiness firms in the grain trading, paprika, and high-value horticultural sector; these links have opened CLUSA's RGBs to markets never before available to them, increased farmer profits, and given the agribusinesses the raw materials they need to grow. Food security (hunger) is an important problem for most Zambian farmers. To address this problem, CLUSA has implemented programs that address hunger along with training in, and production of,  cash crops. In Mumbwa, one CLUSA-RGB member told the evaluation team that since starting to work with CLUSA, he no longer fears hunger.  CLUSA has achieved this largely through its partnership with the CFU, which has resulted in an estimated doubling of maize yields for CLUSA RGB members. Some improvements are needed.  The CMS crop-credit program requires considerable attention.  In the 1998/99 crop year, the average loan recovery rate was 60%.  At these loss rates, USAID's investment of about $900,000 in the capitalization and operation of CMS's small farmer credit fund is at risk.  CLUSA and CMS predict an improvement in 1999/00. Whether this is the case will be known by 9/00. Lessons learned are as follows:  (1) RGBs are an effective conduit for providing training and information to rural populations.  They also allow for a supply-side economy of scale large enough to serve the needs of the Zambian agribusiness community.  (2) Interest rates must be tied to risk.  If an RGB has had problems repaying loans, the risk is higher and this should be calculated into a higher interest rate.  On the other hand, RGBs with good credit histories should be rewarded with lower interest rates and down payment requirements, as well as with other incentives.  (3) A non-profit project such as CLUSA should not choose the markets in which a private credit provider firm (such as CMS) must do business.  The for-profit firm must make the decision of who they will loan to and under what terms and conditions.  (4) Cut losses.  Do not throw good money after bad, especially in the Zambian micro-credit sector. (5) Conservation farming works and should be promoted.  (6) It is important to have a well designed and systematic internal monitoring and evaluation system.  (7) Farmers in areas where other donors and government projects have focused in the past have a higher credit risk than do farmers with lower exposure to government and donor programs. (8) There seems to be some correlation between the distance an RGB is from a main road and its willingness to repay loans. This observation was not proven statistically, but a number of persons the evaluation team talked with believed this relationship existed.  (9) Develop an internal mechanism to keep focused on deliverables.  (10) Have clear channels of communication between implementing partners. CLUSA has been meeting SO1 goals, and as long as these remain unchanged it will have a contribution to make to USAID/Zambia's goals. To end CLUSA after 4 or 5 years of operation would not be a good use of funds or a rational strategy.","Project title: Rural and agricultural incomes with a sustainable|environment (RAISE)|Task order 11","Special Evaluation","Documents","PCE-I-00-99-00001-00","","5/1/2000 12:00:00 AM","","Rural areas|Agricultural enterprises|Group loans|Business enterprises|Commercial credit|Income generation|Farm income|Agricultural product marketing|Agricultural training|Private voluntary organizations|Private enterprises|Partnerships|Food security|Commercial farming|Loan administration|Economic risk|Interest rates","Zambia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABS344.pdf","486 KB","001600 - Associates in Rural Development, Inc.

"Evaluates Phase II of the Livingstone Food Security Project (LFSP), designed to improve food security and reduce vulnerability to drought in Livingstone, Zambia.  Mid-term evaluation covers the period 1996-6/00. The project is being implemented by CARE. LFSP has overall made significant progress in achieving three of its four objectives.  (1) The development of community-based organizations (CBOs) provided the means to identify the underlying threats to food security and develop interventions that are demand- driven and relevant to beneficiary needs.  The strong focus on CBO capacity-building has also proven to be an effective way to improve the delivery of services such as seed inputs and extension training, and has strengthened the ability of rural people to manage their own development activities and become less dependent on LFSP.  The benefits of working together in small groups have been solidly demonstrated to both rural farmers and other institutions; this may very well be the most lasting legacy of LFSP. (2) The introduction of early maturing drought-resistant crop varieties may be the intervention that has most improved food security for the estimated 26,000 direct beneficiaries and their families.  These improved varieties are bulked in a community-based seed multiplication scheme, ensuring sustained supplies of seed stocks.  Although yield data are somewhat inconclusive, project monitoring data shows clearly that there is greater food availability in the communities than there was before the project started. (3) The improved farming practices are complemented by a program to improve water supply.  Over 20,000 farmers and their families benefit from the 80 water- harvesting structures that have been built or rehabilitated with USAID financing.  Although these structures have not made much impact on crop production, which remains largely rainfed, they have had a demonstrated positive impact on the health of people. Improved water supply has also benefitted the production of livestock and vegetables, which are sources of both food and income. (4) LFSP has been challenged to demonstrate significant impact in its last objective, income generation.  The project has found it difficult to boost production of cash crops and other goods and services to a volume and level of efficiency high enough to compete in the market economy.  It was also sidetracked on a savings and credit scheme that was based on an urban model and never achieved success in small-scale rural communities. However, the project has demonstrated on a limited scale a number of approaches for developing viable group enterprises, and the recent reorientation on strengthening market linkages bodes well for future progress. As the project nears the end of the current funding period, its major challenge is to begin to gradually move away from direct facilitation of activities and develop institutional partnerships or structures that will carry proven methods beyond the PACD.  The strong focus on action research has made laudable strides in extracting lessons learned from technology demonstrations.  However, LSFP has had much less success in building the bridges with private sector and government institutions that will be needed to sustain impact.  The project acknowledges it must act in these areas, but may have to reexamine its current staffing skills and activity focus to prepare for the transition period.

"Final evaluation of a project (1/95-9/99) to strengthen financial markets and institutions in Russia through the provision of U.S. financial market expertise.  The Financial Services Volunteer Corps (FSVC) was the implementing agency. Over the course of the project, FSVC volunteers and staff  carried out 221 project activities, about 46 per year.  Activities included travel to Russia to provide seminars, workshops, and consultations (56%); U.S.-based commentaries on proposed Russian legislation or regulations (33%); and U.S. study tours for Russians (11%).  FSVC's program in Russia has focused on strengthening the functions of the Central Bank of Russia (36%), improving payment systems (25%), strengthening commercial banks (21%), and building capital markets (17%). Another key cross-cutting theme was developing the legal infrastructure of the financial system. As the program is highly demand-driven, the relative emphasis among these areas and the specific activities undertaken within each area were essentially determined on a week-to-week basis.  FSVC's New York headquarters did an excellent job of setting policy, recruiting volunteers, and providing leadership to the program.  Besides its office in Moscow, an office established in Samara in early 1999 has been critical to opening up that region to FSVC assistance. Compared with other development programs, FSVC has utilized a very large number of TA providers (228) whose typical stay in-country is short (averaging less than 5 workdays).  As a result, factors such as the clarity of assignments, matching the volunteer to the job to be done, the adequacy of volunteers'  preparation, and efforts to tie discrete assignments together become exceedingly important to the program's ability to achieve impact.  FSVC is carrying out these functions very well. The quality of volunteers provided has been outstanding. Volunteers overwhelmingly felt comfortable with their assignments, and counterparts found them well qualified.  The many Russians interviewed for this evaluation were extremely positive about FSVC assistance.  FSVC is perceived as highly responsive and fast moving, and there is widespread  appreciation for the fact that FSVC volunteers are successful practitioners. Counterparts seem to see FSVC volunteers as more independent and objective than other TA assistance providers, who are often seen (not necessarily correctly) as representing the philosophy and economic policies of a particular country or donor. As a result, FSVC enjoys a high level of credibility and has unusual access to senior decisionmakers. Because FSVC assistance is essentially demand-driven, the program has fewer clearly defined objectives and associated benchmarks to assess impacts than many USAID programs.  Reporting focuses largely on the results of its numerous discrete assignments. Nevertheless, the evaluation team's findings about continuity and impact (based on interviews rather than on reporting) were quite positive.  One the down side, FSVC needs to do a better job of systematically reporting on key program characteristics, and could improve continuity and impact by placing greater emphasis on strategic planning and by other measures identified in the report.  USAID might also increase FSVC's impact by contracting longer-term assistance to complement FSVC's shorter-term TA. FSVC's contribution to strengthening Russia's financial sector merits the continued support of USAID, other donors, and the U.S. financial community.

"Evaluates the Broadening Access and Strengthening Input Market Systems Collaborative Research Support Program (BASIS CRSP), designed to conduct collaborative research and training on ways to improve access to and the efficiency of land, water, labor, and financial markets in Africa, Eastern Europe and Eurasia, and Latin America.  Annual external evaluation covers the year 1999. Generally, the BASIS CRSP is progressing well.  Research is moving forward despite limitations in resources and host country support staff, host country disasters, and a slower than planned implementation. Evaluations of individual country programs reveal a number of strengths and accomplishments:  (1) By its 4th year of operation, the BASIS CRSP has implemented research programs in four regions, is managing add-ons totaling about $650,000 in year four, has cumulatively incorporated more that 50 organizations in BASIS- funded research programs, and has engaged researchers in a broad network of collaboration and partnership. (2) BASIS programs are employing innovative methodologies.  In El Salvador, Nicaragua, and the Horn of Africa, longitudinal surveys are tracking paths that individual households follow in and out of poverty. Research in all sites spans a wide range of ideological backgrounds and disciplines. Research in El Salvador, the Horn of Africa, and Namibia is linking data collection with Global Positioning System (GPS) coordinates that are utilizing state-of-the-art spatial analysis.  (3) BASIS programs have connected with USAID mission and regional bureaus, particularly for work on poverty in El Salvador, land reform in Zimbabwe, and food security in Ethiopia and the Horn of Africa.  The number of add-ons confirms evidence that BASIS research is demand-driven, and USAID missions have indicated vocal support for the program (e.g., a presentation to the USAID Administrator on poverty in El Salvador was based on BASIS data).  (4) BASIS programs are contributing to policymaking.  In El Salvador, the Salvadoran Foundation for Economic and Social Development (FUSADES) has presented BASIS results to economics and social cabinet ministers.  Water research in southern Africa is linking with the National Water Authority and the Water Resources Management Group in Zimbabwe and the Lake Chilwa project in Malawi.  (5) BASIS programs have enabled collaboration and strengthened the capacity of host country researchers and their counterpart organizations in Nicaragua, El Salvador, Malawi, Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Ethiopia, and the Horn of Africa. On the down side, a number of problems and constraints affect the CRSP's technical mission:  (1) The Horn of Africa and southern Africa report serious capacity constraints, including problems reporting finances and disbursing funds in Ethiopia, turnover of key personnel in southern Africa, lack of a U.S. principal investigator in the Mozambique program, and time lost when researchers are hired as consultants on other projects.  (2) Although BASIS has done a good job strengthening capacity of host country researchers through hands-on-training, workshops, conferences, and visiting scholarships to the United States, the level of formal training is relatively low, principally because of funding constraints.  There are notable exceptions -- the training of one graduate student from El Salvador at Ohio State University (OSU) and the training of young students in the water program in Mozambique -- but such efforts are not sufficient to address the capacity constraints affecting the region.  (3) While most site visits report good progress in identifying and reporting results, the articulation, measurement, and monitoring of impact indicators across program activities remains underdeveloped.  (4) The site evaluations note how the United States has economic, political, and humanitarian interests in enhancing growth and reducing poverty in Nicaragua and Southern Africa.  The site evaluations also underscore the global importance of land reform in Southern Africa, land titling in Nicaragua, and the applicability of the water research in Southern Africa for the arid areas of the U.S. west.  However, research has not documented or measured these impacts.  Overall, the factor market focus of the BASIS CRSP makes it more difficult to identify benefits to the United States as directly as under the commodity CRSPs.  (5) Finally, the crosscutting themes of gender, market integration, and risk are being addressed to varying degrees in most sites, but work is not being carried out on synthesis, and crosscutting work in certain programs (the Horn of Africa) is weak.","Project title: Broadening access and strengthening input market|systems collaborative research support program (BASIS CRSP)","Special Evaluation","Documents","LAG-A-00-96-90016-00","","5/1/2000 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural research|Economic research|Agricultural economics|Natural resources|Markets|Research collaboration|Constraints|Access to resources","El Salvador|Nicaragua|East Africa|Southern Africa|Zimbabwe|Malawi|Mozambique|Namibia|South Africa","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABS396.pdf","833 KB","001289 - University of Wisconsin at Madison.

"This study assesses the impact on the institutional capacity of PVOs and their NGO counterparts of the matching grant (MG) programs of the Private and Voluntary Cooperation Office of USAID's Bureau of Humanitarian Response (PVC/BHR/USAID), as well as of PVC special initiatives such as Global Excellence in Management (GEM), Sustainable Development Support (SDS), and Discussion-Oriented Self Assessment (DOSA). (1) In terms of institutional resources, several informants argued that staff development, especially via training, is the most important capacity-building investment for long-term impact.  But virtually no measurement or analysis of the effectiveness of these interventions is available.  Probably the most common use of PVC MG funds for capacity building is in the area of strategic planning, an emphasis that has led many PVOs to significant new departures and ways of doing things. Another common capacity-building objective of MG funds is improved information management, particularly through country or regional resource centers that offer a variety of information support to local NGOs, including web access and assistance with technology use.  While PVOs often use MG funding to develop monitoring and evaluation systems, relatively little effort has been spent tracking the impacts of capacity-building interventions.  A growing emphasis of MG recipients is helping partners generate additional financial resources, an area in which both PVOs and USAID Missions would welcome additional technical support.  It is anticipated that issues of legal structure and governance will grow in importance in the future and may be areas in which grant-supported assistance will have important value-added payoffs. (2) The link between improved organizational capacity and improved institutional performance is difficult to measure rigorously, and little attempt has been made to do so despite the common practice of monitoring.  Also, while MGs encourage the implementation and testing of new models for service delivery, there are no data to prove the link between stronger organizations and improved services.  Nonetheless, anecdotal evidence from the GEM and SDS assessments, supported by observations of the present study, indicate that organizational capacity improvements do lead to improved strategy, better- prepared staff, and in some cases expanded programs.  Ongoing assessments of two PVC-supported networks -- CORE (Child Survival organizations) and CorCom (facilitating PVO-private sector partnerships) -- cite several beneficial outcomes of these networks.  Areas where peer-to-peer networking seems most beneficial to PVOs and NGO are program coordination, sharing and documenting best practices, raising awareness of PVOs and NGOs in the wider community, and fundraising support. Another rapidly growing area of PVO/NGO programming to which MGs add value is advocacy support on behalf of local constituencies. (3) In terms of institutional sustainability, some PVOs focus on enduring and transparent systems of NGO governance, including board roles, supervisory practice, and ethics. Leadership development is a major emphasis of the GEM project and is a subset of the management development that is a part of many PVO capacity-building strategies; overall, however, this may be an underemphasized area of focus. PVC-supported tools for capacity assessment, such as the Organizational Capacity Assessment (OCA) and DOSA methods, provide valuable mechanisms for organizational learning.  PVO networks also support organizational learning and expanded information sharing.  The service center concept, not widely used by grantees but successful in the USAID DemNet program in central Europe and under consideration by some PVOs, may provide a cost-effective way to promote learning opportunities for local NGOs. The role of future PVC support for PVO/NGO capacity building and possible options for a new results package are detailed in conclusion.

"Final evaluation of a matching grant to ADRA International to develop a replicable micro-finance lending program, based on the village banking model, for small-scale, female entrepreneurs in Peru.  The evaluation covers the period 10/96-3/00 vs. a PACD of 9/00. Progress has generally been satisfactory.  The project has established an effective village banking program in urban Cuzco and peri-urban Lima.  It has also developed a financial management system and a comprehensive loan tracking and management system both in both headquarters and ADRA/Peru.  The Global Electronic Monitoring System (GEMS), an important expectation, is not fully in place, though a number of GEMS elements have been developed in ADRA's Central Office (ADRA/CO). Effective operational and training systems have been developed by both ADRA/CO and ADRA/Peru.  ADRA/CO's Economic Development Office helped ADRA/Peru develop and annually revise an operations manual for the village bank program.  The Start-Up Manual in ADRA/CO pulls together training materials used in Peru and capable of further use in launching new programs.  The Micro- finance Business Planning Guide contains the basic planning and assessment tools for use by ADRA country offices in evaluating the feasibility of micro-finance programs.  Finally, the Microfin Projection Model has been adapted from the World Bank (CGAP) model and is used currently in strategic planning in Peru.  It can be extended to other country contexts on demand. The 3-year target of 55% operational sustainability was surpassed by 10/99, when ADRA reported 56.5% coverage of its operating costs.  Since then, however, economic conditions in Peru have worsened, resulting in the closing of many banks; as of 1/00, the level of operational sustainability is 44.4%.  The aggravation of the recession in Peru is attested to by other village-banking programs and by the USAID Mission. The program's institutional sustainability was to be ensured through the creation of an autonomous financial entity, originally assumed to be an EDPYME (Entity for Small and Micro Enterprises), the only form of micro-credit institution officially chartered by the Peruvian government.  While an application for EDPYME status was made in 1998 and accepted in 1999, ADRA/Peru has not yet decided on the structure it wishes to adopt. The Peruvian model has been replicated by many ADRA country offices, though not through ADRA/CO partnerships with these offices.  ADRA/CO is seeking to extend its direct involvement in new program development through partnerships with other ADRA recipient countries.  On the other hand, through the ADRA Professional Leadership Institute (APLI), ADRA/CO has extended network training in microenterprise finance and development and institutional business planning worldwide through regional workshops in early 1999 in Costa Rica, Kenya, Peru, and Thailand; the course is also offered at Andrews University in the United States.  In addition to other state-of-art materials, the basic planning and assessment tools developed under Matching Grant IV are used in this course.  Progress in establishing the independent financial entity at ADRA headquarters seems to have been stalled early on in the grant. Capacity-building activities have led to the creation of a small but dynamic unit in ADRA/CO that is seen as a harbinger of wider organizational change.  The bottom-line rigor required by micro-finance programs is clearly recognized by other sectors.  Although it is too early to see major changes in ADRA/CO, systems thinking and the concept of self-sufficiency are now common. In creating a village banking program in Peru, ADRA/CO has had to develop training programs; adopt operational systems; design appropriate tools for financial management, loan tracking, and portfolio projection; and generate a process for strategic planning.  Most of these tools can be used or replicated in other ADRA countries.  ADRA/Peru's improved capacity to deliver a cost-effective, micro-credit program is best evaluated by examining the service delivery program itself. This is why attention must be paid during evaluation to field operations, the loan tracking system, strategic planning process and outcomes, training materials, and personnel quality.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","FAO-C-00-95-00036-00","","4/1/2000 12:00:00 AM","","Microenterprises|Commercial credit|Economic development|Women in development|Financial institutions|Banks|Project replication|Institution building|Economic self sufficiency|Microfinance|Village banks","Peru","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABS477.pdf","226 KB","006190 - AMA Technologies, Inc.","","007746 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of a program (9/99-7/00) to financially support public financing of the campaign for the 12/99 elections in Mozambique. Other donors included The Netherlands, Switzerland, and Sweden.  Taken together, contributions from the four donors nearly tripled the level of donor support for public campaign finance. The 1999 public campaign finance program in Mozambique suffered from implementation delays and, according to some, underfunding.  As a result, the Government of Mozambique's (GRM) own support of the program was at times suspect in the eyes of some close to the process, though in a country as poor as Mozambique allocations for democracy often reduce allocations to important social sectors.  In any case, once the funding was released, nearly all of it was used for legitimate campaign purposes -- contrary to what took place in 1994.  The involvement of an independent financial accounting and audit firm was key to this improvement, as were the program requirements developed by the National Elections Commission (CNE) with the support of the donors.  Given that less than 5% of the funds disbursed were not properly accounted for, the major concern expressed by USAID/Washington and some in the U.S. Congress when approving the program proved largely unfounded. While it is difficult to come to a definite conclusion, the program appears to have contributed to more competitive elections.  USAID should again finance this type of campaign finance program in Mozambique's 2004 general elections, and perhaps increase its contribution, subject to an increased allocation from the GRM budget. For future elections, the political parties should be informed early on if the formula for distributing funds is to remain unchanged.  Any amendment to the formula should be done at least 30 days prior to the start of registration of political parties in order to allow time for inter-party negotiations on the forming of coalitions.  In order to minimize costs, political parties need to know how much they will receive and when the funds will be disbursed.  Parties need to be able to plan their political campaign strategies much earlier in the process. Well before the electoral process begins, there should be a fixed budget for electoral campaign finance, and a fixed CNE formula for distributing campaign funds.  The tight timeline of the electoral calendar 1999 and the resulting lateness of funding disbursement seriously impeded the effectiveness of the program. These issues must be addressed by a permanent CNE well in advance of the 2004 elections. USAID should indicate early in the process, along with the other donors, the amount of its expected contribution to the campaign fund and other electoral costs. Conversely, any decrease in contributions to the electoral process as a whole should also be indicated early in the process. The close coordination between USAID and the three other donor countries was an extremely positive aspect of this program.  Having more than one donor finance such a fund is essential and reinforces the impartiality of all donors.  A collective agreement between USAID, other donors, and the GRM could speed up the negotiation process and thus allow the most expeditious release of campaign funds to political parties. Establishing allocation criteria and disbursement and accounting procedures, and training political parties in the application of the latter enhanced the program.  This was evident by the fact that in 1999 the campaign finance fund was not criticized by the media as was the 1994 U.N. Trust Fund.  Equally important is public accountability of how these funds are spent. Hiring an independent accounting firm was crucial to maintaining the integrity of the process and should be a permanent feature of the program.  Donors and the GRM should continue this aspect of the program in 2004. The size of Mozambique, logistical difficulties, and lack of media coverage make it difficult for political parties to reach all voters even with additional funds.  Hence, besides contributing to the electoral campaign fund, USAID should consider supporting provincial resource centers for use by political parties during the campaign.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","656-0227-O-00-0085-00","","7/1/2000 12:00:00 AM","","Democratization|Nonproject assistance|Cash transfers|Political parties|Elections|Public finance|Host country cooperation|Development organizations|Donor coordination|Distribution|Political campaigns","Mozambique","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABS493.pdf","64 KB","006564 - Deloitte and Touche","","008580 - USAID.

"USAID's Industrial Environmental Management Project (IEMP) in the Philippines (1992-97) worked with the government and private sector to introduce waste minimization and pollution prevention to small and medium-size industrial firms outside Metro Manila.  IEMP results and impact are documented in this report. A central feature of IEMP was the pollution management appraisal (PMA), a simple assessment of ways to reduce industrial pollution through low- or no-cost techniques and equipment that could both increase production and reduce waste and emissions.  PMAs were done for 143 companies, which invested a combined total of $27 million to implement PMA recommendations. This resulted in annual net benefits of $33 million and an average decrease of 29% in water pollution, confirming that industry-led economic growth can be compatible with environmental protection in the Philippines.  However, few firms have sustained IEMP benefits, the PMA process has not been institutionalized, and the PMA process has not been replicated. Lessons learned are as follows:  (1) PMAs can effectively reduce pollution at the company level and are likely to have greater credibility with senior personnel if conducted by specialists rather than generalists.  It is more cost-efficient to conduct PMAs industry by industry so that industry-specific expertise can be provided all at one time.  PMA recommendations, including what can and cannot be achieved, must be explained carefully to company managers.  PMAs are not a panacea, nor can they guarantee compliance with environmental standards. (2) Companies are likely to adopt low-cost techniques that have an immediate effect on pollution reduction and cost savings rather than measures  requiring a large capital outlay and a long payback period. (3)  Companies are also motivated to implement and maintain waste-minimization and pollution-prevention programs by command-and-control measures, such as environmental regulations and pollution standards, provided the measures are strictly enforced and the penalties are severe.  Often this is not the case in the Philippines due to insufficient resources in the Department of Environment and Natural Resources; cease-and- desist orders are issued only for the most egregious offenses, and penalties and fines are relatively low.  (4) Also effective are market-based instruments, which use economic incentives to influence a company's behavior by encouraging the company to act in its own self-interest.  For example, imposing pollution charges on companies that discharge effluents into the environment effectively internalizes the costs of their pollution.  IEMP concentrated on market-based instruments. (5) A way must be found to institutionalize the PMA process in order to provide continuity once the project ends, perhaps by working more closely with trade associations, a government agency, or private companies that have a financial in- terest in waste minimization.  (6) While a pilot project can demonstrate the benefits of waste minimization, sustainability must be assured.  IEMP assumed that waste-minimization tech- niques, once adopted, would generate substantial benefits and that companies would sustain these techniques over time.  That was not always the case.  Some companies may not have obtained the financial benefits estimated in the PMA; this jeopardized the credibility of the overall process.  Others faced shutdown orders for violating environmental standards shortly after participating in IEMP.  Additional problems include lack of follow-up to PMAs and, possibly, lack of commitment to waste minimization by senior company management.  Sustainability seems to take root most often in large international companies, where corporate image counts and managers reinforce the goal of cleaner production and pollution prevention. Constant support and vigilance from top company management may be the key to sustainability.  (7) Replication of pollution-prevention measures is normally not in the best interests of businesses that have already reduced costs by adopting such measures.  (8) Data collection is essential to establish a baseline against which to monitor progress and measure results.  Data, however, must be collected on appropriate indicators.  An important goal of IEMP was to improve human health by reducing water pollution.  But the pollutant that was measured, biochemical oxygen demand, does not directly affect human health.","Editorial and production services provided by Conwal, Inc.","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","9/1/2000 12:00:00 AM","","Environmental management|Pollution control|Waste disposal|Industrial wastes|Small scale enterprises|Medium scale enterprises|Industrial technology|Technology assessment|Water pollution|Economic benefit|Technology adoption|Financial incentives|Market economy|Project sustainability|Data collection|Performance indicators|Top level managers","Philippines","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNACG611.pdf","154 KB","008058 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of the  Quality Assurance Program (QAP), aimed at improving the quality of health care, in Zambia (1993-98). The amount and quality of QAP's work is impressive.  In only 5 years, a small team of senior staff built a QA structure and capacity throughout the country, generated enthusiasm for QA, and initiated teamwork on quality of care issues by health providers. However, there is no official document describing Zambia's QAP, and despite attempts to establish links with other entities, QAP remains isolated in its efforts to introduce a QA methodology. Developing the ""Integrated Technical Guidelines for Frontline Health Workers"" (ITG) was an excellent initiative, but did not result in anticipated gains.  Neither QAP nor health providers were formally involved in its development.  The QAP approach to setting standards consisted of training about 300 staff to use the Dynamic Standard Setting System (DySSSy).  Those trained said it helped them develop their district or health center action plans, but the impact of the training on quality remains undocumented.  The ITG communication strategy suffered major delays, and very few health workers know it exists. The district staff usually consider its format not user-friendly and its content overly complicated for some.  Health workers are unlikely to use existing guidelines during a consultation.  The extent to which they would use any kind of job aid is unclear. In Zambia, no formal instrument is used to directly observe health worker performance, nor is there is a formal strategy to differentiate causes of poor performance; hence, supervisors cannot distinguish whether problems are caused by incompetency or something else. In-service training may be seen as a solution when a lack of knowledge and skills is not the actual cause of poor performance.  Good quality is not formally recognized and rewarded, but health staff would be receptive to a formal system for doing so. Of 127 health centers, 26 had active QA (or ""problem-solving"") teams. The main reasons why teams do not form seem to be the small number of staff at a health center, the lack of regular visits by the coach, and the absence of a QA-trained officer in charge.  Key reasons why some teams do not successfully complete a first problem-solving cycle are the complexity of the problem and failure to follow the steps of the cycle. The relevance and importance of the problems chosen varied. Waiting times was often chosen, partly because it was an example used in training.  About half the teams chose physical and facilities problems, and about 40% chose clinical problems important for the health of patients or community (e.g., malaria, late antenatal booking).  About 5% of problems were identified by soliciting user views or by input from neighborhood health committees.  In general, specific features of the problem-solving process, such as problem prioritizing and cause-and- effect diagrams, were used correctly.  The use of methods for listing data sources and for gathering and interpreting data could have been better, and about 70% of teams could not show or describe any data collected.  Many teams had problems implementing solutions, usually because of resource restraints. The results of the teams' work were assessed through measurable changes documented or reported.  Five of the 26 active teams achieved measurable changes in quality, and eight others reported doing so, a claim in some cases confirmed by the evaluation.   Also evaluated in the report are national support systems for QAP, specifically, QA training, the QA coaches/link facilitators network, documentation and reporting of QA activities, and supervision of QA activities. Important general findings include the following:  (1) Support systems, such as coaching and QA training capacity, must be well established at the district level to ensure the continuity of the teams. (2) In a decentralized system, the QA program should first target the districts in order to promote team ownership for QA activities.  (3) Numerous factors influence the productivity of the problem-solving teams.  The tools developed for this evaluation (difficulty index and team failure index) proved useful.  (4) A detailed documentation system of the QA program could help in monitoring the QAP's impact and in making adaptations.","Project title: Quality assurance project II (QAP II)|Related document: PD-ABT-604","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","HRN-C-00-96-90013-00|DPE-5992-C-00-6013-00|HRN-5992-C-00-6013-00","","1/1/2000 12:00:00 AM","","Health delivery|Quality control|Teamwork|Human capacity development|Problem solving|Performance measurement|Evaluation methodology|Districts|Supervision|Information management|Health care administration|Impact assessment|Constraints|Professional standards|Quality of care","Zambia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABS604.pdf","480 KB","004486 - University Research Corp.

"Final evaluation of the joint Quality Assurance/Basic Support for Institutionalizing Child Survival (QAP/BASICS) project in Niger (1993-98). The 1997 merger of QAP and BASICS in Niger led to a new and important way of implementing integrated management of childhood illness (IMCI), one that starts by bolstering IMCI support systems rather than with IMCI training.  It also succeeded in bringing many improvements to the health care system in the target areas. Key findings are as follows:  (1) The joint project achieved over 90% of its objectives and in some cases exceeded expectations.  (2) The merger of QAP and BASICS reduced costs and led to benefits on the local, regional, national, and international levels by applying QA measures to support the introduction of IMCI.  (3) The QAP/BASICS project has trained 400 health workers in quality assurance skills.  At the time of the evaluation, over 77 quality improvement teams had formed and had worked on about 120 problem-solving cycles in areas such as prenatal care, family planning, immunization coverage, and nutritional rehabilitation.  (4) The project introduced a number of management tools that contribute to the support of IMCI.  The new management framework used by health care workers and their managers provides indicators and a new management environment for health organizations by allowing health workers to change their behavior and improve their performance.  Staff motivation and interest increased through team activities and the task follow-up process. (5) QAP/BASICS revived the supervisory system and created trained supervisory teams who can provide technical support to health facility staff.  The concept of coaching facilitated the transformation of supervision from an authoritarian style to a supportive, problemsolving approach. (6) The project introduced a number of tools that contributed to IMCI's introduction.  The use of the Rapid Performance Assessment of Health Workers (ERPA) tool proved valuable not only in monitoring health workers' performance, but also in improving it through the timely feedback of IMCI compliance data.  Also, the integrated supervision checklist is a helpful, comprehensive tool, albeit too long.  (7) The problemsolving tool elevated the health providers' ability to identify and solve problems in health service delivery.  However, this tool cannot detect defects in clinical skills, which must be addressed through supervision.  The project has also had a great impact in improving the staff's ability to collect, analyze, and use data at the health facility and district levels.  (8) Improved stockkeeping of essential generic drugs, combined with cost recovery, resulted in lower cost, more reliably available essential generic drugs (MEG), which stimulated the continuity of care and activity integration. The main factors limiting QA were:  personnel mobility and motivation; old refrigerators, maintenance problems, gas shortages, and an unreliable car/motorbike pool; inaccurate or out-of-date demographic data; the dispersed nature of the population; lack of uniform clinical standards; unmet salary payments; and time spent away from the center to attend training sessions. Overall, the project enabled Niger to take a leadership role in introducing IMCI in the West African region. Individuals from many West African countries have participated in IMCI training in Niger, and Niger's experience in QA and IMCI was presented at a number of regional conferences and meetings. Considering the large number of trained agents and trainers, prepared materials, existing documentation, and the success of the international conference in Niamey in 10/98, the project's replication in Francophone Africa should be rapid and could spread to other continents.  The launch of the supervision system and the efficient use of the supervision check-list, ERPA management and analysis, and the coaching methods were important experiments that have been field tested and should benefit other QA projects in Latin America and Asia.  Includes lessons learned.","Project title: Quality assurance project II (QAP II)|Project title: Basic support for institutionalizing child survival|(BASICS)|Related summary: PD-ABS-901","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","HRN-C-00-96-90013-00|HRN-6006-C-00-3031-00|DPE-5992-A-00-0050-00|HRN-C-00-93-00031-00|HRN-5992-C-00-6013-00","","1/1/2000 12:00:00 AM","","Health delivery|Child survival activities|Child health care|Health care administration|Management development|Health care costs|Health professional education|Management education|Problem solving|Supervision|Teamwork|Information dissemination|Information management|Pharmaceuticals|Inventories|Project replication|Constraints|Quality of care","Niger","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABS605.pdf","414 KB","004486 - University Research Corp.

"Final evaluation of a CARE child survival project (9/96-9/00) to improve maternal and child health in the districts of Malema, Mecuburi, and Ribaue in Nampula Province, Mozambique. The project employed a two-pronged strategy based on qualitative and quantitative research:  (1) improving service delivery within the formal health care system by training health center and rural health post staff, as well as non-formal personnel -- community health workers (CHWs) and traditional birth attendants (TBAs); and (2) empowering communities and households to assess and attend to their own health status. Achievements were numerous.  The project:  (1) trained 91 TBAs and equipped them with birthing kits; (2) trained 67 Ministry of Health (MOH) staff and 46 CHWs in sequential management of childhood illnesses; (3) provided refresher training and equipment to 57 CHWs; (4) established a supervision system to monitor technical competencies of health facility personnel as well as of CHWs and TBAs; (5) provided structural and material support to rehabilitate the health centers and posts as well as basic obstetric equipment; (6) trained 51 community councils (637 individuals) to deliver key health messages employing a comprehensive information, education, and communication (IEC) strategy; (7) established a community referral system to identify early danger signs of childhood illness and pregnancy; (8) promoted and sold mosquito nets; (9) developed an emergency transport system, including SOS alert flags, bicycle ambulances, and plans for medical emergencies; and (10) organized two mobile theater groups to transmit messages. An 8/00 knowledge, practice, and coverage (KPC) survey showed that the project achieved positive behavior changes in all four intervention areas:  case management of diarrhea, malaria, and acute respiratory infections, and maternal health. In the latter area, increases were seen in the number of mothers who sought prenatal care, possessed a maternal health card, and received two tetanus shots, as well as in the percentage of pregnant women receiving iron supplements and the number of births attended by a TBA or nurse-midwife.  In addition, more pregnant women in project communities reported having a birth plan and having purchased a new razor blade for severing the umbilical cord.  The radio projects and education by council members mobilized villagers to improve their access to transport for health-related emergencies.  Even people from non-project communities benefitted from the radio projects sponsored by the project.  The project also motivated health personnel to gain more knowledge and apply that knowledge in their work.  Twenty- two health posts that received equipment and materials enhanced their capacity to serve their clientele. In sum, the project made major strides toward meeting its objectives, despite a lag in community-level achievement during the first 2 years. An opportunity to continue the project's accelerated efforts could bring greater benefits to project communities.  A variety of factors, related to health infrastructure, the socioeconomic and political environment in Mozambique, and the level of MOH cooperation and difficulties at the project management level, influenced the attainment of project objectives.  Given more time, the project could have overcome more of these challenges.  Sustainability of behavior change improvements depends largely on the continued application of knowledge and skills acquired by the health personnel and community members.  The cooperation of the MOH could greatly enhance efforts to sustain the project's benefits by providing reinforcement. The report details numerous lessons learned regarding achievement of objectives, community mobilization, communication for behavior change, capacity building of partners, and management.  These lessons, especially those in the area of management, serve as recommendations to USAID.  Additionally, USAID should not underestimate the importance of building a solid foundation for cooperation with the host government before projects are designed.  Efforts to convince the host government of the project's value only at the implementation stage are often unsuccessful.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","FAO-A-00-96-90040-00|FAO-0500-A-00-6040-00","","10/1/2000 12:00:00 AM","","Child survival activities|Maternal child health care|Health delivery|Health professional education|Paramedical education|Health education|IEC|KAP surveys|Health care coverage|Behavior change|Community based delivery|Community participation","Mozambique","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABS640.pdf","219 KB","","","","English","application/pdf","Final evaluation|Health referrals","","Wijesinghe, Sunny","Maternal child health care","Oct 2000","","","","CARE-Mozambique : final evaluation -- child survival XII : improving maternal and child health in rural communities of Nampula Province : September 30, 1996 to September 30, 2000 -- FAO-A-00-96-90040-00","","PD-ABS-640","https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MjU4NzAx","Mozambique","9380500"
"This study examines USAID activities to help create or strengthen capital markets in developing countries, specifically India, Kenya, Morocco, the Philippines, and Romania. An earlier USAID effort to create investment banks in Central America in the 1960s is also reviewed. First, USAID has been successful in promoting capital market development.  The general approach promoted by USAID -- emphasizing the strengthening of government regulatory institutions -- is sound, and USAID has been able to contract capable expertise to carry out such projects.  Second, an efficient capital market is an important ingredient of a successful development strategy.  Though the effects of strengthening capital markets on the poorer strata of society are indirect and long-term, they also have important consequences in generating increased investment and creating more productive employment. Moreover, the failure to provide strong oversight of capital markets, evident in the Asian financial crisis of 1997- 98, also can have severe adverse consequences for poor people. Specific lessons learned from the study include the following: (1) Effective capital market development should not be left to the private sector.  Government oversight is needed to prevent market intermediaries from maintaining monopolistic arrangements that lead to high transactions costs, to an atmosphere permissive of self-dealing and rigged transactions, and to insufficient flow of information to potential investors. (2) Donor support should aim primarily at strengthening this governmental regulatory framework.  Payoffs to such support are likely to be much higher than direct support of individual enterprises or investment houses.  (3) Capital market projects are unlikely to stimulate economic growth where economic conditions are unfavorable.  Inflation, large government budget deficits, and uncertainty about the path of future government policies all deter investment.  Capital market reforms will not produce growth in a stagnant economy.  Rather, such projects are best suited to rapidly growing economies where existing capital structures are limiting investment, and where firms are actively interested in additional financing.  (4) In the longer term, creation of long-term debt markets is essential to reduce the risk of financial crises, such as recently occurred in Asia. That will require improvements in government policy to eliminate inflationary expectations and reduce crowding out by government.

"Final evaluation of a matching grant (MG) (1996-00) to the International Institute for Rural Reconstruction (IIRR) to:  (1) strengthen the capacity of IIRR's NGO and other partners to implement participatory, people-centered local development programs; and (2) increase the institutional and service capacity of IIRR's regional centers (RCs).  Emphasis countries included Ethiopia, Bangladesh, and Nepal, and Ecuador. With regard to MG objective 1, IIRR strengthened the capacity of a greatly increased number of NGOs and other localized partners to implement development activities. Strengthening was achieved via:  (1) IIRR publications, whose numbers, local-language versions, subject matters, and dissemination modes all increased immensely during the MG; (2) IIRR delivery of many kinds of high-quality training, follow-up, and TA assistance, including writeshops (a participatory publication methodology) and conferences, all of which increased significantly during the MG; and (3) IIRR collaboration with NGOs and other partners in field projects, the rural beneficiaries of which also increased. IIRR strengthening of the service capacity of its own RCs, MG objective 2, focused on RCs' ability to deliver and sustain services to partners, undertake process documentation, promote inter-institutional learning and networking, and perform impact evaluations.  Thanks almost solely to MG inputs, IIRR made tremendous progress toward strengthening its AFR and LAC Centers on all these fronts except impact evaluation. In addition to greatly increasing their publications and other best-practices documentation, AFR and LAC increased the number of their partners manyfold and their inter-institutional learning and networking. AFR and LAC also made substantial strides toward self- sustainability. Progress by the ASI Center is difficult to determine due to the conflation of ASI activities, budget, and management with that of IIRR headquarters.  Sustainability at all three centers is still questionable in terms of staff skills and manpower, especially in the area of regional leadership. On the implicit objective 3 of building IIRR capacities as a whole, significant progress was made in virtually all programmatic realms, as well as in global partnerships, financial information and reporting systems, governance, and information technology.  However, headquarters experienced considerable difficulties in managing finances in relation to the Institute's overarching programmatic goals and also in decentralizing decisionmaking authority to the regions. All RCs plus headquarters fell short in conducting impact assessments and, except for training process data, in monitoring and evaluating.  It is thus impossible to provide a definitive or quantitative evaluation of IIRR's progress toward MG objectives, or a comprehensive evaluation of its development programs.

"In 1991 USAID launched the Environmental Pollution Prevention Project (EP3), designed to reduce industrial pollution by introducing cleaner industrial production processes and by reducing and reclaiming industrial waste while saving money for industrial firms.  This report evaluates the EP3 program in Chile, the first country in which the program was implemented. The evaluation found a number of achievements.  For example, nearly 2,500 people received training in industrial pollution prevention, and a cadre of private sector pollution engineering consultants were created. EP3 completed 26 pollution prevention diagnostic assessments (PPDAs) at individual factories.  The PPDAs showed it was possible to save money while reducing pollution.  The assessment recommendations required a one-time investment of $1.4 million by the industrial firms, but that investment generated annual savings of $1.9 million. Savings continued every year for many of the companies.  Pollution was reduced by 32%. The evaluation also found several problems.  The project failed to institutionalize its efforts, so once USAID funding ended, both sustainability and replication lapsed.  The project also faltered because Chile lacked effective environmental regulations.  Without the pressure of environmental fines, many companies were reluctant to invest in pollution prevention. The following lessons were learned:  (1) A pilot effort is an excellent way to experiment and test ideas and methods, but should include a plan to scale up, disseminate, and sustain successful approaches to ensure that benefits continue after USAID assistance ends. EP3 in Chile lacked such an institutional arrangement.  (2) EP3 helped companies reduce pollution, increase profits, and improve their competitive position.  But participating firms were reluctant to share the newly learned techniques with competitors.  Replication will not take place if it reveals trade secrets.  A program needs to develop ways to replicate generic pollution prevention approaches.  (3) Pollution prevention efforts stand a better chance of success if they identify and work with the more progressive and better managed firms.  Good factory managers understand costs, product development, and marketing. (4) It is important to be ahead of the wave, but if a pollution prevention program is too far ahead of a country's environmental consciousness, benefits will be limited.  If pollution laws are not in place, a pollution prevention program may need to help a country develop environmental policies and regulations before it undertakes to persuade industry to adopt pollution prevention measures.  (5) Cost savings alone may be insufficient to induce companies to adopt waste minimization and pollution prevention programs.  While both the carrot (cost savings) and stick (regulations) are important in motivating companies to take action, regulations and fines clearly command the attention of factory managers and create demand for pollution prevention measures.  (6) A program cannot hope to reach all firms directly, but needs an intermediary to spread the message.  A demonstration project cannot hope to succeed with a retail approach, i.e., dealing with one firm at a time.  Impact will be greatest when an institutional structure (such as an industrial trade association or a clean-production center) exists to disseminate pollution prevention findings throughout an industry.","Related document: PN-ACG-618|Editorial and production services provided by Conwal, Inc.","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","12/1/2000 12:00:00 AM","","Pollution control|Industrial processes|Industrial wastes|Waste recycling|Environmental technologies|Technical training|Technology assessment|Cost control|Investment|Pilot projects|Case studies|Project sustainability|Project replication|Environmental legislation|Economic impact|Management operations|Health aspects","Chile","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNACG619.pdf","88 KB","008058 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of a matching grant to Salvation Army World Service (SAWSO) to increase the capacity of NGOs in Indonesia, Bangladesh, and Zambia to develop, implement, monitor and evaluate sustainable community-based health programs. Health impacts were generally high relative to targets, which were sometimes ambitious, especially in the Asian countries.  Observation and discussions with villagers and health workers indicate enormous changes in awareness and positive health-seeking behaviors over the last decade in all participating communities.  Less impressive results relate primarily to instances where government assumed responsibility for certain interventions (e.g., immunization).  Except in Bangladesh, government vitamin A capsule campaigns pre-empted behavior change nutrition campaigns planned by the project. Impacts on health status can be linked to the community volunteer/community worker program, and the extent to which the cadres were well trained, motivated, and supervised. Outcomes for Zambia are particularly impressive, given downturns in the economic situation and the impact of the AIDS epidemic in the target communities. Despite the matching grant's emphasis on sustainability, the program lacked an integrated plan for sustainability and capacity building. Each country program did make progress on each of these dimensions, taking steps to reduce costs, raise fees for services, and engage with communities to foster local ownership.  Nonetheless, efforts to address sustainability were by and large random, and remain uninformed by a broader Salvation Army or SAWSO framework, a coherent plan, targeted TA, or reference to the literature.  SAWSO's vertical approach to program support and implementation precluded potential sharing and synergies across countries. Lessons learned and innovations at the country level in management information system (MIS) development, volunteer training and support, and insurance schemes remain undocumented, though some interesting outcomes appear to merit further investigation.  Zambia has made progress in the design of an MIS system that integrates hospital, clinic, and outreach components and provides usable information to decisionmakers at all levels. Although not an explicit grant objective, gender was not addressed in the design or implementation of the program or country projects.  More needs to be done to redress the staff profile, volunteer and supervisor recruitment, and design limitations that may be inhibiting optimal achievement of health program objectives based on lack of attention to gender. Organizational issues internal to the Salvation Army's structure have given rise to some important findings related to the locus and nature of decisionmaking, links between traditional hospital structures and community outreach, and the relationship between the Army's evangelical and development missions in operational terms.  The relative autonomy that country or multi-country Territorial Headquarters (THQs) enjoy in determining policy and projects means that innovation and change is uneven in the organization.  Mechanisms for sharing information and learning between THQs (and at times between projects and THQs, when they are geographically distant) are similarly undeveloped.  The absence of a performance appraisal system at international or local levels, coupled with the fact that contracted development professionals report to Salvation Army Officers of varying backgrounds and responsibilities, limits the extent to which professionals work within a clearly defined performance or promotion system.  SAWSO has adopted a lower profile in assertively promoting change, at least at the country level, than it thinks, or what, arguably, might be optimal. Includes overall and country-specific recommendations.

"This evaluation assesses the effectiveness of U.S. humanitarian assistance in nations afflicted by complex emergencies.  It addresses three principal questions:  Did U.S. emergency assistance save lives and alleviate suffering?  Did it affect social tensions and political hostilities?  Did it contribute to long-term economic development? The findings are based on field work in Haiti, Mozambique, and Rwanda and on evaluation results in other countries. The assessment concluded that emergency assistance programs funded by USAID and implemented by U.S. NGOs clearly helped save lives and alleviate suffering. Except for Haiti, however, data collection and monitoring were not done (or were done poorly), so it is difficult to quantify results.  In fact, most evaluations of humanitarian assistance tell a ""mission accomplished"" story but are unable to substantiate that story with hard data. Distributing relief supplies was a problem to some extent in all three countries.  Food aid, in particular, was highly valued and became a source of violent competition -- not only for its value as food but also as a source of political power for those controlling access.  There were reports of corruption, theft, and political or personal favoritism in food aid distribution.  And target populations did not always receive timely and sufficient food.  NGOs addressed these problems with varying degrees of success.  In Haiti they were highly successful in limiting diversion to 5-10%.  In Mozambique, leakage was typically 30% when the government was in charge of distribution, and at one point reached 50%. But after the NGOs took over, losses fell to under 5%.  In Rwanda, the military and former political leaders controlled much of the relief distribution and were able to divert substantial quantities of food (more than is usually the case in complex emergencies) from the intended beneficiaries for their own purposes. Since it is provided in the context of conflict, humanitarian assistance can result in unpredictable and substantial political effects.  Though designed to relieve suffering and promote peace, humanitarian assistance can inadvertently fuel, sustain, or worsen complex emergencies by increasing the resources available to warring parties.  In Haiti, massive quantities of emergency food aid reduced the probability of food riots during a period of political and economic stress and may have had a dampening effect on political tensions; but it also may have contributed to a political status quo that enabled the de facto military regime to stay in power longer.  In Mozambique, external military assistance provided by the Soviet Union and South Africa fueled the civil war; food aid, by comparison, had relatively little effect on the country's political dynamics, although food diverted to soldiers may have contributed to the war effort.  In Rwanda, genocidal killers were mixed with legitimate refugees in camps; targeting became problematic, and substantial quantities of food aid were diverted by Hutu extremists and militia resident in the camps.  That had the unintended effect of prolonging the conflict. The notion that relief assistance can be made more development-oriented in the context of ongoing armed conflicts is problematic.  Unlike natural disasters, complex emergencies provide no institutional framework to provide physical security and political stability -- both of which are preconditions for economic development. On the contrary, complex emergencies are often characterized by a total breakdown of state institutions and social and economic structures. Nonetheless, emergency assistance programs can help shape the pattern and direction of subsequent economic development.  In all three countries, USAID and the NGOs not only provided immediate relief (food, medicine), but also agricultural inputs (seed, tools) and household goods to encourage refugees and internally displaced persons to return to their villages, resume food production, decrease their dependence on food aid, and maintain their livelihoods.  They also implemented food-for-work and other programs that created short-term jobs and helped rehabilitate productive infrastructure (roads, irrigation) needed for economic development.  The development objectives were clear:  to restart subsistence agriculture and the rural economy. The assessment offers 4 management recommendations and 18 recommendations specific to the Kosovo crisis as of May 1999.

"This document assesses relief and recovery assistance provided to Honduras and Nicaragua in the wake of Hurricane Mitch by USAID's Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance (BHR) through the Offices of Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA), Food for Peace/Emergency Response (FFP/ER), and Transition Initiatives (OTI). Overall, the contribution of OFDA, FFP, and OTI to relief and transition programs in Central America was timely and appropriate. Visits by the President and other high-level U.S. Government officials and the approval by Congress of $700 million in supplemental funds demonstrated unprecedented support for the region and gained considerable prestige for the U.S. humanitarian program.  High-level host government officials, interviewed for this assessment, expressed their gratitude for the official U.S. response as well as for the outpouring of contributions from the American public. The combined effort of OFDA and U.S. military aircraft resulted in saving lives and alleviating suffering of thousands of victims of the hurricane.  Search and rescue, health, water, and sanitation interventions all directly contributed to the health and welfare of people in the region. The fact that there were no major disease outbreaks is evidence of the effectiveness of preventive health measures and swift action to restore water and sanitation to affected areas. OFDA resources were critical at a time when other USAID, other donor, and host government resources were not readily available to avert major health problems from massive environmental devastation and dislocation of people. The OFDA/OTI investment in shelter in Honduras directly affects the lives of some 30,000 people in Tegucigalpa and the thousands of others who were provided shelter throughout the country.  These were economically marginal groups who had been living in unsafe, unhealthy conditions.  The OTI Exit Program provides an economic ladder to higher status and improved living conditions for groups whose instability would have created fertile territory for civil turmoil. Selected data from PVO Title II grantees show that nutritional status among children improved dramatically in some areas during the emergency food program.  Whether this trend is long term, or solely the result of increased availability of food, is not known.  Food not only served the basic needs of the family but was also an income supplement for those whose economic activities had been disrupted.  Beneficiaries identified Food for Work (FFW) programs as critical in refocusing their energies away from the tragedy and toward rebuilding.  For the most part, FFW programs began months before supplemental funds were available, thereby filling a critical need for material and financial support at a time when resources other than food were not readily available. In terms of institutional strengthening, relief activities began a process that will have an impact far beyond the relief period.  In both countries, host government institutions charged with disaster response were sidelined for lack of management capability.  One year later, with OFDA and other assistance, Honduras's Permanent Commission for Contingencies (COPECO) is a re-engineered institution with more budget resources, staff, equipment, office space, and communication capability. Perhaps more importantly, Honduras' view of the role of COPECO and the need for a strong institution has changed dramatically.  Likewise, in Nicaragua, several steps have been taken to bring disaster mitigation to the fore as a priority policy issue. Includes recommendations for BHR, OFDA, FFP, and OTI.

"Final evaluation of a project (6-9/00) to reduce vulnerability to water shortages due to drought in Rajasthan, India, by rehabilitating and constructing rainwater harvesting (RWH) structures.  CARE was the implementing agency. The project was successfully implemented in all six blocks of Pali and Jodhpur districts, benefitting more than the targeted 150 villages. While it impossible to say that the RWH structures constructed under the project led to increased water availability in the project areas, as there were no rains after the project, the structures would be extremely useful for harvesting rainwater in the future.  On the economic level, the benefitted community used the wages generated through the cash-for-work component to purchase foodstuffs and fodder, repay loans, and engage in other survival-related activities.  Here too the project met its objectives. Full transparency was maintained at all levels.  CARE kept the NGO partners aware of project details, and the latter did the same vis-a-vis the community.  In particular, the concepts of cash- for-work and payment according to work measurement were clarified to the community; site and activity selection were carried out openly and in consultation with the community; and wages were paid in the presence of CARE, NGO officials, and the entire village community. The project was also well coordinated.  CARE sought technical and research information from the Central Arid Zone Research Institute (CAZRI) of Jodhpur, the State Remote Sensing Application Center (SRSAC) of Jodhpur, and the Government of Rajasthan's Department of Watershed and Soil Conservation.  The collectors of Pali and Jodhpur were also kept informed of the project progress. The staff engaged by CARE and its partner NGOs for the project was well qualified and adequate.  The technical consultants hired by CARE compensated for the lack of technical competency among the NGO staff, though the latter's rapport with the community aided in achieving project objectives.  More CARE officers could have been deployed in Jodhpur District, given the vast spread of the project area.  The vast spread of project sites in Jodhpur also made the 4.6% administrative budget seem insufficient, as a large proportion of this money was spent in visiting and monitoring the scattered sites.  In Pali, on the other hand, all the sites were located within a 75 km radius, making monitoring easier and the administrative budget for the NGOs sufficient. In terms of impact, the project stalled migration in the short term by providing timely employment opportunities in Pali and Jodhpur.  In one of the villages visited by the evaluation team, Lapi of Pali District, only 30% of households migrated to Gujarat and Mumbai in search of labor; the normal migration rate in such drought conditions is 70%.  The project is also expected to have an indirect positive impact on agriculture in the area by recharging the ground water via the dug wells situated downstream.  Villagers are confident that in normal rain years project structures would hold water for at least 8 months.  One structure is expected to recharge about 15-20 wells.  Also, a portion of the cash earned has been used to purchase seeds or repay old agricultural loans. The most immediate impact of the project has been on community mobilization.  Local leadership was effectively used during the cash-for-work component to mobilize and organize the local community for labor.  People took up work not merely for cash but also with an understanding of the long-term importance of RWH.  Panchayats in Pali District also rose to the occasion and their members guided, supervised, and monitored project progress at the village level. The project has shown that building water harvesting structures as part of relief projects would help meet the twin objectives of short-term cash generation and long-term water resource management. Also, the efficiency with which the entire project was implemented has created a model for future relief programs.  In its present form, the project can be replicated at other sites.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","386-G-00-00-00103-00","","1/1/2000 12:00:00 AM","","Disaster relief|Water supply|Drought|Water supply structures|Water catchment|Rain water|Private voluntary organizations|Indigenous private voluntary organizations|Community participation|Employment|Income generation","India","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABS790.pdf","41 KB","010577 - ARAVALI","","008557 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of a child survival project (10/96- 9/00) implemented by Project HOPE in the health networks of El Dorado, Lamas, and San Martin in Peru's Huallaga Valley.  The project included four intervention areas -- nutrition and micronutrients, breastfeeding, control of diarrheal disease, and family planning -- and focused on community organization, training and supervision of community health volunteers (CHVs), training and motivation of Ministry of Health (MINSA) field staff, and community education. It is difficult to appreciate the impact of the project, partly because the indicators do not reflect what the project has accomplished in the last 4 years.  Only three of the 13 objectives were actually met during the period, due in part to an overly ambitious proposal and the failure to consider factors outside the scope of the project.  The project has shown positive impact in two important areas: women who exclusively breastfeed until 6 months and stunting in children.  Other improvements include frequency of growth monitoring, initiation of breastfeeding, and use of family planning methods. Major achievements include: development of a very effective educational methodology; encouragement of the value of local foods -- not donated or processed foods; improved quality of nutritional surveillance; development of formula for fortified foods; studies that have allowed focused messages, better understanding of complex disease states, and improved information for use by MINSA officials; and development of leadership skills and greater solidarity in women. Several major problems still need to be addressed:  the information system is not fully functioning; supervision and monitoring is weak at all levels; and collaboration and communication with MINSA needs to be further improved.  It is also necessary to define the needs for capacity building and institutional strengthening and to further strengthen community structures. Key lessons learned were as follows:  (1) Activities that respect and value the local culture have the greatest impact.  (2) For adequate implementation, the project should involve all partners (MINSA, HOPE, communities) from the beginning.  (3) Continuous follow-up and support are needed to develop new abilities.  (4) The greatest impact in changing practices comes with clear, simple messages, based on previous study.  (5) Take advantage of the felt need of women to meet in their own group, according to their own vision.  (6) To decrease the prevalence of diarrheal disease, it is necessary to improve sanitation conditions through coordination with other organizations.  (7) A project cannot advance without the support of local authorities.  (8) The use of checklists clarifies expectations and defines what elements are essential.  (9) Other members of the community need to be trained to create an environment of change. The original 4-year project has been awarded a 3- year extension to continue working in the same 162 communities. Major changes will be to combat malaria and respiratory infections and improve collaboration with MINSA via transfer of responsibilities, training and supervision, and institutional strengthening.

"Evaluates the integrated management of childhood illness (IMCI) project in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC). The project is being implemented by the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) and the Basic Support for Institutionalizing Child Survival Project (BASICS).  Midterm evaluation covers the period 3/97-5/00. All three direct partners in the project -- USAID/LAC, PAHO, and BASICS -- can be proud of their accomplishments.  The LAC region is serving as the test case for many aspects of IMCI, and in just 3 years the results obtained are substantial.  On a policy level, the ability to garner the political commitment at the highest levels of the Ministry of Health (MOH) has been critical to the effective launching of IMCI in Latin America.  On a personal level, the dedication, enthusiasm, and optimism of MOH and NGO staff, promoters, and mothers interviewed are proof that IMCI's success will ultimately be decided by individual willingness to change behavior.  The evidence obtained during this evaluation is that IMCI can be successfully implemented and managed. More specific achievements are as follows:  (1) Seven out of eight countries chosen for the project have adopted the IMCI strategy.  (2) IMCI has been incorporated into the MOH's operational plans in Honduras and Peru and into the MOH's Seguro Basico de Salud in Bolivia.  (3) The IMCI message has been conveyed undiluted and undistorted to different audiences at different levels. (4) Although in-country training is not part of the regional initiative, its quality is related to the quality of the training manuals and the expertise of the trainers.  Over 8,000 people have been trained with manuals adapted from generic materials through the use of regional funds.  Those interviewed had good knowledge of IMCI and an integral vision of children's health.  As a result, there has been better counseling of mothers, more awareness of mothers and community members of their role in children's health, better diagnosis of pneumonia, more awareness of risk factors, and better referrals by health workers.  An often stated but not yet documented consequence has been fewer children's deaths. (5) IMCI tools has been adapted and disseminated both in-country and to other countries.  For example, Rational Pharmaceutical Management (RPM), developed by Management Sciences for Health (MSH) with BASICS and PAHO support, was field tested in Bolivia and Ecuador.  This tool collects cost data, assesses the role of the private sector, determines the availability of drugs at health centers, and assesses prescribing practices. Also, with project support, the Training Center for Breastfeeding and Nutrition (COTALMA) in Bolivia modified the community IMCI materials that were originally developed by PAHO/UNICEF.  With TA from World Education, COTALMA also adapted materials for auxiliary nurses, called complementary IMCI.  Additionally, because of the success of the implementation of IMCI in Latin America, two PAHO representatives were invited to present their experience in an upcoming international meeting in South Africa. Finally, Peru and Honduras made their own shortened versions of the clinical IMCI training course (from 11 to 7 days). (6) The project has shown itself able to work under adversity.  For example, in Honduras, despite the worst hurricane in the last 25 years (Mitch), the initiative progressed; in Bolivia, a dedicated facilitator works on training activities on her vacation time; and in Peru, after work hours, an entrepreneurial young doctor conducted a thorough study of drug use in a group of clinics. The project shows great promise for making a major contribution to the eventual sustainability of IMCI within nationwide health systems in the target countries.  Currently, five different approaches are being pursued to promote sustainability, all with initially promising results, although mostly on a limited and pilot basis:  incorporation of IMCI into MOH policies; stimulation of donor support and funding for the expansion of IMCI; incorporation of health issues into activities of the education sector; training of community-based health promoters and mothers in IMCI messages; and incorporation of IMCI into the curricula of nursing and medical schools.","Project title: Monitoring, evaluation and design support (MEDS)","Special Evaluation","Documents","HRN-I-00-99-00002-00","","5/1/2000 12:00:00 AM","","Regional development|Child health care|Integrated health care|Child survival activities|Disease prevention and control|Integrated management of childhood illnesses (IMCI)","Latin America|Caribbean","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABS838.pdf","2,659 KB","007877 - LTG Associates, Inc.|003366 - TvT Associates","","001373 - USAID.

"Evaluates child survival project being implemented by Project HOPE and Press Agriculture Limited (PAL) in Malawi's Kasungu District. Midterm evaluation covers the period 1998- 10/00.   The project focuses on reducing maternal and child mortality and morbidity among 30,000 people living on 34 tobacco and coffee estates and in 22 surrounding villages. There have been several important accomplishments. These include: strong working relationship developed between the partners; increased access to health services; expanded coverage of health services; improved quality of care provided by Ministry of Health (MOH) and PAL health facilities; and capacity strengthened among 537 health care providers and community volunteers.  These accomplishments were achieved despite frequent stock-outs and chronic shortages of drugs and vaccines; initial challenges in determining the best way to collaborate with project partners; high turnover in the position of the District Health Officer (DHO); a restructuring within PAL during the first year of the project; inflexible MOH policies; and an unstable tobacco market. The first 2 years of the project have focused on creating and reinforcing the capacity of partners and health caregivers.  To this end, the project has trained 15 health surveillance agents, 537 community volunteers, and 2 medical assistants.  Two assessments have also been carried out (one to assess PAL's institutional capacity to support and maintain the health delivery system, the other to assess the quality of care among MOH and project health care providers) which will guide capacity-building activities during the second half of the project. The project's prospects for sustainability are unusually high.  This is because the partner organization is able to employ and support the key health care providers, the medical assistants, and the health surveillance agents.  PAL senior management is also highly motivated to see the health delivery system succeed.  Furthermore, the present DHO is also very cooperative and understands the benefits of this project to the District Health Management Team.  Includes recommendations.

"Final evaluation of the RICHES 2000 project (10/96-9/00), designed to improve child survival by emphasizing maternal health services in eight communes of Western Grand'Anse, Haiti.  The project was implemented by CARE. The project area included a total population of 212,352 and a direct target population of 53,088 women.  Children and men also benefitted indirectly from project interventions.  The project approach was based on the institutional strengthening of health centers to improve the delivery and management of quality services for maternal health, family planning (FP), and HIV/AIDS and sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). The project also trained health center personnel in crosscutting strategies for community mobilization and behavior change communications related to the technical interventions. RICHES 2000 made very good to excellent progress in achieving its objectives.  The project surpassed all objectives for the FP and institutional strengthening components, achieved or nearly achieved all of its objectives for maternal health, and made impressive progress for the HIV/AIDS-STD component.  A major strength of RICHES 2000 was in balancing health center-based activities to improve quality and services with community-based activities to increase knowledge and demand.  This was particularly impressive in the area of FP, where contraceptive prevalence rose from 14% to 33%.  Also, the emphasis  on direct maternal health services contributed indirectly to (or did not limit) improvements in health services for children.  The project was weak in monitoring project objectives and in developing an information system. In addition, inconsistencies between the detailed implementation plan (DIP) and knowledge, practice, and coverage (KPC) survey methodologies made it difficult to assess achievement of project objectives. Lessons learned include the following:  (1) The management of an institutional strengthening project is quite different, more difficult, and slower than a project to develop direct service delivery at the community level, but offers greater possibilities for the continuation of services after the end of the project.  (2) A project based on institutional partnerships requires a careful, flexible implementation process, continuous two-way dialogue, and clear roles that are respected by each partner.  (3) In an institutional strengthening project, the decentralization of planning plays an important role in creating local ownership.  (4) Every sustainability strategy should systematically include a structured phase-out plan that is known by all the partners. (5) The effectiveness of an institutional strengthening project is enhanced when it builds on existing community mobilization and behavior change communication strategies.  (6) In an institutional strengthening project it is important to balance health center-based activities to improve quality and services with community-based activities to increase knowledge and demand.  (7) A project that focuses on maternal health services can indirectly maintain or improve health services for children.  (8) Behavior change communication through youth, mothers' , and fathers' clubs is effective because of the multiplication effect in disseminating information and the reduced cost in adding new messages. (9) The level of knowledge required to achieve a significant change in behavior varies by type of intervention. (10) By responding to client demand for clinic-based methods it is possible to increase the utilization of FP services without depending on a well-developed community-based distribution network. (11) Care for STDs and AIDS requires a functioning referral system.  (12) Cost recovery objectives and activities should be included in every project in order to encourage sustainability.","Attachment A: Study of knowledge, attitudes and practices in|maternal and child health|Attachment B: Projet RICHES analysis of institutional capacity --|results from an institutional survey on the management capacity of|eight partner institutes in the eight towns of la Grand Anse","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","FAO-0500-A-00-6043-00","","7/1/2000 12:00:00 AM","","Maternal health care|Child health care|Health facilities|Clinics|Health delivery|Institution building|Community based delivery|Community participation|Family planning services|Disease prevention and control|HIV/AIDS|Sexually transmitted diseases|Behavior change|Contraceptive prevalence|Men|Private voluntary organizations|Indigenous private voluntary organizations","Haiti","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABS837.pdf","403 KB","007518 - CARE International|009809 - CARE Haiti","","007746 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to develop programs to screen and treat childhood mental and physical illness related to Chernobyl radiation in the Ukraine -- the Chernobyl Childhood Illness Program (CCIP).  Interim evaluation covers the period 5/98-9/00. Major findings are as follows:  (1) A comprehensive system was established to screen for both physical (thyroid cancer) and mental problems, representing a holistic approach to childhood illness.  The size and location of the target population -- children aged 12-18 -- was defined.  (2) Up-to-date thyroid and psychosocial screening protocols and screening data collection and analysis tools were developed.  To date, the program has provided refresher training for 260 physicians and psychologists from pilot regions in ultrasonography, computer applications, and advanced psychological screening and clinical tools. (3) Four Ukrainian American Health Centers (UAHCs) have been established and equipped in the Volyn, Rivne, Zhytomir, and Cherkassy regions.  Each center is the base for a mobile screening team. Portable ultrasound and other diagnostic equipment have been purchased to outfit several minivans for the teams.  The program is also developing community-based and referral systems for psychosocial services for affected children and their families.  (4) The program has currently screened about 20% of the targeted 100,000 children.  Twenty percent of examined children have psychological trauma such as depression.  On average, 6% of examined children have been found to have thyroid abnormalities in the mild and severe stages. Correlation between thyroid abnormalities and psychological manifestations are found in 10% of examined children.  (5) Improvement is needed in follow-up of patients who are referred for evaluation of significant thyroid ultrasound abnormality, as well as for psychosocial treatment.  (6) The legacy of the CCIP should be to strengthen Ukraine's capacity to manage thyroid cancer, specifically in the screening, diagnosis, and treatment of thyroid cancer, and in related psychosocial problems.  This strengthening should occur at the oblast health department level, and should work to ensure that adequate technical capacity can be found in oblast institutions that manage thyroid cancer and related psychosocial problems. USAID should consider extending the program at no additional cost for a fourth year in order to meet screening and referral goals.  Other recommendations are to:  (1) intensify assistance to Rivne, where more than 50% (54,000) of all at-risk children targeted nationally by the project live and which are also areas of iodine deficiency and endemic goiter; (2) continue to pay mobile team members a modest per diem stipend for additional work, but do not tie the payment to a numerical number of children screened per day, lest the quality of both thyroid cancer and psychosocial screening be compromised; and (3) improve referral follow-up, especially on children with modules of 1 cm or larger, by training oblast personnel in ultrasound- guided FNA biopsy, and adding an endocrinologist to each UAHC.  Finally, it is recommended that the project improve the psychosocial program by adding a clinical psychologist to the psychosocial training team, facilitating feedback to psychologists and administrators on the outcome of psychosocial referrals, distributing written information on mental health issues at the community level, and continuing to seeking alternative funding sources for the program and to develop the new profession of clinical psychology in Ukraine.","Project title: Monitoring, evaluation and design support (MEDS)","Special Evaluation","Documents","HRN-I-00-99-00002-00","","9/1/2000 12:00:00 AM","","Child health care|Disaster response|Disease prevention and control|Disease detection|Cancers|Psychological needs|Mobile health services|Information and referral services|Health professional education|Human capacity development","Ukraine","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABS841.pdf","738 KB","007877 - LTG Associates, Inc.|003366 - TvT Associates","","008291 - USAID.

"Updating a 1998 report (PN-ACE-626), this study discusses practical lessons drawn from the experience of USAID, other donor organizations, and development institutions in designing and implementing environmental policy. Four lessons applicable to the overall policy process are discussed: (1) Commitment of key decisionmakers is required throughout the policy process. (2) Policy change is a continuing process.  (3) Timing is everything.  Targets of opportunity must be seized.  (4) The policy process is perforce multidisciplinary and must also recognize cross-sectoral and gender linkages. Lessons discussed regarding policy dialogue are as follows:  (1) Involve all key stakeholders and find a policy ""champion"".  (2) Policy dialogue must adapt approaches and tools to a wide variety of political, economic, and cultural settings.  (3) Donor coordination is crucial for consistent and effective policies to emerge from policy dialogue. (4) Policy dialogue requires flexibility and thrives on open and creative interaction among counterparts. A key lesson regarding problem diagnosis is that diagnosis depends on solid analytics, as well as a credible process for conducting, vetting, and communicating the analytical results to policymakers and stakeholders. Five lessons regarding policy design are discussed:  (1) Donors' partners are not always receptive to ""policy"" assistance.  (2) Early involvement of implementers and stakeholders can improve policy design and build consensus for implementation. (3) Environmental policy design should be linked to economic development and to specific problems that improved policies can address.   (4) Donors should analyze the incentive structures of policy instruments.  (5) Effective design must anticipate implementation barriers. Finally, six lessons are discussed regarding policy implementation: (1) Unforeseen obstacles may prevent a policy from being implemented as designed. (2)  Donors should encourage partners to develop implementation strategies.  (3) The benefits of policy implementation should be marketed in terms of impacts on local beneficiaries. (4) Implementation must be reinforced by commitments to sustain financial support. (5) Programs will be more successful if implemented by those closest to the problem.  (6) Donors may need to help build the capacity of stakeholders.","Later final report: PN-ACM-295|Task order no. 17|Related document: PN-ACE-626|EPIQ (environmental policy and institutional strengthening|indefinite quantity contract)","Special Evaluation","Documents","PCE-I-00-96-00002-00","","12/1/2000 12:00:00 AM","","Environmental policy|Policy analysis|Policy dialogue|Policy making|Implementation|Development cooperation|Development organizations|Donor coordination|Constraints","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNACK466.pdf","626 KB","006958 - International Resources Group (IRG)|001798 - Winrock International|000553 - Harvard University.

"Evaluates project to reduce diarrheal disease in children under age 5 in El Salvador (PROSAGUAS project).  Interim evaluation covers the period 1998-7/00. In the three project sites where pre- and post- project data have been collected, the prevalence of diarrhea in children under age 5 has been substantially reduced.  From 1998 to 1999, diarrhea prevalence dropped from 33% to 6.2% in La Esperanza (Conchagua) and from 14% ti 4.4% in Moncagua.  In Istagua, prevalence decreased from 14% in 1998 to 8.5% in 2000. PROSAGUAS is ahead of schedule in reaching the planned number of beneficiaries (45,000) for both water supply and sanitation.  Moreover, at the current rate of progress, the program will have significant savings in both funding and time. PROSAGUAS has reached 45% of its target of training 9,000 households in improved hygiene practices.  In general, considerable progress has been made in the overall health component.  The health and hygiene interventions are having a positive impact, as evidenced in awareness of health issues, improved hygiene practices, and behavior changes. The program has successfully built on existing organizational structures in the communities, primarily through the community development associations (ADESCOs).  Besides selecting members of the various committees, the ADESCOs have collaborated in a variety of ways with the water users' associations (WUAs).  For the most part, municipalities have also supported the program by providing land or by otherwise collaborating in establishing the water systems.  They have given legal standing to water management boards and audited financial records of the water systems.  A consistent and constructive role for municipal authorities in oversight, monitoring, and support for the WUAs and water management boards is important in ensuring the latter's sustainability.  The community management structures created are viable and effective, and should be able to ensure sustainable operation of the water supply systems.  Substantial progress has been made in increasing the participation of women in organizational and management structures, though generally not in positions with power or decisionmaking authority. PROSAGUAS has created small, not-for-profit water utility companies run by the community, with paid employees and other attributes of a commercial enterprise, at least in the larger water systems.  This entrepreneurial character should contribute greatly to the sustainability and possibility for expansion of these systems to serve more people, within the limitations of their respective water sources. The systems created under the current phase of PROSAGUAS have a more business-like orientation than those initiated under Phase I.  The newer projects also benefit from greater emphasis on community organization and education.  These changes should result in an even higher degree of sustainability than observed in the earlier projects.  The health education component in PROSAGUAS project communities, together with provisions for follow-on support, is likely to result in sustained health benefits. Overall, PROSAGUAS has achieved an appropriate balance between meeting physical outputs under the agreement and investing in the qualitative, or ""software,"" aspects of project implementation.  While it is premature to draw any firm conclusions with regard to the sustainability of Phase II projects, the likelihood of sustainability is validated to a certain extent by the generally strong performance of Phase I community-managed systems. Areas of concern include:  a project selection trend toward urban rather than, as originally envisioned, rural areas; inadequate use of monitoring and evaluation data for program planning and management purposes; inadequate process documentation; inadequacy of community involvement in initial design and construction decisions; a too diffused health and sanitation education program; and limited synergy with other USAID programs and strategic objectives.","EHP project no. 26568/Other.SV1.WSSEVAL|Project title: Environmental health project II (EHP II)","Special Evaluation","Documents","HRN-I-00-99-00011-00","","9/1/2000 12:00:00 AM","","Community services|Water supply structures|Sanitation|Child health care|Disease prevention and control|Diarrhea|Health education|Hygiene|Private enterprises|Nonprofit organizations|Public sector|Municipal level|Development cooperation|Water user associations|Local groups|Community based delivery|Community participation|Project sustainability|Women in development","El Salvador","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABS869.pdf","661 KB","000333 - Camp Dresser and McKee, Inc.

"Final evaluation of efforts (1994-7/00) of the MotherCare project to support and enhance the ongoing Safe Motherhood initiative in three target districts (Banjar, Barito Kuala, and Hulu Sungai Selatan) in South Kalimantan, Indonesia.  The project was implemented in collaboration with the Indonesian Ministry of Health (MOH) and Ikatan Bidan Indonesia (IBI), the national midwife association. MotherCare-assisted interventions addressed four main areas:  (1) improved quality of services through inservice training of midwives based in villages, health centers, and hospitals; a peer review and continuing education system implemented by IBI's district chapter; and a maternal and perinatal audit system in the three districts; (2) improved referral by strengthening the skills of village midwives to manage and refer complications, as well as by improving their relationship with the traditional birth attendants (TBA) and service providers in referral facilities; (3) behavioral change in the community and of providers through an integrated information, education, and communications (IEC) strategy; and (4) the formulation of policies supporting these initiatives. The Government of Indonesia (GOI) has addressed increased coverage of services by placing a midwife in each village and ensuring the presence of at least one doctor with obstetric skills in each district.  In addition, efforts were made to facilitate financial access to services for the poor. The GOI's goal of bringing high quality obstetric services closer to the women who need it has clearly been successful.  The MotherCare program has effectively contributed to this goal by strengthening the GOI's efforts through the training and continuing education of midwives in life-saving, communication, and counseling skills; by initiating and supporting the maternal and perinatal audit process; and by providing women and their families information on how to make pregnancy safer. All these activities were implemented as part of an integrated package, and their mutually reinforcing effect was probably instrumental in their success.  In considering which activities to expand upon, the MOH will not only have to decide which of these activities were ""value for money"", but also the extent to which an integrated approach was essential in effecting change.  The success of the training program in improving midwives' skills and confidence, for example, was due at least in part to the continuing and regular supervision of midwives through the peer review and audit meetings.  Similarly, the increased collaboration between midwives and TBAs was the result of repeated reinforcements during training sessions and audit meetings. One of the key challenges facing the GOI is how to sustain the extensive village-based midwifery program.  A short in-service training program cannot substitute for a 3- year program, and the training needs identified by MotherCare should be incorporated into existing medical, nursing, and midwifery education programs to ensure that doctors, midwives, and nurses graduate with skills adequate to the tasks expected of them. However, maternal health will not improve through midwifery training alone.  Policy decisions and actions are still required to increase referral and ensure quality services at referral level. Most importantly, concerted efforts and commitment will be needed to contain costs of maternal health services and to make services affordable for the poor.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","HRN-C-00-93-00038-00|HRN-C-00-98-00050-00|HRN-Q-00-93-00039-00","","7/1/2000 12:00:00 AM","","Maternal child health care|Child delivery|Obstetrics|Domestic government programs|Health professional education|Nurse midwives|Traditional birth attendants|Health facilities|Continuing education|Occupational skill levels|Information and referral services|Networks|Behavior change|Health education|IEC|Health policy|Host country cooperation|Perinatal care|Safe motherhood","Indonesia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABS900.pdf","189 KB","005553 - John Snow, Inc.

"This summary presents the objectives, findings, lessons learned, and recommendations of the fall 1998 evaluation of a quality assurance (QA) program in Niger, a French-speaking country in West Africa with a population of 10 million.  The Nigerien QA Project (QAP) began in the Tahoua region in 1993 and in 1997 merged with another health care program -- Basic Support for Institutionalizing Child Survival (BASICS)-- to become the joint QAP/BASICS project.  Later, the Konni District (Tahoua) and the Boboye District (Dosso) were selected for QAP/IMCI (Integrated Management of Childhood Illness) interventions; this was the first time in the history of international health interventions that IMCI was introduced in an environment where QA practices were in place. Important lessons learned from the evaluation of the first 5 years of Nigerien QAP and QAP/BASICS relate to the savings and benefits derived from introducing IMCI in a QA environment, the ability of health care providers to learn and adapt QA principles and implement solutions, the development of teamwork among QA-trained staff, and the importance of coaching and meetings to support and sustain QA activities.  The story of QA in Tahoua stands out as an excellent example of how QA activities can improve the quality of care, even in the face of severe resource constraints.

"Final evaluation of a project (8/88-12/00) to prevent and control HIV/AIDS and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in Jamaica. The project continues to record successes, as demonstrated by positive changes in risky sexual behavior; greater public awareness of, and response to, the dangers posed by HIV and STIs; and the strengthened technical and administrative capacity of the Ministry of Health (MOH) at the central and regional levels.  Increased condom use, reduction in sexual partners, continued declines in STI rates, a possible leveling off in HIV prevalence, and greater involvement of regional, parish, and community organizations have contributed significantly to stabilizing HIV/AIDS in Jamaica.  Specific components are rated below. The project has implemented a strong behavior change and communications (BCC) program, which emphasizes face-to-face, interactive, culturally appropriate HIV/AIDS education (as distinct from an earlier approach that emphasized mass media). There has been positive behavior change in recent years:  high condom user rates (especially with non-regular partners); a significant decrease in Jamaicans reporting multiple partners; and a slight rise in the median age of sexual debut.  However, there has been slippage in condom user levels among females age 20 and older and some older males, and a slight rise in the proportion of women reporting multiple partners. The National HIV/Sexually Transmitted Disease (STD) Control Program (NHCP) has implemented a strong STD control component that includes syndromic management, plus an unusually effective program of contact tracing and HIV counseling and testing.  As a result, prevalence and incidence (when data for the latter are available) of most STDs has declined markedly for several years.  The contact tracing program has worked well and has much to teach other countries.  Sentinel surveillance has been in place since 1990 and now covers 10 parishes. Surveillance is also carried out in several high-risk groups and in 10 low-risk groups, some of which can serve as proxies for the general population.  Quality control is maintained through links with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Condom promotion programs, including condom social marketing (CSM), and a BCC emphasis on condom promotion, have been successful.  CSM was included in the recent project from 1997 to 1999.  An island-wide network of at least 2,000 non- traditional retail outlets was established in collaboration with the National Family Planning Board. The MOH feels that a national-level CSM program is no longer needed, but the former national CSM manager feels that problems of condom availability persist in rural areas, and that mass media promotion is still needed. The integrated management and services approach in the Epidemiology Unit has built on its successes under the original project agreement, supporting policy decisions and providing technical guidance for BCC, CSM, and STI prevention. It has evolved into the NHCP's administrative and technical center and has the ability to assume greater responsibility for implementing the NHCP, including the USAID-funded components. With decentralization, the unit has steadily disengaged itself from day-to-day regional and parish operations and has been absorbed into the MOH's Health Promotion and Protection Division. The project's weakest intervention has been strengthening the management capacity of the National AIDS Committee (NAC), which suffers from problems of public perception, executive leadership, and a lack of resources to build a strong infrastructure and mobilize a multisectoral response.  Failure to consolidate infrastructure can be attributed to a lack of political commitment, a poor mix or balance in active volunteers, and lack of independence from the MOH. Key problems that continue to hinder HIV/AIDS control efforts include: the absence of a monitoring and evaluation plan and trained personnel to keep policymakers and program managers abreast of trends and outcomes; inattention to capacity building outside of the Epidemiology Unit, especially at the regional level; an underutilization of NGOs in planning and implementing project activities; and the absence of a training infrastructure for both the public and private sectors.","Project title: Synergy project (SynergyAIDS)","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","HRN-C-00-99-00005-00","","12/1/2000 12:00:00 AM","","Disease prevention and control|HIV/AIDS|Sexually transmitted diseases|Domestic government programs|Human sexual behavior|Behavior change|Government departments|Epidemiology|Social marketing|Commercial retail sale of contraceptives|Condoms|Management operations|Health care administration|Decentralization|Sex education|Community participation|Public awareness|Interpersonal communication|Constraints","Jamaica","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABS916.pdf","170 KB","003366 - TvT Associates","","008291 - USAID.

"Evaluates USAID/Jamaica's environmental portfolio, which consists principally of two programs under Strategic Objective (SO) 2: Coastal Water Quality Improvement Project (CWIP) and Environmental Audits for Sustainable Tourism (EAST); the latter is a component of the Development of Environmental Management Organizations (DEMO) project. In general, the accomplishments of CWIP and EAST have been outstanding.  The programs have generated wide stakeholder support, community NGOs and community-based organizations (CBOs) have been energized to voluntarily undertake a wide array of environmental projects, and the work has elicited high praise from participating public and private sector entities.  The expertise and effectiveness of contractor personnel were repeatedly cited by stakeholders as key to the success of CWIP's community-level initiatives, coastal water monitoring and sampling efforts, EMS initiatives, wastewater training, and EAST's environmental audit program. Significant institutional breakthroughs have been made in establishing public participation models at the local level, as exemplified in the formation of the advisory and monitoring committees in Negril and Ocho Rios.  The emphasis on establishing partnerships and stressing organizational capacity- building at the local level has succeeded in broadening program reach, enabling a sense of local ownership, thereby increasing the prospects for long-term sustainability. CWIP's activity in the EMS and wastewater components, which began at the community level, has led to policy initiatives that are being considered for adoption at the highest levels of government.  Similarly, EAST's environmental auditing program, begun at the enterprise level, is now expanding to sectoral involvement and participation by government agencies. These are examples of how a ""bottom up"" approach to addressing local environmental issues can contribute to the formulation and adoption of national environmental policy. The program's geographic focus during the next 2 years will shift dramatically to Portland.  In addition to CWIP, EAST and the Ridge to Reef Watershed (R2RW) project will be working in the Port Antonio/Portland area, as will other donor programs such as the Environmental Action Programme (ENACT). CWIP has only a 12-month window to commit its grant funds to community-level initiatives in Portland. Whether there is the capacity among the NGOs and CBOs to put these funds to effective use in so short a time is open to question.  As an option, all or part of CWIP's grant funds earmarked for Portland might be used to sustain ongoing projects in Negril and Ocho Rios. Includes program recommendations for the near, medium, and long term, as well as recommendations for SO performance, monitoring, and evaluation.","Also known as: Evaluation of USAID Jamaica's environmental|portfolio : improving key natural resources|Purchase order modification #1","Special Evaluation","Documents","532-O-00-01-00016-00","","12/1/2000 12:00:00 AM","","USAID|Development programs|Strategic objectives|Environmental management|Natural resource management|Performance measurement|Coasts|Water quality|Tourist industry|Sustainable development|Indigenous private voluntary organizations|Local groups|Community based delivery|Partnerships|Environmental policy|Development program planning","Jamaica","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABS942.pdf","343 KB","008563 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of a matching grant (10/97-9/00) to Heifer Project International (HPI) to strengthen HPI's capacity to deliver basic services to partner organizations and communities by implementing and institutionalizing the Cornerstone Model -- a values-based planning and management approach and set of tools. As in the previous matching grants, there is significant evidence of organizational improvement and strengthening at HPI headquarters both in the three participating country offices (Bolivia, Zimbabwe, Indonesia) and throughout the respective regions.  The report focuses on the Bolivia and Indonesia programs; the Zimbabwe program was not evaluated due to general insecurity in the country at the time of the evaluation. The Bolivia and Indonesia programs present greatly contrasted pictures of country offices and programs.  Heifer- Bolivia has more than 40 years experience and a seasoned national staff, while Heifer-Indonesia was largely started from ""scratch"" with new staff -- expatriate consultants and nationals.  Both country offices developed different strategic plans and have had different results.  HPI made a major commitment in matching dollars and staff resources to the grant, which increased HPI's ability to strengthen its mission and clarify its organizational role. The Cornerstone Model continues to support HPI's efforts to promote holistic development through the implementation of livestock projects. Gender and impact are more fully institutionalized as key program initiatives, but require further attention and reinforcement.  Training continues to be a strength of the organization, although questions remain about the transfer of skills and the impact of training. Partnerships and capacity-building are as problematic as ever because of the difficult nature of the work, and HPI can help country offices establish criteria and strategies for phasing out projects. Oversight and accountability at all levels will become more important to the success of the organization as decentralization accelerates in the coming years. In sum, the Cornerstone Model has proven its value to the organization.  It must continue to be examined and improved upon to take into account the evolving nature of rural development throughout the world.

"Interim evaluation (1996-4/00) of the Uplifting Adolescents Project (UAP), designed to provide a variety of services to at-risk adolescents in Jamaica through a nationwide network of NGOs and to develop the latter's project-related institutional capacities. The evaluation team found a range of outcomes, depending largely on the capacity of the implementing NGOs. While most lack the ability to do their own monitoring and evaluation of results, a number have gone to great lengths to provide ongoing and reliable services to the at-risk youth who are the project's beneficiaries.  To date, some 15,100 of the latter have been registered in the regular at-risk and special populations (pregnant girls, learning disabled, etc.) programs, exceeding the project target of 11,000.  The NGOs have registered 12,688 regular at-risk adolescents, well above the project target of 9,300.  In the special populations category, some 2,412 adolescents have been registered, against a target of 1,700. More general findings included the following:  (1) The diversity and flexibility of the program to meet a variety of needs is considered a program strength.  (2) Participating NGOs credit Development Associates with providing them expert guidance and support throughout the grant period.  Most feel that the project has helped them provide better services and improved their administrative and financial management skills.  They also consider the training provided through UAP to be extremely useful and appropriate to the context of program needs. However, training needs still exist.  (3) NGOs are convinced of the efficacy of JAMAL-based literacy and numeracy methodologies and are assisting a number of youth to re-enter the formal education system, but are still weak in reporting on impact. (4) Youth beneficiaries perceive the program to be beneficial, providing services they need to succeed.  The NGOs' UAP programs are not yet self-sustainable either financially or administratively/managerially, and varying levels of capacities exist among the NGOs.  Most programs have severe constraints to extending UAP efforts: lack of physical structure and space; limited time-of-day available for program; and limited administrative staff support.  (5) There is a national lack of available vocational skills training for youths aged 15-16.  For these youths, most NGOs seek local business apprenticeship linkages (outside Kingston) on an individual youth basis. (6) Networking among NGOs remains very weak; networking abilities with other donors varies greatly among NGOs. (7) Operations research has not yet yielded useful conclusions.  Five projects were started; one was terminated; one is completed and will be presented on March 29; and three are pending.  (8) The most appropriate ministry for the program to collaborate with is the Ministry of Education and Culture.  (9) The program could benefit from increased national visibility and advocacy.  (10) UAP teachers and service providers would like assistance in identifying youth with special needs. (11) Policy documents were produced out of the counterpart with the Youth Unit of the Ministry of Local Government, Youth, and Community Development, but the future potential of this unit for at-risk youth policy planning is questionable. Overall, UAP is meeting and exceeding its targets and meeting the needs of at-risk adolescents.  However, the project is reaching, by some estimates, perhaps only one-tenth of the total population of at-risk youth in Jamaica.  In order to address this problem and to serve the target population even better, the report provides recommendations to continue programs and practices that are producing results as well as suggestions about how to maximize some of the potential within the NGOs and the island itself.","Global evaluation and monitoring (GEM) task order no. 800|Global evaluation and monitoring indefinite quantity contract (GEM|IQC)","Special Evaluation","Documents","FAO-I-00-99-00010-00","","4/1/2000 12:00:00 AM","","Child welfare services|Beneficiary targeting|Indigenous private voluntary organizations|Networks|Institution building|Vocational training|Reproductive health|Literacy instruction|Arithmetic instruction|Constraints|Adolescent mothers|Personnel|Financial resources|Behavior change|Project sustainability|At-risk groups","Jamaica","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABT050.pdf","1,369 KB","012322 - Aguirre International","","008563 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of a project (1995-7/00) to strengthen basic education in Honduras (BEST project). The BEST project, which focused primarily on alternative basic education delivery systems, but also included an educational policy component, was successful in the majority of its components, but had mixed success in the Advisory Center for Human Resources Development (CADERH) component.  EDUCATODOS (formerly ABEDS), an interactive radio instruction program, has successfully built an extensive service network, reached its intended target population, met many of its learning goals, and clearly has had an impact on more than 200,000 out-of-school children and young people, as well as illiterate or barely schooled adults.  Weaknesses in evaluation methods and a need for updating program methods and materials are detailed in the report.  The team recommends a final period of gradually declining assistance, during which EDUCATODOS would receive TA to strengthen its academic and administrative systems, and be slowly absorbed into the Secretariat of Education's regular structure. The CADERH-coordinated vocational education network provides quality training services to low-income youth and young adults.  It is currently being expanded through a contract with DevTech, Inc.  CADERH itself, however, while its materials development, training, and certifications services represent real value added, continues to have serious management and financial problems unrelated to the project.  It is an open question whether it will be able to resolve those problems and become a sustainable, self-funding organization.  The evaluation team recommends that CADERH be informed that USAID will provide final, tie-off assistance, provided CADERH is prepared to undertake a series of actions designed to produce sustainability by the end of the grant period.  Assuming CADERH qualifies, assistance would be terminated 12/31/02. After Hurricane Mitch, important work was done under the policy component of BEST to lay the groundwork for comprehensive educational reform in Honduras.  USAID/Honduras played an active and important role in helping create a consensus in favor of reform, supporting the planning and public discussion of reform plans and supporting it through effective donor coordination.  In addition, the Mission assisted several pilot projects, two of which utilize distance learning, to provide inputs to the anticipated reform program.  A national educational reform effort has now been launched.  The team recommends that USAID give priority to supporting selected components of this effort.

"Final evaluation of ""Seeing 2000"", an International Eye Foundation (IEF) project (1994-2000) to expand clinical and surgical eye care services for children through support for NGOs worldwide. IEF met all three primary project objectives.  There were aggregate increases of 63% in eye surgery for children (5,741 operations) and 978% in eye exams for children (509,017 exams). The capacity building (training) objective was generally met; overall, 92 doctors and 121 other health providers were reported trained in the program.  Since most of IEF's grantee partners were strong eye care organizations already, individual grantees' performance on primary objectives was generally very high.  Also, in the seven institutions visited by the evaluation team, the quality of surgical service was judged by the team to be generally high.  However, results in numerical terms were skewed to regions where the underlying disease burden is greatest; data were not disaggregated by type of surgery, age, or diagnosis (all of which have implications for visual outcome); also, follow-up to determine quality of post-operative vision was not reported on.  IEF's tripling of its surgery objective and 20- fold rise in eye exams suggests those service objectives were too modest, as is one person trained per organization as a training target.  Finally, Seeing 2000's contribution to overall childhood blindness prevention is small. The small grants program was an innovative, cost- effective, and successful way to increase surgical services for childhood blindness.  A great deal of activity at many partner institutions was generated by a relatively small infusion of IEF funds.  A number of the grant partners are true centers of excellence.  IEF fashioned a wide geographic network of committed, capable service organizations (e.g., WHO, the International Agency for the Prevention of Blindness [IAPB]), which at international policy/program levels raised the profile of childhood blindness as a separate entity requiring separate services.  The small grant program was successful for a number of reasons.  The network was self-selected, so that ""good"" organizations, like cream, rose to the top in the Request for Applications (RFA) process.  IEF was also able to foster South- South transfer of capability by partnering more nascent NGOs with more robust ones.  At the same time, larger grants to fewer organizations, if carefully targeted and designed, can potentially bring greater results in the long run in terms of strengthening an institution's program management and financial sustainability. Seeing 2000 was highly participatory and there was no micro-management from IEF, which was seen as a reliable and helpful partner, without any conflicting agendas of its own.  All seven local partners visited by the evaluation team expressed high levels of satisfaction with the partnership with IEF, with the timeliness and utility of the IEF assistance given, and with what they, the grantees, accomplished with the grant funds.  They all remarked that the Seeing 2000 grant enabled them to focus their institution on the needs of children, and to maintain that focus post-grant.  Aravind, which manufactures intraocular lenses and suture material of high quality at low prices, has also become IEF's business partner.  Post-grant capacity and programmatic and financial sustainability were not addressed systematically by IEF or its grantees, but the evaluation team had the sense that prospects were good at many grantee institutions.  On the down side, monitoring and evaluation and results reporting were generally weak, and IEF seems thinly staffed for the TA mission it has embraced. Lessons learned were as follows:  (1) A relatively modest level of funding to a PVO (in the $300-400,000/yr range) can be very effective and can result in measurable, meaningful achievements. (2) Cost-recovery for affordable and accessible curative surgery can be achieved.  In situations involving high caseloads and empowered, committed organizations, cross- subsidization of services for children and the poor is quite feasible.  Nonetheless, the right set of circumstances are needed, including: a high prevalence of a condition (such as blindness), clients' general willingness to pay, strong organizational commitment and ability to deliver good quality services, and high aggregate national wealth.  (3) South-South assistance can be real, significant, and sustainable.  In fact, South-North assistance can take place and meaningfully strengthen a grantor PVO's own programs.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","FAO-C-00-95-00036-00","","12/1/2000 12:00:00 AM","","Disease prevention and control|Blindness|Child health care|Health delivery|Surgery|Private voluntary organizations|Indigenous private voluntary organizations|Human capacity development|Health professional education|Grants|Institutional linkages|Partnerships|Networks|Institution building|Project sustainability|Health policy|International level","India|Nepal|Bulgaria|Dominican Republic|Peru","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABT058.pdf","475 KB","006190 - AMA Technologies, Inc.","","007746 - USAID.

"Evaluates results packages to achieve USAID/Ecuador's strategic objective (SO) 1 (conservation of biodiversity in selected protected areas and their buffer zones). Midterm evaluation covers the period 1997-2000. Individual sections of the report present findings, lessons learned, and recommendations of the project's three components -- Cotacachi-Cayapas Ecological Reserve, Bioreserva del Condor, and the Galapagos Island -- from the viewpoint of the field-level integration of activities; the success and failure of specific activities; the pace of implementation; and partner capacity to implement activities. Despite individual achievements, the current orientation of SO1 is not likely to conserve significant amounts of  biodiversity in the future.  The logic for the strategic approach involving the three intermediate results (IRs) ""strengthened capacity of targeted NGOs and civil society organizations active in biodiversity conservation""; ""economically viable natural resource management practices adopted""; and ""key policies and legal frameworks introduced and/or implemented to conserve biodiversity"" -- is based on the premise that raising the economic benefits of populations residing in protected area buffer zones can reduce their incentives to use the resources of those areas.  A strengthening of legal, regulatory, and institutional processes was also part of the strategy. Nongovernmental action, from community to national levels, was to complement historically weak government institutions. Such an approach, however, while suitable for resource conservation in the classic sense, needs to change substantially if real progress is to be made toward the Mission's SO. The problem is neither the program's geographical focus nor its three IRs, but rather the serious constraints to translating the IRs into results packages.  The results packages' logic holds that if local populations believe that the benefits they can derive from buffer-zone products are greater than those they can get from protected areas, then they will leave the protected areas alone.  This may promote better local resource use, but it does not serve the purpose of biodiversity conservation over the longer term.  It simply lowers the value of biodiversity to that of sustainable returns to better-managed buffer zones.  A better strategy would be to express and capture more of the real value of biodiversity, and to allow local populations to share in its much higher rents.  This is not easy, but it is more consistent not only with SO1, but with Ecuador's dire economic reality and even with official policy regarding biodiversity.  The nation's natural resources -- oil, wood, agricultural land, and fisheries -- will come under increasing pressure in the next few years.  The value of biodiversity in protected areas will not only have to reach levels as high as those of production in buffer zones, but also match returns from the exploitation of oil, timber, lobster, or sea cucumber.","Task order no. 803|Project title: Biodiversity and sustainable forestry (BIOFOR)|Related document: PD-ABT-165","Special Evaluation","Documents","LAG-I-00-99-00013-00","","12/1/2000 12:00:00 AM","","Natural resource conservation|Biological diversity|Natural resource utilization|Protected environmental areas|Buffer zones|Strategic objectives|Development project design|Managing for results|Economic benefit|Constraints|Institution building|Civil society|Environmental policy|Development strategies","Ecuador","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABT164.pdf","308 KB","001600 - Associates in Rural Development, Inc.

"Evaluates the Partnership for Economic Growth (PEG) program, designed to promote economic policy dialogue and reform. Mid-term evaluation covers a period ending 10/00 and reviews four grants, three for partnerships between U.S. and Indonesian entities -- IRIS-LPEM, USF-Udayana, GMU-SIAGA (unidentified acronyms) -- and one to The Asia Foundation (TAF). The four grantee partnerships have compiled a notable record of achievements:  (1) IRIS-LPEM organized, on very short notice, 12 major public conferences and 37 seminars, workshops, and other events across Indonesia during the run-up to national elections.  IRIS-IPEM also helped to bring a new generation of policymakers and advisors forward as leaders and media spokespersons for reform.  (2) TAF has emphasized strengthening the organizational capacity and policy advocacy of small and medium scale enterprise (SME) associations.  TAF has also supported studies and analyses of critical importance for SMEs, some of which formed the basis for the conditionality of international financial institutions.  (3) USF-Udayana's program focused on skills training for the legal profession (law faculty, lawyers, and notaries) in eastern Indonesia.  Subactivities included research grants and short courses for law faculties; legal education and reform seminars; short courses for legal professionals; and provision of technical support to public officials and NGO representatives at both the provincial and regency levels.  (4) GMU-SIAGA conducted a ""road show"" of regional seminars in five selected cities during the period leading up to national elections. Their research has focused on banking regulation and reform; taxation, financial disclosure, and competitiveness; and environmentally sound business practices. In general, grantee activities were highly relevant to a changing Indonesian context and have proven flexible and pro-active in promoting economic reform during a chaotic period. Participants generally ranked the activities as highly relevant, with some variations.  A possible explanation for a lower relative score received by GMU-SIAGA is that their program appeared to adhere closely to prior faculty research interests. Participants also tended to rank grantees' implementation of activities as highly effective, though by a lower margin and with wider variability.  There was a fairly marked difference between relevance and effectiveness in activities directly related to developing advocacy capacity, and a significant difference in areas identified with policy or institutional reform.  Effectiveness in legal skills training was ranked almost equal to relevance, although when asked to name the key barriers to improving economic governance in Indonesia, few participants mentioned legal skills.  Emphasis was placed on politics and misguided policies, as well as on official corruption. Performance monitoring systems were set up exclusively to track activity outputs rather than intermediate results or impact, and only three of the four grantees had installed any kind of results targets and monitoring systems at all.  The quality of grantees' financial information systems varied even more widely, and two of the four could not provide detailed expenditure data.  It was not possible to endorse the efficiency of grants management in these cases.  Finally, some of the grantees did not seem to view counterpart contributions in terms of the eventual survival and sustainability of the institutions that had been supported. Participants were optimistic that substantive change could be effected during the next 3 years.  Notable exceptions included progress in competition legislation and decentralization.  Participants believed that rapid payoff could be achieved in SME empowerment, organization of national SME advocacy groups (e.g., FORNAS), and advocacy training. Also perceived as more doable than not within 3 years were bank restructuring, reform of collateral law, and increasing transparency and accountability.  Upgrading the skills of legal professionals was ranked high in terms of immediacy of impact, although participants tended not to list these as highly consequential for future efforts to improve economic governance. There was broad agreement among the participants interviewed that institutional linkages would eventually disappear once external financing was phased out.  The majority seemed to believe that an additional 3-5 years of external support, at a minimum, would be needed.","Task order no. 800|Contract listed on document as: PCE-I-800-00-00012-00|Project title: Support for economic growth and institutional reform|(SEGIR)|Project title: Partnership for economic growth (PEG)","Special Evaluation","Documents","PCE-I-00-00-00012-00","","10/1/2000 12:00:00 AM","","Economic policy|Policy reform|Economic reform|Grants|Partnerships|Small scale enterprises|Medium scale enterprises|Advocacy|Institution building|Human capacity development|Seminars|Workshops|Economic research|Policy analysis|Implementation|Project sustainability|Economic self sufficiency|Performance measurement|Information systems","Indonesia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABT276.pdf","3,061 KB","010677 - Louis Berger Group, Inc.","","009937 - USAID.

"Evaluates a project to expand community support for children with disabilities into three districts of North Vietnam (Luong Son-Hoa Binh, Yen Khanh-Ninh Binh, and Yen Hung-Quang Ninh) having a combined total of 2,606 disabled children.  Mid- term evaluation covers the period 1998-4/00.  The project is being implemented by the Hanoi Center on Special Education of the National Institute of Educational Science (CSE/NIES) and by Catholic Relief Services (CRS). The main activities of the project are to:  develop training materials and textbooks on inclusive education; organize training courses on teaching children with disabilities for inservice teachers of preschools and primary schools and preservice teachers of teacher training colleges; increase awareness of disabilities in general and the unique needs of children who experience disabilities; and strengthen community support for children with disabilities. The project has many areas of success.  Project strengths include: (1) a positive impact on the lives of children with disabilities; (2) increased community awareness of issues related to children with disabilities; (3) improvements in the quality of teaching in schools; (4) strong community infrastructure; (5) age-appropriate and proportionate (to class size) placement of children with disabilities in classrooms; (6) strong support to and for families; and (7) strong collaborative partnerships. Areas for improvement include:  (1) expanded and in- depth training for teachers; (2) implementation of academic/individualized educational services for children with disabilities; and (3) identification of the levels of support that children with disabilities need in order to be successful in inclusive classrooms. Includes recommendations.","Project title: Displaced Children and Orphans Fund (DCOF) in Vietnam|CRS project no. 896-98-002","Special Evaluation","Documents","492-G-00-98-00035-00","","12/1/2000 12:00:00 AM","","Child welfare services|Handicapped persons|Disabilities|Primary education|Preschool education|Teacher training|Teachers' colleges|Community participation|Public awareness|Educational materials|Educational delivery|Private voluntary organizations","Vietnam","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABT399.pdf","1,985 KB","007337 - Catholic Relief Services (CRS)","","010305 - Displaced Children and Orphans Fund (DCOF) and Patrick J.

"USAID supported family planning (FP) and reproductive health (RH) programs in Brazil for more than 30 years.  From 1992 to 2000, the final years of this program and the years covered by this report, USAID concentrated the majority of its activities in the states of Bahia and Ceara, located in the poorer northeastern region of Brazil where indicators showed a lag in women's and men's reproductive health status. The final strategy also made clear USAID's intent to phase out support for FP in Brazil by 2000, when all activities would need to be self- sustaining. Over the years, USAID programs in Brazil helped establish a supportive and energized environment for FP and RH activities. The policy environment clearly improved, which should contribute to a strong, continuing program following USAID's phase-out. USAID's assistance in research and data collection has increased the quality and credibility of reproductive health information for policy, planning, and program evaluation. USAID's support for the introduction of new contraceptive methods has broadened the range of methods available to women, although the use of new methods is still low.  The phase-out strategy tapped into the resources and networks of the private, commercial sector, helping expand the range of methods and lower the cost of commodity procurement for the public sector.  In addition, by the end of 2000, BEMFAM -- the first FP organization to receive USAID assistance in the 1960s -- had reoriented its program and financial strategies to become nearly self-sufficient. Perhaps one of the most remarkable successes, given its relatively late start in 1996, was PROQUALI, a new, client-focused model of service delivery for the public sector. In the two states where it has been implemented, PROQUALI has dramatically improved the delivery of FP and RH services, and offers significant potential for further expansion. A number of lessons can be drawn from the experiences of the various agencies that USAID supported in Brazil over the years. Many of these lessons relate to the importance of local partners investing their own human and financial resources in program activities. The USAID-supported agencies also emphasized the importance of a clearly defined phase-out strategy with adequate time for implementation.  For the immediate future, it will be critical to identify additional opportunities for expanding many of the innovative and successful initiatives started with USAID support.

"Evaluates the Tertiary Education Linkages Project (TELP), designed to increase access for black South Africans to tertiary education, and to improve capacity in historically disadvantaged institutions (HDIs) of tertiary education.  Mid- term evaluation covers the period 1995-9/01. Key findings are as follows:  (1) Despite their structural and historical affinities, the HDIs are not homogenous The universities and technikons differ in conception and function.  Each has a different dynamic, history, character and ethos.  (2) Unanticipated and uncontrollable changes in higher education are having an effect on morale in most of the HDIs, with subsequent negative consequences for the project.  Falling student numbers in higher education generally have militated against TELP's effort to increase access to these institutions. There has been considerable resistance to gender equity workshops. (3) Three factors contribute most to the project's success:  a committed and pro-active Vice-Chancellor, a competent TELP Coordinator, and the project's integration into an institution's strategic plan.  The absence of any of these factors or a combination thereof limits potential project impact. (4) Overall, the HDIs are most satisfied with the institution- specific activities mechanism and least satisfied with the linkages component.  Satisfaction with, and the impact of, the joint activities mechanism was mixed.  (5) TELP seems better integrated into the strategic plans of the technikons than of the universities.  One area in which joint activities have been most successful has been in capacity building around strategic planning skills.  With two exceptions, the HDIs are on course to meet the June 2000 deadline to comply with South African Qualifications Authority (SAQA) requirements. (6) Staff development under Project Implementation Letters (PILs) and joint activities has occurred with regard to curriculum development, and raising awareness and understanding of the National Qualifications Framework and SAQA requirements. The expansion or establishment of research units has had an effect on skills development and staff morale. The linkages program has provided significant opportunities for staff to receive advanced technical and post-graduate training.  However, it has often proven difficult to retain staff trained overseas. (7) Student development is being furthered through bridging programs, standard testing packages, and 5-year student development plans, though much remains to be done in these areas. (8) The workshops run under joint activities have been criticized for being organized on the assumption that ""one size fits all"" and for failing to tailor their schedules to the institutions' calendars. Some criticism was voiced about the expertise of facilitators.  (9) All the HDIs have now established linkages with universities or consortia of higher education institutions in the United States.  A third have established successful linkages.  However, the majority of South African institutions reported significant frustration and disappointment with linkage negotiations and the quality of the services provided under it. (10) One of the most important findings to come out of the site visits is the pivotal role of the TELP coordinators to the success of the program.  (11) Good communications between all stakeholders and actors are essential for TELP's success.  The desire was expressed several times for better sharing of information within and between institutions. (12) Utilizing project benchmarks as a measurement of performance reveals that TELP definitely is making progress towards achieving its intended results.  Most HDIs are developing and using revised curricula; about 50% are evaluating first year students on entry.  A minority of institutions is providing compensatory/bridging programs.  Of the 15 HDIs, 13 have developed 3-year rolling plans.

"Close-out report on USAID/Ecuador's microenterprise assistance program (1996-9/00). The program had six components:  (1) USAID/Ecuador-Prime Fund made equity investment in Banco Solidario, Latin America's first privately-owned bank created to serve the microenterprise sector.  This investment has catalyzed $2.5 million in additional funding. Consequently, Banco Solidario met its capitalization requirement and significantly improved its delivery to financial services to microentrepreneurs, opening 10 branches in suburban Quito and in smaller cities across the country.  As of 9/30/00, it had 24,000 microentrepreneur borrowers.  External TA was provided by Accion International through the matching grant project.  (2) TA was provided by Coopers and Lybrand to CorpoMicro and four of its affiliate NGOs; emphasis was on upgrading management and information systems and developing strategic plans.  A plan for improving the information systems of the four NGOs was developed and partially implemented in FY 1998. (3) Village banking activities grew significantly through cooperative agreements with Catholic Relief Services, People-to-People Health foundation (Project HOPE), and Foundation for International Community Assistance (FINCA).  As of 9/30/00, 1,110 village banks were established, benefitting some 27,500 women entrepreneurs, far beyond the strategic objective target. (4) A grant of $400,000 was provided to Fundacion Alternativa for its training center for the staff of financial institutions engaged or interested in microcredit, including commercial banks, NGOs, and credit unions. (5) To encourage commercial banks to serve the microenterprise sector, Accion International was contracted to educate these banks on microenterprise best practices. USAID/Ecuador has successfully achieved the entry of one formal bank into the sector and initiated fundamental changes in the attitude of the formal, commercial banks toward microentrepreneurs, whom they have traditionally shunned.  This institution, called CREDIFE, initiated operations at the end of 1999; as of 9/30/00, it had 2,500 microtenterprise clients.  (6) A Latin American Challenge Investment Fund (LA CIF) was established in 5/99.  This offshore microenterprise guarantee fund is expected to support activities in Latin American countries, especially in Ecuador. The microenterprise program has raised the standard of living of poor, marginalized families in 10 of Ecuador's 22 provinces and enabled them to invest more in education, health care, and other basic services. Almost 100% of village banking clients have been women; as a whole, 76% of the program's beneficiaries were women.  Nevertheless, the banking crisis derailed new programs for USAID-assisted microenterprise lending by two large national banks.  One of the largest surviving banks received training support with USAID funds and started its own microlending program through CREDIFE. In sum, the program reached 54,000 poor (and mostly women) clients with credit assistance, surpassing original targets. Two of the three village banking institutions achieved 100% self-sustainability by the end of FY 2000 and the third reached almost 80%, indicating excellent prospects for their sustainability.  These partners were also working to identify new sources of funding to expand operations. Lessons learned include the following:  (1) NGOs in Ecuador have structural weaknesses that limit their utility in developing stable financial intermediaries serving micro and small businesses.  Legal prohibition on mobilizing savings deposits denies NGOs (except for cooperatives) access to domestic savings.  Nonetheless, NGOs and credit unions can play an important role by creating innovative channels for reaching microentrepreneurs.  (2) To survive, a second tier financing institution needs access to resources at sufficiently cheaper rates than do its first level borrowers.  Careful financial planning is required before creating a second tier organization, to ensure that an economic niche for it exists.  (3) Microentrepreneurs are able and willing to pay extremely high interest rates for short periods of time; this can make an attractive market for commercial lending.  (4) NGO providers of credit have a limited range of financial services.  Either the NGOs must consider a transition to a different type of financial structure to support the growth of their clientele, or other types of organizations must be encouraged to move in and meet this need.  (5) The microenterprise universe is quite diverse and has different needs.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/2000 12:00:00 AM","","Microenterprises|Development finance|Credit|Business support services|Financial institutions|Banks|Commercial banks|Institution building|Human capacity development|Private voluntary organizations|Indigenous private voluntary organizations|Women|Training centers|Microfinance","Ecuador","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABW131.pdf","32 KB","008538 - USAID.

"This final evaluation of the Slovakia Local Government Program looked at the results of the $12 million 7-year local government program, in order to identify/document the strengths and successes of the effort, as well as its failures, and to determine lessons learned for other local government programs in the E&E region. The analysis focused on three aspects of a multi-faceted program: decentralization policy reform, organizational development, and training of local government officials. The conclusions of the analysis have led to a series of ""lessons learned"" for local government programs.

"Evaluates USAID program to encourage a peaceful transition to democracy in Cuba.  Evaluation covers the period from the program's inception in October 1995 to April 2000. To date, USAID has awarded $6,419,275 to 15 NGOs and three universities in the United States to increase the free flow of accurate information on democracy and human rights to, from, and within Cuba. The program has supported activities in six areas:  (1) building solidarity with Cuba's human rights activists; (2) planning for transition; (3) giving voice to Cuba's independent journalists; (4) defending the rights of Cuban workers; (5) helping develop independent Cuban NGOs; and 6) providing direct outreach to the Cuban people. USAID expends approximately $500 million per year on 72 country and regional programs that support democracy and good governance.  The vast majority of these programs are carried out collaboratively with the governments in the countries where activities take place.  USAID's Cuba program is one of a few exceptional cases for several reasons: the Government of Cuba prohibits pro-democracy activity within Cuba and works to thwart the USAID Cuba program; the United States and Cuba do not maintain diplomatic relations; and U.S. law prohibits assistance to the Government of Cuba and its dependencies. As a result of these obstacles, program grantees have encountered difficulty in identifying Cuban partners and promoting the free flow of information to, from, and within Cuba. Despite these difficulties, the USAID Cuba program and its grantees have demonstrated the potential to contribute to a peaceful transition to democracy in Cuba.  While the program is only a small part of the U.S.  Government's approach to Cuba, USAID's encouragement of democratic change in Cuba provides sustenance and information to important actors on the island, within the international community, and to several U.S. civil society organizations that are helping people within Cuba today. USAID's administration of the program has been satisfactory and effective, particularly since it takes place in such a difficult political context and is subjected to constant cross-cutting pressures. The program would benefit from an increase in staff at USAID headquarters and in Havana, the adoption of a research agenda to guide planning and to inform program activities, expanded information sharing and cooperation among grantees, and improved measurement of program performance.

"Evaluates food security (P.L. 480) assistance activities of four cooperating sponsors in Peru for the period 1996-99:  Adventist Development and Relief Agency (ADRA), CARE, Caritas, and Prisma. Activities were carried out in the areas of health and nutrition, agriculture and productive investment, and microcredit. The cooperating sponsors have been ambitious and dedicated in carrying out food security programs and have generally met projected outputs, e.g., numbers of children vaccinated, or hectares of small-farmer production planted using improved seed varieties.  However, they have not collected information on intermediate results that can be used to assess program impact, nor disaggregated budget data for evaluation of cost-effectiveness.  Also, concerns about may be raised about the sustainability of the results achieved in some programs of all four sponsors. At the financial level, international cooperating sponsors demonstrated significantly higher administrative costs than did those of local cooperating sponsors.  Leveraging added more than 56% to the total amounts of Title II assistance monetized during the reporting period. Findings regarding economic cost-effectiveness were as follows:  (1) Health and nutrition programs should focus increasingly on training in basic good practices and the institutional strengthening of and collaboration with public sector institutions that eventually will take over integral health programs.  (2) Organizational strengthening of small-firm economic associations should emphasize business skills, quality control, cost-sharing, and establishing strong business linkages. (3) Agricultural production assistance activities should always be based on market signals and demand, and in particular should rely on and incorporate strategic marketing approaches.  (4) Investments in public infrastructure, from rural access roads to canals and irrigation systems, are problematic in terms of sustainability.  Unless concrete  mechanisms are in place for the self-financing of future operations and maintenance, they should be phased out of the P.L. 480 portfolio, and a concerted effort made to encourage their adoption by responsible public authorities.  (5) Rural microcredit activities remain unproven. Following a defined period of 18-24 additional months, microcredit activities in rural areas should be reviewed to see whether they should continue to be financed by the program. In other areas, concern remains about the effectiveness of the Government of Peru's food distribution activities.  Several reports allege that extreme poverty in rural areas of lesser political or economic importance is not receiving the attention it deserves. Concerns about contracting out could be mitigated if responsibility for implementing the programs were contracted out on a competitive basis to NGOs.  This could also leverage considerable resources to help ensure impact sustainability.  Finally, the cooperating sponsors need to begin tracking such intermediate results as increases in agricultural yields, production, and sales, as well as to track microcredit activity performance by type of client in order to better establish the impact of their programs.
