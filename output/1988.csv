"A comprehensive review of 212 evaluation reports (ERs) from FY 1985 and 1986, this document focuses on five key topics (implementation constraints, sustainability, women in development, environmental impacts, and private sector initiatives) in order to provide a distillation of recent experience and to identify patterns of both problems and successes.  The document uses a rating system to assess the significance of about 40 subtopics related to the five topics mentioned above. Findings are as follows. (1) Implementation constraints. About a third of the ERs reported that project design and adequacy of borrower/grantee staffing and budgeting were severe constraints to implementation success; projects with minimal implementation constraints were associated with strong management, well defined roles, relationships and responsibilities in project design, and activities that addressed needs clearly perceived by participants and beneficiaries. (2) Sustainability.  Good project sustainability was associated most with positive ratings for technology acceptance (31%)  and strength of project constituency and host country policies (24% and 21%).  Poor sustainability was associated with negative ratings for organizational/institutional capacity, for financial provision for operation and maintenance, and for management capacity. (3) Women in Development.  WID was a major purpose in about 15% of the projects.  Successful projects tended to have positive ratings for strengthening locally based women's institutions, including women as participants in project design/planning, and extending services for women into rural areas. (4)  Environment.  About 29% of the ERs made some sort of statement about environmental impact. Typically, high-rated environmental projects were associated with strong institution building components and the provision of medium-term economic motivation for improved resource management. (5) Private sector. About 21% of the ERs were concerned with private enterprise development.  Key findings in this area included (inter alia):  many A.I.D. projects are not designed explicitly to achieve certain desired impacts (e.g., employment creation); evaluation procedures are not adequate to capture the failure of projects to generate such desired impacts, and quality of design received the highest percentage of strongly negative ratings for private enterprise projects. Includes five annexes describing in detail the study's methodology.","Earlier ed.: Synthesis of AID evaluation reports FY 85 and 86|(PD-ACP-528)","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","3/1/1988 12:00:00 AM","","Development project evaluation|Evaluation methodology|Environmental aspects|Private sector|Women in development|Project sustainability|Development project implementation","Latin America|Caribbean|East Africa","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAW776.pdf","4,056 KB","","","003433 - USAID.

"During the 1960's and the 1970's, A.I.D. supported three newly established Nigerian universities via three cooperating U.S. land grant universities - Ahmadu Bello University (Kansas State University), the University of Ife (the University of Wisconsin), and the University of Nigeria at Nsukka (Michigan State University).  This study identifies the impacts of these projects. All three universities have expanded exponentially - from a few hundred students to 21,000 at Ahmadu Bello (including its non-degree granting schools), 13,000 at Ife, and 12,000 at Nsukka.  Their brief history encompasses four eras of Nigerian history: the heady period of independence beginning in 1960; the 1967-70 civil war; the oil-boom years of the later 1970's; and the oil-bust period from the early 1980's to the present. Efforts to transfer the tripartite land-grant model (teaching, research, extension) to Nigeria had mixed success.  Ahmadu Bello comes closest to the model in practice.  Staff at the other two universities understand and appreciate the concept but have been limited in their ability to practice it.  All three universities have adopted the model's teaching component, but only Ahmadu Bello, because it incorporated established Nigerian research institutes at its founding, has produced significant achievements in research and extension.  Thus, while the universities have contributed to solving Nigeria's agricultural problems (e.g., through staff participation in state, federal, and parastatal commissions, the development of improved food crop varieties, and research in production economics and animal health), their impact (except at Ahmadu Bello) has been less than expected. Three factors seem to have determined the universities' impact: (1) the reluctance of government ministries to transfer research and extension responsibilities to the universities; (2) the failure of the universities' promotion and incentive systems to reward research and outreach by staff; and (3) the declining financial fortunes of the universities resulting from the sharp drop in oil prices in recent years. Several lessons were learned.  (1) Of the three components of the U.S. land-grant model, teaching is the easiest to transfer.  (2) Structural factors in many countries inhibit the development of relevant, problemsolving research and extension.  (3) It is unrealistic to expect a university to be a major influence without a suitable incentive and reward system for its staff.

"The Superior Institute of Agriculture (ISA) was created in 1962 by a group of socially minded community leaders to remedy the Dominican Republic's lack of trained agricultural manpower. Originally a high school, ISA was later expanded to include an undergraduate degree program through a local university, as well as a specialized non-degree program in rural development administration.  It recently gained autonomous university status. This report focuses on ISA's development impact. These impacts have been numerous and important.  ISA's training is generally regarded as excellent.  Current and former faculty are vitally involved in national decisionmaking regarding agricultural and rural development, either indirectly (via research) or directly (via government employment or consultation).  ISA faculty have conducted innovative commodity research which has led to important foreign exchange savings and have influenced government policy on critical issues such as agrarian reform and reforestation. Several factors account for ISA's vitality:  continuous, strong leadership from its founding group; early institution-building inputs by Texas A&M University; responsiveness to societal needs; innovative training and other programs funded by the Dominican Secretariat of Agriculture (DSOA), A.I.D., and other donors; and ISA's own commitment to quality education.  Constraining factors include an overly theoretical curriculum, insufficient linkages with research and outreach activities, and pressures on ISA to turn to the private sector in the light of dwindling government/donor support (which threatens to divert ISA's attention from the small-farm sector) and to reduce or terminate its technical/vocational program (despite the present shortage of lower- and mid-level agricultural technicians). Lessons learned include the following.  (1) An agricultural college needs strong, supporting linkages to its primary bureaucratic constituency (in this case, the DSOA).  (2) Donors should follow institution-building efforts with projects to build linkages to research and outreach.  (3) Moderate resource scarcity can generate institutional entrepreneurship and innovation.  (4) External funding should not infringe on the recipient's basic institutional autonomy, which may be a major impetus to social relevancy.  (5) Institutional autonomy needs to be coupled with direct accountability to ensure responsiveness to societal needs; oversight by the founding group is an important mechanism in this regard.  A 15-page Spanish/English bibliography is included among the appendices.

"In response to the high levels of Third World under- and unemployment, A.I.D. has increasingly funded employment generation (EG) projects, particularly in the off-farm sector. This study reviews over 30 such projects, with a focus on the policy environment as it relates to distortions in foreign exchange, factor, and product pricing. Initial sections present the conflicting views of the employment problem in the literature, summarize current A.I.D. strategies in the area, and present the basic concept underlying the study's approach, namely, that of aggregate production function, according to which (other things being equal) increased growth means increased employment.  The paper's central section examines five different types of EG projects - vocational education, labor-intensive infrastructure, Food for Work (FFW), export promotion, and small-scale enterprise (SSE) credit and technical assistance - reviewing each type in terms of its success, policy context, and lessons learned.  A final section specifies relevant factors in the policy environment for the five areas studied (though acknowledging the study's weak empirical base) and discusses the study's programming implications.  Two areas requiring urgent donor attention are noted:  the vitality of the informal sector in creating new jobs and the feasibility of export promotion projects in the present international economic environment. General conclusions on the projects studied are as follows.  (1) As tools for EG, vocational education programs frequently had poor payoffs, suggesting caution in their future use.  (2) Labor-intensive infrastructure and FFW projects are promising on paper, yet enountered multiple problems and typically affected small numbers of workers. There is a need to strengthen economic analysis of these projects, especially of FFW.  (3) Export promotion projects are closely tied to exchange rates - the variable most closely associated with economic growth, according to a World Bank study.  (4) SSE projects provided some employment, but sometimes at great cost per job. Overall, the results of EG projects were middling or disappointing. Women were generally given no special consideration, equity was sometimes ill served, management was always difficult, and the projects were hostage to an economic and administrative environment beyond their control.  Appendices include a list of conditions promoting the success of the five types of EG projects studied and a list of sectoral policies, suggesting a wide range of policy options.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","3/1/1988 12:00:00 AM","","Employment|Development project design|Development strategies|Economic policy|Policy reform|Unemployment|Underemployment|Labor policy|Employment policy","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAX203.pdf","291 KB","003433 - USAID.

"This is one of three reports that evaluate at midterm A.I.D.'s Family Planning Training for Paramedical/Auxiliary/ Community Personnel II (PAC II) project.  It reviews progress made by the contractor, Program for International Training in Health (INTRAH), in meeting project goals between 1984 and 1987.  PAC II's main purpose is to increase the capability of less developed country (LDC) institutions (both in-country and regional), to train PAC workers to provide family planning services. The contract called for allocating 80% of contract resources to Africa, where provision of family planning services is still relatively undeveloped and the need for training for providers of these services is acute.  The strategy employed in Africa was to develop a group of core trainers from within the institutions, mostly Ministries of Health, targeted for assistance.  Although INTRAH has introduced a good number of African family planning trainers to new experiential training methods, the evaluation found that there were neither time nor resources to provide the broad spectrum of skills deemed necessary.  Gaps were identified in the areas of needs assessment and design of training programs, evaluation, and curriculum development.  At this point, it is apparent that it will be several years before host country training in Africa is institutionalized. In Africa, most training has been targeted toward clinical providers. In contrast, in Asia efforts have focused on training for various groups of community-based distributors, including some very successful efforts with young village women and traditional medical practitioners. Most of the organizations assisted, however, were judged well along in their ability to operate in a self-sufficient manner, and INTRAH assistance, while helpful, was not deemed critical. Development of regional training institutions was designated as a major focus of activities in Asia, where two existing regional institutions were already successfully providing training.  Under the contract, participants from some African institutions have benefited from exposure to CBD training activities in the Asian setting.  Of the five regional institutions targeted for assistance in Africa, however, none was deemed to have begun to achieve institutional self-sufficiency. Project management has been competent with most quantitative goals met or surpassed.  The greatest weakness was in the area of evaluation, both with respect to training trainers how to evaluate their own efforts and with respect to self-assessment of project performance.

"This is one of three reports that evaluate at midterm A.I.D.'s Family Planning Training for Paramedical/Auxiliary/Community Personnel II (PAC II) project.  It reviews progress made by the contractor, RONCO Consulting Corporation, in achieving project goals in the Near East and North Africa between 1984 and 1987. PAC II's main purpose is to increase the capability of LDC institutions (both in- country and regional) to train PAC workers to provide family planning services. RONCO has been operating in a region where wide differences in attitudes toward family planning, and extreme cultural and developmental variations among the countries, have made the job of training family planning workers very difficult.  Compounded by RONCO's own inexperience as a training contractor, these problems have resulted in a considerable shortfall in the number of trainees who should have been trained at the time of the evaluation. RONCO's main achievements were seen to be limited to promoting its goals among training team members and government officials. From a practical standpoint, however, although trainers trained by RONCO were enthusiastic about the participatory methods they were being taught, they were judged to need more support and follow-up when they began to operate on their own. For a number of reasons beyond RONCO's control (primarily lack of government interest), little had been accomplished in the area of pre-service clinical skills training. Principal recommendations called for a number of major personnel and organizational changes, as well as a concerted effort to plan future activities using measurable objectives.  For the remainder of the project period, it was recommended that RONCO limit its activities to four countries - Egypt, Jordan, Tunisia, and Turkey.

"Evaluates project to strengthen Uganda's national oral rehydration treatment (ORT) program.  External evaluation covers the period 1984-87; methodology is not noted. On the whole, the purpose of the project - to increase awareness of ORT and the availability of oral rehydration salts in Uganda - is being achieved. The considerable political unrest in Uganda during the first phase of the project and the resulting economic collapse have been and continue to be major obstacles to the implementation of any development activity. The USAID mission was actually closed after the coup in 1985 and has been reestablished only recently. International staff were reluctant to stay in or come to Uganda (which had an impact on the technical assistance provided by UNICEF) and the national staff that still remained in the country worked in extremely difficult material conditions.  Considering the situation, UNICEF, and also Ministry of Health staff, should be commended for what has been done to date. Many problems encountered by the project have to be viewed within that context.  At this point, the supply of oral rehydration salts to Uganda is slowly catching up with the backlog; a reliable and timely delivery system is a prerequisite to more effective - and much needed - in-country management.  The health staff training component of the program has, on the whole, been implemented satisfactorily.  The operational research component is suffering from a lack of technical expertise and is still in the initial stages. The second phase of the project will focus on reaching the population and will include a major mass communications component.  Management issues at the peripheral health units should also be addressed if efficient and appropriate basic health care is going to be provided to the rural areas.  The government's policy move towards decentralization, integration, and promotion of self-reliance activity should be encouraged.

"Summarizes attached evaluation of a project to rehabilitate Cairo's sewerage system.  Evaluation covered the period 1981-87 and was based on document review, inspections of sewers and pump stations, and interviews with sewer cleaners and repairmen, community leaders and residents, and project staff. The evaluation found that there had been an 84% reduction in chronic sewerage flooding since the project was initiated in 1981.  Of the 67 areas with chronic flooding problems identified in 1981, only 11 remain, with 12 other areas experiencing occasional, localized flooding. Similarly, residential complaints about flooding have dropped markedly; Cairo sanitation officials credit the project with this drop. Surveys of residents show that 76% are aware of the project and could cite problems which the project had reduced (e.g., foul odors, mosquitoes and flies, increase in diseases, difficulty in walking or driving through the streets, etc.). Continuing flooding problems can be traced in some areas to increased population density and illegal housing; in other areas, lack of waste disposal systems lead residents to dump garbage directly into the sewers.  Industries and public institutions are also known to abuse the sewerage system by dumping chemical and solid wastes. The Mission comments that continued flooding is largely caused by industrial abuse.  Solid wastes (from tanneries in particular) damage and clog secondary pipelines, which the Cairo General Organization for Sanitary Damage cannot afford to correct or replace.  Sewer maintenance operations are being upgraded, however, and the Mission will work with the Governorate of Cairo (GC) to end industrial system abuse.  The GC has also begun a pilot garbage collection service in two affluent areas; if successful, the service will be expanded.","Attachment: XD-AAX-624-A","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","3/1/1988 12:00:00 AM","","Sanitation engineering|Sewage system maintenance|Sewage systems|Quality of life|Living conditions|Urban areas","Egypt","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAX624.pdf","1,793 KB","008539 - USAID.

"Evaluates the management and performance of A.I.D.'s Center for Development Information and Evaluation within the Bureau for Policy and Program Coordination (CDIE/PPC).  Evaluation covers the period 1983-88 and is based on document review and interviews with CDIE staff and officials of USAID Missions, A.I.D. offices, and other donors and international organizations. CDIE's goals and objectives, as mandated in the 1982 General Accounting Office report that was the genesis of CDIE, have remained valid.  CDIE management and staff have done an outstanding job, both in terms of establishing CDIE as a bona fide center for development information and in developing useful information services.  It has established a credible A.I.D. memory, increased dramatically the demand for its information services, provided guidance and stewardship in evaluation, and has given A.I.D. a position of leadership in the donor community in the information and evaluation fields. There remains room for improvement, however, especially in terms of linking CDIE more effectively with A.I.D. policy priorities and promoting within the Agency a wider knowledge of CDIE services.  While USAID Missions and A.I.D./W offices alike express satisfaction with CDIE services, a clear perception persists that the results of CDIE evaluations and lessons learned are not regularly or evenly used in Mission project and program development exercises.  There is a need for more targeting of evaluation studies to users. CDIE is well located within PPC, but suffers from physical isolation from other PPC offices.  Communication with other PPC offices needs to be improved.  Another recommendation is for CDIE to reorganize resource allocations in order to increase utilization of its evaluation results and information services. If the demand for CDIE services continues to grow, and budget and staff allocations remain at current levels, the quality of CDIE's product will undoubtedly suffer.

"Evaluates project to improve health financing, health management training, and clinical training in Latin America and the Caribbean. Mid-term evaluation covers the period 1985-87 and is based on document review, and interviews with A.I.D., contractor, and other involved personnel. The management training component, implemented by the Association of University Programs in Health Administration (AUPHA), has produced analytic assessments of training needs in 12 participating countries; held four workshops (on health services administration training, hospital management training, undergraduate education, and project management training) with a total of 114 participants; provided TA in curriculum and materials development to several in-country training programs; and developed new publications for health management trainers. The clinical training component has had limited success.  While short-term preceptorship training has been provided in the United States to 22 physicians (in line with target), the lack of adequate criteria for trainee selection has obviated any possibility for a strong multiplier effect.  The component has provided only limited TA (one workshop and a week of lectures and seminars in El Salvador).  The relative weakness of this component is perhaps due to the fact that the implementing agency, the Interamerican College of Physicians and Surgeons (ICPS), has experienced a difficult adjustment as a new A.I.D. contractor.  ICPS communication with A.I.D. Missions has been particularly deficient. The health care financing component, which is implemented by the State University of New York (SUNY), has produced eight country studies (four of which are currently being used by host government planners, but others of questionable value) and a state-of-the-art paper which requires revision; workshops to disseminate this information will be held in 1988.  Limited short-term TA has been provided as well.  The overall quality of SUNY's services has been uneven. A number of recommendations are made to address project shortcomings. These include, inter alia, expanding the management training component into Eastern Caribbean countries not yet served by the project and improving information dissemination activities; improving selection of candidates for the clinical training component; and increasing health finance TA for LAC Missions during the remainder of the project. The project teaches that effective utilization of technical and project services depends on continued dialogue between the contractor and the client Mission or host country.  Regional projects are utilized according to the degree Missions are aware of the services they provide; the burden of this communication must fall on the contractor.","Attachments: XD-KAM-072-A, XD-KAM-072-B, XD-KAM-072-C|Companion evaluation summary: PD-ABC-341","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","3/1/1988 12:00:00 AM","","Health professional education|Management training|Health finance|Regional development|Participants","Latin America","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDKAM072.pdf","10,133 KB","000981 - Pragma Corp.","","000114 - USAID.

"Evaluates project, implemented by Kansas State University's Food and Feed Grain Institute (FFGI), to help LDC's improve their postharvest grain systems.  Evaluation covers 9/80-3/88 and is based on document review and interviews with staff of FFGI, USAID/Costa Rica, and USAID/Belize, and with LDC cooperators. FFGI has built an excellent reputation based on its highly qualified professional staff and 20 years of continuous work in the field.  While most FFGI efforts are oriented toward public sector agencies, its recent work in Costa Rica and Belize in guiding the privatization of marketing board operations is a commendable example of assistance to the private sector. Further, FFGI's work, given its depth of outreach, is more likely to achieve permanent results than are more fragmented efforts. However, the many funding reductions which FFGI has had to accommodate threaten these achievements.  The possibility that Mission buy-ins may make up for some of the shortfall must be balanced by the variability of such funding and work. FFGI is, to a degree, isolated.  Networking, especially collaboration with other S&T agricultural research programs, should be expanded and efforts should be made to form stronger links with the international agricultural research centers, particularly to strengthen postharvest considerations in the CGIAR crop breeding programs.  Similarly, further attention should be given to the reporting of FFGI accomplishments, through case studies, annual reports, public relations materials for LDC audiences, and a newsletter for former students and other sector professionals. With regard to institutionalization, more attention should be given to involvement with Mississippi State University and the Government of Honduras in the proposed international seed and grain center in Honduras.  Such a center could significantly reinforce and expand FFGI's research, training, and technology transfer capabilities. Other needs are for FFGI to:  develop a system of ongoing internal program evaluation; initiate further studies to establish the size, location, and timing of losses and to guide research into cost-effective preventive measures; and continue to expand its Post Harvest Documentation Service (PHDS), while finding means to cooperate with a proposed FAO Asian database on postharvest losses. Lastly, an increase in A.I.D. core funding is critical to FFGI's future success.  More cuts would mean loss of activities, and ultimately, possible program elimination. The project teaches:  continuity of financial support is crucial; buy-ins are not appropriate for providing a high proportion of support to professional organizations; a critical mass of assistance in a given country is essential to institutionalization.","Delivery order no. 12|Companion project evaluation summary: PD-AAZ-291","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-1406-I-00-7011-00","","4/1/1988 12:00:00 AM","","Post harvest food losses|Cereal crops|Food crops|Feeds|Institution building|Agricultural research|Central funding","Costa Rica|Belize|Honduras","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAX695.pdf","1,140 KB","000480 - Experience, Inc.","","000180 - USAID.

"Project Assistance Completion Report on a project (FY79-87) to improve the primary school curriculum in Eastern Caribbean countries. It was expected that ten countries would participate fully in the project.  However, Grenada withdrew during the first year of project implementation and only rejoined following the U.S.-led intervention in that country in 1983.  It should be noted that by October, 1985, project implementation was completed in all countries except Grenada and that the last two PACD extensions were required to facilitate the completion of activities in that island.  All project activities have now been satisfactorily completed. This project benefitted from three external evaluations, one in 1981, another in 1982 and a final evaluation in 1985.  At the time of the last evaluation, project implementation was nearing completion in all countries except Grenada.  The evaluation found that (a) new curricula and teacher and student materials had been developed and reproduced in low-cost format and disseminated to schools; (b) teachers from five pilot schools in each country (Grenada excluded) had become skilled in the use of new instructional materials, new methods of teaching, classroom testing and curriculum development techniques; (c) principals of the pilot schools had been trained in educational planning and administration; and (d) the grantee, the University of the West Indies (UWI), had enhanced its capability to assist Eastern Caribbean countries in their educational development programs. During the post-evaluation period, Grenada successfully completed a curriculum development and training program similar to that undertaken in the other Eastern Caribbean countries. Several important lessons were learned from this project.  Two of the most significant ones are as follows.  (1) In a regional project of this nature, full-time Local Coordinators should be used:  In this project, unlike the Secondary Curriculum Project, Project Implementation Officers/Local Coordinators were employed on a full-time basis. Experience showed that this led to more efficient project implementation.  (2) Local expertise should be used wherever possible. The extensive use of West Indian educators in every major aspect of project design, implementation and evaluation was, perhaps, the single most important factor which contributed to the success of the project. UWI satisfied all preconditions set out in the Grant Agreement and adhered to the special covenants.  No follow-on monitoring responsibilities were stipulated in the Agreement.

"Final Mission report on a project component (FY83-87) to stengthen the capacity of the Barbados Institute of Management and Productivity (BIMAP) to provide training and TA to private enterprises. BIMAP worked directly with over 400 small and medium-size businesses in ten Caribbean countries and trained over 600 managers.  Enterprises which received assistance from BIMAP showed improvement in employee work habits and skills. This project experienced long start-up delays.  A mid-term evaluation in 12/85 made a number of recommendations, of which the most significant was to reorganize the project in order to: (1) provide more effective promotion, follow-up, scheduling, training, and reporting; and (2) enable BIMAP to focus more completely on what it does best (i.e., providing training and counseling services to small and medium-size businesses in areas of accounting, financing, computerization and costing) in a reduced number of participating countries. Following this recommendation, the technical and geographical focus of the project was reduced.  Training and consultancy services were provided in a reduced number of technical areas primarily to six Eastern Caribbean countries.  A Memorandum of Understanding was also signed between BIMAP and the Caribbean Association of Industry and Commerce (CAIC) to secure promotion of this project by CAIC, and to encourage collaboration between BIMAP and the A.I.D.-funded Small Enterprise Assistance project implemented by CAIC.  The object of the collaboration was to (a) avoid duplication of efforts and (b) encourage the recognition of BIMAP as a deliverer of services in certain defined areas of management training and consultancy. One of the important lessons learned is that if an institution without a regional mandate is selected as grantee for a regional project, a more intensive promotional effort is needed to encourage region-wide acceptance of that institution as implementing agency for the project.  Many of the delays experienced in implementation were related to the unanticipated length of time and effort which BIMAP had to invest to gain an entree into the business communities of many of the Eastern Caribbean countries. BIMAP satisfied all preconditions in the Grant Agreement and adhered to the special covenants.  The low level of counterpart contribution is due to (a) a lower rate of fee collection than anticipated and (b) training for a smaller number of BIMAP staff than planned, thus requiring a lower level of BIMAP contribution to meet salary of staff in training.

"Summarizes final external evaluation (PD-AAX-825) of a cooperative agreement with the Population Council (PC) to conduct contraceptive development/introduction and family planning (FP) support activities. Evaluation covers 1983-88; no methodology is noted. PC has one of the most successful public sector programs in the contraceptive development field. Its research, both basic and applied, has been outstanding, and PC has introduced more new methods to the marketplace than any other program. In addition to NORPLANT and the Copper T380A IUD, which are now in the introduction stage, PC is developing several promising new products, including NORPLANT-2 rods, the levonorgestrel (LNG) IUD, implants using the steroids ST-1435 and 3-Ketodesogestrel, and three different vaginal rings. PC has performed impressively in introducing NORPLANT and the Copper T380A, although progress has been slower for the former due to the absence of U.S. Federal Drug Administration approval. A.I.D. support has been a critical factor in PC's success. PC's FP program, which has been responsive to A.I.D.'s changing priorities over the years, includes operations research, TA, exploration of new programs, and the production of informational/educational materials. Following considerable involvement in Asia and Latin America, PC is now focusing on Africa, an area in which A.I.D. support has again been crucial. The major concern is insufficient PC staffing in certain key areas of the contraceptive development process, including dosage formulation, toxicology, regulatory affairs, and clinical trial monitoring. Some of the delays in registering NORPLANT in the United States can be traced to staffing problems. PC deserves continued and expanded A.I.D. support. Major recommendations are that: (1) A.I.D. gradually increase PC's funding by about 50% over the next few years; (2) PC recruit additional staff to fill key positions; and (3) PC develop a long-range plan specifying its optimal organizational size. Other key recommendations are that: A.I.D. continue its policy of line-item funding for major research areas (e.g., NORPLANT 2), but allow PC discretionary use of 10% of the contraceptive development budget; A.I.D. increase funding for the contraceptive introduction program to permit hiring of additional field staff, particularly for Africa; PC work to expedite each country's registration of NORPLANT; PC seek greater involvement in contraceptive introduction activities by major service delivery programs, donors, and TA agencies; and A.I.D. maintain its ability to tap PC's field experience and expertise by continuing the FP component.","Complete report: PD-AAX-825|Project title: Population technical assistance (POPTECH)","Special Evaluation","Documents","DPE-3024-Z-00-7079-00","","5/1/1988 12:00:00 AM","","Technological development|Technology transfer|Contraceptive research|Research organizations|Contraceptive agents and devices|Population programs|Personnel development|Barrier methods (birth control)|Intrauterine devices|Contraceptive side effects|Contraceptive dosage level|Diaphragms|Steroids|Toxicology|Information dissemination|Technical assistance|Contraceptive implants","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAX746.pdf","1,120 KB","000673 - International Science and Technology Institute, Inc.

"Evaluates project to strengthen the capacity of LDC institutions to develop family planning (FP) training programs for paramedical, auxiliary, and community (PAC) personnel. External evaluation covers the first 2.5 years of the 10-year project. Progress has been made in a number of areas. The number of trainees has already exceeded target in Asia and Latin America (regions with more highly developed training institutions), while being on target in Africa, and falling short in the Near East/North Africa region. Only in Africa has any progress been made in developing pre-service curricula -- probably because the need for in-service training remains relatively more important. The project has apparently served to enhance the status and responsibility of PAC workers in some cases (though much remains to be done); to increase access to FP services in rural Asia and Latin America (though not in Africa, where efforts in rural areas are tied to the government's ability to provide basic health care); and to increase contraceptive use in some cases (though not enough to affect contraceptive prevalence rates). Project contractors (which have responsibility for different geographic regions) are pursuing two major institution-building strategies: strengthening training institutions; and strengthening country training systems. The latter, being broader, may take significantly longer to accomplish, especially in Africa, where FP services are delivered mainly through Ministries of Health, which are resistant to change. Related to institutionalization, three major issues which have arisen during the project should influence programming decisions in the near future: (a) the proper mix between pre- and in-service training of nurses and (b) between training of community-based and clinic-based workers; and (c) whether personnel should be trained to work in integrated primary health care/FP programs. Training targets have been appropriate, but a major weakness has been a failure to develop indicators of training quality, resulting in an unsystematic approach to training of trainers and a lack of guidelines for training community and clinic-based workers (these guidelines, however, are now being developed separately by two of the contractors). There is also a need to: consider client (rather than PAC worker) needs when designing training programs; include AIDS in the curriculum; produce/disseminate more training materials; and increase contractor networking. All contractors are experiencing difficulty in developing the capacity of regional institutions. The centrally funded approach to this project has proven appropriate. The use of several contractors has also proven beneficial, although a single contractor might offer other advantages.","Project title: Population technical assistance (POPTECH)","Special Evaluation","Documents","DPE-3024-C-00-4063-00|DPE-3024-Z-00-7079-00","","5/1/1988 12:00:00 AM","","Family planning|Paramedical education|Nursing education|Training centers|Institution building|Regional development|National level|Curriculum design|Educational materials|Teacher training|Community health workers|Community based delivery|Family planning clinics|Continuing education|Central funding","Asia|Africa|Latin America|Caribbean|Middle East","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAX752.pdf","3,909 KB","000673 - International Science and Technology Institute, Inc.

"Evaluates project component, implemented by the International Statistical Programs Center (ISPC), to support LDC population censuses. Interim evaluation covers the period through 5/88. By increasing increase LDC institutional capacity and skills in census taking, ISPC activities fill an important niche in the overall program of international assistance to census operations. IPSC staff seem to be functioning at top capacity, responding well to the pressure that exists to put out immediately salable products.  In the process, there appears to be little room for the kind of creative activities that might be most productive in the somewhat longer run (i.e., the 1990 round of censuses). The heavy workload and a lack of resources have also resulted in too little attention having been given to communication in general, and to reporting and monitoring in particular. The assistance provided by ISPC, whether TA, training materials support or workshops, has on the whole been competent, professional, and timely.  Workshops, particularly country workshops for persons involved in census data processing and mapping, have been pertinent and useful. The TA has been varied and has met many of the needs expressed by LDC personnel.  ISPC publications, particularly Popstan, have been useful as guides to various aspects of census operations.  A number of gaps were identified, however.  Of prime importance were problems in planning and management, but there were also weaknesses in questionnaire design, data quality, and survey methods.  There is some need for more in-depth treatment of technical areas.  In addition, a lack both of French-speaking TA staff and French-language materials was identified. The Census Bureau software that has been and is being developed under another project component and with other funds has made feasible the processing of a national census on microcomputers. Human and financial resources are limited, however, for further major software projects. The gulf between data collection and data analysis - a familiar issue in census work in both developed and less developed countries -  is clearly a problem in sub-Saharan Africa.  The focus on collection to the exclusion of analysis means that the results are not adequately exploited for planning with respect to education, health, employment, and other critical areas, and the data required for projections and the study of population dynamics are often not being produced. Coordination among international organizations, among donors in the field, and among the various levels of A.I.D. deserves close attention. Problems exist at each level, leading to uncertainty in host countries and a piecemeal approach to planning.  The ad hoc Committee on Interagency Coordination represents a promising start toward meeting one aspect of this need.

"Evaluates Phase I (1984-4/88) of a project to conduct operations research (OR) aimed at improving family planning (FP) programs. The evaluation is based largely on interviews and compares the present project with the previous OR program (1973-84). This project has continued A.I.D.'s OR program in:  providing TA and financial support to improve FP delivery in LDC's through subprojects (SP's) that diagnose existing service delivery problems; testing new approaches to service delivery; and collecting and disseminating information useful for improving service delivery.  Prior to this project, SP's involved household- and community-based distribution of pills, condoms and, less often, spermicides in rural areas; contraceptives and services were generally provided for free.  Studies often used baseline and endline surveys and quasi-experimental designs and were mainly interested in contraceptive prevalence (CP); the methodology was one of testing different approaches (""learning by doing""). Only about a third of the more recent SP's follow this model. Newer SP's are more likely to:  be clinic based and set in urban areas; feature paid services or purchased commodities; stress referrals and information, education, and communication; and promote male methods and IUD's.  Output measures increasingly focus on cost-effectiveness, self-sufficiency, and efficiency rather simply CP. Although quasi-experimental designs still predominate, more of the recent studies have no control group and could be considered diagnostic studies.  Data collection is now most frequently based on service statistics, service provider and patient/client interviews, administrative/cost records, and qualitative approaches. Those interviewed for the evaluation unanimously supported the continuance of the OR program, which has to a considerable extent become localized and is now meeting country and project level needs for improving FP service delivery.  The technical contributions of the OR staff in Washington (OR/W) were mentioned frequently. Critical comments emerging from the interviews included:  (1) inadequate attention by OR/W to institution building; (2) in some cases, a rigidity inhibiting adaptation to local conditions; (3) the program's lack of visibility to those not directly participating and its separateness from other A.I.D. FP evaluation activities; (4) occasional micro-managing by OR/W, leading to SP delay; and (5) overemphasis on the number of SP's initiated and on CP at the expense of TA and more general and cross-regional products.  The interviews revealed that OR/W is aware of these problems - a fact of which field staff may not be aware. A 5-year extension is recommended.  Other recommendations address the problems noted above.

"Evaluates project to conduct research and policy analyses to support efforts to stimulate employment growth via small and medium enterprise (SME) development.  Mid-term evaluation covers the period 9/84-1988. The major finding of the evaluation team is that the project has developed state-of-the-art research documents which question the initial project assumption that support of all SME's will result in rapid employment growth in all countries. The following are the Evaluation Team's conclusions.  (1) State-of-the-art research has been conducted and published by the project.  The research base and methodology developed by the project could enable USAID Missions to deal more effectively with employment generation as a policy issue.  Dissemination of the findings needs to be improved.  (2) Satisfactory long- and short-term TA activities have been conducted by the project.  The project needs to consider coordination issues and procedures for developing a larger project memory of the findings of TA activities.  (3) Sustainable policy change has resulted from several of the TA activities.  Success appears to be tied to extensive involvement of Mission and host-country officials; successful processes for achieving this involvement should be recorded and institutionalized. Other findings follow.  (1) The project should include more input from A.I.D. staff working in policy analysis and reform.  (2) The project has not filed the required quarterly report for its long-term field projects.  (3) The project needs to review the contract objective of institution/network building and determine if it continues to be essential to the success of the project. (4) The required annual workplans do not provide adequate detail to enable S&T/RD/EED to make administrative and budgetary decisions.  (5) The project administrators must define what is being done by whom, for how much time at what rate. (6) The project contractors (Harvard Institute for International Development, Michigan State University, and Development Alternatives, Inc.) are geographically separated, a situation that requires a strong coordination plan.  Quality control has not been consistent, nor have internal project communications allowed for peer review of documents. (7) Familiarity with the project among A.I.D. personnel is not optimal. Improvement in the presentation and dissemination of EEPA products is needed. Recommendations directly address the above issues.

"Evaluates project to assist LDC's in conducting 35 demographic/health surveys and 25 further analysis studies. External evalation covers 9/84-12/87 and is based on a site visit, interview, and document review. The contract to implement 35 surveys over 5 years has required a torrid pace.  In a short period of time, the contractor - the Westinghouse Institute for Resource Development (WIRD) - has developed survey instruments, supporting documents, and computer software, and has collected a remarkably large and complex volume of data.  Originally 21 short-instrument, 10 long-instrument, and 4 in-depth surveys were planned.  The current schedule includes 29 long-instrument, 2 in-depth, 2 male-respondent, and 2 experimental surveys.  Of the 29, 12 are in sub-Saharan Africa, 10 in Latin America/Caribbean, and 7 in Asia and North Africa combined.  Both experimental surveys were carried out in Latin America.  One in-depth survey occurred in Nepal; another is planned for Egypt. As of now, final reports on 3 of the surveys have been published, and 2 are in press.  Twelve standard surveys (plus 5 non-standard) are scheduled to have final reports completed sometime in 1988.  Along with the remaining 12 (plus one in-depth), this means that 30 survey reports need completion before the project terminates in 9/89.  The workload to be completed is clearly overwhelming. The 25 further analyses (under development primarily by the subcontractor - the Population Council) have of necessity been backed into the last 2 years of the project; 5 of these are near official completion.  Due to the belated implementation of this activity, the analyses could not be evaluated here.  Attention needs to be given to the timely completion of the remaining analyses. With A.I.D. cognizance, the course of project implementation has departed importantly, and most likely for the better, from the original contract plan.  WIRD has undertaken more extensive data collection (e.g., a major and expansive set of child health questions) than planned.  It has also adopted microcomputer technology exclusively for data processing and analysis, developed in-house software for this purpose, and distributed four times as many microcomputers as called for in the contract. The impressive and rapid pace of implementation, however, has been purchased at the cost of lost opportunities for timely analysis and reflection on the data gathered.  The microcomputer technology developed may have contributed to improved data quality, but this remains to be assessed.  A more structured opportunity within Phase II for consideration of the information benefits of WIRD's massive data collection effort is recommended.

"Evaluates project to improve the administration of justice in Latin America and the Caribbean. First interim evaluation covers 3/85-4/88 and is based largely on interviews. This complex and ambitious project is operating in all target countries and has made significant progress. The Latin American Institute for the Prevention of Crime and Treatment of the Offender (ILANUD), the implementing agency, has doubled its staff and taken important steps to improve its ability to handle A.I.D. funds and meet its project responsibilities. National criminal justice commissions have been established in all core countries except El Salvador. All but one of the core countries and three of the South American countries have undertaken or are planning bilateral programs to improve their criminal justice systems. By the end of 1988, ILANUD will have exceeded training and substantially fulfilled TA targets and supplied all core countries with basic criminal justice libraries. By mid-1988, six country judicial sector assessments will have been completed and national workshops held to discuss them. Shortfalls and problems are not lacking, however. ILANUD's major TA program is behind schedule and its provision of TA in response to national requests lacks focus and clear impact. The national commissions need much more assistance than anticipated. Sector assessments have not been used to prepare strategies and programs. ILANUD's training program lacks a follow-up mechanism and an evaluation system, does not focus on national problems to the extent desirable, and is not coordinated with related efforts (e.g., the Harvard Law School Project in Guatemala). Also, Mission bilateral programs have not relied on the project to the extent expected, partly because there is no system of coordination among participating entities and partly because of the overwhelming responsibility placed on the Regional Administration of Justice Office by both the project design and the circumstances of implementation. The main challenge now is further strengthening of ILANUD, especially in management areas - policy, planning, evaluation, role definition, setting of staff responsibilities, and forging of client relationships. Assistance in these areas needs to be increased. The magnitude and nature of this assistance will depend on whether the project is expanded to include South America in all activities and whether A.I.D. includes ILANUD in bilateral programs. It is likely that by the PACD the project, while achieving its minimum objectives, will have little significant impact on the actual operations of judicial systems or on public perception of the fairness of these systems. Moreover, ILANUD will probably be unable to sustain its current activity level unaided. Reasons to continue support to ILANUD and other regional institutions conclude the report.","Delivery order no. 21","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-0085-I-00-6097-00","","6/1/1988 12:00:00 AM","","Regional development|National level|Institution building|Criminal law|Administration of law|Technical assistance|Management training|Sector evaluation|Personnel development|Libraries","Latin America|Caribbean|South America","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAX800.pdf","17,586 KB","000356 - Checchi and Co.

"Final evaluation of a rural water supply and sanitation project (1980-87) in Togo. The project was highly successful, having provided potable water to 864 villages (some 600,000 persons).  A total of 1,048 boreholes, 3 springs, 256 cisterns, and 473 latrines were constructed.  Key to both the construction effort and the long-term operation and maintenance of the systems was the establishment of a Village Development Committee (VDC) in each project village. Coordination was difficult in the beginning because of a complex project structure involving four donors and three Government of Togo (GOT) ministries.  Nonetheless, after a mid-term review considerable improvements were made, especially regarding coordination between the drilling and village development components. Training of GOT field agents and of VDC's (each including a president, secretary, treasurer, pump repairman, woman pump caretaker, woman ORT demonstrator, and committee advisors) was an integral activity and effective participatory methodologies were used.  VDC members received specialized training in their fields, and 120 GOT field agents each received about 160 days of training, an amount which was well justified. The project's community participation strategy included village meetings, workshops for villagers, and follow-up and evaluation of community activities.  This process of community organizing and training required careful follow-up by the field agents for several years.  In the majority of cases, where the field agents were motivated and persistent, this strategy was very effective. Contracting for borehole drilling with a private firm was effective and efficient; costs were cut by one-third by this means.  Siting of boreholes was also effectively accomplished through contracting with a French geologic firm.  Due to procurement delays, however, 340 boreholes were without pumps for more than 2 years.  Pump maintenance has been generally effective but improvements are still needed.  The cost and availability of some pump parts have not been satisfactory, and overworked regional repair teams have not been able to respond quickly to village needs. Springs and cisterns as alternative water supply technologies were found to be effective.  Cisterns, in particular, are important alternatives in areas without groundwater resources. (About 33% of the boreholes were dry.)  The cisterns are rather expensive, however, and studies on less expensive models are needed. Latrine construction was also effective but covered only a small percentage of project villages.  Again, studies are needed to find less expensive designs.  More emphasis is needed on latrine construction. Increased emphasis is also needed on protecting the water quality of boreholes.  Some 15-20% of boreholes have bacteriological contamination.","WASH activity no. 413|French ed.: PD-ABI-541","Special Evaluation","Documents","DPE-5942-C-00-4085-00","","2/1/1988 12:00:00 AM","","Community participation|Potable water|Water supply engineering|Villages|Beneficiary count","Togo","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAX801.pdf","3,324 KB","000333 - Camp Dresser and McKee, Inc.

"PACR of project (3/83-3/88) to establish a water supply system to meet national potable water demands in Antigua and Barbuda and to provide TA and training to the Antigua Public Utilities Authority (APUA) to ensure system maintenance and future expansion. In 1984, when the construction phase of the project began, Antigua was facing a drought of disaster proportions - fresh water was being barged to the island from Dominica and Guadeloupe.  As a result, initial priorities were placed on developing new groundwater reserves and rehabilitating existing wells.  APUA personnel were trained to drill exploratory and new wells, and 21 wells were rehabilitated and 26 new wells developed.  Total groundwater capability is now 1 mgpd, and average production is 900,000 gpd. In addition, water pipelines, treatment plants, pumping stations and related structures were built and rehabilitated, including among others a 16-inch transmission line from the storage tank at All Saints to Scotts Hill, two 600,000 gallon storage tanks at All Saints and Buckley, and an experimental solar pumping station, which pumped 5,000 gallons per day until its solar cells were damaged, apparently by vandals. As part of the institution building side of the project, an organizational chart for the water division of APUA was developed, and job descriptions were prepared for each position. An accounting system was installed, operating procedures were developed for procurement, budgeting, and planning, and a number of APUA employees attended regional seminars on a variety of water quality and management issues. Timing is a crucial element in project design, and in too many cases the consultant's estimate of the time required to complete the project is based on North American conditions. Unfortunately, in developing countries, remoteness from manufacturers and less than ideal infrastructure can add significantly to implementation time.  It can take up to six months for materials ordered from overseas to arrive. Engineering also takes longer than expected, as consultants have to learn about local conditions. This delays right-of-way acquisitions, which in themselves can take up to a year.  Since TA contracts are budgeted on a time basis, these delays could mean that the budget could run out just when construction is able to start.  It is essential that project design realistically estimate PACD's. Other lessons are (1) project budgets must assign realistic values for contingency expenses; (2) time must be allowed for maintenance and operation training; and (3) all parties in a project should be aware of conditions precedent and their financial obligations and abide by them - too often, these are glossed over in everyone's haste to get a project underway.","Loan no. 538-K-023","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1988 12:00:00 AM","","Institution building|Water supply structures|Water supply structure maintenance|Water supply engineering","Antigua and Barbuda","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAX805.pdf","1,086 KB","001373 - USAID.

"An impact evaluation of the CARITAS/Catholic Relief Services Applied Nutrition Education Program (ANEP) in the Dominican Republic was carried out in 1987, three years after the program had been restructured to target at-risk families and focus on home-based growth monitoring and individualized nutrition education, using women's self-reliance and social marketing strategies.  The evaluation used pre-post comparisons of participants' knowledge, practices, and children's nutritional status, and made comparisons of the same variables using matched participant and nonparticipant communities.  Data indicated significant behavioral changes, and differences in key health and nutritional practices.  Overall prevalence of moderate-to-severe malnutrition was reduced by more than one half after 2-3 years of program participation. There were consistent improvements in nutritional status in program children over time and as compared to nonprogram populations.  ANEP's success was attributed to its careful selection of communities and selection and training of personnel, to its strong supervisory system and operationally defined activities, and to its effective communication strategies and in-built system for monitoring and evaluation.

"Project Assistance Completion Report on a project (FY82-87) to support the efforts of the Caribbean Project Development Facility (CPDF) to identify and facilitate investment subprojects in the Caribbean region. The project provided $1 million in grant funds (about 30% of CPDF's budget), which, pooled with other contributor's resources, went towards the hiring of nine consultants and support staff. There was not a separate budget for A.I.D.'s support.  However, all funds obligated to this project were expended. During the life of the project, 81 subproject proposals were completed, of which 32 had received financing commitments at the end of 1987.  Forty-three of the completed studies related to projects in the Eastern Caribbean countries; 12 of these had received funding commitments.  In addition to preparing project proposals, CPDF also assisted entrepreneurs by arranging TA for start-ups and funding for feasibility studies.  The consultants also assisted project sponsors in their negotiations with financiers. The project's overall impact was considerable.  CPDF assistance contributed to the start-up or expansion of a number of businesses leveraging funding commitments of $45 million related to total investments of $70 million.  The projected job creation from this investment is 2,768 jobs.  About 50% of the proposals prepared by CPDF were export-oriented and thus are expected to significantly improve the balance of payments position of the beneficiary territories. Lessons learned:  the project was a pilot exercise which demonstrated that project preparation services are needed in the Caribbean.  Since Caribbean financiers often display a greater degree of faith in international consultants, it is essential for prospective Caribbean consultants to obtain exposure in the international arenas.

"Project Assistance Completion Report on a project (FY84-87) to provide the physical infrastructure needed to expand private production in the Eastern Caribbean. Under the project, a $12 million loan was initially made available to the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB) for on-lending to private investors through commercial financial institutions.  This amount was subsequently reduced to $6 million due to lack of demand.  Grant funding in support of this loan was provided under the Investment Promotion and Export Development Project to hire TA and engineering services. Overall, 29 sub-projects were considered by commercial banks in the region for funding under the project and 5 were approved by the ECCB. The other projects were cancelled or rejected by either the commercial banks or the ECCB because of non-viability or because the sponsors shelved the projects.  A total of about $1.8 million of project funds were utilized for construction of about 62,000 sq. ft. of factory space in Antigua and Grenada. This space facilitated manufacturing activities, e.g., involving pre-fab housing, garments, industrial gases and furniture. Remaining project funds will be re-obligated. In sum, the project contributed to the commencement of five projects involving total investments of about $3.241 million. There was a mix of investments between local and foreign investors.  Employment generation was modest, with 240 production jobs having been provided during the life of the project.  This impact is marginally increased through recognition of the temporary construction jobs that resulted from the project.  None of the firms occupying space had started exporting as of the PACD. The project failed to meet its objectives primarily due to flawed design assumptions:  (1) that the demand for factory space exceeded supply; and (2) that foreign investors would be willing to come into a region of unproven industrial experience with unreliable demand estimates and construct factory space on speculation. The principal lesson is that projects to satisfy market deficiencies must provide for prompt reaction to the perceived deficiency or be sufficiently flexible to respond to unforseen cyclical changes in economic activity.  Secondly, market surveys/feasibility studies should be subject to verification before being used as a basis for funding allocation.

"Evaluates project to promote nontraditional agricultural exports in Ecuador.  Final external evaluation, conducted one month before PACD, covers the period 9/84-6/88. The project will fail to achieve its goal of an increase of U.S. $63 million in nontraditional agricultural exports by PACD.  This is due to a number of reasons:  the project design was incomplete and faulty; measures of achievement were overestimated and inappropriate and the timeframe was insufficient; the budget was too small; the time required to develop and change the attitudes of participants or potential participants was not taken into consideration; USAID/E's management was inadequate; there was not continuity of TA; the investment credit facility did not perform as expected and there were too many delays; and the agreement between USAID/E and the Central Bank was confusing and caused delays in implementation. Nonetheless, the project has made important gains - especially in developing and utilizing private institutions - which should not be discarded.  The activities which have been completed can be viewed as a Phase I effort setting the stage for Phase II. The second phase should be developmental and should build on the basic institutional structure that is now in place.  It should stress TA and the development of a production and marketing base from which to launch a full-scale export marketing program. A systems approach is recommended.

"Evaluates project to promote economic growth in developing countries by supporting improved energy policies and efficiencies through a series of specific support activities to A.I.D. regional bureaus and Missions. External evaluation covers the period 1983-87. The project is without a doubt providing a valuable service within its defined scope of activities, even though it needs to be promoted more actively as a tool for addressing economic as well as energy issues.  Both its Energy Conservation Services Program (ECSP, implemented by Hagler, Bailly) and its Energy Planning and Policy Development component (EPPD - with the Oak Ridge National Laboratory) have had much success.  LAC and AFR Regional Bureau attitudes toward energy issues do not coincide with host country and Mission views, and as a result the demand for S&T/EY support is definitely present in many countries in these regions.  ANE Bureau has been and will continue to be a focal point of project activity.  In the field ECSP is perceived as more responsive than EPPD, but this is perhaps because there is too little awareness of EPPD and the resources it has to offer. A number of management and implementation issues have kept the project from reaching its full impact potential; among these, the need for closer cooperation between project components stands out.  Other findings focus on the need to modify ECSP implementation strategy in countries with weak infrastructures, allowing for supportive or follow-on activities; and to strengthen project management on the part of both S&T/EY and the two contractors. Several recommendations are made to address these issues, including (inter alia):  (1) the project should be marketed to a broader audience because of its legitimate potential for economic impact beyond just the energy sector; (2) the project should continue to develop collaborative activities with the World Bank and other development banks; (3) travel budgets should be increased; and (4) EPPD should put more emphasis on field activities, less on S&T/EY program planning.","Delivery order no. 9","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-5730-I-00-6112-00","","2/1/1988 12:00:00 AM","","Regional disparity|Energy research|Energy policy|Energy economics|Energy costs","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAX844.pdf","7,234 KB","004425 - IT Power Inc.","","000184 - USAID.

"Presents final Mission report (3/85-2/88) on a project to increase the generating capacity and extend the transmission and distribution network of DOMLEC, Dominica's electric utility. Under the generation component, the General Engineering Company of St. Croix installed 2,750 KW units and ancillary equipment in 5/85 for $876,000, considerably less than the budgeted amount. EBASCO Services, which had identified the technical requirements, periodically inspected the units until they were commissioned in 4/86.  Between 8/85 and 8/86, Sadelmi N.Y. Inc. constructed a 23.5-mile high-voltage transmission line from Trafalgra to Rosalie on the east coast and thence north to Castle Bruce and south to Delices.  The contract amount of $2.405 million included a claim of $44,000 for extended overhead costs resulting from delays in processing access permits.  Materials for the low-voltage distribution network were delivered by 4/86; the contract amount was $646,000.  DOMLEC transported the materials to warehouses on the east coast and installed the network itself. After all objectives had been met, DOMLEC requested that the $500,000 in grant funds remaining be used to (1) procure additional materials needed to extend the distribution network from Delices to Stowe in the south and from Castle Bruce to Marigot in the north and (2) conduct the training recommended in the institutional analysis section of the Project Paper.  USAID/D endorsed these requests and extended the PACD from 6/87 to 2/88 accordingly. procured under a $380,000 contract. DOMLEC is installing the materials itself and has agreed to continue provide bimonthly progress reports until the work is completed. Training was carried out by the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association (NRECA), which developed individually tailored technical and management training programs, lasting 1-10 weeks, for 12 DOMLEC staff. The total cost of this component was $120,000.  Project funds were also used for a public information program ($30,000) and project management services ($95,000). All objectives were met by the PACD.  DOMLEC was institutionally strengthened by the training program and by the installation of a comprehensive computer network.  Over 1,000 house connections have already been made on the east coast; additional domestic, commercial, and industrial connections are expected.  The entire network is due for completion by the end of 1988.  DOMLEC's financial contribution to the project will far exceed that envisioned in the project budget. Implementation was facilitated considerably by prequalifying construction contractors.  Advertising major contracts during the design stage made it possible to award contracts and begin work shortly after execution of the Pro-Ag.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1988 12:00:00 AM","","Electrification|Rural areas|Electric utilities|Electric power generation|Electric power distribution","Dominica","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAX845.pdf","125 KB","001757 - USAID.

"Presents final Mission report (12/85-12/87) on a project to improve Grenada's economic infrastructure - specifically, roads, industrial facilities, and electric power - and increase the availability of construction materials (cement and concrete). Under the project component to construct factory shells at Frequente Industrial Park, Construction Products International (CPI) of Houston, Texas, supplied prefabricated components for three buildings with a total floor space of 63,000 sq ft.  The buildings were erected by J&J Engineering Co., a Miami-based 8a firm.  Two were occupied immediately and operations began in them in 12/86.  The third building provided reserve capacity and has since been occupied.  The total cost of this component was $292,000,including $200,000 for the CPI contract. EBASCO Services provided engineering services for the project's power component, and International Power Systems (IPS) supplied and installed a 2.04 MW diesel generator at the Grenada Electric Company's (GRENLEC) plant in Queen's Park.  As a result, load shedding has no longer been necessary.  Although IPS also provided operations and maintenance training to GRENLEC staff, GRENLEC has had continuing operational problems with the unit, partially because of its own failure to carry out periodic maintenance.  Given GRENLEC's history of maintenance problems, a service contract should have been considered.  A total of $1.050 million was spent on this component. The Government of Grenada negotiated a $3.5 million cost plus fixed fee contract with Morrison Knudsen (MK) for the road resurfacing component.  MK resurfaced or repaired 22 miles of road, including the St. George's-Grenville, Lance Aux Epine, and Morne Rouge roads, and selected streets in St. George's.  MK also provided long-term TA to Grenada Rock, Asphalt and Concrete Products (GRACP) to ensure an adequate supply of material for construction activities.  Some 20 GRACP employees were trained in quarry development and operations, crusher operations, and maintenance and quality control of asphaltic concrete mixtures. The TA provided by MK was intended to help the GOG establish a critically needed producer of cement and concrete for the construction industry.  These efforts were hampered initially by the failure of GOG agencies to pay for the materials in a timely manner and later by the GOG's reluctance to retrench unneeded and unproductive workers.  The end result has been the establishment of a statutory body with a virtual monopoly on the crushed aggregate business and which charges excessive prices, thus substantially escalating local construction costs.  This aspect of the project should have been more thoroughly discussed during project design.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1988 12:00:00 AM","","Economic infrastructure|Building construction|Industrial facilities|Electric power generation equipment|Road construction|Public enterprises|Monopolies","Grenada","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAX846.pdf","159 KB","001757 - USAID.

"Final Mission report on a project (10/80-6/86) to strengthen health planning and information systems in Kenya's Ministry of Health (MOH). The project was a success.  Specifically, it:  (1) created within the MOH a senior-level management/planning committee, provincial and district health management teams, and a working group which was the predecessor of the newly formed Division of Planning and Information; (2) provided extensive provincial- and district-level training in management, planning, and budgeting; (3) established an MOH computerized data processing facility, introduced over 100 senior and mid-level managers to microcomputers, and provided extensive formal and on-the-job training in data processing.  The project's major strength was the ability of TA staff to work well with counterparts.  A major weakness was the administrative burden placed on this too small staff. The project fostered significant institutional change, although not always as directly as planned.  MOH senior management, fearing that the full-fledged Division of Planning and Information called for in the Project Paper might inhibit decentralized planning, established instead a Health Planning Working Group.  This effort, however, laid the basis for the creation - some 2 years after the PACD - of the Division initially called for.  Similarly, although the envisioned ""Scheme of Service"" - a specialized designation and career ladder for MOH health planners - turned out to be beyond the MOH's authority, systemic changes within the MOH and the Government of Kenya (GOK) promoted the same objectives. The project put in place several concepts and structures which, along with the GOK's aggressive promotion of decentralization to the district level, laid a sound basis for the follow-on project - Information and Planning Systems.  The project also validated the importance of general institutional management development to USAID/K's other population/health investments.  In the past, the Mission had focused on vertical interventions rather than general institution building. Several lessons were learned.  (1) Institution-building projects require long-term commitment of time and money from the start, and a compatibility between project intents and government policies.  This project lacked the former but enjoyed the latter. (2) Implementation must be flexible, working within existing policies in order to change them.  It is better for advisors to accomplish part of a task with counterpart participation than all of a task that is seen as irrelevant. (3) Several directions in the field of health planning and information systems emerged during the project - host government awareness of the importance of institution-building/management systems, a shifting emphasis in health information to the user level, and an increasingly multidisciplinary approach to health planning.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","5/1/1988 12:00:00 AM","","Health care administration|Health care planning|Information management|Institution building|Government departments","Kenya","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAX852.pdf","267 KB","008565 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of a pilot activity (financed under a 4/85-12/87 project extension) to conduct research, training, and extension in agroforestry (AF) and soil conservation (SC) techniques in sixty villages in the regions of Thies and Diourbel in central Senegal. Results were mixed.  AF targets for tree planting, extension, and training met with good success.  Woodlots were started in many project villages; survival rates ranged from 60% in better protected woodlots to 34% in double line windbreaks.  Natural regeneration of Kad (Acacia albida) had an 89% survival rate. AF training events for extensionists were held both in-country and through short-term study tours in the United States.  Project personnel also benefited from stateside training in information management and farming systems research.  Extension activities in project villages (e.g., woodlots, orchards, windbreaks, windrows, individual plantings, live fencing) were successful as well, although a complicating factor was the lack of water and materials for compost pit construction and well digging. On the other hand, soil and water conservation activities did not take place as planned, due to problems with local contractors, and there was only marginal success in developing AF and SC techniques.  Funds programmed for adaptive research were used instead for technical studies carried out by Senegalese firms. Collaboration among the six different agencies involved in the project was complicated by budget restrictions, and research-extension cooperation did not occur as designed.  In fact, project management proved to be the most challenging aspect of this pilot effort, due to the project's small size and diversity, the number of participating agencies, and USAID/S's direct procurement approach. Some 15 lessons are gleaned from this project; they stress the need for streamlined, field-based management procedures, the importance of considering village dynamics when designing AF projects of this type, and the need to develop more sophisticated improved maintenance procedures for tree plantings.  Other specific lessons are that  (1) simply planting trees does not adequately demonstrate their value; (2) tree protection is a good indicator of village interest in different plantings and species; (3) barbed wire fencing is probably easier and cheaper to use than local fencing materials; (4) SC activities require accurate data, so preliminary studies should be performed before these activities are designed; and (5) AF is not a sufficient response to the problems of soil degradation.","French ed.: PD-AAX-874","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1988 12:00:00 AM","","Agroforestry|Soil conservation|Soil research|Pilot projects|Agricultural extension training|Agricultural extension","Senegal","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAX873.pdf","15,048 KB","005159 - Labat-Anderson, Inc.","","008600 - USAID.

"Project assistance completion report on a project (completed 10/84) to investigate alternative energy technologies and to build Thailand's capacity to conduct energy research. On the whole, the project was highly successsful in meeting its objectives.  (1) It played a very important role in alerting the National Energy Administration (NEA) and other branches of the Royal Thai Government (RTG) to these alternative energy technologies and resources.  Within the NEA, a National Energy Information Center has been organized and equipped and is functioning. (2) It linked together the various activities related to supply and demand for energy in an Energy Master Plan which optimizes the use of all energy resources and which has been used in national planning. (3) It developed indigenous expertise which forms a strong base for future energy problemsolving.  Four Regional Energy Centers have been created, staffed, and equipped and are doing excellent work disseminating information developed during the project and since.  They have held workshops and training sessions on fabrication and use of improved cooking stoves and improved charcoal kilns, and on planting and caring for seedlings in village and private woodlots.  Two additional centers have been established with RTG funding. (4) It developed several proven technologies which can make significant reductions in both petroleum imports and the decimation of the forests.  In particular, microhydropower, improved cooking stoves, and village woodlots have already been proved of significance, while village energy surveys, solar/wind resources assessment, and improved charcoal production hold significant potential impact.  However, water lifting technology, solar thermal processors, biomass gasification, and pyrolysis of rice husks will require either different conditions in the energy sector or much more development. (5) Another major accomplishment was the extensive utilization of local experts.  Over 30 Thai experts (retired RTG officials, university personnel, etc.) were recruited. (6) Only in the area of training was there significant shortfall from the planned outputs.  There was no long-term academic training undertaken, while funding of seminars, workshops, and special courses was only about 10% of that budgeted.  These shortfalls were due mostly to bureaucratic constraints. Further development of nonconventional energy resources in Thailand will depend on their commercial viability vis-a-vis the price of conventional (i.e., oil) resources.  The project began when oil prices were high and ended when they were low.  The drop in oil prices has slowed down further active development and replication of project research.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","6/1/1988 12:00:00 AM","","Alternative energy technology|Research centers|Renewable energy resources|Institution building|Information centers|Energy research|Government departments","Thailand","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAX927.pdf","200 KB","008613 - USAID.

"Provides final Mission report on a project (1967-88) to introduce improved agricultural practices and better the quality of life for about 10,000 farm families in the Lam Nam Oon (LNO) region of Thailand. The end of project status specified in Project Implementation Letter No. 14 has largely been reached:  the LNO irrigation system (comprising 314 km of main and secondary irrigation canals, and another 178 km of drainage canals) is capable of providing water to 167,000 rai of land in the wet season and 67,000 rai in the dry season.  Long-range land development plans have been formulated, and on-farm land development has been completed on 90,500 rai; alternative on-farm irrigation models have been tested; and a revised agricultural research program emphasizing cropping patterns and integrated farming systems has been developed.  In addition, Royal Thai Government (RTG) personnel have been trained to provide TA to farmers in water management, 18 LNO area families have been trained in silk production, and fish production has been improved through fish cultivation and villager training programs. The irrigation facilities are generally in satisfactory condition, and operation and maintenance have improved over time, although there is a persistent shortage of maintenance funds (due to RTG budgetary constraints).  A computerized water management system is being tested. The project teaches that for budgetary purposes large systems such as LNO should constitute a separate region so that RTG agencies would be required to take the special needs of irrigated areas into account when preparing budgets, and as a way of giving different government agencies a common framework within which to cooperate.  Other lessons are: (1) LNO water user groups have functioned well, although they require a long-term TA program in water management and cropping systems; (2) training should be provided to the children of current farmers to ensure successful operation of the system into the second generation; (3) dry season agriculture will expand only if agricultural marketing opportunities are increased (the RTG needs to adopt specific measures to encourage private investment in LNO); (4)  support should be given to the further development of the computer-based water management system at LNO to ensure adequate water management in the face of complex multi-crop watering schedules; and (5) a detailed implementation strategy should be incorporated into a project from the beginning, even though it will be changed over the course of implementation.  LNO eventually developed such a strategy, but outputs could have been greater if it had been in place from the beginning.","Loan no. 493-T-020","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","6/1/1988 12:00:00 AM","","Water supply structures|Irrigation|Irrigated farming|Agricultural water management|Cropping systems|Rural areas","Thailand","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAX928.pdf","241 KB","008613 - USAID.

"Evaluates family planning project in Morocco.  External evaluation covers Phase III, 1984-88. Most of the 13 subproject (SP) activities are on target and seem to be operating without significant problems.  Three of the four main end of project objectives have already been reached:  (1) regular availability of FP information and services for about 70% of the population; (2) a contraceptive prevalence rate of 35% (the project goal); and (3) increased Government of Morroco (GOM) awareness of overpopulation problems and incorporation of specific population models into GOM development planning. Direct indicators of the effectiveness of activities designed to reach the fourth project goal, expanded maternal child health (MCH) care, are not available, although the current immunization program has vaccinated virtually all children under age 5. In addition, as the Ministry of Public Health's (MOPH) opposition to private sector FP efforts has eased, USAID/M has stepped up support for private FP initiatives by expanding commercial retail contraceptive sales and company-based FP activities and by implementing the planned community-based sale of contraceptives through the Moroccan FP Association. IEC has presented serious problems.  Despite extensive TA, the MOPH is still unable to develop a coherent IEC strategy.  Many mass-media messages have been produced, but their quality and impact are questionable.  Printed material for educational use is inappropriate, confusing, and often out of date; most health workers simply ignore it. A related SP, to develop an FP information system, has been plagued by an overabundance of irrelevant data. Certain qualitative weaknesses, especially in regard to service delivery, pose major policy problems.  The use of mobile units to provide basic FP/MCH services has become the cornerstone of the MOPH approach to extending health coverage, but plans to use this strategy to provide a full range of primary health care services may include services not appropriate for periodic outreach. Further, budgetary constraints are making proposed expansions of the mobile approach difficult to fund.  Also, the project has focused on supplying oral contraceptives to the neglect of other contraceptive methods. Recommendations are to:  (1) broaden the contraceptive alternatives offered through the project; (2) revise and target the IEC strategy; (3) redesign the FP information system; (4) assure that the MOPH can assume the costs of FP outreach services; and (5) expand USAID/M resources for project management and consolidate future project activities.","Companion evaluation summary: PD-ABD-017|Project title: Population technical assistance (POPTECH)","Special Evaluation","Documents","DPE-3024-Z-00-7079-00","","7/1/1988 12:00:00 AM","","Family planning services|Contraceptive distribution|Family planning promotion programs|Maternal child health care|Health outreach services|Oral contraceptives|Family planning policy","Morocco","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAX948.pdf","4,530 KB","000673 - International Science and Technology Institute, Inc.

"Evaluates project to support collaborative agricultural research between Indian and U.S. research scientists and institutions. Interim evaluation covers the period 6/83-4/88. The project has initiated seven subprojects (SP's) - soybean processing, postharvest technology, embryo transfer, biodegradable waste, blood protista, forestry training, and the Project Implementation Unit (PIU) - and has initiated action on an eighth (plant genetic resources); five others are designed, but not approved, and one remains to be designed.  It is still too early to assess the project's impact on Indian agriculture, but the project's design and concept are strong, and its purposes will probably be achieved. Implementation has been and continues to be delayed by problems in timing inputs.  For example, Indian scientists wanted to schedule their U.S. training so that equipment purchased under the project would be available on their return, and they wanted the U.S. consultancies to begin after staff training, installation of equipment, and (in some cases) after new facilities construction had been completed.  Given the length of time needed to procure equipment from the United States, this has become a major bottleneck.  The Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) contributed to the delays by failing to provide adequate staffing and support for the PIU, which serves as the GOI counterpart to USAID/I for the project. Some of these delays were alleviated in 1986 by the appointment by USAID/I, with funding outside the project, of a Management Support Services unit, which has been helpful in arranging U.S. training, identifying consultants, and purchasing equipment outside India.  ICAR commissioned a review of operational problems by the Indian National Academy for Agricultural Research Management in 1986, but its findings and recommendations have not received much attention. Recommendations are, inter alia, to (1) more evenly divide available funding among SP's and reach a decision about which if any additional SP's are to be included in the project; (2) use joint U.S.-Indian teams to design SP's; and (3) hold discussions between USAID/I and ICAR to ensure that ICAR meets its commitment and that the PIU is brought into full operation. Although the project design was highly appropriate at the time of its development (when Indo-U.S. cooperation in agriculture was being reestablished), future collaborative efforts should not rely solely on this model.  A number of larger stand-alone projects which are already evolving could provide a better framework for truly collaborative research with longer-term benefits.  Also, future cooperative research efforts should receive financial commitment from both sides for at least 10-15 years and should involve greater collaboration with Indian state agricultural universities.","Delivery order no. 12|Companion evaluation summary: PD-AAZ-019","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-1406-I-00-7007-00","","6/1/1988 12:00:00 AM","","Research collaboration|Scientific cooperation|Research management|Agricultural research","India","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAX976.pdf","4,537 KB","001335 - Chemonics International Consulting Div.","","008557 - USAID.

"Evaluates the divestiture program of the Corporacion Costarricense de Desarrollo (CODESA), which began in 1984. Key findings are as follows.  (1) The USAID Mission in San Jose has pioneered in a new field with impressive success.  The Costa Rica privatization program has been a unique experience, but many of the elements designed for it and the problems solved can be useful in planning privatizations elsewhere. (2) Creation of a private sector trust (FINTRA) to function as an intermediary in divestiture activities solved problems which might otherwise have led to failure of the program. (3) The use of local currency generated in connection with A.I.D.'s Economic Stabilization Fund (ESF) programs, and held on deposit with the Central Bank of Costa Rica (BCCR), to offset CODESA borrowings from the BCCR in amounts related to an adjusted cost basis valuation of assets divested was essential to the success of the program, had little (if any) cost to A.I.D., and facilitated the demonetization of those funds and avoidance of their potential inflationary effect. (4) The key individuals involved in the program, particularly those working on behalf of USAID/CR, FINTRA,  and (since mid-1986) CODESA, have done an outstanding job of initiating, planning, and carrying out an extremely difficult and challenging task in a highly professional manner. (5) A number of mistakes and miscalculations were made in planning and carrying out the program.  These were principally (1) a failure to define the valuation method to be employed (or at least to recognize the magnitude of the potential problems which might result), (2) the adoption of an overly optimistic timetable that underestimated bureaucratic resistance, political delays, and problems in the individual enterprises (although it did take into account the probable political need to complete divestiture before the end of President Monge's term), and (3) a failure to require a change in CODESA management at the outset of the program, or to require that the law enacted provide for the ultimate liquidation of CODESA at the end of the program. These errors or misjudgments (or, in most of the cases cited, acceptance of apparent political reality) are understandable in the light of the pioneering nature of the program, and in fact correspond to identical mistakes since made in privatization programs in other countries.  In the CODESA case the resulting difficulties encountered were resolved as necessary without long-term damage to the process.

"Since the late 1970's donors and host country governments alike have become concerned with reversing the environmental degradation taking place in many Third World nations and limiting the adverse impact of development projects on the environment. This study describes, and reviews the effectiveness of, A.I.D.'s system for assessing the potential environmental impacts of proposed projects.  Using examples of projects that were revised after environmental review, the study discusses A.I.D.'s methods for classifying the environmental risks of development projects (the so-called black, grey, and white lists), and the impact of the assessment process on revising project designs and implementaton.  Experience indicates that in many cases the assessments have helped project designers to identify and address significant environmental issues, and that they provide a forum for host country officials to voice their concerns about project impacts.  The system is less effective, however, in screening activities indirectly funded by A.I.D. (e.g., activities of A.I.D.-supported intermediary credit institutions) and it does not provide guidance on how to detect or address unforeseen negative effects that might occur during implementation. Another potential problem is that budget-conscious Missions, fearing expensive project redesigns, might avoid the process altogether by funding only those projects on the ""white list,"" i.e., that qualify for a categorical exclusion.","References, p.15","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","6/1/1988 12:00:00 AM","","Environmental protection|Development project design|USAID|Regulations","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNABA143.pdf","29 KB","003433 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to create an Agricultural Studies Unit (UEA) in the Dominican Republic to formulate sound agricultural policies. Final evaluation covers the life of the project (1984-88). The project has met its objectives.  During its first phase, under the Jorge Blanco administration (1984-86), the UEA provided high-quality, issue-specific policy studies and options analysis to the GODR's reactivated National Agricultural Council (CNA) and the Agricultural Policy Analysis Committee (CAPA), a group of CNA members from the public and private sectors.  Most requests for policy analyses during this phase were from the private sector. During the second phase (1986-88), although the CNA was deactivated by the Balaguer adminstration, both CAPA and UEA continued to operate, with UEA responding primarily to policy analysis requests from the Technical Sub-Secretaries of Agriculture and of the President. The studies undertaken by UEA have provided sound and coherent policy recommendations to the government, the only drawback being that external TA, needed by UEA to calculate social costs and benefits, was not available after departure of the long-term advisor in June 1986. Acceptance of UEA's proposed policy measures generally proved easier in the second phase (although there were also notable successes in Phase I), and the policies advocated by UEA have in fact helped raise farm incomes and increase agricultural efficiency. Recommendations for a possible extension of the project are, inter alia, to (1) produce more studies, (2) hire a full time macroeconomist, and (3) encourage the private sector to commission more studies.","Delivery order no. 15","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-1406-I-00-7011-00","","6/1/1988 12:00:00 AM","","Institution building|Government departments|Policy analysis|Agricultural policy","Dominican Republic","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAY001.pdf","2,671 KB","000480 - Experience, Inc.","","008537 - USAID.

"Final external evaluation of a project to upgrade the capacity of the Organization for Rural Development (ORD), a small farmer organization formed in St. Vincent in 1978.  Evaluation covers the period 7/85 to 5/88. ORD's progress has been very satisfactory, given the Organization's lack of experience, the risks inherent in agriculture, and the difficulties of entering the commercial world.  ORD now has in place, and has to a great degree institutionalized, all of the management systems essential for effective operation at its expected future level. Financial reporting, membership records, and the flow of sales and production data are all being handled well, and ORD deals effectively with its suppliers, customers, and banks.  In fact, the private and public agencies interviewed regard ORD quite favorably (although still holding some reservations about its goals exceeding its capacities). Also, ORD and the Ministry of Trade, Industry, and Agriculture are now working together reasonably harmoniously after early difficulties. ORD's support for small farmer production and marketing is expected to increase farmers' production and sales over time, given sufficient future funding. Despite this generally good record, some organizational weaknesses still exist, especially a failure to collate and effectively use information to manage and control operations. ORD's lack of experienced managers with appropriate responsibility and authority compounds these planning and control problems.  Another problem is that ORD continues to view itself as a service organization - a view which has hampered acceptance of some of the more rigorous controls and concerns necessary for business success. The most troublesome aspect of the project has been its unrealistic initial projections and the compression of a planned 5-year time frame into 3.5 years, leaving ORD with a financial gap that threatens the maintenance of current operations.  An A.I.D. bridge grant would ease the transition to self-sufficiency. The project teaches that similar projects should:  acknowledge that building a profitable business operation, especially with an inexperienced, service-oriented group, inevitably takes longer than donor agencies anticipate; underestimate income and overestimate costs in order to provide a safety margin; initiate and enforce desired financial controls early; insist that a chief of operations or general manager be in place from start-up; include commercially oriented decisionmaking as a key aspect of training and TA; and provide readily quantifiable benchmarks against which to measure progress.","Companion project evaluation summary: PD-AAZ-179","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","7/1/1988 12:00:00 AM","","Private organizations|Institution building|Crop production|Agricultural product marketing|Management development|Integrated management","Saint Vincent and the Grenadines","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAY022.pdf","3,867 KB","001757 - USAID.

"Project assistance completion report on a project (1979-8/87) to upgrade and expand agricultural research programs and facilities in Sumatra. Delays due to administrative and funding problems were ultimately offset by a project extension from 4/84 to 8/87 and most project components were satisfactorily implemented.  Achievements include the establishment of the Sukarami Research Institute for Food Crops (SARIF); upgrading/construction of eight research stations; transfer of technologies (particularly in land development and simulation modeling) to SARIF; the development of a highly efficient and effective extension program; and adoption by 500 farmers in Sitiung of a new cropping system for dry land and by 100 farmers of soil conservation techniques.  Among the project's research highlights were the introduction of improved upland rice and high-yielding peanut varieties; testing of granular pesticides for control of seedling flies and studies on the relationship between seedling fly attack and the developmental stage of rice; and introduction of a modeling system for monitoring rice blast disease. Research was also conducted on such diverse topics as the use of lime for Indonesia's mostly acid soils, homestead farming systems in transmigration areas, the agroecology of Sumatra, and food crop components in perennial crop plantations in three provinces.  In addition, a prototype rice hulling machine was developed. Training, provided mostly in-country, focused almost entirely on scientific staff; 41 researchers completed Ph.D.'s or M.S.'s, and another 28 are still pursuing them.  Additional training in physical plant and equipment management and in general administrative procedures would have benefited the project. Procurement was well done.  However, due to host government budget cuts, maintenance of some items, especially vehicles and heavy farm equipment, has been problematic. It was learned that:  (1) implementation delays were due, in part, to the lack of understanding of A.I.D. regulations for approval of engineering designs, specifications, and cost estimates; (2) lack of English-language ability among some staff reduced planned levels of overseas training; (3) failure to carry out land development concurrently with other physical upgrading interfered with field research for several years; (4) given the budget limitations which have developed, time-phased improvements to the several research stations might have been preferable to simultaneous improvement of all sites; and (5) more attention needs to be given to identifying equipment needs and to the suitability and ""state-of-the-art"" life of the desired equipment, especially when it is costly.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","6/1/1988 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural research|Institution building","Indonesia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAY033.pdf","280 KB","008558 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of a project to provide farming systems research and extension (FSR/E) TA, training, and information dissemination and to strengthen the capabilities of the University of Florida (UF) and other support entities (SE's) to do this.  Evaluation focuses on the period since the mid-term evaluation (6/85-12/87). The project was much more successful in certain areas than in others, but achievements overall were constrained by a lack of consensus - both within A.I.D., and among A.I.D., UF, and the other SE's - as to what the project's objectives and strategy should be.  This lack was recognized by the mid-term evaluation, but was not sufficiently overcome, and as a result A.I.D. decided to reduce funding and to terminate the project at the end of 1987. Nonetheless, the project did produce a number of useful products, including several training courses and workshops in the U.S. and abroad on various topics.  The courses, while initially weak, improved substantially as the trainers gained experience and better materials were developed.  Also, a limited amount of TA was provided to Missions in project design and evaluation; although the TA was generally well-received, demand was far lower than expected. Networking was probably the most successful activity.  The project established an SE network with 21 U.S. universities and 4 consulting firms (most, however, felt underutilized and were to drop out eventually).  It also supported two networks in West Africa (following the mid-term evaluation, West Africa became the project's explicit geographic focus).  Finally, a number of publications were developed, including a newsletter with a circulation of 5,000, two internal network newsletters, a series of technical papers on field experiences and advances in methodology, and a series of annotated bibliographies.  The project also developed an on-going documentation center within S&T and a statistical package for use in on-farm experiments. Lessons learned flow directly from the project's principal problem - that work in a poorly defined subject area, as FSR/E was and still is, is inherently difficult and risky, making a well-designed project and well-defined management and decisionmaking responsibilities absolutely essential. Relationships between A.I.D. and UF - which held directly conflicting views of their roles - were adversarial almost from the start.  Greater care should have gone into project design and into selection of a contractor.","Companion evaluation summary: PD-AAZ-896","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","PDC-1406-I-00-7007-00","","2/1/1988 12:00:00 AM","","Farming systems research|Technical assistance|Development project design|Agricultural extension|Agricultural training|Educational materials|Information networking|Technical information","West Africa","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAY047.pdf","3,088 KB","001335 - Chemonics International Consulting Div.","","000180 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to strengthen several key institutions in the energy sector of Sudan and increase reliable energy production and distribution.  Interim evaluation, originally scheduled for early 1986 but postponed due to the evacuation of U.S. personnel during a period of political turmoil, covers the period through January 1987. Overall, the project has helped increase the reliability of the Blue Nile Grid from a low of 74% in 1983 to 94% at the time of the evaluation. One component of the project focused on improving the management, billing, collection, pricing, purchasing and stores, and vehicle operation and maintenance capabilities of the National Electricity Corporation (NEC).  In particular, the improvements in the billing and collection system are already showing positive results and promise to be of major importance to the utility and the nation.  A long-run marginal cost tariff study has also been conducted and training given to engineering personnel and to vehicle mechanics.  Planning and installation of capacitors bought with Commodity Import Program funds has also begun. A second component focused on developing the National Energy Administration (NEA) as a national energy planning institution. Notable achievements include:  reorganizing NEA into a more task-oriented form; strengthening NEA's computer capabilities with hardware, software, and studies; helping bring NEA to the point of publishing NEA Sudan Energy News on its own; and helping NEA conduct several survey data collection efforts and prepare at least 10 analyses of energy issues and/or policy options. The accomplishments of these two project components - a third component, involving the General Petroleum Corporation, was never funded - were remarkable given the substantial internal and external turmoil attending implementation.  Beside the mentioned evacuation for safety reasons, the NEA component was seriously delayed by disagreements between USAID and the contractor over local currency spending rates, the departure of the Chief of Party (COP) and the 8 month hiatus before he was replaced, and the Mission's failure (perhaps because of more pressing problems) to complete certain paperwork.  The NEC component was troubled by the refusal of the NEC Director-General to name a successor to the first COP and by the destruction through misuse or cannibalization of hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of utility construction vehicles.  Also, structurally, putting both components in one project but having two separate contractors was a serious mistake and only increased the administrative effort required. Key recommendations are to continue funding at least for the computerized NEC billing and collection system as well as for the computer equipment for the NEA.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","6/1/1988 12:00:00 AM","","Electric utilities|Energy planning|Government departments|Institution building|Technical assistance|Electric power distribution|Management training|Technical training","Sudan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAY065.pdf","20,615 KB","005083 - Martin Marietta Energy Systems, Inc.","","008607 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to improve small farmer food production in the Sahelian zone of Chad through four subprojects (SP's) implemented by four PVO's (CARE, Africare, VITA, and the Organization for Rehabilitation through Training - ORT).  Evaluation covers 6/85-5/88. The project has made progress in irrigated agriculture, water management, farmer training, and, to a lesser extent, private enterprise promotion.  Africare has developed two promising water management technologies - the construction of water catchments across wadi beds and an animal traction waterlifting system - for use in the drought stricken Ouaddai prefecture.  ORT has developed new tubewell technologies, and CARE has developed improved canal lining techniques to maximize water use efficiency.  The project has also had success testing a variety of experimental crops and farming practices. Agroforesty activities have had a mixed record.  Fruit tree production and nursery development have been the most successful areas, dune stabilization the least.  Tree planting has been hampered by poor conditions (e.g., lack of water) and cultural factors (in some areas tree ownership has significant land tenure implications). Credit for farm improvements has had limited effectiveness due to local markets' inability to supply inputs and absorb farm outputs. VITA's private enterprise credit program is in serious trouble; a new effort to develop export markets for agricultural products shows much more promise. A number of recommendations are made for the project as a whole and for individual SP's.  Clearly the PVO's should continue to expand their collaboration with each other.  However, certain aspects of the project are overextended geographically, and the project needs to reevaluate those areas of Chad that can most benefit from project activities.  Food production activities should be concentrated along the Logone and Chari Rivers, and commercial agricultural production should be encouraged in high potential Sahelian/Saharan environments (e.g., the Bahr-el-Ghazal). Finally, forestry activities are best left to forestry-specific projects. The project teaches many vital lessons.  While PVO umbrella projects are a valuable development mechanism, it does require time for PVO's to develop acceptable SP designs.  SP's should focus on doing a limited number of things right, rather than engaging in a broad range of (possibly) superfluous activities. PVO's with experience working in a given country will usually produce the best results, but prior success in a given activity (e.g., VITA's previous success with credit programs in Chad) will not guarantee continued success.  Finally, the transition from prolonged disaster relief to development activities, as is the case with this project, can be difficult.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","5/1/1988 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural development|Agricultural production|Farmers|Small farms|Appropriate technology|Technology transfer|Private voluntary organizations","Chad|Sahel","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAY079.pdf","6,927 KB","008528 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to finance short-term consulting and other services to private enterprises through proposals developed by Africa Bureau offices and Missions.  The evaluation covers the period 1/85-10/87. The project has been well-managed and has proven a flexible and useful tool for responding to Mission needs.  It has fulfilled many of its objectives.  Twelve investment climate assessments were conducted by contractors - for Gabon, Benin, Zaire, Swaziland, Ghana, Madagascar, Cameroon, Guinea, Mauritania, Botswana, Guinea-Bissau, and Niger.  The reports provided Missions with current information about policy constraints to private sector growth and recommendations for policy reform. Mission personnel generally agreed that the climate assessments focused attention on issues relevant to private sector growth, although there is no evidence that specific policy reforms have been instituted as a result of the assessments. Eighteen feasibility and technical studies have been completed, dealing with such topics as financial markets, trade and investment opportunities, and specific investment projects.  A feasibility study cost sharing program has also been implemented, in which U.S. companies are reimbursed 50% for undertaking investment feasibility studies in Africa.  Two of these studies (in Togo and the Ivory Coast) have been completed, and are expected to lead to investments of $1 million and $2 million respectively. The project has funded other field support activities, including private sector training programs, conferences, and seminars for Mission staff.  These activities were informative and helpful in sensitizing field staff to opportunities for applying private sector resources to the economic development process. On the negative side, several components of the original project plan have not been fulfilled.  Assistance to indigenous organizations has been far less than anticipated.  Most likely, Missions will provide such assistance after they have undertaken a private enterprise project.  No direct training of Africans has been financed, although a program for 3,000 trainees was part of the original project plan.  Support for privatization has also been less than anticipated, perhaps because of the availability of A.I.D./PRE funding for this purpose. Finally, although it is difficult to document project impact to date or to demonstrate cost-effectiveness, it appears that important initial steps have been taken toward fostering private sector development in Africa.  One concern is that project activities will generate expectations for follow-on programs for which no funding may be available.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","AFR-0510-O-00-8007-00","","1/1/1988 12:00:00 AM","","Private enterprises|Private sector|Investment environment|Pre investment surveys|Investment promotion","Africa south of Sahara","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAY108.pdf","1,512 KB","004589 - USAID.

"Project assistance completion report on a project (8/82-12/87) to support decentralized rural development in Senegal by strengthening the Ecole Nationale d'Economie Applique's (ENEA) capability to provide management training for middle and lower-level public agencies' staff. The project was successful on many counts:  it was implemented in a timely fashion, with all inputs and other elements in place, and yearly targets attained.  Nine of ten participants (ENEA staff) completed graduate training, seven new management courses were integrated into ENEA's core curriculum and specialized college programs, seven seminars/training workshops in management and computer operations were conducted, and two in-service training sessions for ENEA graduates were carried out.  In addition, a training book translated into four national languages and other teaching materials have been tested and disseminated. However, ENEA's ability to carry these gains forward or to translate project success into meaningful training programs in the future faces several constraints, including:  a ""top-down"" authority structure unsuited to an academic institution; a lack of regular communication among ENEA, its client organizations, and other training institutions (both public and private); a cumbersome organizational bureaucracy which hinders the planning and execution of routine tasks; a lack of reliable financial support from the Government of Senegal, making expenditures problematical; and a policy of staff training, work assignment, and promotions that does not consistently reflect individual capabilities or contributions.  As a result, ENEA staff appear on the whole to be poorly motivated, or motivated by monetary considerations alone.  Many are dissatisfied with working conditions and wish to leave, including several who received U.S. training and have not been given assignments commensurate with their training upon their return to ENEA.  If these individuals leave, or are encouraged to do so, the project's long-term impact will be diluted.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","6/1/1988 12:00:00 AM","","Rural development|Decentralization|Teacher training|Institution building|Educational facilities|Management training","Senegal","","","008600 - USAID.

"Evaluates the Government of Togo's (GOT) compliance with conditions precedent (CP's) to the release of the second tranche of a $7 million cash transfer designed to encourage the GOT and its parastatal TOGOGRAIN to liberalize private sector grain export policies.  Evaluation covers 8/86-5/88. GOT compliance with CP's for the second tranche does not warrant release of the funds at this time.  Although the first CP required the GOT to issue export licenses to private cereals traders for two seasons, no licenses were issued during the program's first export season, 9/86-4/87.  In the 1987-88 season, 97 tons of exports were licensed, but the procedure for getting a license was not particularly open or competitive.  Declining food production in Togo over the 1986-88 period has clearly influenced the GOT's attitude toward licensing exports, as the GOT believes it must control food supplies if it is to ensure food security. Although the evaluation team would prefer that licenses be given to all legitimate traders desiring them (vs. the CP approach of approving specific transactions), this is unlikely given the GOT's inflexible approach to food security.  Therefore the team recommends that the CP be met before the second tranche is released.  A TA team, funded under a companion grant and only just arrived in Togo, should work with the GOT to encourage further trade liberalization. CP's regarding local currency generations have not been met either: the GOT did deposit the equivalent of the first tranche cash transfer in an agricultural credit fund as planned, but it has not developed an acceptable plan for use of the funds.  The TA team will help the GOT to develop such a plan.  Since there does not seem to be the institutional capacity in country to manage the large amounts of local currency the second tranche will generate, and since the market structure of the agricultural sector limits the demand for credit, perhaps the best option would be to not program the local currency from the second tranche at all, which would allow the program to contribute to GOT deficit reduction on a one to one basis. The remaining two CP's have been fulfilled.  (1) In conjunction with World Bank structural adjustment guidelines, TOGOGRAIN has curtailed almost all its cereal marketing activities; one (permissible) exception was when the GOT authorized TOGOGRAIN to sell some of its stock in food deficit areas in southern Togo in 3/88.  (2) Requirements that the GOT publish and disseminate agricultural production and price data have been nominally met, although greater use could be made of broadcast media, particularly radio. With the help of the TA team and USAID/T, the GOT should modify licensing procedures and develop more liberal export policies. As more licenses are granted, the second tranche can be released, probably by the end of the 1988-89 agricultural year.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","5/1/1988 12:00:00 AM","","Food crops|Agricultural product marketing|Exports|Trade liberalization|Food policy|Food security","Togo","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDBBM623.pdf","1,544 KB","008614 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to encourage edible oil production in Burma by providing credit to oilseed producers for expanded processing and marketing facilities.  Mid-term, formative evaluation covers the period through 7/88. Though behind schedule (due to, inter alia,  untimely commodity deliveries, lack of candidates for training, and non-utilization of planned in-country training consultancies), the project has made progress toward its objectives.  A TA team (an engineer and two master mechanics) has been in place since 10/86, and 116 of a planned 262 person-months of long- and short-term training in the United States is underway.  A central quality control lab and three mill labs have been established, and commodities are on order to help establish ten more mill labs.  Rehabilitation has begun on six oil mills using existing equipment, and standardized oil expeller worms and cages have been designed and a prototype is being installed at the Prome oil mill. However, implementation delays mean that the original goal of rehabilitating 10-15 mills over the life of the project is no longer feasible.  The training component has also suffered from the delays, since there is no longer time for Master's degree candidates to complete their training.  Additionally, the Government of Burma (GOB) has contributed only 6% of its planned funding (vs. 54% by A.I.D.). Despite these problems, the project can still make an important contribution to Burmese agriculture.  Its goal and purpose are still achievable, if certain important design changes are agreed upon. Accordingly, recommendations are made to improve project management and coordination with the GOB.  More specifically, the Mission should cut A.I.D. funding from $9.5 million to $6.9 million, reduce the number of oil mills to be rehabilitated from 10-15 to 10 mills capable of operating at 75% capacity, and limit the Master's degree training program to the four candidates currently selected.  The GOB should provide a full-time project manager and make better use of the short-term training component. Finally, mill rehabilitation efforts often involve too many institutions; work could be speeded up by making individual workshops and mill personnel responsible for expeller rehabilitation repair and physical rehabilitating and maintenance, and by making the GOB responsible for quality control.","Work order no. 7","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-1406-I-00-7006-00","","7/1/1988 12:00:00 AM","","Oil crops|Food processing facilities|Food processing technology","Burma","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAY151.pdf","4,075 KB","000436 - Development Associates, Inc.","","008521 - USAID.

"PACR for project (1978-87) to provide electrical service to rural areas in nine states of India. The project met its goals a year ahead of schedule.  By March 1986 electrical connections totalling 380,000 kilowatts had been completed. The total cost per kilowatt was $390.26, of which A.I.D. contributed 39.1%. The turning point for the project occurred in 1984.  Up to that time, the implementing State Electrical Boards (SEB's) had focused on procurement and construction, and had given little attention to providing actual electrical connections for the rural population.  The project design was altered in 1984 to tie disbursal of A.I.D. funds to the SEB's to actual kilowatts connected, rather than simply making lump disbursals to cover the costs of equipment, and Mission staff regularly reviewed SEB records and made site visits to verify that connections had been made.  The design change also placed a premium on connecting higher-load devices, particularly electric irrigation pumps, instead of household connections, which made small farmers the prime beneficiaries of the project. The project has had a positive impact on the life of beneficiaries. Increased use of irrigation on small farms (up to 2 ha) has increased farm income 50-80% per unit of land. Electrification also brought with it higher employment, lower lighting costs (savings per family of Rs 200-600 per year compared to kerosene costs), and improved quality of life. Further, the ""backward"" population (Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes) owned 25% of the electric irrigation pumpsets in four states surveyed and constituted 20% of domestic connections. The project's main lesson is that future rural electrification projects should tie financing to actual kilowatt connections, in order to ensure that expensive infrastructure is put to use.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","7/1/1988 12:00:00 AM","","Rural areas|Electricity|Electrification","India","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAY153.pdf","266 KB","008557 - USAID.

"From 1955 to 1972, A.I.D. contracted with several U.S. land grant universities to help India establish eight agricultural universities. Today, India boasts 28 State Agricultural Universities (SAU's), and the SAU system, together with the Indian Council for Agricultural Research (ICAR), has become the world's second largest agricultural scientific establishment, with numerous achievements in agricultural education, research, and extension.  The SAU's have developed the capacity to train students through the Ph.D. level, provided technical support to various state extension services, and made a considerable impact on Indian agriculture in terms of personnel, productivity, and technology development and transfer.  Besides detailing these achievements and the factors contributing to them, this study, part of a worldwide review of A.I.D.'s support to higher education in agriculture, documents:  (1) the historical development of the SAU's and their current structure; (2) their conformity with the ICAR Model Act; and (3) the issues which, in the view of SAU faculty and others in India, now face the system given the changing nature of world agriculture. Pressing management issues include:  (1) strategic planning to build new constituencies; (2) the isolation of the SAU's and the overcentralization of the SAU system; (3) compromises in regard to faculty quality; (4) faculty uncertainty about the mission of the SAU's; (5) high staff turnover and in some cases very high levels of faculty vacancies, resulting in heavy teaching loads and student frustration; and (6) the inadequate representation of women both in professional disciplines and among the student body.  Key educational issues are: (1) lack of staff in the social sciences; (2) outmoded methodologies for teaching and for extension education; (3) severe limitations in regard to the basic sciences; (4) the high number of students from urban rather than rural areas; and (5-6) the need to develop an interdisciplinary approach to research and expand job opportunities for graduates. The report concludes that the crucial test for SAU's in the next decade will be to develop into ""proactive, environment-shaping"" organizations.  This can only be accomplished by forging new links with other agricultural institutions (e.g., the state irrigation departments) and, more importantly, by ensuring the continued political support of the Government of India.

"Founded in 1943, Kasetsart University's (KU's) original goal was to provide trained personnel to Thailand's Ministry of Agriculture and other public sector agricultural agencies.  More than 40 years and some 38,270 graduates later, the university is entering a new phase:  the transition from agricultural school to a broad-based academic institution capable of providing skilled graduates to Thailand's growing private sector.  This document reviews KU's institutional development and draws valuable lessons for the development of agricultural universities in general. KU has participated in several programs which have fundamentally improved Thai agriculture.  Of special interest is the National Corn and Sorghum Research Program, which has provided Thai farmers with improved maize varieties and cultural practices, resulting in a hundredfold increase in maize production.  KU has also influenced the development of Thailand's world-renowned tropical fruit industry and has been instrumental in developing specialty crops such as honey, straw mushrooms, tropical orchids, and silk.  KU scientists have contributed to supplying the Thai people with low-cost, high-quality protein supplements and have helped fight environmental degradation by participating in soil mapping, land use classification, and remote sensing activities. A number of lessons can be derived from KU's experience.  (1) The role of agricultural higher education needs to be reconceptualized in order to enhance the relevance of agricultural schools and facilities. (2) Universities should develop strategic mechanisms for integrating diverse faculties and research programs around a common, institutional goal.  (3) New forms of university organization are needed to provide more opportunities for students and faculty to engage in active, problem-oriented learning activities. (4) Universities should be held accountable for the relevance of their programs to the needs of the community.  (5) The university should encourage and support leaders capable of introducing change and innovation within the university.  (6) Donors and host governments should more effectively address long-term faculty development needs. (7) External donors should focus more on developing ties between the university and its outside policy, scientific, and industrial constituencies.

"Evaluates project to promote diversified irrigated agriculture in El Salvador.  Evaluation covers the period 8/85-12/87. The evaluation identified several constraints to project success. First, there is a crucial need for more B.Sc. and vocational level irrigation technicians.  Although the National School of Agriculture (ENA) has the facilities to provide the training, it is not legally able to grant B.Sc. degrees; an amendment to its charter enabling it to grant B.Sc. degrees is essential.  In addition, ENA staff have not been able to go abroad for advanced training, as planned, as their salaries are not continued while they are away.  It also appears that ENA is experiencing financial problems which could negatively affect the project. Second, management of the credit component could be improved. CORPREX, a cooperative comprised mostly of irrigation equipment suppliers, was formed by the project to manage the loan portfolio, but after 2 years the incorporation process is still unfinished.  Moreover, the prospect of irrigation equipment suppliers controlling loan funds earmarked for irrigation equipment raises the possibility of conflict of interest. FUSADES has in effect been managing the credit component, and should continue to do so, while CORPREX could play a role in promoting irrigation and training farmers. Proposals that FUSADES use loan funds to expand its private sector activities and be permitted to invest in operations funded by the project should be resisted, since they would compromise FUSADES' standing as a nonprofit development institution.  Other recommendations are, inter alia, to:  encourage FUSADES to finance as many projects as can qualify and to solicit proposals from other areas of the country; increase the amount of credit available for packing and processing plants; provide incentives to increase equipment suppliers' participation; remove restrictions on financing for furrow irrigation; and take steps to upgrade agricultural research capacity. Lessons learned are as follows.  (1) It takes much more time to change cropping patterns than was allotted; future, similar projects should be funded for at least 8 years.  (2) Farmer interest waned during the 2 years between project approval and the arrival of advisors; TA should be provided rapidly and continuously.  (3) Public and private sector cooperation is essential, and has only recently been achieved in this project. The Mission must work continuously to ensure good relations.  (4) Due to the high turnover among Salvadoran officials, many times key government officals did not know about the project. USAID/ES should stand ready to provide new officials with copies of project documents.  (5) One person at the Mission should remain in charge of the project for at least 4 years to ensure continuity of administration.","Companion project evaluation summary: PD-AAY-936","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-0085-I-00-6097-00","","3/1/1988 12:00:00 AM","","Irrigation|Irrigation system construction|Water supply structure maintenance|On farm water management|Nontraditional agricultural exports|Export promotion|Financial management|Agricultural credit","El Salvador","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAY204.pdf","1,422 KB","000356 - Checchi and Co.

"Evaluates project to provide emergency credit assistance to small and medium size farmers of Bolivia's Altiplano and the Lowlands. Final external evaluation covers the period 9/86-9/88. The project has been fully implemented.  While disbursal delays, adverse climate conditions, and depressed prices for some crops forced many farmers to request loan extensions, some 8,757 loans have been made, as compared to the target figure of 2,500. In all, $13,540,715 was disbursed, of which $2,247,837 has been recovered.  It is expected that a high percentage of the loans will be recovered within a reasonable time. There continues to be a great need for agricultural credit in Bolivia, and it is strongly recommended that USAID/B use funds recovered from this project to finance improved credit programs for small and medium sized farmers. This project teaches a number of lessons for future credit programs. (1) Cooperatives and co-op credit associations generally did a better job in channeling and supervising credit and in providing TA than did private banks, and should be favored in the future.  (2) Credit should be:  available for both working capital and fixed investments, provided at flexible terms and to coincide with production/marketing cycles, and accompanied by training and TA.  (3) Targeting of credit doesn't work (farmers will use the credit in accordance with their own needs, not the project's).  (4) Funds to intermediate credit institutions (ICI's) should be provided for longer periods (3-4 years) to allow them to manage the funds (select beneficiaries, monitor payment, etc.) more carefully.  (5) Future credit projects should encourage greater participation by agricultural chambers and farmers' associations, strengthening their capacity to intermediate between farmers and ICI's. (6) Credit distribution should be planned by region and by crop.  (7) More monitoring of and feedback to ICI's is needed.  (8) More attention should be given to the potential negative effects of legal instruments - in this case a Supreme Court decree allowing food to be imported indiscriminately depressed prices.  (9) Bolivia's P.L. 480 Executive Secretariat managed the project efficiently, despite the speed with which USAID/B wanted it implemented, and USAID/B's own delays in disbursements (the project was greatly handicapped by these delays). (10) Unclear/inappropriate objectively verifiable indicators and means of verification in a project design hamper both implementation and evaluation.","Work order no. 17|Companion evaluation summary: PD-AAY-913","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","PDC-1406-I-00-7011-00","","9/1/1988 12:00:00 AM","","Emergency relief|Agricultural credit|Credit cooperatives|Agricultural cooperatives","Bolivia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAY205.pdf","8,592 KB","000480 - Experience, Inc.","","008515 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to strengthen national agricultural research systems (NARS) in sub-Saharan Africa by helping two International Agricultural Research Centers (IARC's) - ICRISAT and IITA - and a regional unit of the Organization of African Unity/Scientific Technical and Research Commission to set up four regional crop networks.  External evaluation covers the period through 9/88. The IARC's have provided very effective Network Coordinators and the Project Coordinating Office (CO) has provided commendable administrative and political support.  The principal constraint on the evolution of African leadership within the networks has been insufficient formal training of NARS network scientists. Plans for M.S. and Ph.D training should be developed. In addition, A.I.D. should continue funding the CO at its current level for the duration of the project.  While other funding sources should be pursued, major efforts in this direction should be deferred until after the 1991 reevaluation.  Various other management suggestions to improve CO/IARC support to the networks are included in the report. The project's focus on crop-specific research networks and its regional approach to national human resources development are found to be appropiate, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, where the development of the scientific capacity of indigenous research institutions is a critical component of agricultural development. The effectiveness of a regional follow-on project may be influenced by a recent initiative calling for all A.I.D. regional projects to be funded from operational year budgets of country Missions.

"Evaluates performance of SOFIHDES, a Haitian development finance corporation financed partially through capital from private investors and created to provide credit to industrial enterprises.  External evaluation covers the period 1983-8/88 SOFIHDES is a well-run institution which became profitable in only its second year of operation, but recently it has been criticized for its conservative lending policies.  SOFIHDES' clientele in many cases is the same as that of commercial banks, and, while it does have a more liberal collateral policy, its credit manual excludes lending to a number of industries (including agriculture, mining, construction, restaurants and hotels, transport/storage, and communications concerns). In addition, SOFIHDES maintains a number of policies (e.g., borrowing businesses be 51% Haitian owned, refusal to make loans to board members) which restrict the number of loans it is able to make.  As a result, most loans have been restricted to export (assembly) industries, import substitution industries, and agro-industries in and around Port-au-Prince; little attention has been paid to rural areas. All this calls into question SOFIHDES' success as a development bank. Clearly, it is in a position to increase its lending activities.  A number of recommendations are made toward this end.  SOFIHDES should continue to pay scrupulous attention to project appraisal, as well as maintaining current efforts to provide TA and training to support financed ventures.  More aggressive searches should be mounted for suitable projects in rural areas, however, and SOFIHDES should consider relaxing certain restrictions (e.g., by financing non-Haitian owned enterprises, and in sectors that have up to now been neglected, such as commercial agriculture) and revising certain policies (e.g., by extending credit to board members, increasing its debt-equity ratio from 5: 1 to 8: 1, and lowering the floor for individual loans to $30,000). SOFIHDES should also (1) postpone the issuance of new capital shares until the funds so obtained can be put to productive use; (2) capitalize $300,000 of the retained earnings; (3) declare a dividend for the founders' shares of 6%; (4) explore the possibility of taking on a merchant banking function; and (5) more sharply focus existing public relations campaigns. It is recommended that USAID/H concur in the above changes, release the $2.8 million in loan funds earmarked for SOFIHDES without requiring SOFIHDES to immediately increase its share capital, continue funding the agribusiness TA advisor, and consider additional TA to help identify and prepare projects for SOFIHDES consideration.","Delivery order no. 39","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-0085-I-00-6097-00","","9/1/1988 12:00:00 AM","","Development banks|Industrial credit|Loan administration|Institution building","Haiti","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAY209.pdf","4,136 KB","000356 - Checchi and Co.

"Final evaluation of a project to protect and restore the soil, water, and plant resource base in Nepal.  Evaluation covers the period 1985-88. Project activities have been more successful since attention was shifted to small watershed units following the second interim evaluation in 1985.  Some activities are efficiently meeting objectives and have a reasonable chance of being sustained.  Key components of these successes have been (1) incorporation of user group needs in activity planning and implementation; (2) flexible institutional approaches to take advantage of existing opportunities; (3) use of low cost, locally available materials in the design and construction of infrastructure; (4) local cooperation for long-term protection of an area; (5) evidence of local awareness of the importance of resource conservation; and (6) more focus on smaller activities within more limited geographical areas. Future USAID/N projects of this sort should focus more on the panchayat level, providing incentives to encourage local level natural resource management.  Project designs should meet the most critical conditions for sustainability (i.e., technical appropriateness, economic efficiency, user group participation). Designs should also ensure flexibility for leveraging existing opportunities where appropriate, encourage the use of local contractors, and ensure appropriate monitoring of activities. Other recommendations are that (1) the HMG/N should make forest and grazing land conservation a higher priority, and invest more time and effort in providing in-country training for professionals and in involving women in natural resource management efforts; (2) using gabions for river training and gully control is neither technically effective nor economically efficient and should receive low HMG/N priority; and (3) USAID/N should use innovative strategies to implement natural resource projects as well as innovative funding mechanisms, e.g., ""sinking funds.""","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","PDC-5517-I-00-7137-00","","5/1/1988 12:00:00 AM","","Natural resource management|Forest resources|Water management","Nepal","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAY217.pdf","3,521 KB","005072 - Tropical Research and Development, Inc.","","008583 - USAID.

"Evaluates multi-donor cereals marketing restructuring program (PRMC) in Mali.  Evaluation covers the period 1986-6/88. Considerable progress has been made in liberalizing cereals marketing in Mali.  Offical prices for coarse grains were abolished in 11/87, and the role of OPAM (a parastatal) in price support and stabilization via a regulatory stock was abolished in 12/87.  OPAM was given a new mandate to manage food aid, supply deficit areas, and maintain national food security stocks.  These new policies have allowed PRMC donors over the past 18 months to focus more on supporting the private market by funding credit and market information programs and less on supporting OPAM or paying for subsidies. Rice policies remain problematic.  The ban on the import of rice that began in 3/87 still has not been officially lifted. However, there has been a decision to allow some rice imports, and approval of a new system of variable taxation on rice imports is expected soon.  This explicitly protectionist measure - which was approved by PRMC and by the World Bank - is supposed to give Mali's rice producers time to become more competitive with the world market, but it is far from certain that the tax will be discontinued after 3 years, as scheduled, since there is little incentive for producers to reduce costs. USAID/M should continue to support PRMC by contributing food aid and, if warranted, money, but the Mission should ensure that counterpart funds are needed by PRMC and that PRMC activities are well-supervised and designed.  Unneeded counterpart funds should be reprogrammed for other USAID/M projects/programs.  Specific recommendations are to:  (1) restrict the role of PRMC largely to policy issues, leaving the implementation of programs (e.g., credit programs) to specific donors; (2) increase supervision of credit programs; (3) increase interest rates for merchant credit programs; (4) expand the credit programs as they prove viable, but make sure they do not become a backdoor means of price support; (5) closely monitor OPAM's role as supplier of deficit areas, so that this role does not become an excuse to increase OPAM's sway; (6) consider supporting programs in transportation infrastructure, storage, and agricultural technology; (7) modify the variable tax system in 3 years to provide a declining level of protection in order to encourage producers to lower their costs; and (8) explore means of increasing intraregional trade.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-1406-I-15-7007-00","","6/1/1988 12:00:00 AM","","Cereals|Cereal crops|Agricultural product marketing|Trade liberalization|Food policy|Food security","Mali","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAY218.pdf","2,420 KB","001335 - Chemonics International Consulting Div.","","004142 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to upgrade Bangladesh's Space Research and Remote Sensing Organization's (SPARRSO's) remote sensing and data analysis capabilities.  Evaluation covers 1980-5/88, and includes recommendations for a possible extension beyond the current PACD of 12/88. The project has significantly strengthened SPARRSO.  Operation of stations to receive and process satellite data is now routine at SPARRSO, and data are delivered to the Meteorological Department on a daily basis.  Staff are fully competent to maintain and operate all equipment provided by the project. SPARRSO's ability to meet user needs has developed slowly, mostly because of slow delivery of equipment.  For example, the computer system was not installed until 1985, and the final software is yet to arrive. Despite these constraints, a wide range of natural resource studies have been undertaken and completed for a variety of Bangladeshi and donor agencies.  User acceptance of SPARRSO work is apparently very high. There are, however, a number of short- and long-term management, procedural, and technical constraints on SPARRSO's outreach to users. Key needs include (1) organizational changes to enhance SPARRSO's potential for self-sufficiency; (2) procedural changes to allow SPARRSO to operate the UNDP Service Oriented Program; (3) actions to guarantee maintenance and upgrading of project-funded facilities and to provide for potential integration of various SPARRSO projects; and (4) plans to increase SPARRSO's interaction with the regional and international remote sensing communities. A project continuation is strongly recommended.  Specific recommendations are provided for both the near (1988-90) and long-term (1990-93) future.  During 1988-90, SPARRSO should, inter alia, (1) form special units to facilitate transfer of services and products to user agencies and donors; (2) introduce PC-based image processing work-stations with geographic image processing software and establish networks to the existing VAX system; (3) examine the Data Collection Platform program and establish a local contract to service the platforms and update the sensor electronics; (4) improve photographic and report publishing capabilities though improved PC software; and (5) continue staff training and development programs.  Total cost of this short-term program is about $1.5 million. Over the long-term, SPARSSO should (1) replace the VAX system; (2) replace or upgrade the meteorological satellite ground receiving station to receive new types of information from U.S. and other satellite programs; (3) increase PC network capabilities; and (4) continue at a reduced level on-the-job training.  The projected budget for this program is $830,000.","Companion evaluation summary: PD-ABB-404","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","5/1/1988 12:00:00 AM","","Satellites|Natural resource management|Remote sensing|Environmental research|Meteorology|Institution building","Bangladesh","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDCAY290.pdf","1,134 KB","007642 - Earth Satellite Corp.","","008511 - USAID.

"Final Mission report on a project (1981-87) to help the Government of Ecuador (GOE) institutionalize its Integrated Rural Development (IRD) Program. A major aim was to assist IRD activities in Salcedo and Quimiag. A redesign of the Quimiag irrigation system in early 1986 increased costs by over $4 million, shutting down most other project components.  By that time, the project had:  completed 495 ha of secondary distribution systems and 7,000 ha of diversion and conveyance work in Salcedo and provided TA for operation and maintenance; disbursed over $1.5 million in credit to small farmers; built 120 km of roads in Quimiag (though most planned road work proved unnecessary); built community training centers in both areas; and planted over 600,000 trees on farms and school grounds.  By the 9/87 PACD, the primary irrigation canal in Quimiag was 90% complete and the secondary and tertiary systems 100% designed and 15% and 10% constructed, respectively. CARE, with P.L. 480 and GOE financing, is helping Ecuador's Institute for Water Resources complete the systems, which are using sprinkler technology because traditional surface irrigation would cause rapid and extensive erosion in Quimiag. A sharp rise in the value of the dollar provided much more local currency than expected.  Much of this money was used for unplanned activities, e.g., schools, some of them in Jipijapa, where several activities were undertaken even though only a planning effort was envisaged. Long-term credit was to have been used for on-farm irrigation, but instead was used almost entirely to buy grazing cattle.  This was partially due to the fact that farmers could use cattle for collateral, but would have had to mortgage their land to obtain credit for on-farm improvements. The GOE's new IRD Development Secretariat (SEDRI) did not fare well as implementing agency, and was dismantled in 1986. Although the project did not institutionalize IRD to the degree planned, the GOE has designed over 15 other donor-financed IRD projects. Several lessons were learned.  (1) It is unwise to assign implementation for a complicated project to a new organization. (2) IRD projects should be implemented in phases.  This one was not.  (3) Lack of adequate technical supervision hurt almost every aspect of the project and robbed it of momentum.  (4) USAID/E's management interest waned after the project began having problems.  Constant attention is needed to assure implementation.  (5) Because planned cooperation with the Forestry Sector Development (FSD) Project was not formalized in the Pro-Ag's for the two projects, there was no basis for overruling the SEDRI forester's decision not to work with FSD. Inter-project coordination should be built into project agreements.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","6/1/1988 12:00:00 AM","","Institution building|Government departments|Integrated rural development|Irrigation system construction|Agricultural credit","Ecuador","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDKAM534.pdf","169 KB","008538 - USAID.

"Evaluates the impact of the first grant under the African Economic Policy Reform Program (AEPRP) in Guinea.  A $10 million AEPRP grant, aimed at providing balance of payment assistance in support of Guinea's economic policy reform efforts, was authorized in 9/86, and the first tranche ($5 million) was released in 6/87.  The second tranche had not yet been released as of this 5/88 evaluation. The performance of Guinea in implementing a comprehensive program of macroeconomic policy reform has been clearly outstanding, at least during the period late 1985-mid 1987).  However, a number of more specific microeconomic conditions of the AEPRP grant have not yet been met.  In particular, the government is reluctant to liquidate the two existing state-owned agricultural input enterprises (AGRIMA and SEMAPE); a flexible approach is recommended. The Guinean government is confronted with major political, economic, and social difficulties.  Vigorous action is required to reactivate the macroeconomic policy reform program undertaken in late 1985.  Key issues to be addressed are exchange rate management, budget performance, wage policy, and food prices. Most of these issues will be discussed with a joint International Monetary Fund (IMF)/World Bank mission tentatively scheduled for late June 1988. If the Guinean government takes the appropriate measures to address these critical macroeconomic policy issues, A.I.D. should definitely join with other donors to provide additional quick disbursing policy-based financing in support of the Guinean reform program.  Future AEPRP assistance should be linked with improved food pricing policy, a key issue for the long-term future of the agricultural sector in Guinea.

"PACR on a project (8/80-5/87) to stimulate economic development in southern Sudan and northern Kenya by providing a 620-km all-weather route between the two countries as an alternative to the road through Uganda, which is periodically closed due to internal fighting.  The project was funded by A.I.D., the European Economic Community, and NORAD, the Norwegian Agency for International Development. The project purpose was not met because the amount of money necessary to upgrade the road was underestimated.  Also, plans to support Government of Sudan gravelling units were unsuccessful because road gravelling equipment in southern Sudan was in much worse condition than was believed.  The project therefore stressed construction by private contractors. Nonetheless, the project did make progress toward a future achievement of its purpose.  Roads in both Kenya and Sudan were improved through the placement of structures in drainage channels and rivers where high water previously had blocked traffic. Although there are still delays at some stream crossings during the heavy rainy season, the project has provided a higher-percentage all-weather road for four-wheel drive vehicles. The project's efforts have also stimulated other donors to fund or consider funding sections of the road.  Thus, the project's purpose may eventually be met. Lessons learned:  (1) Multi-donor projects can be implemented even if individual donor regulations have to be combined.  (2) Parallel or component financing is simpler than co-mingling.  (3) Financing of project design and supervision by donors other than A.I.D. on A.I.D.-financed projects is possible but leads to less than total control.  Projects spread over two countries are extremely complex.  (4) An underfunded project can be salvaged only if project inputs are redefined.  Other donors cannot be counted on to fill a funding gap. (5) A.I.D. should beware awarding construction contracts to lowest bidders, who may subsequently rely on claims to more than make up for the lowness of the bid.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","9/1/1988 12:00:00 AM","","Access roads|Drainage|Donor coordination|Road construction","Kenya|Sudan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAY288.pdf","1,304 KB","008607 - USAID.

"PACR for project (1975-85) to help small farmers in Peru's Sierra region improve land use and agricultural production via activities to improve irrigation, introduce improved crop varieties, and promote double cropping. The project successfully completed many of its planned activities, improving the agricultural potential of the lands in the target area and contributing to long-term agricultural development by increasing the efficiency of land and water use and by making more water available to farmers, thereby significantly reducing the risk of catastrophic failure caused by lack of rainfall. Specifically, 17 of 27 planned small-scale irrigation and drainage network subprojects were designed and completed, making 13,443 of a planned 27,900 ha suitable for improved agricultural production, benefiting 10,439 families.  The project also provided credit extension assistance to 100 farm families, and granted about 200 small farmer loans per season; established 135 research plots and 20 demonstration plots on 11 crops, trained 28 technicians and 33 new farmers, using baseline data from the 1985 crop cycle, and developed methodologies for conducting farm-level budget analyses and sociological data collation. Finally, 795 ha of a planned 1,200 ha were reforested.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1988 12:00:00 AM","","Farmers|Small farms|Irrigation system construction|Irrigated farming|Upland cropping|Crop production|Beneficiary count","Peru","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDKAM575.pdf","51 KB","008591 - USAID.

"PACR for project (1980-87) to improve natural resource planning in Peru by financing TA, training, and computer equipment to expand the remote sensing and data analysis capabilities of the Oficina Nacional de Evaluacion de Recursos Naturales (ONERN). The project was successfully completed 6/30/87 - 4 years after the original PACD - having achieved all its programmed activities and purposes.  ONERN developed an automated Geographic Information System (GIS) and a satellite image analysis system, and 23 people from 7 ONERN departments participated in the development of a hierarchical data base designed to allow more efficient storage and manipulation of data for the GIS.  A total of 29 ONERN staff received in-house training in GIS applications, two ONERN professionals completed a digital image processing course, and 16 staff members received remote sensing and cartography training in the United States and Panama.  ONERN now has reconnaissance-level soil erosion and land use information, LANDSAT imagery, and life zone maps for the entire country. ONERN has also: completed over 20 detailed resource base studies; conducted GIS training and demonstration applications in the Upper Huallaga Valley, Puno, Palcazu, Cerro de Pasco, Junin, and Chumbivilcas; and completed the collection, storage, and analysis of data for the development of simulation models in these areas. In addition, ONERN:  (1) published Peru's first Environmental Profile, which is being utilized by the National Planning Institute in planning environmental and development policy; and (2) completed a number of smaller regional environmental studies, including a land use report on grazing suitability in the Department of Cuzco.  The High Jungle Development Policy Office (APODESA) and ONERN collaborated in designing a data base for the Palcazu Valley under the Central Selva Resource Management Project. A.I.D.'s quarter-century long support for ONERN has had impressive results - a leading organization in natural resource inventory, evaluation, and analysis with a well-trained cadre of professionals now exists in Peru.  ONERN continues to produce the most complete coverage of published resource inventory data and maps in the country, and its products are used by the government, universities, and international environmental organizations.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1988 12:00:00 AM","","Natural resource inventories|Natural resource management|Remote sensing|Computers|Technical training|Environmental research|Research centers|Institution building","Peru","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDKAM580.pdf","61 KB","008591 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to help African governments to plan and implement sound national energy programs and promote public and private energy conservation initiatives.  External final evaluation covers the period 9/82-9/87. The project suffered from serious design and management flaws. At the time of project design, oil prices were high, and A.I.D. policy emphasized energy planning and renewable energy technologies.  But by the time the project was approved, interest in the issue had waned.  In addition, many Missions were discouraged from developing subprojects (SP's) because of the bureaucratic burdens this imposed; this was particularly true for Missions without officers trained in energy or forestry. A.I.D. management and supervision of the contractor were inadequate. This was a result of many factors:  budget cuts; closing of the Africa Bureau office that had been managing the project; and lack of technical expertise among A.I.D. overseers. In early 1984, A.I.D. management asked the contractor to redesign the project to accommodate budget cuts.  Outside, unbiased experts were not consulted on the redesign, meaning that major redirection of this complex regional project was based solely on recommendations of interested parties.  Moreover, no mid-term evaluation had been conducted, which also could have provided valuable objective advice on improving the project. On the positive side, the project did fund 9 bilateral SP's and 38 single-issue TA activities, including various types of training, workshops, studies, and the preparation of a host of reports, technical papers, computer models, etc.  The TA provided by the prime contractor was apparently of high quality.  Its cost-effectiveness, however, is open to question because A.I.D. did not require sufficient financial data to be collected and analyzed.  In comparison, it seems that SP activities were more cost-effective than single-issue TA. Several lessons were learned.  (1) Projects concerned with a specialized issue such as energy should be managed by an A.I.D. office with in-house expertise in that issue.  In the case of regional projects with bilateral SP's, Mission personnel should also have experience in that issue.  (2) Regional projects in Africa should be managed in the field, not by A.I.D./W.  (3) The cost-effectiveness of providing TA from contractors' field offices should be realistically weighed against providing in-house capabilities in A.I.D. offices.  (4) A.I.D. should assess more realistically the U.S. political climate before committing to a long-term project.  (5) Mid-term evaluations should be an absolute requirement for any project of four years' duration or more. (6) Project-produced materials (e.g., manuals) should undergo independent peer review before dissemination.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-5730-I-00-6110-00","","9/1/1988 12:00:00 AM","","Energy planning|Energy research|Energy policy","Africa south of Sahara|Liberia|Lesotho|Kenya","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAY297.pdf","7,344 KB","005612 - deLucia and Associates, Inc.","","001554 - USAID.

"External evaluation of a project component to build the Government of Indonesia's (GOI's) institutional capacity to plan and implement overseas training programs.  The evaluation covers the period 1984-2/88. With project funding and TA, the GOI's Overseas Training Office (OTO) has made notable progress.  More than 600 academic and technical participants have been programmed for training in a variety of fields, exceeding overall project targets.  On the negative side, the project was less successful in meeting objectives to involve women and universities.  Of a target 30% of project funds for these areas, only 3.8% of funds were used for the not-for-profit private sector and only 9% for women. The OTO now has the capacity to cover all major components of the training cycle, and its services have been widely accepted by other agencies involved in overseas training.  These services include:  (1) departmental training for the planning and selection processes; (2) academic aptitude testing in the Indonesian language; (3) an English-language training program; and (4) pre-departure cross-cultural orientation. While these services have helped institutionalize the OTO, its status as a permanent GOI entity needs to be formalized. Currently, OTO's personnel are borrowed from other GOI agencies, its mandate derives from the Ministry for Administrative Reform, and its operating funds come from A.I.D. and the World Bank.  It is recommended that the GOI formalize the OTO by establishing a permanent OTO office in Jakarta with its own budget and staff. This measure could increase donor support for the OTO, which currently is at a lower level than originally anticipated.  It is also recommended that the OTO conduct workshops and research to strengthen its training plans, review selection procedures, and improve its participant monitoring and follow-up activities. The OTO should also improve communication with other GOI agencies, as well as private sector organizations and donors, and maintain a centralized database of all sponsored trainees. It is advised that A.I.D. continue short-term funding of  the OTO, as no other sources of financial support currently exist.  A U.S. institutional contractor should also be engaged to provide continuing training support services in the United States over the next several years.","Companion evaluation summary: PD-ABE-195","Special Evaluation","Documents","ANE-0328-C-00-8018-00","","3/1/1988 12:00:00 AM","","Participant program administration|Participants|Participant preparation|Institution building","Indonesia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAY332.pdf","5,163 KB","000981 - Pragma Corp.","","008558 - USAID.

"Evaluates P.L. 480 Title II program to provide 24,000 MT of rice worth the equivalent of $8.3 million in local currency in five tranches to the Government of The Gambia (GOTG).  Interim evaluation covers the period 1986-4/88. Four principal conclusions were reached:  (1) GOTG compliance with the condition precedent to the fifth tranche, to announce a plan for the divestment and privatization of remaining Gambian Produce Marketing Board (GPMB) operations and assets, may not be possible during the 3-year life of the program; (2) commodity and financial management measures need improvement (rice stocks in five GPMB warehouses were improperly stored, and commodity and financial accounts were not reconciled to given standards of tonnages shipped or known local currency amounts); (3) the Mission and REDSO/WCA should seek a determination from A.I.D./W as to whether the GOTG's liberal rice import/export policy is or is not in contravention with the intent of current P.L. 480 legislation; and (4) two local currency accounts established under the program have been extensively mismanaged; the accounts should be audited by an appropriate GOTG authority. Recommendations include (inter alia) that (1) future evaluations should refer to the Transfer Authorization (TA), rather than the PAAD, as the program's definitive operational reference; (2) improved storage practices should be required, although the GOTG cannot be reasonably expected to comply with U.S. warehousing standards; (3) the Mission should send a letter to the Ministry of Finance and Trade requesting reconcialation of commodity accounts, which must be in balance before the Mission can undertake a new TA; and (4) the Mission should prepare an amendment for submission to A.I.D./W which specifies that the TA is a multi-year program and clarifies GOTG's ability to implement the conditions precedent, defines working stock, anticipates the termination of the present TA preparatory to designing a new TA, and clarifies the management of the special local currency account.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","4/1/1988 12:00:00 AM","","Rice|Food for Peace Title II","Gambia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDBBN040.pdf","1,069 KB","008545 - USAID.

"Evaluates A.I.D./World Bank project to rehabilitate irrigation and drainage systems in Pakistan and establish funding procedures and operations and maintenance (O&M) capabilities.  Evaluation covers FY83-87. Progress was made in rehabilitating the systems, although original project plans were modified.  Instead of the systems approach stressed in the Project Paper, a ""band-aid"" approach was adopted, in which only the most vulnerable parts of the system were patched up.  This approach was justified by emergency conditions, and no known major breaches have occurred since completion. Institutional improvements have been less significant.  Efforts were made to obtain adequate funding, prepare O&M manuals, establish and/or improve workshops, introduce rehabilitation and maintenance equipment, and respond to various management problems. But the impact of these efforts has been to set the stage for future initiatives rather than to establish mechanisms capable of sustaining physical and institutional improvements. To some degree, the project's limited institutional impact is the direct result of management deficiencies.  Inappropriate resources were mobilized, while others were squandered, misdirected, or not coordinated.  Contributions were made in specific areas of interest or expertise, but no single guiding force was present for attaining overall objectives.  Inherent difficulties in institutional development were exacerbated by poor communication, flights of fancy, and plain poor judgment. Consultants confused quantity with quality, the Provincial Irrigation Departments (PID's) were selective in responding to project needs and initiatives, and A.I.D., for its part, entered the project with only limited understanding of PID's as institutions. Although the project should have achieved more concrete results by the end of Phase I, its original goals were unrealistic and did not necessarily represent the interests of both A.I.D. and the PID's.  The first challenge in Phase II should be to create a productive dialogue to achieve a shared agenda.  Also, A.I.D. should be prepared to make a commitment of at least 15 years to complete the process of physical rehabilitation and institutional development. To ensure continuity, Phase II design should begin immediately and conclude quickly.  The design should be based on a phased strategy, which establishes overall norms and permits specific details such as TA requirements and equipment purchases, to be articulated during implementation.  Short- and long-term sustainability objectives should be precisely defined; this will require that physical and institutional targets emphasize O&M as well as rehabilitation.  The design should focus on what is simple and genuinely possible and stress active PID involvement.","ISPAN activity no. 604A|Companion project evaluation summary: PD-AAZ-532|Project title: Irrigation support project for Asia and the Near|East (ISPAN)","Special Evaluation","Documents","ANE-0289-C-00-7044-00","","2/1/1988 12:00:00 AM","","Irrigation|Water supply structure maintenance|Drainage|Irrigation equipment|Institution building","Pakistan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAY392.pdf","6,157 KB","","","008588 - USAID.

"Presents final Mission report on a 1979-86 project to institutionalize a farming systems research (FSR) component within the Research Division (RD) of the Lesotho Ministry of Agriculture (MOA). The project achieved most of its goals, though some, like establishing an FSR section in the RD, were replaced by other approaches to overall objectives.  Achievements were as follows. (1) The project improved the understanding of deficiencies in traditional production practices and of how cultural and economic factors influence the acceptance of new technologies.  The goal of adoption of a new technology by 5% of prototype area farmers was surpassed, with farmers showing a willingness to put their own money into new technology.  (2) Research results were disseminated through a publication series (bulletins, reports, and circulars).  Handboooks are revised and disseminated as needed.  (3) There is now continual interaction with international centers such as CIMMYT and ICRISAT and cooperation in a sorghum and maize testing program with these centers. (4) The project generated an understanding of the limitations and characteristics of each of the major ecological zones in the country from work in three prototype areas.  (5) Information was transferred to farmers through radio broadcasts, counterpart training, and demonstration field days.  An in-depth analysis of the results indicates a marked impact on the knowledge, attitudes, skills, and aspirations of farmers involved with a sustained extension program.  (6) The project surpassed its target of 16 long-term degree trainees and also conducted continuous short-term training.  (7) The Agricultural Research Library was developed into a well-organized repository serving the needs of many agencies in Lesotho. On the other hand, progress was slower than desirable in increasing support and recognition for the RD from the MOA administrators and other Divisions, and in establishing a solid research capability in the RD. There is a shortage of research leaders who can design and implement successful programs in the various disciplines.  Capable support personnel are not available, and the attitude and dedication which are ubiquitous in the best research units has not yet fully developed. However, these essential qualities should develop with the provision of the proper administrative guidance and the necessary technical resources. Three lessons were learned.  (1) Institution building is a long-term process requiring substantially more than the usual 5-year project.  (2) Researchers should receive not only technical support, but also training in research policy, planning, and management.  (3) To ensure the exposure of MOA participants to a diverse range of disciplines and approaches, long-term training should not be centered at one institution.","Title supplied by cataloger","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","7/1/1988 12:00:00 AM","","Institution building|Government departments|Farming systems research|Agricultural extension|Research centers|Agricultural technology|Technology transfer|Technology adoption|Personnel development|Information dissemination","Lesotho","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDBBM996.pdf","1,790 KB","","","008569 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (8/80-5/86) to develop the institutional capacity of the Lesotho Cooperative Credit Union League (LCCUL) and its member CU's. The project was a success, with at least 2/3 of its quantitative and qualitative targets being met.  Thanks in part to the training of 1,514 board and committee members throughout the country, the overall administration and management of LCCUL and select CU's have been substantially improved.  In addition, 32 operational guidelines were developed, and credit procedures and less restrictive loan policies and appraisals are now in place. Further, LCCUL has increased its staff, achieved the financial self-sufficiency target of 36%, and developed a comprehensive 5-year plan (which includes a break-even strategy) in concert with the CU Development Component of project 6320221.  The project also:  completed 123 CU audits; developed a weekly radio program promoting savings and CU's; produced and distributed 60,000 pamphlets and brochures on CU membership; improved the supervision of field officers and redirected the latter's efforts from promotion to the provision of TA; and trained over 5,000 farmers in improved agricultural production practices.  On the negative side, the target to decrease overall CU loan delinquency to 24% was not met, and only 11 of a targeted 16 new CU's were established. Improvements were more rapid during the 1984-86 period, in which the project gave priority to select CU's (especially those with paid employees) instead of continuing inadequate assistance to all CU's. Also during this period, the project fully implemented recommendations made in project evaluations regarding linkages with LADB (unidentified acronym) and Government of Lesotho entities, bookkeeping and credit assessment training, and field staff supervision.  Work was progressing in fulfilling other recommendations, e.g., to install loan control systems and intensify loan collection. Several lessons were learned.  (1) The CU's are jealous of their autonomous status.  This sense of ownership reflects a grassroots orientation which is the key to the success of these CU's.  (2) Institutional development is a slow process and requires a long-term donor commitment.  (3) Direct TA by LCCUL's field officers is essential for the continued development of the CU's. (4) The project's provision of substantial financial and technical support to LCCUL enabled the League to retrain its staff and undergo professional and institutional development.","Title supplied by cataloger","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","7/1/1988 12:00:00 AM","","Credit unions|Institution building|Management development|Management training","Lesotho","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDBBN002.pdf","175 KB","","","008569 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of a project in Old Naledi ward in Gaborone, Botswana, to catalyze new and expanded small-scale economic activities through a business skills training extension program for the urban poor. Evaluation covers the period 2/84-9/86. The project benefited only a very small portion of the population in the target area, and the cost of assisting individual clients was somewhat high.  A major problem was that a baseline study of the Old Naledi ward was not done until after the project design had been completed.  Consequently, the original design did not clearly identify and analyse the project target group, leading to inaccurate perceptions of beneficiary needs.  The target area was too small geographically for a sufficient client pool, and low literacy rates in the area made most clients incapable of learning business skills.  The grantee, Partnership for Productivity/Botswana (PFP/B), responded by expanding the target area and introducing a credit scheme for small businesses, which had not been part of the original project design.  This change was appropriate and considered by beneficiaries to be the most valuable component of the project. PFP/B has failed to make any real progress in securing further funding for the project.  Thus, the long-term viability of project benefits, and of PFP/B itself, is uncertain. Lessons learned are:  (1) Project design should be preceded by adequate baseline studies.  In the case of OPG's, beneficiaries' needs should be subject to continual review during the course of project implementation.  (2) Projects to create sustainable institutions should be funded over periods of at least five years.  (3) Sustainability can be achieved, in part, by charging user fees, as opposed to receiving all operating funds from government and donor funds.  (4) For OPG's, project designers should conduct early stages of project management and implementation.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","8/1/1988 12:00:00 AM","","Small scale enterprises|Educational extension programs|Business support services|Development project design|Baseline studies|Credit","Botswana","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDBBN018.pdf","1,210 KB","","","008516 - USAID.

"Over the past 20 years, A.I.D. has funded a broad range of agricultural policy analysis and planning projects worldwide. This paper synthesizes the findings of two recent reviews of such projects - a final report on agricultural planning projects in Latin American and the Caribbean, and an interim report on similar efforts in Africa, Asia, and the Near East.  The two studies used the same methodology and thus permit a comparative analysis of the effectiveness and impacts of projects in different areas. The study's major conclusion is that, while the projects sponsored by A.I.D. during the 1970's and early 1980's successfully achieved their primary purpose of improving the analytical capacity of staff in host government institutions, they were less successful in influencing policy and programmatic change.  Policy issues were often given insufficient emphasis in project design and were consequently downplayed during project implementation. In order to contribute more directly to policy reform and programmatic change, A.I.D.'s approach to and design of policy analysis and planning projects need to be modified.  (1) Better diagnosis is needed of the key problems and policy constraints facing the agricultural sectors in developing countries.  (2) Far greater attention should be given to the needs of host country decisionmakers, without whose support and active participation there is little reason to initiate a project.  (3) The strategy for targeting agricultural policy analysis and planning assistance to host governments needs to be reexamined. Assistance should be targeted to the government units that decisionmakers rely on for policy analysis, whether these units are located inside or outside the Ministry of Agriculture. More specific recommendations for designing future projects are presented in the last section of this report.  It is encouraging to note that some of these recommendations, which are based on the experience of A.I.D. projects implemented in the 1970's and early 1980's, have been incorporated into projects designed in the mid-1980s and are currently being implemented in countries such as Ecuador, Niger, and the Philippines.  Includes 15 lessons learned and a list of the projects examined.

"Evaluates A.I.D.'s economic assistance program to the Government of Pakistan (GOP) for the period FY82-FY87. The A.I.D. program was designed in part to offset the balance of payment impacts of GOP purchases of U.S. military goods.  Thus, the program included a $448 million agricultural Commodity Import Program (CIP), a $100 million energy CIP, and a $309 million Title I program. The Title I program led to policy changes intended to liberalize markets and increase local production of edible oils (despite contrary U.S. commercial interests), while local currency generated by all 3 programs helped reduce chronic GOP budget deficits.  Nonetheless, the GOP's public finance position has seriously deteriorated. Activities in agriculture (with obligations totaling $186 million) have achieved clear successes in improving irrigation water use/system maintenance and partial success in policy dialogue (market liberalization and increasing the private sector's role). A food security project shows promise.  Other initiatives, however, such as those in agricultural research and forestry, require stronger GOP commitment to institutional reforms.  Also, the need for fast-disbursing balance of payments support may preclude using the new Agriculture Sector Support Program to leverage policy reform. USAID/P's energy efforts (obligations of $356 million) may turn into a major success story.  The Mission has identified activities that complement those of other donors and is prepared to take the high risks and perform the humble tasks of exploring the feasibility of various potential private sector investments. The Mission is also gradually achieving institutional reform in this arena. Following GOP priorities, there has been less activity in the social sector than seems warranted, with only $196 million obligated for health, family planning (FP), training, and women in development. Perhaps the most innovative effort has been a social marketing project, which despite policy constraints is successfully distributing low-priced contraceptives through the private sector.  Training, especially the Development Support Training Project, has also been an important success story. Other social sector initiatives have suffered from insufficient GOP policy and financial support. Area development/narcotics control projects have faced severe implementation problems, with only $20 million disbursed of $98 million obligated.  The Northwest Frontier Areas Development Project has apparently succeeded in reducing poppy cultivation; however, projects in the inhospitable environments of Baluchistan and the Tribal Areas seem to have exposed USAID/P to a high risk of failure.  GOP support has been less than might be expected.

"PACR of a project (9/84-4/88) to promote private enterprise development in Grenada by establishing a National Development Foundation (NDF) to deliver business and credit services; strengthening the Chamber of Commerce and Industry; and providing TA through the International Executive Service Corps (IESC). The final project report from the grantee for the NDF component does not allow for an accurate evaluation of NDF achievements. Data are provided only through September 1987, by which time 213 loans totalling $430,000 had been provided, and about 470 jobs created.  Extrapolating from these figures, it appears that overall accomplishments will be significantly below the targeted 350 loans and 1,000 jobs.  Two problems hindered realization of project targets:  high delinquency rates and NDF leadership problems.  NDF involvement improved markedly in the last year of the project, but delinquencies were running at 14% - double the regional average.  The NDF is now receiving A.I.D. support through the regional Small Enterprise Assistance Project (SEAP), which is giving particular attention to finding other financing sources for NDF's, helping them to contain costs, and fostering cooperation with other programs. Some progress has been made in strengthening the Chamber of Commerce and Industry.  A Private Sector Economic Affairs Committee was established, which meets periodically with the government for dialogue on economic policy matters.  Membership of the Chamber has also grown from 122 to 184, but a large body of dissatisfied manufacturers formed a splinter group, the Grenada Manufacturers Association, in 1987.  Efforts to encourage cooperation between the two institutions have been unsuccessful. The Chamber may receive some support through SEAP; clearly it needs to increase contributions from its members if it is to continue operating at the same level that it has under the project. TA provided by the International Executive Service Corps (IESC) has been highly successful and cost-effective.  The IESC assisted 11 entities - nine private enterprises, a public enterprise (Grenada Rock & Asphalt Corporation), and the NDF.  IESC TA was critical in the start up of two of the private enterprises, and helped others to expand and improve productivity.  It is expected that under SEAP, IESC assistance will be linked to a broader program.","Attachments: XD-AAY-488-A, XD-AAY-488-B, XD-AAY-488-C","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","9/1/1988 12:00:00 AM","","Private enterprises|Business enterprises|Credit","Grenada","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAY488.pdf","8,121 KB","008549 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (1981-3/88) to increase oilseed and maize production in 28 rural Burmese townships by providing TA, equipment, and training to improve production techniques and by establishing 4 seed farms. Nearly all aspects of the project were highly successful. Production increases exceeded goals for all target crops - groundnuts, sesame, sunflower, and maize - and yields exceeded national averages.  A total of 95,600 farm families (approx. 493,000 persons) participated in the project and gross farm income was increased by $225 million.  The extensive amount of fertilizer provided by the project and the Government of Burma (GOB) was instrumental in attaining these goals. Considerable effort was spent in adaptive research on fertilizer needs, optimum plant populations, row spacing, and planting dates for project crops.  Research on maize and sunflower proved the most useful. This research is necessary in order to generate information on project crops and must be continued. Training goals were nearly met, despite delays in nominating candidates:  24 participants (22 M.Sc., 2 Ph.D.) of a targeted 36 (25 M.Sc., 11 Ph.D.) received U.S. training and were placed in appropriate positions upon their return.  A total of 58 (of a targeted 70) persons participated in short-term overseas training programs of 2-6 months.  In addition, considerable on-the-job training was provided, along with 33 semi-formal, short courses attended by 831 people. Physical construction is basically completed on the four farms developed by the project for foundation and certified seed production. By the PACD, $6.1 million had been expended on farm equipment and commodities.  Management and machinery operation have improved with each planting season, and seasonal activities are usually conducted on time. On the negative side, seed production fell far below original targets due to delays in establishing the farms, shortages of diesel fuel, and changes in crop mix. The project also helped establish a new rhizobium inoculant facility at the Agricultural Research Institute at Yezin. This facility has reached its production maximum, however, and a new facility is needed. Project benefits are likely to be sustained, since participants recognize the advantages of the new technological methods. Moreover, the GOB appears committed to maintaining production increases by increasing fertilizer allocations and by expanding the program to additional townships.  Production at the four seed farms will also continue after donor funding has terminated.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","11/1/1988 12:00:00 AM","","Crop production|Agricultural research|Maize|Oil crops|Agricultural technology|Agricultural education|Agricultural extension|Seed production|Beneficiary count","Burma","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAY506.pdf","630 KB","008521 - USAID.

"Evaluates Food for Progress program to support rice marketing liberalization in Madagascar by providing a buffer stock to help maintain stable, open-market consumer prices.  External evaluation covers the period 8/86-8/88. Rice was provided only during the first year of the three-year program because good harvests and large carry-over stocks obviated the need for further shipments.  As of 7/88, all stocks supplied have been utilized and no further rice shipments have been requested.  Physical management of the rice stocks improved considerably after the 1987 evaluation, at which time a strong potential existed for spoilage and/or wastage.  Due to improved USAID/M monitoring and efficient measures by local officials, only 4.2% of the total consignment was lost. Success of the buffer-stock price management approach has been mixed. During the 1986-87 lean period, buffer-stock supplies played a decisive role in stabilizing prices.  After 1987, however, the buffer stock was sold below market and target prices, indicating that the Government of Madagascar (GOM) inappropriately used the supplies to keep prices low in major urban centers.  Also, due to inadequate communication of the buffer-stock target price, traders lacked guidance in making buying and selling decisions; private-sector participation in rice trade has contracted since 1987. Nonetheless, the program has been a significant component of the GOM's overall economic reforms.  Progress toward decontrol of rice movement and free market access in the past three to four years has been significant.  Regional monopolies on rice distribution have been removed, trade restrictions have been substantially reduced, and the official distribution system was eliminated.  As a result, rice mills have flourished, the number of rice assemblers has increased significantly, and competition among traders improved to unprecedented levels.  Further, liberalization has resulted in immense benefits to producers without putting an undue price burden on consumers. Several recommendations are made for the benefit of other food aid programs in Madagascar.  (1) Appropriate timing of shipments would help overcome local transport, storage, and other logistical constraints. (2) Policy dialogue would be facilitated if the pricing of food commodities, and the timing of their release, were based on more quantifiable criteria.  (3) The GOM should be required to submit regular reports providing detailed and consistent information on commodity utilization and an inventory of remaining stocks.","Delivery order no. 33","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-0000-I-33-6134-00","","8/1/1988 12:00:00 AM","","Price stabilization|Food marketing|Trade liberalization|Rice|Food for Progress|Agricultural policy|Policy reform|Food prices","Madagascar","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAY521.pdf","9,249 KB","000673 - International Science and Technology Institute, Inc.

"Evaluates project to strengthen the capability of Nepal's national agricultural research system to develop appropriate technologies, especially for resource-poor hill farms, and demonstrate them on-farm. External mid-term evaluation covers the period through 1/88. The project has created four new bodies within the existing research system:  the Research Coordination Committee, the National Agricultural Research Services Center, the Farming Systems Division, and the Socio-Economics Division.  Although development of these institutions has exceeded expectations, their linkages with and within the Departments of Agriculture and Livestock and Animal Health have been weak.  The project needs to shift its emphasis from production-oriented activities to re-establishing and redefining these ties and upgrading research management. The project is continuing to strengthen the systems approach to research via use of the farming systems methodology and the input of socioeconomists into the research process.  However, production activities in the hill areas have not had any appreciable impact, nor is it likely that any will be achieved in the remaining project period; these activities have focused on testing various technologies in several selected areas while ignoring information already obtained from similar tests. Moreover, no work has been done to develop appropriate extension methodologies for the hill areas.  On the other hand, seed production activities have been effective in promoting multiplication and distribution of improved seed varieties in remote areas.  The involvement of private producer/sellers appear to be key successful attributes. Monitoring, reporting, and coordination have been major project weaknesses.  Baseline surveys have been implemented in selected areas for some programs but will not be capable of providing an overall evaluation of project impact.  Reporting responsibilities have been divided, making it difficult for involved agencies to plan and coordinate activities.  Coordination has been limited by insufficient staff and the lack of defined roles and responsibilities.","Companion project evaluation summary: PD-AAZ-533","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-1406-I-00-4054-00|367-0149-00-8016-00","","1/1/1988 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural research|On farm research|Agricultural technology|Farming systems research","Nepal","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAY548.pdf","2,265 KB","004444 - No-Frills Development Consultants|003211 - Wu P'i, Inc.","","008583 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (3/78-3/88) to increase potable water and electric energy supplies and develop a sewage removal system on Sal, an island in the Cape Verde archipelago. Due to higher than anticipated costs, the project was substantially reduced in scope by eliminating the sewage removal system and other elements.  All major components of the redesigned project were accomplished, but with varying degrees of success.  The desalination/power plant and water/power distribution systems were installed and operational by 4/83.  The availability of potable water was increased for all Sal residents from 5-6 to 22-23 liters per person per day.  Water and power connections have been provided to, respectively, 573 and 905 households, 43 and 57 government facilities, and 39 and 48 industry and commerce units.  Commercial, industrial, and tourist activity has been stimulated by these accomplishments -- secondary benefits have included expansion of a lobster plant and of the Sal airport and construction of a hotel and a seaport. The desalination plant was designed to allow easy expansion, so that the supply of water and power can be increased with relatively small additional capital investment. Training provided to operational and administrative staff of the desalination/power plant was excellent.  The professional and senior administrative staff participated in U.S. training courses of 3-5 weeks, and on-the-job training was provided for 7 months after plant construction. On the negative side, the desalination plant was plagued with problems from the start, and has never operated properly in its 5 years of operation.  Problems have occurred in each of the 3 major areas - intake, pre-treatment, and reverse osmosis - resulting in periods of poor water quality and quantity and frequent plant shutdowns.  The problems are attributed to: design deficiencies; poor plant maintenance due to inadequate funding by the Government of Cape Verde (GOCV); and installation of inadequate materials, parts, and fittings. It was recommended that A.I.D. assist the GOCV in filing a legal claim against the equipment and parts supplier, should they refuse to replace defective parts.  Procurement specifications should be clear and well-defined, and performance warranties of up to 2 years should be considered for plants involving sensitive equipment and relatively high technology.  Two years of periodic inspection and advice by an A.I.D. consultant would also help intercept problems, as would an onsite technical project manager. Finally, A.I.D. should beware of such cost-efficiency efforts as eliminating key components or reducing below minimum standards.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","3/1/1988 12:00:00 AM","","Desalinization|Potable water|Electric power plants|Electric power distribution","Cape Verde","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAY557.pdf","590 KB","008525 - USAID.

"A.I.D.'s Communication for Young People Project in Latin America, which used two popular songs to promote sexual responsibility among teenagers and urge them to postpone sex until they were more mature, was a resounding success by any standard. The songs, sung by young vocalists Tatiana and Johnny, reached the top of the popularity charts in every country and - along with discussion about them - received about 1 million hours of air time, as well as substantial favorable publicity in the press. Both qualitative and quantitative research demonstrated that the songs' messages were appropriate for and understood by teenagers. The youngest teenagers were particularly receptive to the idea of postponing sex - an achievement that cannot be overstated, since it is this segment that is the least informed about sexuality and at the greatest risk of unwanted pregnancies.  It was also found that younger teenagers and those who could readily recall the songs considered sexual relations less important to their self-concept than did older teenagers and those who could recall the songs either not at all or only after prompting. Older teenagers, especially males, were not as receptive to the idea of postponing sex, but they agreed that people should be mature before engaging in sexual activity. The project was less successful in channeling young people to family planning (FP) counseling or services.  Teenagers felt that teachers and schools should be the main source of information on sex, though most Latin American schools provide only general information in these areas. Many teenagers had discussed the songs with their mothers or girl friends, however. What made the project successful was its commercial viability. Media executives responded very well to the songs because they could make money while promoting a valuable social cause.  The teenage audience emphatically endorsed the project's entertainment approach through their purchase of the record and their many phone calls and letters to radio stations, the record company, and FP centers.  Because the social message was conveyed not via a lecture, but in an attractive, modern format by appealing, credible role models and had immediate relevance to the audience's lives, it reached and was remembered by millions of young people throughout Latin America.  Appendices include lyrics of the two songs.

"With only 11% of 212 A.I.D. projects recently evaluated showing good chances to be self-sustaining after the termination of U.S. assistance, the seriousness of the sustainability issue is now being recognized at the highest levels of the Agency. This report consolidates the experience of A.I.D. and 15 other donor agencies to identify the most important factors affecting sustainability.  The paper discusses and briefly illustrates the factors affecting sustainability - government policies; management, organization, and local participation; finance; technology; socioculture; environment and ecology; and external political and economic circumstances.  Techniques and conditions that favor sustainability are identified, such as realistic goals, adequate project duration, sufficient maintenance and support systems, continuity, and flexibility.  In conclusion, the paper examines current donor efforts to ensure consideration of sustainability in project design and implementation.  These efforts include intense host country collaboration and the development of monitoring and early warning systems which can identify impediments to sustainability.  An appendix illustrates interrelations among sustainability factors.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","11/1/1988 12:00:00 AM","","Development projects|Development programs|Project sustainability","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAX209.pdf","2,207 KB","003433 - USAID.

"Evaluates food assistance provided under Section 416 of the Agricultural Assistance Act.  External evaluation covers the period 1982-9/87. Charged with the dual objectives of reducing surplus U.S. food stocks and feeding needy persons overseas, the Section 416 program has donated almost 800,000 MT of surplus commodities through some 70 cooperating sponsors in 33 different countries since its initiation in 1982. Despite inherent problems, the program has achieved solid results.  It has:  measurably improved the nutritional status of certain vulnerable populations; helped to mobilize existing resources, as well as to generate additional resources over and above the value of the donated commodities; strengthened participating local institutions; and increased the productive capacity of beneficiaries both directly (through income-generating activities, family gardens, etc.), and indirectly (through health-related activities, school feeding, etc.). Problems have stemmed principally from the difficulties of implementing a constantly evolving legislative mandate.  Major legislative changes in 1984 and 1985 have decreased the program's flexibility and increased the time required for project approval. Interagency dissent has also impeded implementation:  A.I.D. and the U.S.D.A. have disagreed persistently on matters concerning resource allocation, program emphases, and control.  Beginning in 1986, these problems have been exacerbated by a lack of milk availability and general instability of commodity supply.  In general, management deficiencies have been more serious in Washington than in the field. The major problem at the field level has been the danger of program assistance increasing recipients' dependence on food aid.  Steps are being taken to address both types of problems. It is recommended that the program target countries that have a social services tradition or infrastructure, clear priorities for target groups, resource mobilization capability, and committed embassy or USAID staff.  Participating sponsors should have field experience, links with other sponsors, and sufficient resources. Project proposals should include beneficiary selection criteria, rational implementation alternatives, and a phase-out or termination plan; the issue of dependence should be explicitly addressed. Other suggestions are to:  prohibit sponsors from altering their normal activities to accommodate 416 commodities (sponsors should be capable of absorbing commodities on a windfall basis); ensure that project-level objectives are commensurate with the program's limitations; introduce some form of yearly fiscal planning; improve proposal review and approval procedures; adopt alternatives to the present commodity allocation system; and improve communication with the field.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","3/1/1988 12:00:00 AM","","Food for Peace|Development program implementation|Laws and legislation|Nutritional status|Poor|Commodity management|Private voluntary organizations|Development program design|Beneficiary targeting|Food supply","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAY564.pdf","2,543 KB","006214 - Planning Assistance","","006215 - USAID.

"The Niamey Department Development Project (NDD) is a 10-year integrated rural development project in Niger that is coming to an end in December 1988.  The project began with a 3-year first phase to determine which interventions were likely to be most effective in the rural areas of Niamey Department.  This was to have been followed by a 5-year second phase and, if warranted, a third phase.  Toward the end of the second phase, it was decided to extend the project by 2 years rather than proceed with the third phase.  The total cost of the project is about $15 million in A.I.D. contributions and about $2 million in Government of Niger (GON) contributions (not including salary support for GON cadres). The purpose of this report is to review the experience of the project to draw lessons learned that could be applied to similar projects in Niger and to rural development projects in general. The report is divided into three parts:  description of project objectives and activities; assessment of the achievement of project objectives; and discussion of the major lessons learned. The major lessons learned are as follows. (1) An effective small farmer extension program must be based on a sound understanding of local growing conditions and existing farming systems.  (2) There is no point in creating self-managed local organizations capable of initiating and implementing development activities unless there are viable development activities to undertake. Where there are very few such activities, a self-sustaining rural development process as exemplified by the existence of self-managed local organizations is not possible and therefore should not be attempted.  (3) Integrated rural development projects must be properly phased and have a flexible design. Strong goal oriented management and technical assistance is particularly important for this type of project.  (4) Implementing integrated rural development projects through existing government services seriously delays implementation and does not ensure institutional sustainability.  (5) The key elements in assuring the institutional and financial sustainability of rural development projects are (a) clear successes and (b) open communications with government institutions long before the end of the project.  Even then, under conditions that prevail in Niger sustainability is unlikely.

"Evaluates P.L. 480 Title II program in Guatemala implemented by CARE and Catholic Relief Service (CRS).  External evaluation, the first performed since 1971, covers the period through 3/88. The program provided $3,885,000 worth of food during FY87 and is expected to distribute a like amount during FY88.  The CARE program involves:  (1) monthly Maternal/Child Health (MCH) food distribution to 270,000 beneficiaries at 630 sites, (2) Food for Work (FFW) projects in Guatemala City and rural areas, and (3) Other Child Feeding (OCF) for 16,500 beneficiaries in 107 orphanages.  CRS, through Caritas, distributes food in:  (1) an MCH program for 68,000 beneficiaries at 327 sites, (2) an FFW program for 2,400 workers, and (3) an OCF component serving 3,600 recipients. Neither CARE nor CRS have succeeded in tying MCH food distribution to development activities, although both have incorporated health and nutritional activities with feeding to some degree.  Both agencies recognize that their MCH projects may have encouraged dependence on food aid.  It is recommended that MCH activities target infants under 2 years (the age when malnutrition is most serious) and that accompanying services to reduce infant mortality and malnutrition (e.g., oral rehydration, immunization, and nutrition education) be strengthened. Under the urban FFW project, CARE and the Municipality of Guatemala City work with community groups to build drainage, retaining walls, and other construction, activities which have benefited workers and have helped institutionalize responsible and democratic municipal response. On the negative side, the project needs to introduce health and maintenance education activities and improve food distribution; currently, workers must pick up food at a distant warehouse.  An agroforestry FFW project has also been impressive, having increased crop yields by 25% or more, while encouraging local investment in terracing, tree planting, etc.  A more modest CRS/Caritas rural FFW project encouraging the use of compost piles has also increased crop yields, and has led to the establishment of sustainable community nurseries and reforested areas.  CRS and Caritas need to help participating community groups use the temporary windfall income provided by food distribution for community development. Estimated 1988 food donations to Guatemala are massive - 380,000 tons (of which Title II will contribute 24,560 tons). Nonetheless, macroeconomic disincentive effects are negligible and continued A.I.D. support is justified by current nutritional status and political/economic conditions.  Both OCF and MCH help to save lives, and neither should be reduced without a year's notice.  However, Title II aid should not be increased until the two PVO's integrate food distribution more effectively with development and have devised phase-out plans for selected communities.  The Mission should support such plans by making local currency available for FFW and other activities likely to promote increased food production and/or income. Finally, USAID/G should establish a food office to help monitor and coordinate U.S. and international food aid and should address duplication of activities caused by a Section 416 Project, implemented by World SHARE, Inc.  SHARE should be invited to serve as an umbrella organization for managing small distributions, provided that current duplicative distributions are terminated.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-0262-I-00-7150-00","","1/1/1988 12:00:00 AM","","Food for Peace Title II|Maternal child feeding programs|Child feeding programs|Nutrition education","Guatemala","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAY678.pdf","1,812 KB","002615 - John Snow Public Health Group, Inc.","","006215 - USAID.

"In the early 1980's, A.I.D., the World Bank, and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) worked with the Government of Costa Rica to design economic reforms needed to alleviate the country's economic crisis. This report assesses the impact of these reforms and of attendant international assistance, especially A.I.D.'s cash transfer programs. The objectives of cash transfers are explained both in general and in the Costa Rican context.  The report first discusses the IMF's lending programs, which emphasize short-term stability, and the World Bank programs, which have the longer-term objective of promoting export-led growth.  A.I.D.'s contribution, consisting of cash transfer and local currency programs, are then analyzed in depth. Cash transfers represent 83% of the USAID/Costa Rica program - totaling $800 million - since 1982. The reforms and assistance programs have generally had a beneficial impact on the Costa Rican economy.  The A.I.D. program was larger than the IMF and World Bank programs combined, but the conditionality provisions and impacts of the three programs are closely related.  The report details positive results in the following areas:  (1) production and private sector performance, (2) international trade, (3) fiscal performance, (4) financial performance, (5) employment and equity, and (6) agriculture.  The only negative aspect of the program noted in the report is the potential for creating economic dependency.  The main recommendations address this issue, stating, inter alia, that each program should have a short-term performance indicator and termination date. The evaluation resulted in several conclusions of general application.  (1) Cash transfer programs should be designed to be phased out.  Missions should be able to show that the program creates no dependency and can fully meet its objectives within 5 years, and that individual local currency projects will have full impact and can be discontinued within 3 years.  (2) Cash transfer programs should specify Mission administration of both dollar and local currency funds and the permissible level of Mission discretion in using these funds.  (3) The decision to implement local currency programs should be made on a case-by-case basis. Although such a component is often very useful, its costs can outweigh its benefits.","Summary highlights: PN-ABH-145","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","11/1/1988 12:00:00 AM","","Cash transfers|Economic reform|Local currency|Economic development|Nonproject assistance|Structural adjustment|Conditionality","Costa Rica","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAX210.pdf","3,875 KB","003433 - USAID.

"Adopting a broadly sectoral and historical perspective, this study examines the sustainability of U.S.-supported health, population, and nutrition projects in Honduras since 1942.  The authors differentiate between ""immediate"" outputs (e.g., personnel trained) and ""replicating"" outputs (e.g., schools to train personnel).  It was found that once A.I.D. funding stopped, some immediate outputs were sustained with national funds, but that replicating outputs typically were supported by other donors' funds. An analysis of three cases of high degree of sustainability (auxiliary nurse training, rural water supplies, and latrine and pump projects) and three cases of low degree of sustainability (family planning, malaria eradication, and nutrition projects), revealed the following significant relationships.  (1) National commitment to project goals was essential to the sustainability of project outputs and benefits.  (2) Cooperative negotiations between A.I.D. and the Ministry of Health with regard to project objectives, design, and implementation contributed to sustainability.  Projects viewed as imposed by A.I.D. were not well sustained.  (3) Vertically organized projects often generated institutional resentment that jeopardized sustainability, whereas integrated projects tended to be better sustained, though at lower levels of effectiveness.  Use of a multi-component matrix organization which combines several vertical components with an integrated managerial and planning structure might lead to higher levels of effectiveness.  (4) Projects perceived as effective during the life of the project were more likely to be sustained than those which failed to achieve anticipated outputs.  Effectiveness did not, however, guarantee sustainability. (5) Coordination among donors was important for sustainability. No clear relationship was found between sustainability and the size of A.I.D. funding relative to Honduran contributions to the project, national assumption of recurrent salary costs, cost recovery, or the proportion of the national health budget devoted to hospitals (versus primary health care).  Similarly, the amount, type, and duration of technical assistance, training, and community participation were not significantly related to sustainability.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","12/1/1988 12:00:00 AM","","Project sustainability|Health care|Nutrition improvement|Family planning","Honduras","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAX211.pdf","260 KB","003433 - USAID.

"Interim evaluation of a project to demonstrate and promote bioenergy systems as sources of fuel for development applications.  External evaluation covers the period 1979-2/88. The project lacks concrete evidence of success in establishing subprojects, although it is moving in productive directions and is a logical and important component in A.I.D.'s energy program. Thus far, model cane energy projects have been undertaken in Jamaica and Thailand. The Jamaica project is sponsored by a foreign firm, whose objectives are somewhat incongruous with A.I.D.'s and have led to implementation delays.  The Thailand project is sponsored by an indigenous firm, as is generally preferred, particularly when accompanied by a great deal of constituency building.  The rice residue utilization program has made a promising start, but there are potential difficulties in both currently targeted countries - Indonesia and the Philippines.  Current Indonesian rice milling characteristics would make power from rice waste uneconomical, while USAID/P is uninterested in energy as a program area and reluctant to work directly with rice milling companies.  A wood waste energy program being carried out in Costa Rica has been plagued by equipment difficulties since installation in 1985 and remains under trial.  Nonetheless, the project should continue efforts in this area, perhaps in collaboration with A.I.D.'s Program in Science and Technology Cooperation. Perhaps the greatest project deficiency is its overemphasis on technology and insufficient attention to financing.  The project should seek advice from U.S. firms on how to mobilize third-party financing and should collaborate more closely with such institutions as the International Finance Corporation.  A full-time staff member with strong private sector project development and finance experience should be hired and a more explicit policy for dealing with the private sector should be developed.  It is also recommended that the project renew information dissemination efforts in order to convince planners of the practicality of bioenergy technologies. A project extension with at least the current level of funding is recommended.  The current technological approach, particularly the emphasis on agricultural wastes, is valid; however, the project needs to broaden its perspective to consider developmental as well as technological objectives.  It is also recommended that the project take a more active role in addressing the energy problems - particularly the fuelwood crisis - in Africa.","Attached to PD-WAL-660|PES consists of facesheet only","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-5730-I-00-6112-00","","2/1/1988 12:00:00 AM","","Biomass|Agricultural wastes|Alternative energy resources|Technological development|Private sector|Alternative energy technology|Development finance","Jamaica|Thailand|Indonesia|Philippines|Costa Rica","","","000471 - Energy/Development International","","000184 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (1978-4/88) to increase contraceptive use and expand village family planning (FP) services in Indonesia by providing TA, U.S. training, and commodities. Project targets for increased contraceptive use were met.  By 3/88, 68% of married reproductive-age women were using FP services, compared with 24.6% in 3/78, according to the National Family Planning Coordinating Board (BKKBN).  An independent survey indicated that 47.8% were contraceptive users by the end of 1987.  The fertility rate also declined from 5.6 in 1971 to 3.3 for the 1984-87 period.  The crude birth rate declined from 44 in 1971 to about 28 in 1987. To reach Indonesia's large rural population (75% of the total), the project assisted the BKKBN in shifting its strategy from a clinic-based approach to one of village-based services.  FP activities were expanded first in Java and Bali, and then in 10 and other selected less densely populated areas in the outer islands.  The number of FP facilities increased from 3,670 clinics and 36,000 contraceptive distribution centers in 1978 to 18,878 clinics and 70,459 centers in 1988.  However, the project was far less successful in the sparsely populated outer islands than in Java and Bali, mainly due to the rugged topography, poor transportation and communications, large administrative areas, lack of field and other supervisory staff, and heterogeneous populations.  A new strategy may be needed, possibly one which would emphasize placement and quality of services rather than absolute number of service points. Progress on Java and Bali was less evident in urban than in rural areas, due to urban population diversity, lack of tightly knit community structures, and a limited distribution system.  More attention and resources for work in this area have been built into the follow-on project. The project was successful in strenthening the BKKBN's institutional capacity in 5 areas:  (1) program planning, (2) procurement and production of oral contraceptives, (3) nationwide logistics for contraceptives and other commodities, (4) collection of contraceptive data, and (5) personnel development. A major lesson learned was that the flexibility and responsiveness of the local cost programming mechanism used for the project were key factors supporting innovation, learning, local adaptation, and effective implementation of priority initiatives. Also, since surveys show that a large percentage of Indonesian women want no more children, more attention should be paid to improving access to voluntary sterilization.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","11/1/1988 12:00:00 AM","","Family planning services|Contraceptive distribution|Contraceptive prevalence|Family planning clinics","Indonesia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAY753.pdf","138 KB","008558 - USAID.

"Mid-term evaluation of a project to provide management and technical training to Nepalese development personnel at institutions in the United States, Nepal, and other countries. External evaluation covers the period 8/85-12/88. Thus far, 35% of a targeted 426 participants have returned or are in training.  The goal of providing 25% of training months to women has been met, while the private sector has received 8% of a projected 10% of training months.  Training evaluation at this point is limited primarily to the short-term/technical training component, since graduate study programs are still in progress. Of the returned short-term participants, 75% have made concrete use of training.  Those interviewed displayed confidence and were seeking opportunities to change their work processes.  With project funding, two local organizations - the Business and Professional Women's Club and the Management Association of Nepal - have also provided useful private sector training for limited numbers. The project is well administered and documented, although participant monitoring and follow-up activities have not yet been implemented and serious problems exist in ensuring adequate training courses. Increasing numbers of trainees are placed in Asian institutions about which too little is known.  For example, a person sent to study small business enterprise may find himself studying large corporate structures.  To improve training relevancy, it is recommended that the project:  (1) increase communications with third country institutions, (2) develop more specific statements of training objectives and work expectations of graduates, and (3) integrate graduates of third country institutions into participant orientation. The project is also constrained by unrealistic targets regarding location of training (e.g, 291 participants are to be trained in India and 930 in Nepal).  It is recommended that the geographical targets be eliminated and that quality and relevance of training be emphasized. To reduce workload, it is recommended that a single training plan for the remainder of the project be designed.  The Ministry of Finance (MOF) is reluctant to change from an annual to a multi-year plan, however, due to the uncertainty of future project funding.  The project should also concentrate on training personnel in fewer agencies and only in those most critical to development.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-1109-I-00-7120-00","","12/1/1988 12:00:00 AM","","Participant program administration|Participants|Education for development|Management training|Technical training","Nepal","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAY771.pdf","672 KB","000601 - Institute for International Research, Inc.

"Evaluates project to provide consulting services to the Central American private sector in producing and marketing agricultural exports. External evaluation is based primarily on surveys and follow-up interviews with the Agricultural Federation, growers/shippers, Missions, the Regional Office for Central American Programs (ROCAP), and project staff.  It covers the period 12/85-12/88. The project is well-regarded by federations and growers and is meeting perceived assistance needs.  It is a principal source of practical, high-level, and timely consulting advice available to growers in the region.  The project staff has had a highly visible impact on planned and active agricultural export ventures throughout the region. These successes are largely due to the new Chief of Party, who has reorganized a problem-ridden and leaderless project into an increasingly well-directed and effective one. Most problems related to project strategy emerged during the first 18 months and were inherited by the current Chief of Party. These include: (1) concern on the part of federations that the project's emphasis on dealing with individual growers detracts from federation-strengthening activities and (2) ROCAP's objection to the project's focus on established rather than marginal or small growers.  Through the new leadership's efforts, the federations have become increasingly supportive of project assistance to growers and ROCAP now understands that established growers are more able to take major business risks involved in the development of new export crops.  Nonetheless, there is unresolved concern among Mission staff that successful technologies may not be transferred to smaller growers, and within each country and each crop group there is a tendency for users to think the project should be spending more time and energy with them. Implementation problems are manageable and are already being addressed by both the project and ROCAP.  The major problem has been unpredictability of project response, which reflects the need for work plans, time for new leaders to address past problems, and increased user awareness of the project's service limitations.  Many respondents recommended that a specific list of services and lead time requirements be distributed to federations and growers.","Full report: PD-AAY-774","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-0085-I-00-6097-00","","12/1/1988 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural markets|Export promotion|Federations|Consultants","Central America","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAY773.pdf","101 KB","000356 - Checchi and Co.

"Evaluates project to develop improved wheat and barley varieties, especially by crossing spring and winter wheat.  External evaluation covers the period 1/86-7/88. The project has been exceptionally well-implemented by Oregon State University.  (1) OSU has an excellent working relationship with the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT):  60% of CIMMYT spring wheat advanced lines can be traced to some spring x winter parentage derived from OSU germplasm.  (2) Genetic diversity of wheat has been enhanced by the collection and evaluation of over 10,000 cultivars.  (3) Systematic crossing of winter and spring genepools has significantly increased genetic variability for many traits including more durable disease resistance and higher, more stable grain yield. (4) Genetic lines from several countries have resistance to diseases that may cause serious crop losses in the U.S. or other wheat producing areas.  (5) Barley breeding, initiated in 1986, is in its initial stages but has already achieved some significant results, the most exciting being the development of a doubled haploid technique.  (6) The project developed a microcomputer database application for cereal breeding research; project personnel can retrieve the most current agronomic, disease, quality, genetic, or yield information.  Thus, poor performing breeding materials can be discarded as they are harvested. (7) Fifteen graduate students are enrolled in the program with three receiving stipends from project funds and others receiving thesis research support.  (8) The program is benefiting small farmers by selecting germplasm with greater stress tolerances. (9) Spring habit varieties developed from OSU materials have been released by national programs in at least 19 LDC's.  Worldwide, it is estimated that these varieties cover around 10 million ha, or about 10% of the total developing country wheat area. (10) National programs in Chile and Turkey have released winter habit varieties developed from the winter x spring program. Argentina, Peru, and Bolivia are very near release of varieties. South Africa has released a winter habit variety that has scored the most rapid increase of adoption ever recorded in that country.  (11) Because of the vernalization requirement, the winter wheat program has progressed more slowly than the spring wheat program, but several very promising cultivars have been developed. (12) About 30% of the advanced lines now being developed for use in Oregon soft white winter wheat are derived from winter x spring crosses. A hard red winter wheat is nearing release to Oregon farmers.  (13) Financial support by the Oregon Wheat Growers League amounts to about 27% of the cereal research budget.  They recently provided $500,OOO - together with a matching fund by the Oregon Legislature - to endow a wheat research chair at OSU.  The Wheat Growers League is vocal in support of the international aspects of the program and feel they are benefiting from the sizable collection of barley and wheat enhanced germplasm at OSU. The following lessons were learned. essential to a cereal breeding program; it takes about 10 years to develop a new variety of spring wheat, longer for winter wheat.  (2) Land grant institutions can encourage support for international research.  OSU has done this by arranging for Oregon farmers to visit CIMMYT/Mexico, and informing them of the sources of breeding materials with special characteristics. Also, screening nurseries located on various farms in Oregon are frequently visited by international guests.  (3) A graduate program coupled with a breeding program helps to establish long-term international relationships.

"Evaluates the impact of a program to help Kenya develop a commercial fertilizer marketing system.  External evaluation, covering the period 1983-1988, is based on a survey of farmers, importers, and retailers. The program - which provided Kenya with 134,301 MT of fertilizer worth $39 million and promoted trade liberalization and other policy reforms by the  Government of Kenya (GOK) - contributed to significant increases in fertilizer availability in appropriate packaging and at more competitive prices.  As a result, fertilizer use and knowledge have increased, especially among small farmers.  About 40% have improved access to fertilizer and 43% can now obtain supplies within a kilometer of their farms. About 95.5% of farmers use fertilizers regularly, while about 55% report increased use.  About 85% report increased fertilizer knowledge and 73% are aware of various fertilizer types and uses. About 91% reported that fertilizer use increased their yields. Moreover, a viable commercial fertilizer marketing system is beginning to take form.  While 85% of farmers obtained fertilizer from a single GOK-supported supplier 4 years ago, only 47.1% use this supplier now.  The number of fertilizer retailers in rural trading centers and the involvement of cooperative unions in fertilizer distribution have increased markedly.  Importers are now capable of applying competitive methods of procurement and about 92% are better able to plan their import needs.  As a result, about 35% of retailers and 43% of importers report profit increases. Third, the program has helped the GOK to develop a national fertilizer policy and to improve its procedures for estimating fertilizer requirements and for monitoring stock levels, sales, and the performance of importers.  The program has also assisted in establishing the Kenya National Fertilizer Association and an agency to ensure immediate transport of fertilizer shipments.  In addition, USAID/K has improved coordination of donors, which have increased from 4 countries (21,548 MT) in 1983/84 to 11 countries (140,000 MT) in 1988. Several constraints to a viable commercial marketing system remain, however.  (1) The supply of fertilizer aid-in-kind, which necessitates GOK involvement in fertilizer management, should be replaced with other forms, such as balance of payment support, in order to maximize private sector control of fertilizer markets. (2) Allocations to end-users have taken away the large-scale sector from private distributors and left them with the less profitable smallholder market segment.  (3) Price control remains a major constraint.  The GOK has not been able to announce fertilizer selling prices on time, often resulting in insufficient importation.  (4) Rural retailers lack access to an effective credit system.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","11/1/1988 12:00:00 AM","","Fertilizers|Agricultural markets|Retail marketing|Privatization","Kenya","","","006280 - Agriconsult, Ltd.","","008565 - USAID.

"Evaluation to determine the value of food aid as a development resource in Nepal.  The evaluation builds upon a previous assessment conducted in 1984. A case can be made that Nepal needs more food aid.  Although the country remains relatively self-sufficient in terms of market demand for food, substantial numbers of people suffer from undernutrition, while others experience temporary declines in access to food arising from instability in production, food prices, or household income.  Seasonal underemployment is prevalent where chronic food deficits are the most serious.  Food for Work (FFW) projects could reduce undernutrition and mitigate the lack of transportation infrastructure, reforestation, irrigation, and other development resources.  USAID/N should continue to provide Title II resources to the Dairy Development Corporation and to collaborate with the World Food Program on FFW for road construction.  A Title I program in vegetable oil should also be explored. The Government of Nepal (GON) has made numerous requests to donors for specific food commodities and for expanded FFW assistance for roads and reforestation.  However, GON implementation capabilities are strictly limited and are currently stretched very thin by a plethora of foreign aid donors and projects.  To expand the use of food aid, the GON and donors will need to collaborate more effectively with external PVO's and local nongovernmental organizations, neither of which are currently involved or strongly interested in food assistance. Additional recommendations include the following.  (1) Land distribution inequality is a root cause of chronic food insecurity and should be made a priority policy issue.  (2) An in-depth study of Indian foodgrain pricing in relation to seasonal and regional price levels in Nepal should be carried out.  (3) Assistance to the GON to strengthen collection and processing of agricultural statistics and its early warning system is needed.  (4) A study of inter-district movements of food, seasonal migration of people, and adjustment strategies of food-deficit households and districts should be supported.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-0085-I-00-6098-00","","6/1/1988 12:00:00 AM","","Food aid programs|Food for Peace|Food for Work","Nepal","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNABB598.pdf","2,088 KB","000436 - Development Associates, Inc.","","003433 - USAID.

"Evaluation of P.L. 480 support to a public sector job-creation program in Tunisia, focusing on the first seven months of A.I.D. assistance during 1987/88. The equivalent of 22,000 jobs were created, compared to the target of 35,000.  This level accounted for roughly one-quarter of the jobs created by the program (totaling 87,000) and was judged significant relative to total unemployment of about 314,000, although much of the job creation is temporary employment only. Projects focused primarily on agricultural activities, such as forestry and soil conservation, and the quality of the output was judged to be excellent.  Projects are well integrated into national development activities.  Impact on production cannot be assessed from the information available. Suggests improvements to project selection, monitoring, and worker selection.

"Final evaluation of a project to assist the Government of Togo (GOT) in promoting animal traction (AT) technology among small farmers in the Kara and Savanes regions.  Project TA was provided primarily to PROPTA, a GOT institution established to coordinate and expand AT activities. External evaluation covers the period 1983-6/88. The project was an unqualified success.  At the heart of project activities were 16 rural facilities constructed to serve as AT training centers, equipment testing sites, and stocking points for animals, equipment, and veterinary supplies.  More than 1,700 farmers and extension agents participated in the hands-on training programs, which are effective, technically competent, and sustainable by host-country institutions.  Approximately 700 small farmers benefited directly from project-promoted technical packages (i.e., equipment plus training). PROPTA has supplied more than 850 pairs of oxen to project beneficiaries and coordinated veterinary services in areas where such services are limited.  PROPTA successfully produces a technical quarterly, an AT manual, and worksheets, although the quality of these publications could be improved.  While PROPTA has carried out required monitoring and evaluation responsibilities, guidelines in this area focus too narrowly on output indicators. Establishment of a credit program for farmers adopting AT technology has been critical to project success, and loan repayment rates are currently nearly 93% in the Savanes Region. On the negative side, the project experienced delays and shortfalls in both USAID and GOT funding due to complex administrative and fiscal procedures.  In order to cope with these deficiencies, the project borrowed from resources in earmarked accounts and from other donors. The project also failed to conduct a training needs assessment, which resulted in insufficient participant training. Prospects for project sustainability are enhanced by GOT policy reforms which endorse AT technology and mandate high-impact training and extension systems. It is recommended that PROPTA functions be cut back, perhaps by phasing out equipment and animal supply responsibilities and increasing emphasis on monitoring and evaluation, technical research and diagnostics, and information coordination. Construction of the Namiele livestock facility is also a concern. A financial feasibility study of the project is recommended.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","8/1/1988 12:00:00 AM","","Animal traction|Agricultural extension|Agricultural equipment|Agricultural extension training","Togo","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDBBO502.pdf","2,673 KB","006727 - Development Alternatives, Inc.

"This evaluation, conducted for USAID/Bolivia, examined (1) the general functioning of the P.L. 480 Title I/III Executive Secretariat, and (2) the wheat marketing system for P.L. 480. The wheat market is divided by geography and infrastructure into two areas; the market area containing the major national commercial production of wheat receives little or no P.L. 480 wheat, and thus the report concludes that ""P.L. 480 wheat has had little or no detrimental impacts on national production or the prices of nationally produced wheat.""  The credit programs financed by sales proceeds are generally functioning well, with cooperatives noting that they could disburse more funds if they were available, and farmers commenting that they would like to receive technical assistance in addition to credit.  The major criticism was the late arrival of funds.  There is evidence that most of the credit supplied through the program is not just substituting for more expensive credit, but rather is helping to finance new production and expanded use of inputs.

"PACR of a project (8/83-11/86) to supplement UNICEF's funding of the Government of Burundi's (GOB) national spring capping program. The bulk of the project's implementation and administration burden was the responsibility of UNICEF and of GOB project staff. A.I.D. interventions included funding of UNICEF-implemented sanitation and safe water seminars for communal administrators; publication of a manual on spring capping construction and maintenance; and (65% of A.I.D.'s contribution) the procurement of construction materials and equipment. A planned observation trip to Malawi never took place.  However, one unplanned output, the construction of 398 laundry tables near the springs, was achieved. A final evaluation of the project was judged unnecessary because of UNICEF's relatively effective implementation (which included inventories and mapping of all capped springs); because of the general difficulties of determining the project's health and social benefits; and because USAID/B has shifted its program strategy away from unrelated small projects toward a focused concentration on agriculture and population.

"PACR of a project (8/83-11/86) in Burundi's Bururi Province to upgrade about 30 km of mountainous dirt track to all-weather standards, institutionalize labor-intensive construction within the Direction Generale des Routes (DGR), and train a cadre of skilled roadworkers. Although road improvement goals were met, the objective to institutionalize labor-intensive construction was not achieved. The DGR relied exclusively on expatriate TA and made no effort to create a separate labor-intensive brigade for road construction. Quantitatively, the training component proved to be very successful, providing varying levels of on-the-job and formalized training for approximately 2,200 skilled and unskilled workers. However, the project goal of establishing a road construction labor pool for subsequent projects was unattainable because, in general, the roadworkers would not likely have the opportunity to relocate to search for employment. The improved road has had a positive impact on the socioeconomic welfare of the surrounding population by increasing the availability and use of manufactured goods and staples, reducing mass transportation fares, and contributing to more positive attitudes concerning schooling, extension services, and events occurring ouside the region.  Project impact on agriculture was more difficult to assess due to a lack of consistent baseline data.  Nonetheless, there are indications that the upgraded road facilitated the introduction of new seed varieties and allowed greater involvement in seed multiplication, reforestation, and palm oil manufacturing projects in nearby areas. The DGR responded effectively to interim evaluation recommendations regarding maintenance, dynamiting, and equipment inventory.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1988 12:00:00 AM","","Road construction|Construction workers|Access roads|Labor intensive technology","Burundi","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAY829.pdf","295 KB","008522 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of a project component to help the Costa Rican Social Security System (CCSS) provide continuing education to general physicians and pharmacists in the rational use of medications. Evaluation covers the period through 2/88. The project developed 15 training modules which are now available for use.  Some 120 people received at least one of these modules, and 102 of these received two or more.  In addition, 20 people participated in training-of-trainer workshops. The programs contributed to significant changes in pharmaceutical consumption patterns.  In Hospital Nicoya, improvements in consumption of non-steroidal anti-inflammatories and antibiotics were demonstrated 16 months after modules were conducted.  Less striking changes were seen in the use of anti-hypertensives, but promising trends were evident. However, these gains could be threatened by personnel turnover and limited resources if continuing education is terminated. It is recommended that the project focus on 2 main activities over the next 2 years:  (1) training of trainers to decentralize the training process and (2) module implementation.  Additional USAID support may be needed.

"Evaluates P.L. 480 Title II program implemented by CARE in the Dominican Republic. CARE has made a major commitment over the past few years to improve and expand the Title II program.  In 1982 an evaluation and audit of the program were performed, and USAID/DR, CARE, Catholic Relief Services (CRS), and Church World Services (CWS) were required to take measures to improve the program.  CRS and CWS actually opted to phase out of the program, while CARE decided to take action to improve its efforts. Nonetheless, many of today's program deficiencies are similar to those found in the earlier review.  That is not to say that the Title II program has not gone through changes.  Quite the opposite is true. However, the problem remains that Title II beneficiaries are still receiving food without receiving educational messages, and in fact some families are so used to receiving Title II foods that they ask why they continue to receive such small portions. CARE and its counterparts should not be content with how the Title II program is being run and should be further challenged to use Title II foods in a development sense, thereby making an impact on beneficiaries. Maternal/Child Health (MCH), Other Child Health, and Preschool and School Meal Programs should utilize Title II foods as a valuable food supplement, but also as an incentive to parents to send/take children to preschool and primary schools, to child recuperation centers, to day care centers and to MCH programs.  Once in the grasp of the program, parents and/or beneficiaries should receive nutrition education and other educational orientations to help them improve their lifestyles. In MCH programs, beneficiaries should be graduated from programs, not because they reached an age that excludes them from the program, but because children recover from a state of malnutrition due to a combination of food supplementation and educational interventions. Ideally, interventions should provide parents with enough learning opportunities so that children (upon leaving the program) do not fall back into a state of malnutrition.  Furthermore, parents should be happy that children no longer need food supplementation and have gained knowledge to utilize more locally available foods for home consumption. In Preschool and School Meal Programs, records should reflect an increase in school attendance.  If food commodities are being prepared, we can assume that more parents will see that children attend facilities to be assured that they get at least one good meal that day.  However, if attendance records are not accurately kept, program impact cannot be determined.  Further, teachers should be able to detect, immediately, the impact food rations can have on children's ability to learn. Children should be more alert and active in food supplemented school and preschool feeding programs.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","517-0000-O-00-8233-00","","8/1/1988 12:00:00 AM","","Food for Peace Title II|Child nutrition|Nutrition education|Private voluntary organizations|Maternal child feeding programs|School feeding programs","Dominican Republic","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAY894.pdf","4,506 KB","","","008537 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to strengthen Malawian intermediary institutions (II's) that provide credit, training, and business/technical advisory services to small and medium enterprises (SME's) in rural areas. External evaluation covers the period 1984-9/88. The project has made a positive contribution toward institutional development of three II's:  INDEFUND, a development finance institute lending to the SME sector; the Malawi Union of Saving and Credit Cooperatives (MUSCCO); and the Development of Malawian Traders Trust (DEMATT).  With project operational support, TA, and credit financing, MUSCCO has made particularly impressive progress.  Its program of mobilizing savings and organizing indigenously managed credit unions is creating numerous opportunities for expanding rural incomes.  INDEFUND, which received grant funds for on-lending, has achieved a lower level of lending than expected, largely because management has had to focus on improving its existing portfolio and strengthening internal operations. Once these improvements are made, however, INDEFUND should take a more aggressive approach to development financing.  Project TA has strengthened DEMATT's management and has clarified its mandate to provide SME's with business and technical advice.  Its services are unique among II's, and with further strengthening, DEMATT could become a major force in creating small businesses. The project has had a less direct, yet notable, impact on other SME development agencies by collecting and disseminating SME information. In 1988, the project began a pilot effort to promote SME credit financing opportunities by preparing feasibility studies and project portfolios for INDEFUND, the Small Enterprise Development Organization of Malawi, and commercial banking institutions.  The project has also engaged constructively in SME policy dialogue, working closely with the Ministry of Trade, Industry, and Tourism to broaden its involvement with II's. Project impact on SME's is more difficult to assess.  Specific project targets for employment and income appear to be unrealistic, in light of the effort required for II institutional development.  In addition, project managerial problems hindered impact at the SME level. For example, the project coordinator position was not filled until 8/85, a year after project implementation began.  There was also considerable disagreement regarding the role of Africare and the operational support requirements of MUSCCO, INDEFUND, and the project coordinating unit. It is recommended that USAID/M continue to support the II's in addition to planned SME development projects.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","DAN-1090-C-00-5124-00","","9/1/1988 12:00:00 AM","","Institution building|Business support services|Credit|Small scale enterprises|Medium scale enterprises","Malawi","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAY895.pdf","5,180 KB","000833 - Robert R.

"PACR of a multi-donor project (1978-88) to develop and institutionalize fish culture extension services for small farmers in Zaire.  USAID/Z was primarily involved with funding TA and commodities, as well as arranging participant training in the United States and other countries. The project was highly successful.  More than 8,000 farmers have participated, and average fish production has increased from less than 15 kgs to more than 30 kgs per 100 sq. meters.  Most importantly, the project achieved its main objective when the Government of Zaire (GOZ) established a National Program for Family Fish Culture to replace the project in 8/88.  Although this does not guarantee continued success, it does exhibit GOZ commitment to the project.  The Peace Corps will continue to provide extension services for the next 6 years and USAID/Z will continue local currency support for equipment and training. The project established management/leadership training centers for farmers in the following regions:  Bas Zaire, Bandundu, Kasai Oriental, Kasai Occidental, and Kivu.  Originally, the centers were used solely for fingerling production, while training was to be conducted at only one site in central Zaire.  When this site proved inaccessible, training programs were incorporated into the centers.  Courses are conducted year-round for 20 farmers at a time. USAID/Z completed all procurement, including vehicles and office and technical equipment.  TA consisted of:  (1) a consultant to the GOZ counterpart organization, Project Pisciculture Familiale; (2) two mobile extension team leaders; and (3) advisors to develop flip charts. Although participant training was not a major component, two persons completed U.S. management training programs and several others were sent to Israel and the Ivory Coast to study fish pond production. Another major accomplishment was the organization of farmer groups, which was not foreseen in the project documents.  These groups meet every 3 months and require no dues or official registration.  In addition to providing a forum for information exchange, the groups have maintained member interest in fish farming and have attracted new farmers. The project succeeded because it made fish farmers totally responsible for their own involvement and success.  Participants did not receive any TA until they had dug their own ponds without any project resources or assistance.  A second reason for the project's success was its simplicity.  Only TA was provided to farmers - no loans, no machines, no involved marketing schemes. If project designers can picture themselves in the role of implementors, they may be able to design projects which are more simply and easily implemented.","Attachment: XD-BBO-908-A","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","9/1/1988 12:00:00 AM","","Fish culture|Fish ponds|Extension services","Congo DR","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDBBO908.pdf","3,336 KB","008626 - USAID.

Although overall foodgrain production increased only 2.5% per year during the project, against a target of 4%, Boro rice production increased 8% per year and wheat production increased 12% per year. Thirty-four warehouses with a capacity of 165,000 MT were constructed. Bangladesh Agricultural Development Corporation (BADC) gross fertilizer warehouse capacity is now over 400,000 MT, which is sufficient to meet current and short-term needs. Fertilizer imports under the project totaled 527,461 MT (about 13% of all fertilizer imports) and have helped close the supply gap experienced at the start of the project. The objective of increasing fertilizer availability on an equitable basis has also been achieved. Virtually all farmers currently use some fertilizer on foodgrains, and fertilizer is even widely available (although slightly more expensive) in remote areas. The project directly resulted in policy changes that have established a free market system of fertilizer distribution, which now handles 99% of all fertilizer and appears competitive and efficient. Retail fertilizer prices have gradually been completely decontrolled and fertilizer subsidies have been substantially removed. In neither case has there been a serious negative impact on fertilizer use. BADC dealer training has had a positive impact and is widely supported. However, the training has been sharply reduced since 1986, and should be restored and redesigned to reflect changes in the private marketing system. Although project implementation was slower than anticipated, A.I.D./W and USAID/B managed the project adequately and used a consensus approach to decisionmaking. TA provided to BADC by the International Fertilizer Development Center has been technically sound, problem-oriented, and timely. Several lessons were learned. (1) Agricultural development projects with major policy reform objectives should be expected to have long implementation periods (i.e., 5-10 years) if institutional change is to be successful. (2) Agricultural policy reform must be viewed as an evolutionary, step-by-step process. (3) Important agricultural reform is possible, given sufficient resources and USAID and host government committment.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","7/1/1988 12:00:00 AM","","Fertilizer distribution|Crop production|Agricultural markets|Privatization|Agricultural policy|Agricultural prices","Bangladesh","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAY817.pdf","4,579 KB","","","008511 - USAID.

"Annual evaluation of the Title III program in Bangladesh.  No aggregate balance of payments, supply, or consumption/nutrition impacts are presented or discussed.  The evaluation team does recommend that the FY 88 allocations include $60M in Title III commodities and $15M in flood relief, to provide ""maximum leverage for policy reforms."" The report notes that policy reforms in the areas of government procurement/open market sales were disappointing, but that much of the lack of movement in price liberalization was caused by delays in imported grain arrivals from donors.  Progress on exploring the expansion of maize consumption was judged good, while additional analysis is necessary on rural free food distribution programs and on modified rationing for the rural poor. The report strongly recommends increased monitoring of Title III projects, while the Mission response states that they believe the success of Title III will be measured by policy reforms not by results of the projects.

"Evaluates Food for Peace Title II activities in Madagascar, focusing on the Maternal/Child Health (MCH), School Feeding (SF), and Other Child Feeding (OCF) programs.  Catholic Relief Service (CRS) is the implementing agency.  Evaluation covers the period through 8/88. MCH is the largest CRS activity in Madagascar, providing monthly nutrition lessons, growth monitoring, and milk, rice, and vegetable oil rations to 50,000 mothers and 50,000 children at 68 sites.  Center managers generally have been successful in targeting the neediest populations.  CRS maintains nutrition statistics on MCH beneficiaries, and a recent survey will soon provide data on their socio-economic status.  These data, however, do not provide information on the program's long-term impact, and many program administrators doubt the existence of a positive nutritional impact. The SF program provides a daily meal to 14,000 students (6-14 years) in 88 schools.  Each school's program manager is responsible for targeting the neediest children.  No statistical data on the nutritional impact of the SF program are available. The principal weakness of this program is its lack of a realistic plan to decrease its dependence on U.S. food aid. The OCF program feeds institutionalized orphans, lepers, and the handicapped in compliance with AID guidelines.  However, the program also is involved with smaller MCH centers for undernourished children under three years old, which does not conform to A.I.D. guidelines. The following measures are recommended.  (1) An in-depth study of the nutritional impact of the MCH program should be conducted. (2) CRS should develop a reporting method which shows the nutritional impact of MCH activities.  (3) The CRS socio-economic beneficiary survey should be analyzed as soon as possible.  (4) CRS should better integrate its MCH program with government efforts by adopting the standardized growth chart.  (5) MCH centers should be used as hubs for small development projects. (6) Termination of SF support should be considered if a long-term plan to end dependency is not developed.  (7) USAID should continue to support OCF institutions, but require CRS to reclassify feeding centers currently misplaced in this category.

"Mid-term evaluation of a project to support Mauritania's National Agricultural Research Center (CNRADA) by providing TA and researcher training.  External evaluation covers the period 12/85-10/88. The project has made important progress toward agricultural research institution building.  Thirteen studies have been completed on farming systems, ecology, and food consumption patterns in the Senegal River Valley.  Short-term, third-country training has been provided to 5 research assistants, and 7 researchers are attending U.S. universities, 5 for the B.S. degree and 2 for the M.S.  Additional activities have included station and on-farm trials, collection of sorghum germplasm, and strengthening of linkages between CNRADA and other national and international research and development agencies. On the negative side, because the project was originally planned as a regional effort, the project paper contains wording which applies to Senegal and Mali only, not to Mauritania.  This has caused confusion during implementation.  The project paper also overestimated the availability of qualified Mauritanian researchers and the ability of CNRADA personnel to conduct/analyze agronomic trials.  The 1988/89 on-farm trial program should be scaled back, taking into account CNRADA's human and material resources, while station trials need to improve data collection and interpretation.  Although the project's farming systems research strategy is sound and well-adapted to Mauritanian conditions, the methodology has not always been followed. For example, in some cases farmer-managed trials were implemented when researcher management would have been more appropriate.  More in-country, on-the-job training of researchers at all levels is needed. Also, the U.S. academic training should be accompanied by practical experience in agronomic trial design, implementation, and analysis. An insufficient operating budget continues to be a major problem for CNRADA, and the Government of Mauritania has stipulated that CNRADA's budget allocation will not be increased until it has further demonstrated a capacity to generate technologies acceptable to farmers. It is recommended that A.I.D. make a long-term commitment to support CNRADA in obtaining this goal.  A follow-on project should also be in place to receive the participant trainees, who will not return in time to benefit from working with the advisers under this project.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","10/1/1988 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural research|Research methodology|On farm research","Mauritania","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAY954.pdf","1,331 KB","005072 - Tropical Research and Development, Inc.","","008576 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (12/80-1/88) to improve the efficiency of agricultural marketing in Jamaica. The project was executed in 2 phases, the first focusing on developing a marketing division within the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) and promoting cooperative Producer Marketing Organizations (PMO's), and the second funding the construction of markets and assembly/grading stations.  Other activities have included fruit fly trapping, a citrus canker survey, and a road improvement component, the latter added in 6/86 with a 7/89 PACD. The project was plagued with implementation problems from the outset. Some were typical of large, complex institutional development projects, while others can be attributed to the Government of Jamaica's (GOJ) failure to provide scheduled counterpart funding, particularly for construction, and to cumbersome GOJ contracting procedures.  During the first 5 years, only 1 assembly/grading station was built (vs. 25 planned), and the appropriateness of that facility is doubtful, given the volume of produce marketed by the PMO that operates it.  A plan to construct a commercial slaughterhouse was not carried out because the implementing agency failed to identify an appropriate construction site and contract an operator. TA proved a problem rather than an asset.  The first team of advisors to the MOA marketing division were particularly unresponsive to project needs:  one member prepared specifications for the procurement of processing/storage equipment (costing $755,422) totally inappropriate for the PMO's, which were then at their earliest stages of development. Fortunately, however, the equipment has since been put to good use at a winter vegetable processing facility. More positively, after expansion of the TA component in 1/85, a U.S. Department of Agriculture inspector was assigned to preclear and supervise the fumigation of produce exported to the United States. Equipment for a GOJ fumigation facility and training of MOA personnel were also provided.  This activity has made an important contribution to facilitating the export of nontraditional products, and has since been incorporated into another A.I.D. project to ensure continued funding. Several lessons were learned.  (1) Cultural and historical factors should be considered early in the design process.  Had this been done, more than 5 years and many millions of dollars would not have been expended in a futile effort to substitute a wholly inappropriate U.S. marketing model for one that had developed locally for over 200 years, and which is still entirely appropriate in the Jamaican context.  (2) An efficient agricultural marketing system is characterized by open competition, well-informed participants, and minimal price distortions. This project failed to emphasize these characteristics by concentrating on market infrastructure construction and cooperative promotion.  (3) Project management must be alert to delays in the execution of activities and make necessary modifications, including timely reprogramming.  (4) Planning and budgeting in the project design process must be realistic.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","7/1/1988 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural product marketing|Agricultural markets|Marketing facilities|Export promotion|Nontraditional agricultural exports","Jamaica","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAY957.pdf","215 KB","008563 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (1/85-2/88) to strengthen the Jamaican cooperative movement by helping the National Union of Cooperative Societies (NUCS) to provide TA and training to the Jamaica Cooperative Credit Union League (JCCUL) and to cooperative businesses. The project made significant progress and had substantial impact on agricultural production in some areas.  (1) The target number of 6 produce marketing organizations (PMO's) were formed, although 1 ceased operation in 11/87.  With project TA and training, 4 of the PMO's succeeded in increasing the volume of produce marketed.  This has encouraged expansion of cropping, diversification, and crop scheduling. The PMO's have also been investigating the possibility of a direct export joint venture. NUCS made loans totaling $255,000 to the six PMO's for farm input procurement.  Combined with project TA, these inputs saved farmers time, improved pest and disease control, and raised yields. TA to JCCUL's mortgage lending program helped improve its member services with a resulting increase in mortgages issued to medium- and low-income groups.  Strategies have been identified to further increase this program's profitability and efficiency. Project counterparts developed 10 curriculum packages for credit union leaders and 4 manuals on accounting, credit delinquency, and communications.  A number of Jamaicans now have the skills to produce such materials. Several lessons were learned.  (1) Jamaican small farmers must be involved in a project from the beginning stages, as they are usually slow to accept imposed changes.  (2) A cooperative will not succeed unless there is a felt need among the members.  (3) Jamaican farmers are slow in developing trust and confidence in others and thus tend to retain familiar outlets even though collective marketing by the cooperative could provide more stability.  (4) Cooperatives are often slow in showing visible results. Thus, many of the efforts seen as failures by farmers could be successes if allowed time.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1988 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural cooperatives|Credit unions|Agricultural product marketing","Jamaica","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAY958.pdf","162 KB","008563 - USAID.

"The Hill Areas Land and Water Development Project has had a positive impact on irrigation development in the State of Himachal Pradesh, India, and has considerable potential to resolve specific water and land use problems, but several actions are needed to improve technical quality and economic viability: (1) the pace of scheme development should not increase and new schemes should be selected with more emphasis on technical considerations and include watershed planning; (2) special training and research are needed in water management techniques appropriate to hill areas; (3) the project needs support from a substantial contract team of appropriate technical specialists. Although implementation was slow at the start, there is clear evidence of significant impact and progress toward realization of the project's potential.  The project has had a major impact on irrigation design - evaluation of scheme investments, scientific determination of water requirements, distribution system planning, working relationships with users, and establishment of irrigation as a profession are significant changes introduced by the project.  There is also potential for higher-impact efforts in related watershed forestry and conservation interventions. However, there is little institutionalization of these changes due to very slow progress in technical training, socioeconomic analysis, technology adoption, and system research. Although there are indications of high returns to irrigation in Himachal Pradesh, the internal rate of returns (IRR's) of some of the surface water high-lift schemes appear questionable due to high capital and recurrent costs (particularly for the increasing numbers of high-lift pump systems).  Further, given the low charges for water and particularly high operating costs, the recurrent costs of project investments will become increasingly burdensome to the State.  Three steps may resolve the economic questions:  (1)  technical selection of optimal, less difficult sites, (2) increased community/farmer control and responsibility, and (3) ex-post analysis of actual benefit streams. The project is substantially overfunded given its timeframe and the size and experience of the implementing departments' cadre. Options for the remainder of the project range from completing as pilots those schemes already committed (approx. $20 million) to continuing with schemes in an extended timeframe with concentration on watershed protection and the addition of the development of a major institution (approx. $45 million).  The current commitment to the State and the obvious impacts and potential argue strongly for an option which strengthens and extends the project's activities.  At the same time, the large number of schemes planned should be reduced and emphasis put on planning, training, analyses, applied research, and feedback monitoring. The project's substantial management demands are due less to its apparant complexity, than to the limited staffing, technical, and institutional resources in the State in relation to the project's size and objectives.  Successful implementation will require considerable assistance to the State's field staff, Project Cell, and universities from a multidisciplinary team of U.S. and Indian specialists in resource planning, hydrology, hydraulics, soil conservation, water resource engineering, monitoring/evaluation, training, and rural organizationa. With this supplemental assistance, the project can be managed by the current personnel.

"Mozambique's rapid execution of and initial successes with an Economic Rehabilitation Program are fast turning it into a favored example of the International Monetary Fund, but over 2.2 million Mozambicans are affected by severe shortages of food and other essentials, and another 1.1 million have been displaced from their homes by a continuing cycle of drought and floods and an active and widespread civil war.  This evaluation assesses two grants to support CARE's efforts (1984-present) to assist in creating a Logistics Support Unit (LSU) in Mozambique's Department of the Prevention and Combat of Natural Calamities (DPCCN).  LSU's mandate is to manage and transport emergency food and non-food commodities throughout the nation to at-risk populations. Food aid is provided to Mozambique by over 40 NGO's, UN agencies, and multilateral and bilateral donors; in 1987 alone more than $325 million dollars of emergency assistance was provided.  Donor commodities managed by DPCCN/LSU rose from 61,550 tons in 1985 to 153,253 tons in 1987. However, the 98,000 tons of the 1987 contribution that was cereals represents adequate rations for only 800,000 of Mozambique's 3.3 million at-risk persons; absolute availability of food is thus still a constraint. Given the growth of widespread terrorist activities and concomitant difficulties with internal transport, LSU/CARE relies on 18 points of entry for commodities around the country; this compounds problems with accountability and increases costs, but has a high degree of effectiveness in reaching at risk populations. In 1984, emergency assistance was delivered to 3 of Mozambique's 10 provinces; Phase I of a CARE Master Plan of Operations tracking commodities from donors to the provincial level was installed, and accountability for some 70% of commodities was achieved.  In 1987, 9 provinces were receiving emergency aid and Phase II of the Master Plan was initiated with the training of delegates in 50 accessible districts, with another 20 to be trained in 1988; thus, all accessible districts will be fully accounting for commodities in the near future. Overall, CARE has made a strong contribution to developing an effective, well-equipped disaster relief structure, of which LSU is but one part.  This has been accomplished by establishing LSU as a vertically integrated logistics unit, covering planning, collection of baseline information, and emphasis on developing in-house transport capacity. CARE's careful attention to a systems approach will have a very high payoff in the medium and long term; CARE has been less concerned with operational efficiencies in the short term, given the massive needs.  As CARE has done well in establishing an effective system, so it now must turn to fine-tuning to enable Mozambique to maintain the system in the future.  Several recommendations are made for redefining LSU's modue operandi. and lessons learned for similar efforts outside Mozambique are identified.

"PACR of a project (7/80-9/88) to improve the physical infrastructure and quality of rural Honduran primary education and to develop a management information system (MIS) in the Ministry of Education (MOE). Despite major crises, all activities have been completed.  Due to the Government of Honduras' (GOH) slow procurement and distribution of materials, the MOE constructed only about half of the target number of classrooms by the original 4/85 PACD. Contracting of private firms was then authorized.  While this increased costs, it accelerated construction and eventually 2,056 of a targeted 2,100 classrooms were built - many of them in extremely remote and previously unserved areas. The project also renovated 606 of a targeted 700 schools and provided locally built school furniture, including 3,000 items to non-project schools.  As a consequence of project construction and renovation, 81,100 students have access to primary education for the first time. For several reasons - e.g., taboos against singles of opposite sexes occupying the same house, lack of enthusiasm among villagers, and inadequate rural living conditions for teachers - only 5 of 600 planned housing units for rural teachers were built. Funds were used instead to build an in-service teacher training center in La Paz.  However, after completion of this 13-building residential complex, USAID/H decided that it was too remote from population centers, too costly to operate, and did not fit with the concept of decentralized teacher training.  As a result, plans have been made to trade the complex for an educational center in Tegucigalpa of equivalent value and size. Under the maintenance component, which limited its target area in 7 departments due to operational difficulties, 1,200 classrooms were repaired and 1,008 received indirect support (i.e., manuals and equipment).  A key aspect of the component was the use of promoters to create support for maintenance activities among parents, teachers, and students. More than in 70% of the communities that received maintenance services and training have continued their repair work. Although the MOE decided not to merge the In-service Teacher Training Group (ITTG), created under a previous project, with its Pedagogical Section, the ITTG component provided professional training to 39 trainers and seminars and short courses to more than 16,000 MOE teachers and supervisors (exceeding target); nearly all indicated that the training improved their job performance.  This component also: introduced the ""nucleo"" concept of school organization in 5 departments, developed an innovative and participatory curriculum model, and was (unexpectedly) successful in motivating primary school teachers. Efforts to institutionalize a computerized MIS was impeded by the MOE's chronic management instability and high personnel turnover. Only the educational statistics subsystem of the MIS was achieved as planned. A follow-on component is planned to fully integrate the system into overall MOE operations. Several lessons were learned.  (1) Rapid personnel turnovers placed excessive power in the hands of an MOE official of limited ability; A.I.D. contractors should implement projects from beginning to end.  (2) Use of the private sector for school construction proved more efficient but also more expensive than the Fixed Amount Reimbursement method.  (3) A.I.D. must eventually deal (as this project did not) with the GOH bureauratic problems which hindered project implementation.  (4) The project's impact on school dropout and repeater rates was miniscule.  A stronger focus on educational quality issues was needed.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","9/1/1988 12:00:00 AM","","Primary education|Classrooms|Rural areas|Building construction|Primary schools|Access to education|Teacher training|Beneficiary count","Honduras","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDKAN213.pdf","284 KB","008555 - USAID.

"Evaluates the impacts of several USAID/Honduras rural road projects. The impact of the earliest roads was nearly impossible to measure because most of these had since been rehabilitated or reconstructed. The principal target of the impact measurement was the Rural Trails and Access Roads project, new enough to be remembered, yet completed with sufficient time for impacts to be evident.  Inspections of some Rural Roads II project and some roads built by other institutions were also conducted. In general, the roads were properly constructed.  Some faults were found with lack of completion of some elements in Rural Trails and Access Roads; supervision had improved by the time of the Rural Roads II Project and the contractors finished their work.  There were some design problems, mainly on roads subject to flooding; the roadbeds were not high enough to overcome the problem.  A few created dams which increased the flooded areas.  Probably the major weakness in both projects was that on some roads insufficient select material had been used on the surface, while on others the surface had not been properly compacted. Lack of proper maintenance is a major problem. maintenance offices have nearly no equipment, small budgets, and insufficient personnel to effect the routine repairs necessary to prolong the life of the roads. The national maintenance office has experienced reduced budgets the last 2 years while more and more roads were being built.  The problem is a serious one that must be faced if A.I.D. is to protect its investment. Economic benefits were studied via two main approaches:  from the view of the beneficiaries, and through two special studies of a macro nature.  The beneficiaries engaged in agriculture, shrimp, salt, transportation, and commerce had reaped unusually high benefits from the roads.  First, the roads opened areas so that more land is devoted to crops and livestock, and to the shrimp and salt enterprises.  Second, the opening of the roads was quickly followed by many TA services and these further spurred development and stimulated many small businesses. Transportation services improved markedly, growing from horses to modern buses and trucks, all operating profitably in the new areas.  That, in turn, brought still another benefit to communities - additional opportunities to associate with other people, to bring in their supplies at lower cost, and to haul their produce to better and farther markets. In the Northwest Region, the effects of the development after road construction are greater than the sum of the beneficiary effects. Commerce, interregional transportation, credit institutions, and many other services are considerably enhanced. That is, there is a benefit beyond the farmers and their families; the impact spreads to a series of businesses that are spawned or operate at a higher level. Beneficiaries reported more primary schools, more children enrolled in school, and more youths traveling to other towns where secondary education was available.  Some adult education has now reached the communities as well.  Health benefits were equally evident.  More rural clinics had been built, nutrition was being taught in some communities, travel to hospitals and other health facilities was easier.  Some organizations had entered many communities and were helping with the construction of latrines and potable water systems.  More needs to be done in health but a substantial beginning has been made.

"Interim evaluation of a project to support an integrated pest management (IPM) program within the Escuela Agricola Panamericana (EAP) in Zamorano, Honduras.  The program aims to develop new IPM technologies and test extension procedures and materials for transfering these technologies to trainers and farmers.  External evaluation covers the period 1986-9/88. The project is well-managed and meets its teaching, research, and extension mandates.  EAP students receive an excellent balance of theoretical and practical training through a curriculum which utilizes a large quantity of project-developed IPM teaching materials, including textbooks, laboratory guides, and audiovisual modules.  It is recommended that A.I.D. support continued development and distribution of these materials throughout Central America.  Research conducted both on- and off-station is designed to solve the specific production problems of Honduran farmers.  In addition, detailed research is conducted to develop delivery methods acceptable to farmers.  Farmers are also involved throughout the process of identifying research needs and in developing research and extension methodology.  As a result, the EAP's relationship with participating farmers and other cooperators is strong, and farmers are changing their practices.  EAP research-extension technologies and methodologies could also serve as models for other crop production technologies. The EAP could make valuable contributions to USAID/H's proposed Land Use and Productivity Enhancement (LUPE) project.  In addition to IPM expertise, LUPE would benefit highly from the EAP's research program in no-tillage production and its diagnostic, biological control, and pesticide use and efficacy centers.  Should the project become a part of LUPE, it is recommended that the EAP receive $1 million per year for research, extension, and teaching services. The major lesson learned is that plant protection provides easy access to farmers because it usually results in dramatic and positive solutions.  IPM activities could serve as the conduit for the flow of other technologies, such as soil testing and fertilization.","Work order no. 83","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-1406-I-83-7006-00","","9/1/1988 12:00:00 AM","","Integrated pest management|Agricultural schools|Agricultural training|Research centers|Educational materials","Honduras","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAZ023.pdf","2,720 KB","000436 - Development Associates, Inc.","","008555 - USAID.

"In 8/84, the Government of Niger (GON) and USAID signed a 4-year agreement to implement the Agricultural Sector Development Grant (ASDG). Under that agreement, the GON was to receive $29 million in local currency in return for undertaking specific agricultural policy reforms. These reforms thus became conditions precedent for the release of funds into a special account.  A Secretariat was established to manage the counterpart fund, and a joint USAID/GON committee was formed to allocate the fund to support agricultural policy reforms and development projects.  In addition, $3 million was included for TA, and a team of resident advisors was provided by the University of Michigan.  The ASDG's results have been mixed.  Policy reforms have been undertaken, although the success of these reforms has varied.  The ASDG's macroeconomic impacts have been significant, though of limited magnitude.  The effectiveness of the TA was also mixed.  The advisors completed a number of important studies, but Nigerien participation in those studies was minimal.  Little progress was made in enhancing the host government's capability to undertake policy analysis, though training in microcomputer use was successful.  The ASDG program's experience yields numerous lessons regarding several potential trade-offs associated with undertaking this approach to policy reform as opposed to a more traditional policy and planning project. Lessons learned are as follows:  (1) The credibility and effectiveness of the program depends largely on the rigor of the process through which satisfaction of the CP's is certified.  The program's credibility can be undermined in a situation such as the 1986 evaluation suggested exists in Niger, where disbursements were made even when there was some question as to whether the GON had fully met the CP's specified for that tranche; (2) Enforcement of the CP's requires a careful balance between being too strict if conditions warrant flexibility and being too flexible in certifying that CP's have been met.  There must be a clearly established system of responsibility and accountability for making that certification.  It appears that in the ASDG, the TA team's role in that decision was secondary to the political objectives of the Mission.  The result of unjustified disbursements can be to undercut the team's effectiveness in promoting policy reform and in establishing the analytical capacity to continue the reform process.  (3) The lack of integration of the economic advisors into the Ministry of Agriculture and the lack of interaction between advisors and counterparts has minimized the institution-building impacts of the ASDG and reduced the likelihood of the reform process continuing after the program's completion. (4) Government announcements that a particular policy has been reformed (such as the liberalization of cowpea exports in Niger) may make little differences if administrative and other barriers are not removed in the process.  (5) Programs should serve to strengthen the ties between policy analysis and decisionmaking.  Reforms are more likely to be implemented if decisionmakers appreciate the importance of analysis and understand the rationale and objectives of proposed reforms.

"Evaluates project implemented by Volunteers in Technical Assistance (VITA) to provide credit and related TA to small and medium businesses in Chad.  External interim evaluation covers the period 1/84-9/87. Despite extremely difficult economic conditions, the project has achieved some of its objectives and is an important element in Chad's modest financial sector.  A well managed and staffed professional institution has been created that is now the chief source of term credit for small and medium businesses.  The project has also created enterprises and jobs, assisted in war reconstruction, provided goods and services, and generated income.  As of 9/87, some 169 loans totaling about $590,000 have been made for such undertakings as vegetable and fruit truck farms, purchase of plows, tailor shops, refrigeration repair facilites, automobile repair, private schools, metal fabrication, and pharmacies. However, the project now faces 3 significant financial problems: (1) declines in loan applications and in total loan volume, (2) operating costs which increasingly exceed loan volume, and (3) worsening repayment performance.  The cause of these problems seems to be the 1986-87 economic slowdown and the decline in the number of sound projects after the initial surge associated with war reconstruction. Recommendations for solving the financial problems are to:  (1) increase publicity for the program, (2) provide loans in new geographic areas, (3) increase average loan size and repeat loans to successful borrowers, (4) undertake joint lending with commercial banks, (5) become the credit arm for other PVO's and donors, (6) raise interest rates, (7) introduce fees for TA, (8) reduce staff, and (9) persuade the Government of Chad to provide office space and utilities. It is recommended that project termination be considered if these financial problems are not alleviated by the third quarter of 1988.  If they are alleviated, A.I.D. must determine if continued support is warranted even though the project will not become financially self-sustaining in the foreseeable future.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","AFR-0438-C-00-5007-00","","1/1/1988 12:00:00 AM","","Credit|Small scale enterprises|Medium scale enterprises|Private enterprises|Loan administration","Chad","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAZ045.pdf","1,233 KB","009024 - Dimpex Associates, Inc.","","004589 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (9/79-9/88) to strengthen the management capability of Somalia's Water Development Agency (WDA) and support establishment of an on-going rural water supply program. Results were mixed.  Despite its technical accomplishments, the project failed to achieve major institutionalization objectives. A total of 142 boreholes were completed over the life of the project, but only 20 of these were commissioned by the WDA after the 6/86 departure of the contractor (vs. a planned capacity to commission 50 wells per year). Moreover, due to the WDA's lack of operating funds, further private sector well-drilling has not been commissioned since the first four private wells were completed in 1987.  A shortage of qualified Somali personnel constrained full institutionalization of the following components:  an electronic and geophysical lab, a monitoring and evaluation system, and a planning unit.  In addition, maintenance of well sites and pump and distribution systems is minimal to non-existent. On the positive side, the project provided degree and short-term U.S. geological training for 12 persons and effective on-the-job training for all project staff (about 132 in total) - although it is generally believed that continued inadequate pay (and for a period in 1987, actually no pay) will lead many trainees to leave the WDA for more lucrative employment. A National Water Center was established within the WDA and is now functioning relatively well with a library of more than 200 publications. Community participation was effectively encouraged through establishment of local water committees.  The project also established a water quality lab, developed cost analysis models, and conducted studies on the potential for private sector water development and the future role of the WDA.  Most importantly, socioeconomic studies indicate that conditions in target villages have improved considerably. Previously high rates of morbidity, mortality, and migration during seasonal water shortages have been minimized by project-constructed wells. Several lessons were learned.  (1) Project design should more actively involve long-term staff members who are familiar with local conditions and, ideally, speak the local language.  (2) The Mission should work more closely with other donors to address the standardization and local maintenance of vehicles and equipment. (3) Groundwater projects should consider not only quantitative needs but also the impact of alternative approaches on equipment needs, settlement patterns, future maintenance needs, and organizational structure.  (4) Local participation in well development and operation should be included in all rural groundwater development projects.  (5) The chances of successful project implementation are substantially reduced when authority is fragmented.","Includes bibliography","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","6/1/1988 12:00:00 AM","","Drilled wells|Small bore drilled wells|Groundwater|Rural areas|Institution building|Water supply structures","Somalia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAZ049.pdf","212 KB","004134 - Louis Berger International, Inc.

"Mid-term evaluation of the Semi-Arid Food Grains Research and Development (SAFGRAD) Phase II Project, which is directed at increasing food production in the semi-arid tropics of sub-Saharan Africa. During Phase II, direct agricultural research activities at two International Agricultural Research Centers (IARC's) - the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics and the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture - were phased out.  Instead, the project provided substantial resources to the same IARC's and to a regional unit of the Organization of African Unity/Scientific Technical and Research Commission (OAU/STRC), the SAFGRAD Coordination Office (SCO), to set up 4 regional crop networks.  The problem of increasing food crop productivity in 26 countries through agricultural research is an enormous one.  By reducing the focus to establishing 4 effective crop research networks, SAFGRAD II attempted to increase the impact of the IARC's on the National Agricultural Research System (NARS) in a manageable, well-defined manner. The IARC's have provided very effective network coordinators and the SCO has provided commendable administrative and political support.  The principal constraint on the evolution of African leadership in the Networks has been insufficient formal training of the NARS Network scientists.  Plans for M.S. and Ph.D. training should be developed by the SCO in collaboration with the leaders of the various NARS. The evaluation recommends funding the SCO at the present level for the duration of SAFGRAD II.  Major new activities in pursuit of donor funding or in direct implementaion of other activities, besides Network support, should be deferred until the re-evaluation in 1991 for a SAFGRAD III.  A critical component of SCO maintenance of present and future Network support will be an SCO/USAID budget re-allocation to pay for the two top management personnel supported by the International Fund for Agricultural Development until 4/89.  If increased funding can be obtained for the SCO without major management effort, the SCO is encouraged to pursue this.  Certainly both the OAU/STRC and the African Development Bank should be approached for some supplementary funding. Various other management suggestions have been made for both the SCO and the IARC's to improve their support of the Networks. Among lessons learned, the evaluation team believes that SAFGRAD II was appropriately designed to have a narrow focus on crop-specific networks in the NARS, and especially on national human capital development.  The regional focus of this project also seems to be appropriate.  In planning for SAFGRAD III, the evaluation team is concerned with the recent A.I.D. initiative calling for all regional projects to be funded from operational year budgets of country Missions.

"Evaluates project to strengthen both regional (sub-Saharan African) and Cameroonian capacities to control schistosomiasis by establishing a regional schistosomiasis research facility in Cameroon, conducting studies, and training researchers. Evaluation was performed 41 months after arrival of the TA team and start-up of the project. The technical studies have been performed very well by the Tulane TA team and the Cameroonian scientists.  The mapping of schistosomiasis prevalence and intensity, and the parallel malacological studies have been major achievements and are about 80% complete.  The researchers should now consider how their findings can be applied to national schistosomiasis control programs.  The socioeconomic research component was not carried out; it should be started as soon as possible in order to contribute to the design of effective control strategies.  Lack of implementation of the socioeconomic research component of the project will adversely affect the development of control activities that are economical and socially acceptable to the Cameroonians. The training component has been very successful, about 70% complete, though heavily weighted in favor of Cameroon.  Twelve Cameroonian trainees are working toward Ph.D. degrees, while eight non-Cameroonians are being trained at the Master's level. Cameroon's Institute for Medical Research and Medicinal Plants (IMPM) should now give serious consideration to effective assimilation of the returning students into schistosomiasis or allied research programs. Few of the regional objectives of the project have been met.  The team also found deficiencies in the institution building objectives of the project, which are only about 10-15% complete. One major problem was that the Project Paper did not give thorough consideration to institution building and its sustainability.  Another problem was that none of the three parties - A.I.D., Tulane, or the IMPM - involved in project implementation focused on the institutional objectives.  Other major outputs of the project and their levels of completion are (1) construction of a schistosomiasis research center,  25% completed; (2) increased knowledge about schistosomiasis, 85% completed; and (3) formation of interagency and regional network, 10% completed. In sum, many of the components of this project have been very successful, but some deficiencies still remain.  Remedial action would include planning a pilot control study, developing work plans, ensuring further training of key personnel, and staging workshops, as recommended below.  In the case of socioeconomic research, funds and personnel will need to be identified.  The project is now in a position to go beyond its present status by reaching out on a national and regional basis to disseminate results and develop strategies to control schistosomiasis. The project has many aspects of which the Government of Cameroon can be proud.  Sustaining the effort in the years ahead is a major challenge.

"Interim evaluation of Phases I and II of an activity to promote small, labor-intensive non-farm enterprises in Bangladesh by helping the Government of Bangladesh (GOB) collect data on enterprises and develop policies to promote them.  Phase I, financed by the Enterprise Policy Reform Project, was to include an economic census, institutionalization of an annual economic survey, and a survey of household and cottage industries.  Phase II, financed through a buy-in to the centrally funded Employment and Enterprises Policy Analysis Project, was to provide an economic advisor, along with short-term TA to conduct studies leading to policy recommendations.  Evaluation covered the period 9/85-3/88. The activity has had mixed results.  All components of Phase I have experienced delays, while disagreements have arisen between Phase I and II personnel about the content and availability of Phase I data.  In Phase I, the coverage of the census was a bit disappointing (91% for households and 85% for businesses), but delays in census processing and optical mark reader procurement are more troubling.  Production of an annual economic survey based on census data has had to be postponed at least one year. It is believed, however, that the economic census will achieve its major purpose of serving as a sampling frame for economic units throughout Bangladesh. Phase II activities have only just begun.  The Phase II economic advisor has performed well despite a lack of logistical support and legal recognition by the GOB.  The advisor's work has helped build the analytical capacity of the Bureau of Statistics' Planning Commission by providing technical advice on the Fourth Five-Year Plan, a social accounting matrix, and a computable general equilibrium model. Given the constraints imposed by delays in Phase I data, it is recommended that USAID/B consider modifying the schedule of the Phase II economic advisor to better assist the Planning Commission in economic/statistical modeling activities.  Also, a consensus on the workplan among Phase I and Phase II, Mission, and Planning Commission/GOB personnel is essential to the progress of both phases. USAID/B should encourage the GOB to formally recognize Phase II as an activity of the Planning Commission; this will enable the Phase II advisor to gain legal standing in his advisement work.  In addition, an expansion of the Phase I Survey of Household and Cottage Industries from 1 month to 12 months would provide more accurate data.","Attached to PD-CBA-729","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","7/1/1988 12:00:00 AM","","Small scale enterprises|Economic planning|Economic surveys","Bangladesh","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDCBA729A.pdf","2,522 KB","008511 - USAID.

"Evaluates irrigation training component of a project to increase agricultural water management capacities in India. The evaluators were greatly impressed by the progress made in developing and implementing training activities by the institutions visited.  The State Training Institutes (STI's) are making a considerable impact on increasing the awareness of on-farm irrigation needs.  Furthermore, spirit at the STI's is good, staff seem to be quite motivated, and course materials and ability to present them are improving. STI programs appear to be broad, generic, and academic.  Programs are apparently not planned specifically to meet the needs of the officers of the Irrigation and Agriculture Departments or the Command Area Development Authorities.  In view of this, the evaluation team recommends that the STI's collaborate with Irrigation and other concerned Departments to design training programs focused on the specific work activities of irrigation system designers and operators, and the knowledge/skills necessary to increase their capability. For example, the focus of present training programs at all the project- supported institutions appears to be mainly on the tertiary or on-farm level of irrigation systems.  However, there are major structural and management concerns and opportunities for improvement at other levels.  In view of this the team recommends a more balanced training approach to encompass key aspects of the entire irrigation system.  This would involve a greater emphasis on the operation and management of the ""main system"" (above the outlet to the tertiary system). Improvements could also be made via:  (1) incorporating course materials into a systematic curriculum that reflects the actual work functions of the Irrigation  Department; (2) increasing faculty members' use of participatory and hands-on training methods; (3) developing evaluation procedures for each STI; (4) increasing linkages with universities; and (5) reviewing guidelines for selecting trainees.  The team also finds that it would be more cost-effective to strengthen a training of trainers capability within India, rather than to continue with the U.S.-based program.

"Recent progress made by the Philippines in economic reform and the role played therein by A.I.D. are reviewed in this report. Part I provides a context for the policy and program review. Part II evaluates four program grants made between 1984 and 1987 - Rural Productivity Support, Development Support, and Budget Support I and II - concluding that A.I.D. provided timely and desperately needed balance of payments support during these critical years, and that local currency contributions were also helpful in offsetting budget deficits and cutbacks in capital expenditures; minor implementation problems were experienced in the management of local funds.  Part III contains an indepth analysis of seven areas of structural and sectoral reform: trade policy and investment incentives, tax reform, government corporations and financial institutions, the financial and agricultural systems, public sector investment and decentralization, and transportation and transport infrastructure.  It is concluded that the policy reform efforts begun in the early and mid-1980's have been generally positive. The current challenge is to continue in the direction already established and to regain the momentum lost during the change in governments.  Part IV shapes the findings of Part III into a national reform agenda.  Highest priority is given to trade liberalization, currency devaluation, an improved tax system, deregulation of inter-island transportation, and increased maintenance of regional infrastructure; secondary emphasis is placed on privatization, financial sector efficiency, investment incentives, agricultural policy reform, and reducing economic favoritism (e.g., artificial monopolies, quotas on selected export products).  Specific recommendations are made for A.I.D.

"This evaluation of the Technology Transfer for Energy Management (TTEM) Project was undertaken in November 1988 by a two-person evaluation team who spent 3 weeks in Manila.  This project is one of a number of energy conservation projects under the direction of the Office of Energy Affairs of the Government of the Philippines.  It has two components, TA and demonstration projects.  The demonstration projects encouraged a demonstration loan fund (DLF) and the re-organization of energy functions within the government.  The project effectively started some 2.5 years after the signing of the original loan and grant agreement. Therefore, at the time of this mid-course evaluation, the project is getting off the ground in certain key respects. Specifically, at the time of evaluation no loans under the DLF have been closed and its potential for promoting energy conservation has not been established.  The evaluation does, however, analyze its demonstrated strengths and weaknesses.  It discusses the problems of its integration into an overall strategy for energy conservation in the Philippines, the direction versus independence it needs, the emphasis needed in planning and marketing versus engineering, and strengths and weaknesses of the U.S. contractor's support.

"Final evaluation of a project to increase rural income in Honduras by introducing improved technologies to rural households, enterprises, and small farms.  External evaluation covers the period 1979-88. By reaching 21,044 families and 447 small rural industries, the project far outstripped goals (revised in 1984) to assist 12,000 families and 110 businesses.  The project also reached intended target groups, including women, Protestants and Catholics, mestizos, and blacks.  Working with about 191 types of technologies and techniques, the project carried out 28,753 disseminations - 70% more than the 17,000 targeted.  The most successful technologies were veterinary services, domestic stoves, soil and water conservation techniques, metal silos, corn shellers, and innovations in cropping systems and cultivars.  The cost-benefit ratio of 1.39 for these technologies indicates that the project has been an economic success.  In addition, many of the technologies combated the frightening pace of deforestation in Honduras. Much of the project's impact from 1986 forward can be attributed to its adoption in 1984 of the farming systems research approach, which incorporates beneficiaries into the technology generation and extension process. The project's attachment to a semiautonomous institution (the Ministry of Economy's Centro de Desarrollo Industrial) provided only limited shelter from disruptive political interventions.  Management was often subjected to political pressures - either to replace competent technical staff with the politically favored or to ignore malfeasance among politically connected subordinates.  The job insecurity and stress associated with this political milieu resulted in high staff turnover, including 7 project managers in 9 years. Although the credit component was positive in terms of the number of persons served, it was also very expensive, comprising 32% of the operating budget in 1987 and 1988.  Furthermore, a significant number of loans delivered directly by the project were made to finance supplies for both agricultural production and small enterprises, which was clearly inappropriate for a technology dissemination project.  The project also used nongovernmental organizations and private banks as financial intermediaries. NGO performance was mixed.  Of the 10 NGO participants, 7 currently have active loan agreements, while default and administrative problems forced the project to renegotiate the debt with 2 and initiate legal proceedings against the third.  Although the total number of loans through private banks was quite small, results are encouraging since loans from such banks to small farmers are usually considered too small and risky to be profitable.","Selected bibliography: p. 83-84|Companion evaluation summary: PD-ABA-234","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-5315-I-00-8101-00","","12/1/1988 12:00:00 AM","","Rural development|Appropriate technology|Agricultural technology|Industrial technology|Technology transfer|Credit|Development project management|Beneficiary count","Honduras","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAZ146.pdf","3,420 KB","001036 - Research Triangle Institute (RTI)|003751 - Development Alternatives, Inc.

"Evaluates a project to provide inservice and pre-service training to rural health personnel in Malawi.  All health workers will receive training in family health, while specific programs will be implemented for enrolled community health nurses, health assistants, and medical assistants.  Mid-term evaluation covers the period 1984-9/88. Overall, the project has been carried out in an outstanding manner and has greatly pleased the Government of Malawi with its accomplishments.  The family health component, larger than all other components combined, has trained an impressive number of health workers and has met rapidly growing needs with a well-organized, comprehensive, and smoothly administered program. The project's pioneering effort in the enrolled community health nursing component has been very successful in the quality and quantity of nurses trained.  For both the family health and community nurse components, the project has made efforts to ensure high quality training and service by preparing protocols and conducting monitoring/supervisory visits to the graduates. The health assistant program has made substantial progress through a relatively stable group of trained tutors.  In-service training was provided to the 164 existing health assistants and pre-service training capacity was increased from 10-12 to 40 per year. On the negative side, there is serious doubt about the sustainability of the medical assistant training component. Inputs to this program lag behind all other components, and the turnover rate among tutors has been high.  The program is also fragmented, with preclinical training provided at the Lilongwe School of Health Sciences (LSHS) and clinical training in Blantyre.  There is also some evidence of instability at LSHS, the primary provider of pre-service training for the project. LSHS staff members are transferred to the school by the Ministry of Health for temporary assignments, and most feel a lack of career opportunity at the school. Major recommendations are to redesign and extend the project to 12/91 to permit training of health surveillance assistants and to improve the LSHS's curricula in other areas (i.e., clinical officers, pharmacy assistants, dental assistants) and to ensure sustainability of project components.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","AFR-0211-A-00-4036-00","","9/1/1988 12:00:00 AM","","Health professional education|Paramedical education|Primary health care|Family health care|Health occupations","Malawi","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDBBP143.pdf","1,191 KB","008573 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to upgrade primary health care, especially maternal/child health care and family planning (MCH/FP), in Swaziland. External mid-term evaluation covers 4/86-9/88. The project's design was broad, leading to a diffuse workload which is still being revised.  There is some uncertainty about the project's major objectives and its priorities at the regional and central level, and there are unmet expectations for support and commodities in several areas outside of the MCH/FP target population. Contractor performance by Management Sciences for Health has been satisfactory, given start-up delays and a shortage of Ministry of Health (MOH) counterparts.  Recent visits by a Senior Technical Officer have helped prioritize activities and delineate advisor roles.  The project should collaborate with the MOH to identify areas where decreased support is appropriate. The project, in collaboration with the MOH and other donors, has developed effective methods to screen high-risk infants and mothers, implemented a clinic health information system, improved supply management for drugs and contraceptives, and increased supervisory competence.  Several workplans (maternal health, immunization, diarrheal diseases, acute respiratory infection, and malaria) have been developed. Areas for attention now include strengthening of the referral system and evaluation of training and training materials.  Clinic management is helping to strengthen the clinic linkage to regional planners by generating data and monitoring supply needs.  An orientation manual has helped staff nurses make the transition from hospital to rural clinic, and a clinic reference manual is widely used. The MOH is decentralizing administrative and some planning and resource allocation functions to the four Regional Health Management Teams (RHMT's).  The project has produced guidelines for personnel management, financial management, and drug inventory control, and helped two of the four regions prepare annual budget requests.  Establishment of a management information system for RHMT's is a high priority. Training has been conducted at all levels.  Workshops have been used widely and successfully and have raised nursing morale and confidence, but little evaluation of post-training change has been done, a priority for the next year.  The evaluation recommends clinic-based learning with planning and training by regional public health nurses and supervisors. Also, health education has received insufficient attention at the clinic or community level. In conclusion, the project is progressing in its Phase 1 MCH/FP services and clinic management components.  Encouraging developments have taken place at the regional and central levels. If further institutionalization is achieved, the project will make an important contribution in enabling Swaziland to reach its health goals.

"Evaluates project to improve Cairo's wastewater system through rehabilitation of the primary collection system, training of operation and maintenance staff, and development of expansion plans.  Ex post external evaluation covers the period through 11/88. The project improved Cairo's wastewater system's operation and maintenance; since 1981, flooded areas have been reduced by nearly two-thirds.  Pump stations and sewer cleaning still have deficiencies but are more effective due to a combination of new equipment, training, preventive maintenance, and management advice.  The training component was effective but needs to be expanded (in regard to both technical and management training), since only 6%-7% of the work force has received training thus far. Effective operation of the General Organization for Sanitary Drainage (GOSD) is constrained by a lack of management autonomy and limited ability to raise revenues.  The GOSD's budget is also inadequate and the provision of foreign currency for spare parts is uncertain. After the project was terminated, a 15-month hiatus in initiating follow-on Work Order IVA caused some of the gains made by the project to be lost.  To reinstate the program to the level needed by 1991 (when clean water flowing into Cairo will exceed the new system's capacity) will require:  (1) restoring preventive maintenance checklists and regular evaluations and training personnel from GOSD's Technical Evaluation Department to undertake these responsibilities; (2) initiating an annual competition, with prizes, for best station, crew, performance; (3) building an urgently needed pump repair shop; (4) improving the supply of and procedures for obtaining spare parts; (5) developing safety policy and providing safety equipment and training (an urgent need); (6) educating the public to avoid misuse of sewers; (7) amending building regulatons in order to prevent building without sewers as well as the construction of buildings over manholes; (8) mapping the sewer system; and (9) establishing new maintenance depots.","WASH activity no. 452","Special Evaluation","Documents","DPE-5942-C-00-4085-00","","11/1/1988 12:00:00 AM","","Wastewater|Sewage system maintenance|Water pumps|Water sanitation","Egypt","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAZ167.pdf","1,583 KB","000333 - Camp Dresser and McKee, Inc.

"Evaluates CARE project to increase farmer income in six communities within Guatemala's Playa Grande Ixcan settlement area by stimulating the production and marketing of cardamom.  Final evaluation covers the period 1/84-3/88. As planned, the project installed 6 drying and sorting plants and provided training to 360 farmers in cardamom cultivation, harvesting, drying, and marketing, as well as to 13 technician-promoters from participating government agencies - the National Agrarian Transformation Institute (INTA) and the General Agricultural Services Directorate (DIGESA).  The target of 359 cardamom manzanas was actually exceeded, though with fewer than half the cardamom plantings planned.  The drying facilities have paid for themselves and made occasional profits, while also allowing growers a higher price than they would receive for undried cardamom.  The value of the driers is evident in that, when 2 of the 6 driers burned down, the communities immediately invested scarce funds and took out loans to get them running again. The production and marketing of cardamom resulting from these inputs were key factors in the increases in family income observed in the project communities.  Cardamom growing is not without risks, however. While production targets were nearly achieved for the 1986-87 harvest, drought during the following year caused a one-third decrease in production.  Moreover, cardamom prices are unstable and currently so low that production is less than profitable.  Nonetheless, cardamom remains an important cropping option since soil conditions will not allow for traditional annual crops such as corn and beans. The Village Agricultural Associations (ECA's) imposed on the communities by INTA have been a cause of discontent and need improvement, especially in financial management and community relations. The project also suffered from a lack of technical information on cardamom, since the responsible Guatemalan agency - the Agricultural Science and Technology Institute (ICTA) - had not developed an adequate information base.  Coordination and cooperation on the part of the agencies involved was also a problem, and it is doubtful that INTA and DIGESA are capable of sustaining the project or planning and implementing others. Several lessons were learned.  (1) It seems both better and feasible to select a small, motivated group for establishing an enterprise such as the cardamom driers rather than to work with the entire community. (2) Training of subsistence farmers with little formal education must be intensive, long-term, and practical.  (3) Crop diversification provides some protection against plummeting prices and drought.  (4) Planning can always be improved.  In this case, pre-project perusal of ICTA's workplans by CARE would have revealed that ICTA was committed to finishing studies on corn and beans before moving on to cardamom.","Attached to PD-AAZ-247|Spanish ed.: PD-ABB-021","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","3/1/1988 12:00:00 AM","","Farm income|Crop production|Cardamom|Crop driers|Farmer training|Farmer participation|Commercialization","Guatemala","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAZ247A.pdf","3,837 KB","","","008550 - USAID.

"Mid-term evaluation of a project to improve Third World capabilities for educational planning, assessment, and management.  External evaluation covers the period 1984-5/88. Training in data collection and the use of simple computer models has been the principal activity to improve institutional capacity in planning and analysis.  The impact of training is probably restricted by language and software problems.  Workshop instruction is in English, the language of the instructor, even though the English-speaking ability of the trainees is very limited.  Although most software is written in English, it does not appear cost-effective to teach English prior to training in computer use.  A second problem is the use of software which is not supported within the country. In the knowledge-building component, the project has invested substantial effort and funds in conducting sector assessments, but has neglected to provide for sufficient translation and distribution.  In general, distribution has been limited to key policymakers in the various government ministries and donor agencies.  This distribution has often been only in English (except for a translated executive summary), thereby limiting the potential audience to high-level officials with educational and travel experiences in the West.  The project has largely ignored its goals of disseminating the lessons learned in asssessment technology and developing an information network for education policy issues among other countries.  Policy-related R&D varies widely across countries.  In some (e.g., Botswana and Nepal), researchers are well qualified and expectations are high regarding the quality of the product.  In other countries, the investigators lack either the skills or enthusiasm for the specified research project.  The amount of TA to investigators and the interaction between investigators working on similar themes does not appear adequate to assure high-quality products. The project has also failed to systematically promote knowledge networks within countries and to develop a dialogue with the larger scholarly and practitioner community.  The project should also collaborate more with A.I.D.'s BRIDGES project, led by Harvard University, which aims to develop strategies for future education initiatives. The impact of project activities on efficiency and costs cannot yet be determined, though the familiarity of selected individuals in the education and planning ministries with the findings of the sector assessments suggests at least an indirect influence on educational policy and resource allocation.  However, some governments have announced educational policies which would not be supported by the sector assessments and have failed to back policies supported by the assessments.","Cover title: Final report, external mid-term evaluation : improving|the efficiency of education systems II|Delivery order no. 1|Cover date: July, 1988|Companion evaluation summary: PD-ABA-900|Project title: Improving the efficiency of educational systems II|(IEES II)","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-1109-I-00-7118-00","","3/1/1988 12:00:00 AM","","Institution building|Educational planning|Educational policy|Educational research","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAZ254.pdf","1,726 KB","000461 - Education Development Center, Inc.

"Final external evaluation (through 12/88) of a project to improve public sector skills training in Jamaica. The project has achieved a great deal.  The Human Employment and Resource Training (H.E.A.R.T.) academies are showpieces, and the Ministry of Education (MOE) has been greatly assisted by equipment and the renovation of facilities.  Instructors have been upgraded, although not all have remained in the system or even in the country. Competency-based education modules have been devised and partially implemented.  Proficiency tests for trade areas, evaluations, and coordinating activities have all been delayed, although some are planned or underway.  The most important accomplishment of the project, however, has been to galvanize public attention (and public resources) for skills upgrading.  Still, over the long term, meeting operating costs will be a major concern. Planned outputs relating to coordination, evaluation, and management/cost data have not been achieved.  The project design was based upon questionable assumptions and expectations.  The importance attached to the role of coordination, as opposed to, for example, instructor salaries, was debatable, as was the short (5-year) timeframe for a project of this size and complexity. Project implementation, divided among three agencies (the MOE, the Ministry of Youth and Community Development, and as coordinator and monitor, H.E.A.R.T), suffered from unclear lines of authority, and it was unrealistic to believe that a coordinating authority could be imposed on the existing training bureaucracy.  Thus H.E.A.R.T.'s shift in emphasis away from management and toward direct operation of the academies was only to be expected. The project's final impact in terms of facilitating skills upgrading, increased employment, and improved management prospects cannot be reliably determined due to lack of data. Data are also inadequate to separate adminsitrative costs from the costs of the academies, although it is seen that recurrent costs per trainee in the academies are over four times higher than MOE technical high schools. Future projects should include:  (1) a phased, experimental approach - the highly specialized and supply-side focus of this project led Jamaica along a particular, fairly costly path for skills development; (2) greater consideration of the absorptive capacity of participating agencies; (3) a large knowledge-development component - including controlled experimentation; (4) increased participation by the private sector; (5) separate funding for participating agencies; and (6) greater use of subcontracting among public agencies. A 1-year extension, largely for administrative reasons, is recommended.","Cover title: Final report for delivery order no. three under|contract no.

"PACR of a project (7/82-9/88) to establish the Caribbean Agricultural Trading Company (CATCO) as a vehicle for opening new market channels in the Eastern Caribbean and promoting the production and consumption of regionally produced agricultural commodities. The project paper was overly optimistic and did not anticipate the considerable developmental costs required to improve the intermittent supply and poor quality of produce in the region. As a result, CATCO's gross income from sales in 1987 was about $443,000, compared with the predicted amount of $31.5 million.  A considerable amount was spent on extension work with small farmers, since existing extension and research services lacked the expected capacity to provide improved technology and information.  Additional false assumptions were that Trinidad and Tobago markets would be more open and that the demand for bananas would be greater.  Furthermore, CATCO was unable to profitably market farm inputs as originally planned because of existing arrangements held by other trading companies. CATCO's situation began to improve markedly in 1985 under new management by FINTRAC Consultants.  By seeking extra-regional and niche markets, FINTRAC was able to stem increasing losses and develop a favorable reputation in the European market.  Export earnings and the volume of produce traded increased by more than 8 times since 1984, and the compound annual rate of sales growth for FY87-FY89 was about 60%. Nonetheless, because of the level of development still required to elicit larger volumes of produce, the company continues to have difficulty in meeting the burden of the USAID loan, and must borrow at commercial rates to pay it off. Overall, project impact has been positive.  CATCO has become the only truly regional agricultural trading company in the Eastern Caribbean and has demonstrated that the successful export of agricultural produce in the region requires that the trader be involved in applying recommended production packages, as well as in the processes of harvesting, packing, and shipping.  The company has thus had an important demonstration effect at a time when Eastern Caribbean governments have been seized by the need for agricultural diversification away from bananas. The most important lesson learned is that financial projections based on assumed availability of a tradeable volume of agricultural produce is extremely important for any project of this type.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1988 12:00:00 AM","","Institution building|International trade promotion organizations|Agricultural markets|Agricultural product marketing|Exports","Eastern Caribbean","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAZ302.pdf","284 KB","001757 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (1985-1988) to assist Sri Lanka's Anti-Malaria Campaign (AMC) in reducing the incidence of malaria and to institutionalize an integrated vector control program. Overall, the project was a failure.  Sri Lanka's 1987 malaria count was the worst in 30 years and the current situation is the worst in South and Southeast Asia.  While this was due partly to migration to the Mahaweli irrigation area, where malaria incidence is high, and partly to severe security problems in some regions, it is also a result of the AMC's lack of strong leadership and the resistance of AMC senior staff to alternative, integrated control methods.  Instead, the AMC concentrated on a traditional house spraying program (conducted seasonally in all medium-risk regions and quarterly in high-risk areas), which proved ineffective due to poor supervision of field offices.  An epidemiological surveillance system is operating, but it relies on data up to 2 months old due to logistic problems, including the lack of radio links between the AMC and its field offices. The project's multi-media campaign was hampered by the lack of an information center for distributing literature and posters to schools and the general public. As a result, many house owners resisted spraying activities. The project failed to achieve significant progress in planning and management.  This was due in part to the AMC's refusal to decentralize and delegate more authority to the AMC regions, its inability to implement action plans, and its underutilization of the project-supplied computer.  Although several hundred AMC employees were trained under the project, this component was inadequate due to the lack of qualified staff at the national training center and the termination of the training advisory committee formed early in the project. It is recommended that the Ministry of Health take a more active, positive, and emphatic role in AMC activities and support AMC management in the use of new methodologies introduced by the project.  Increased attention should also be given to decentralizing malaria control to the provincial and community levels.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","12/1/1988 12:00:00 AM","","Malaria|Morbidity|Epidemiology|Disease prevention and control|Disease vectors|Parasitic diseases","Sri Lanka","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAZ332.pdf","467 KB","008606 - USAID.

The review showed that A.I.D.'s IP projects have overwhelmingly returned very poor results in terms of levels of investment and business ventures and jobs created; they have also been very cost-ineffective. Only one project - Investment and Export Promotion in Costa Rica - was deemed successful, whereas 11 were rated as very poor or as failures; these included 4 projects in Latin America (Private Sector Productivity in Costa Rica, along with projects in El Salvador, Honduras, and the West Indies/Eastern Caribbean), 6 in Asia and the Near East (3 projects in Egypt and 1 each in Indonesia, Sri Lanka, and Thailand), and 1 in Africa.  Data were lacking on projects in Belize, the Dominican Republic, Haiti, and Panama. The overriding and dominant factor dictating success or failure was found to be a good investment climate - something lacking in most developing countries.  Other key factors include the need for:  an accomplished business/marketing organization; an experienced, bilingual, mostly indigenous staff; a clear, well-planned, and well-executed IP plan; and an overseas promotional campaign.  The review also showed IP to be a long-haul effort, with results likely to show up only after 1.5 to 2 years of hard work. It is recommended that A.I.D. support IP projects only in developing countries with a good investment climate; these countries include Thailand, Indonesia, India, and Costa Rica, followed by Guatemala, Ecuador, the Dominican Republic, and the Philippines.  While countries such as Pakistan, Egypt, Jordan, Kenya, and the Ivory Coast will occasionally offer a viable investment opportunity, a multimillion dollar IP project in these countries is a waste of money.  It is noted further that no developing country has enough viable potential business ventures to allow a promotion firm to make enough money from fees to cover costs.  Nor are developing country governments likely to take up the funding of IP projects where A.I.D. leaves off.  Other recommendations are to:  (1) dedicate high cost networking IP projects solely to IP and have them operated by a private firm; (2) seek ways to cut costs; (3) and rigorously evaluate projects after 1.5-2 years and terminate those lacking promise.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1988 12:00:00 AM","","Investment promotion|Investment environment|Return on investments|Foreign investment","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAZ340.pdf","2,031 KB","000743 - Arthur D.

"Evaluates 10 years of research and training under A.I.D.'s Small Ruminant Collaborative Research Support Project. The following major accomplishments of the project have immediate implications for small ruminant production in developing countries. (1) Substantial progress has been made in genetic control of prolificacy. (2) The identification of the comparative and interactive grazing behavior of sheep, alpacas, and llamas on Peruvian highland ranges is a major step toward sustainable production systems. (3) The identification and control of caprine arthritis encephalitis viral infection in Kenya, Peru, and elsewhere could represent a worldwide savings of US$20 million. (4) The upgrading of Criolla sheep in Peru is expected to increase the production of carcass meat by 8,000 MT and grease wool by about 20 million kg per year. (5) The development and placement of dual-purpose goats in Kenya with the corresponding increase in forage production should increase the income of small farmers by an estimated US$52 per ha. (6) The identification of nutritional myopathy among sheep in Morocco, a condition previously unrecognized in this region, was determined to be caused by a dietary deficiency of selenium. (7) Research in Indonesia revealed that unsupplemented tropical grasses impose severe restrictions on the growth and reproduction of Javanese Thin Tail sheep and the growth of Kacang goats is similarly affected. (8) In Brazil, researchers found that thinning the tree canopy resulted in significantly more forage biomass produced beneath the trees. (9) Research in Peru revealed that a large proportion of the livestock produced by highland peasant communities is raised in agropastoral communities and not exclusively by pastoral communities as had been previously thought. Furthermore, the research established that these communities value livestock more for the dung they provide for fertilizers than for their meat, fiber, or cash value. (10) Increased alpaca fiber yields in Peru from 6-17 pounds per animal should add incomes of US$40-$50 per animal. (11) The development and validation of computer simulation models for sheep and goats should have wide application and use for future researchers. (12) Training has been highly successful and has resulted in a long-term contribution to both host countries and U.S. institutions. (13) The collaborative mode has been effective in multiplying the impact of A.I.D. funds through matching contributions from U.S. and host country institutions.

"Evaluation of a project to increase the capability of Zaire's Department of Agriculture to conduct farming systems research (FSR) and crop improvement research and to provide extension services.  External evaluation covers the period 9/83-12/88. Crop research has made excellent progress.  Several improved varieties have been distributed, including more than 10,000 kg of maize seed and an average of 245,000 m of cassava cuttings each year from 1986 to 1988.  A national food crops research institution for cassava, maize, and grain legumes is in place and functioning.  Training of Zairian personnel will be completed by the PACD and the concept and quality of the training program are good; synchronization of training and TA has not occurred, however.  FSR and outreach are underway, although these components have not been integrated with crop improvement research and accomplishments have been disappointing.  TA provided by the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) has been uneven, of poor quality, and adversely affected by IITA's weak leadership. The project's major handicap is the lack of vehicles, equipment, and supplies.  Lack of transport for on-farm trials, village-level studies, etc. seriously hampers FSR, outreach, and crop research.  The project also suffers from a shortage of local currency resources and is totally dependent on USAID/Z for local costs.  No prospect exists for the program to become self-sustaining in the next five years.  It is thus recommended that the three national research programs be reduced to two - cassava and maize - and that relocation of major research facilities be considered.  Also, the maize program is threatened by its shaky hold on its facilities at Kisanga.  It is important that the program be assured a secure footing at that location. Several lessons were learned.  (1) Project objectives should be internally consistent.  This project suffers from having three distinct objectives.  (2) USAID should avoid detailed involvement in project management and administration.  (3) International agricultural research centers - in this project, IITA, which possesses no comparative advantage in management and outreach - should be retained only with a clear and precise understanding of what they are best qualified to do. (4) Integration of FSR and outreach with crop improvement research requires agreement on what FSR is and an extended learning process.","Companion project evaluation summary: PD-ABA-202","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","12/1/1988 12:00:00 AM","","Farming systems research|Maize|Cassava|Varietal research|Agricultural extension","Congo DR","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAZ382.pdf","13,658 KB","001335 - Chemonics International Consulting Div.","","008626 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of the A/NE Bureau's Regional Science and Technology Information Transfer Project, implemented by the U.S. National Technical Information Service (NTIS) from end-1983 to 9/87. The project sought to expand the existing technical information (TI) network in Tunisia and initiate activities in 9 additional Near East countries.  Evaluation focused on 3 countries:  Morocco, Tunisia, and Egypt. Project effectiveness was undermined by difficulties in identifying and recruiting host country cooperating agencies. Two countries, Lebanon and Oman, were dropped at the request of their USAID's.  The lengthy time period required to obtain agreements with counterpart institutions reduced the time available for institution building.  Obstacles to links between NTIS and local organizatlons included a book monopoly (Tunisia), discomfort with idea of selling U.S. government reports (Tunisia and Morocco), and competition from TI services supported by other A.I.D. projects (Egypt).  Use of a Cyprus-based consulting firm with branch offices in several Near East countries, was only partially successful in circumventing these difficulties. Some progress was made in organizational development.  In Egypt and Morocco, collaborating organizations were strengthened via in-country seminars.  In Egypt, the cooperating agency expanded its microfiche collection by thousands of documents, but was unable to link its operations with USAID/Cairo-supported TI services. In Morocco, considerable progress was made at the policy level.  The impact of training in Jordan and Cyprus was diminished by staff turnover in the local organizations.  In Tunisia, institutional impact was minimal as the Regional Coordinator, based in that country, did not transfer marketing skills to counterparts. Sales data for Tunisia, Morocco, and Egypt provided further evidence of the project's partial impact and effectiveness. Generally high sales in Tunisia, estimated to exceed 500 documents annually in the last year of the project, attributed to the active campaign of the Regional Coordinator, suggest that aggressive marketing can generate demand for NTIS documents in at least some Near East countries.  Low sales in Morocco and Egypt, averaging less than 75 documents annually, were due to a combination of factors.  In Morocco, promotion efforts were limited almost exclusively to conference presentations and distribution of brochures. In Egypt, a principal Mission concern was that concurrent regional and Mission-funded TI projects may give confusing signals to the Egyptian Government regarding U.S. TI policy.  In addition, the market for TI services was usurped by the larger, Mission-funded project supporting the Egyptian National Science and Technical Information Network. Major assumptions of the project that were questioned by the evaluation included:  the feasibility of cooperating agencies operating on a self-sustaining basis without diversifying services to include popular trade publications, academic journals, and other products; and selection of project countries, recruitment of counterpart institutions, and selection of marketing approaches without conducting country needs assessments.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","3/1/1988 12:00:00 AM","","Technical information|Scientific information|Information services|Technical publications|Technology transfer","Middle East|Egypt|Tunisia|Morocco","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAZ542.pdf","1,464 KB","003970 - Management Systems International, Inc.

"PACR of a project (7/88-12/88) to identify and spray areas of major locust infestations as part of an international donor program to protect agricultural crops and reduce locust populations in eastern Chad. The project provided the aerial services of a survey helicopter, 30,000 liters of pesticide, satellite imagery and other support costs, and additional aircraft for survey and aerial spraying. The arrival of two Turbo Thrush planes at the project site was delayed for weeks by necessary repairs and an erroneous report of security problems in Chad. Helicopter activities were delayed by changes in personnel, while the delivery of pesticide took 7 weeks longer than if it had been sent prior to the rainy season. These delays, however, had no adverse affect on the program since the locust situation never developed to the expected catastrophic levels due to unusually heavy rains.  No major infestations were identified that would have warranted the use of the high-capacity spraying capabilities of the Turbo Thrush planes.  Instead, these planes were used to ferry fuel for the survey helicopter and Pawnee spray plane funded by the French Assistance Program in West Africa (FAC), allowing them to survey an extensive area and spray 25,000 ha in the Ouaddai and Biltine Prefectures.  One of the Turbo Thrush planes also sprayed about 600 ha in 5 different patches in the Biltine Prefecture because the area was too distant for the Pawnee plane.  The helicopter was used to conduct a number of aerial surveys of locust populations and was then sent to provide similar assistance in Mauritania. Several lessons were learned.  (1) Funds should be made available early in the season to enable timely contracting for services and procurement of commodities.  (2) Alternatives to emergency pest control programs (e.g., provision of Title II cereals to cover crop losses) should be considered.  (3) It is essential that emergency programs be vertically integrated.  (4) Farmers are not prepared to use pesticides for locust control and instead use them to control other pests on vegetable crops.  (5) Farmers in eastern Chad actively use traditional techniques to control locust larvae.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","12/1/1988 12:00:00 AM","","Locusts|Pest control|Pesticide spraying|Crop pests|Aircraft|Helicopters|Aerial surveys","Chad","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAZ648.pdf","790 KB","008528 - USAID.

"Interim evaluation of a program to provide U.S. academic and technical training to participants from the Caribbean.  External evaluation, based in part on exit evaluations of the program by short-term trainees, covers the period 2/86-12/87. A total of 662 trainees have initiated or completed programs in the United States.  Of these, 80% have been short-term (about a month on average) and 20% long-term; most of the long-term training has been provided on the undergraduate level, as planned. Two targeted populations - women and the economically disadvantaged - are being reached in expected proportions (53% and 70% respectively).  A total of 64% of the trainees are teachers, reflecting the emphasis on education in the Jamaica and RDO/C Missions.  Excluding the Haitians, almost three-fourths of the trainees are from the public sector.  Of the Haitians selected, almost three-fourths are students or recent graduates. All trainees have received predeparture preparation consisting of English-language training when necessary and an orientation to U.S. culture.  However, only about half of short-term trainees felt prepared for the training.  In general, 42% of these trainees found the training to be better than expected, while only 5% reported it to be below expectations.  Experiences outside the classroom varied greatly.  More than half had visited or lived with U.S. families, and 38% had attended civic activities. Some respondents reported a much increased understanding of U.S. families (35%), citizens (43%), and lifestyles (52%); fewer reported that their understanding of U.S. politics (16%) and government (19%) was much increased. The Missions' performance in recruiting, screening, and selecting trainess has been mixed.  USAID/Dominican Republic and USAID/Haiti have developed sound procedures for these tasks (though USAID/H has not always followed these procedures in practice). USAID/H and USAID/Jamaica have not adequately documented their procedures, while RDO/C has, until recently, used procedures leaving it with limited authority over selection.

"Since the mid-1970's, A.I.D. has supported several co-financing projects with U.S. and indigenous PVO's (IPVO's) in the Philippines and Indonesia.  These projects have shown that IPVO's are no longer passive recipients of assistance but true collaborators of A.I.D. and U.S. PVO's.  In fact, established IPVO's now provide the only affordable means of reaching smaller, newly formed, local organizations in isolated and widely dispersed areas.  In addition, by helping their clients participate in their own development the IPVO's have written a success story in ""democratization"" that should be heard and understood by the U.S. Congress and the American people.  A key policy implication is that A.I.D. should accord the IPVO's greater responsibility, especially in regard to financial management.  At the same time, A.I.D. should only attempt to replicate the Indonesia and Philippine co-financing program after thoroughly analyzing the new setting.  The co-financing projects have also shown that, as development practitioners, IPVO's are as good as and often better than the U.S. PVO's now serving them, and know more about the local culture and government sensitivities than do the U.S. PVO's.  And the annual cost of an expatriate TA consultant - $100,000 - could pay the salaries of several local development workers.  While not unappreciative of past assistance, IPVO's now desire to specify the help they need from their U.S. counterparts and to share with them the knowledge they have themselves acquired of the development field.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","12/1/1988 12:00:00 AM","","Co-financing|Development assistance|Development cooperation|Institution building|Indigenization|Local groups|Private voluntary organizations|Development strategies|Democratization","Indonesia|Philippines","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNABD340.pdf","2,674 KB","","","004200 - USAID.

"PACR of a multi-donor project (8/82-8/88) to establish a resident mission in Antigua to help Eastern Caribbean countries formulate and execute public sector programs, update data bases, and obtain external financial and technical assistance. The project made a strong contribution to developing effective indigenous analytical and planning capacity, but its sustainability without direct external support is questionable. During the first phase of the project (8/82-12/86), RDO/C met its project obligations via a grant to the UN Development Program (UNDP) to provide short-term TA in support of the resident mission.  In Phase II, A.I.D. assistance was extended in order to transfer project functions to the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States/Economic Affairs Secretariat (OECS/EAS) and other regional institutions, specifically, by providing the EAS with funds to hire a macroeconomic advisor and a counterpart, provide secretarial support to the advisor, and carry out short-term studies and other TA activities.  After a year of vacillation, the EAS hired a macroeconomic advisor in 6/87 for a 2-year contract.  However, by this time the EAS director had taken another position.  During the prolonged period before a replacement was identified, the EAS drifted and the economic advisor left after only one year.  As a result, RDO/C advanced the PACD 4 months and deobligated the $173,000 remaining in the project. Project experience underscores the critical importance of effective and positive EAS leadership and management in order to avoid wasting expensive and scarce technical talent.  It also underscores the potential for drift and atrophy in key regional development organizations when narrower political concerns are allowed to weigh too heavily in determining the direction and staffing of such organizations.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","8/1/1988 12:00:00 AM","","Economic planning|Institution building|Financing|Regional development|Development organizations|Project sustainability","Eastern Caribbean|Antigua and Barbuda","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAZ902.pdf","65 KB","001757 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (1982-1987) to establish a maternal child health/family planning clinic in Khartoum, Sudan.  The Sudan Fertility Care Association (SFCA) was the implementing agency. Due to a political dispute over who was the correct official to sign the grant agreement (a matter that should have been clarified at the outset), the actual opening of the clinic was delayed until 7/86. During the delay, staff received salaries without having to work; this did not encourage an expeditious resolution of the problem.  Despite the delay, the SFCA's part-time volunteer staff developed the clinic into an established institution with a full-time clinical and administrative staff providing service delivery, educational, and training functions. Good progress was made in many activities.  The IEC, training, and administrative components were generally successful, although the failure of the evaluation component to materialize makes exact quantification of clinic achievements impossible. Training of physicians, nurses, and staff exceeded target.  An estimated 70% of married women of childbearing age were reached by the IEC campaign against a target of 90% despite logistic difficulties caused by Sudan's political situation.  All told, the clinic serves an estimated 31,000 people a year.  However, only 28% of these receive family planning services.  As a result, contraceptive prevalence has not grown as rapidily as expected: despite the city's increasing population, less than a quarter of the target of 165,000 woman-years of contraception was provided. Also on the negative side, the clinic is generating only 60% of its own revenues because it is providing more free services than initially expected.  It is recommended that the clinic establish a sliding fee scale. The SFCA added an administration building to the project facility without prior authorization, causing considerable delay in closing down the project.  In retrospect it was decided to authorize the building since there was virtually no possibility to recover the funds.  The clinic's expensive surgical contraception equipment and training were unused due to lack of public interest.  The demand for this service should have been determined before proceeding with the venture.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1988 12:00:00 AM","","Maternal child health care|Family planning clinics","Sudan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABA057.pdf","182 KB","008607 - USAID.

"Final Mission Report on the Swaziland component of Southern Africa Manpower Development Program (1978-84). 1. Summary:  This project provided GOS organizational units with OPEX staff who maintained high-level operational efficiency in these units while counterparts were being trained to assume or resume responsibilities.  Several Opexers and participants have been transferred to the Swaziland Manpower Development Project (SWAMDP) (645-0218) and the remaining project funds have been deobligated and reobligated into SWAMDP and AFGRAD.  Swazi nationals in positions of responsibility with substantive inputs into the planning, design and implementation of the GOS's development programs were sent for advanced training. 2. Status of Completion:  The project purpose was to reduce critical personnel constraints, mainly in the fields selected by U.S. Congressional mandate, while strengthening the public sector's capability to meet the development needs of the country. A total of 300 long- and short-term participants have been trained in the U.S., but these have not replaced U.S.-funded personnel as was expected.  The planned output of some 420 nationals being trained in approximately 13 in-country training programs and courses was cancelled.  Of the 6 ""spin-off"" donor-supported projects estimated as a project output, the Swaziland Manpower Development Project has been the only direct ""spin-off.""  A marked improvement in efficiency has been observed in departments where OPEXers are or have been working. 3. Accomplishments in Terms of Project Purpose:  During the life of the project, over 200 participants were trained and are now working in GOS positions that influence policy and development issues.  Most of the staff of the GOS Tax Commission, including the Assistant Commissioner of Taxes and the Principal Tax Inspector, were project participants.  These former participants are credited with influencing the GOS decision to expand its revenue base and improve tax collection procedures.  A new sales tax was introduced in 1984 and since has increased revenue significantly.  Most of the key staff at the Central Statistical Office, including the Chief Statistician, are former participants.  Two of the major financial institutions in the country have former participants in key administrative positions:  both the General Manager of the Swaziland Development and Savings Bank and the Head of Research at the Central Bank of Swaziland are former participants who received the Master's in Economics under this project.  The 1986 policy decision by the GOS to delink its currency from the Rand Monetary Area (RMA) was made easier by having trained individuals who could present arguments based on sound economic reasoning. In the Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives (MOAC), the Director of Community Development completed a Masters' program under this project and is currently responsible for liaison between the various ministries and the traditional sector government. In the education sector, this project has provided degree programs and upgrading of degree status to members of the faculty of the University of Swaziland.

"PACR of a subproject (1986-1988) to test the feasibility of producing captive Mithrax crab and spiny lobster in Antigua and to establish a crab mariculture research facility at Grand Turk. The Antigua component demonstrated the difficulty of developing commercial production systems for a species (i.e., the Mithrax crab) without well-defined markets or extensive knowledge of the animal's life cycle and environmental requirements. Indications are that Mithrax crab could not be grown in captivity without considerable additional research.  On the other hand, there were positive recommendations for the potential of spiny lobster.  While ongoing research at the research facility established on Grand Turk did not advance as expected, the center has potential to become an important component of regional mariculture research in the Caribbean. Unfortunately, however, the Smithsonian Institution, the primary implementing agency, has no guarantee that funds will be available to sustain the center. Three major lessons were learned.  (1) Economic and market analyses should be early integral parts of research in developing commercial production systems for maricultural or aquacultural products.  (2) Grants to other U.S. government institutions (e.g., the Smithsonian) should be periodically reviewed to insure adequate design and progress. (3) Prior to funding cutting-edge research, A.I.D. should subject research proposals to peer review.","Evaluation period: Jul 1986-Jul 1988","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","7/1/1988 12:00:00 AM","","Aquaculture|Shellfish|Crabs|Lobsters","Eastern Caribbean|Antigua and Barbuda|Turks and Caicos Islands","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABA313.pdf","70 KB","000113 - USAID.

"Evaluates the impact of three renewable energy technology (RET) projects:  (1) Low-Cost Energy Technology (9365701 -- 1979-87), implemented by Volunteers In Technical Assistance (VITA); (2) Small Decentralized Hydropower (SDH) (9365715 -- 1980-1987), implemented by the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association (NRECA); and (3) Energy Technical Service Support (9365702 -- 1978-88), implemented mainly by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). VITA focused on demonstrating wind energy systems, e.g., in Honduras, and on developing more efficient woodstoves, by 1983 helping deliver improved woodstoves to over 100,000 people in 40 countries, including, notably, drought-stricken Burkina Faso. VITA also:  developed a biomass stove and tested it in 17 countries; designed a simple and easily maintained dug-well handpump for Thailand; produced numerous publications as part of its international alternative energy network; and implemented a small grants program for small-scale energy projects. Despite changing emphases, NRECA's SDH program fielded 30 TA teams which helped 20 developing countries develop their SDH potential.  NRECA also convened 4 international conferences and 2 seminars on SDH issues; assembled a library of over 4,000 references and 2,000 slides of SDH installations worldwide; and established a talent bank of 200 SDH specialists.  The project's greatest success lay in strengthening the SDH capabilities both of developing countries, e.g., Madagascar and Thailand, and of NRECA itself, as evidenced by the latter's establishment, on the basis of project success, of an International Foundation to support SDH and related efforts overseas.  On the negative side, NRECA failed to complete the SDH Economics Handbooks due to a depletion in funds -- a fact which indicates A.I.D.'s need to leverage available funds more wisely. Project -5702 provided TA to conventional and especially to RET technologies.  A decline, beginning in the mid-1980's, in both Development Assistance funding and project activity led to the project's termination in 1988 after 2 years of non-use. Reasons for this demise included a breakdown in cooperation between A.I.D. and the DOE as a result of staff and management changes; policy shifts; and A.I.D.'s increasing use of the Economic Support Fund to finance energy projects.  While it lasted, however, the project provided important assistance to A.I.D./W, Missions, and developing country governments; facilitated joint participation in multilateral activities; promoted policy reform through sector evaluations; and developed a body of experienced managers for A.I.D.'s energy portfolio. Despite their technological and methodological differences, the projects showed striking similarities.  This was especially true of the VITA and NRECA projects, in which A.I.D. used cooperative agreements with experienced private, non-profit organizations to further its own aims while strengthening grantee institutional capacity.  Both projects demonstrated the effectiveness of RET's (hydro, solar, wind, and some biomass) for daily application -- though only those which can compete in the market place in terms of cost, efficiency, and reliability can succeed in the long- term.","Companion PES's: PD-ABA-383 and PD-ABA-384|Delivery order 2","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-5730-I-00-7052-00|DHR-5730-O-00-8025-00","","11/1/1988 12:00:00 AM","","Renewable energy resources|Small scale energy systems|Technological development|Technology transfer|Hydroelectric power|Rural development|Decentralization|Energy technology","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABA385.pdf","1,750 KB","004935 - TEM Associates, Inc.","","000184 - USAID.

"Mid-term evaluation of the Malaria and Essential Drugs Project in Central America.  The evaluation covers the period through 1988 and covers the project's essential drugs component. The project has been implemented with a high degree of effectiveness, with all annually planned training courses completed and prototype systems of drug utilization well developed, particularly in university hospitals and social security institutes. Essential drugs programs have been established or strengthened throughout the subregion, and improvements in drug resource management have occurred in many institutions.  Although emphasis has been on the technical- scientific subsystem, the operational subsystem will receive more attention during the fourth year. The subregional approach has been effective in establishing exchanges of information and stimulating ideas among key professionals.  Moreover, the approach has led to significant utilization of local professionals in project activities, and allowed the project to take advantage of economies of scale in the production of educational materials, the use of TA consultancies, etc. As a relatively new effort, the project has a tendency towards a multiplicity of activities.  It has also encountered some problems in the drug price information exchange network and the publication of guidelines for warehouses planning, design, and construction. A major lesson learned is that the Central American subregion has a limited number of trained persons in the pharmaceutical field and thus a limited capacity to absorb technical cooperation. There is also a limited capacity in the subregion to train professionals in essential drugs, mandating a need for swift project intervention in providing such training.  Continued close and active project management is essential to create the conditions for appropriate technical activities to be developed. Project start-up was slower than expected because of the different stages of development in each participating country.  A four-year project does not necessarily translate into four years of activities in all countries. A four year project extension is recommended.  Emphasis should be placed on, inter alia, greater subregional exchange of information and continuing education for health workers involved in essential drugs programs. Reports on national-level programs in Belize, Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador, Costa Rica, and Panama are included in the evaluation.","Companion evaluation: PD-ABA-790","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1988 12:00:00 AM","","Pharmaceuticals|Medical education|Health finance|Hospitals","Central America|Belize|Honduras|Guatemala|El Salvador|Costa Rica|Panama","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABA789.pdf","720 KB","001373 - USAID.

"Mid-term evaluation of the Malaria and Essential Drugs Project in Central America.  The evaluation covers the period 3/85-2/88 and focuses on the malaria component, which aims to strengthen malaria programs and institutionalize a training and research program for vector-borne diseases. Malaria programs in the region have been strengthened through the establishment of effective training and education programs at various levels, and progress has been made in integrating malaria control with general health services.  The project's subregional focus has enhanced local problemsolving capacity, improved institutional communication and coordination, and taken advantage of economies of scale, while enhancing program continuity and momentum.  The malaria effort complements several related bilateral and multilateral projects and has contributed to a high level of cooperation among funding and operating agencies. Despite these achievements, much remains to be accomplished.  In addition to the current stress on technical topics, training in health planning, administration, and management continues to be a high priority, and steps should be taken to further integrate malaria activities and other health services.  Subregional and national research activities have focused on key topics, but the subregional research is behind schedule and local research capacity is limited.  While the project is attempting to enhance research capacity through postgraduate and other types of education, this is a slow process. One of the most important lessons learned is that substantive organizational changes (in this case from eradication to control and from a vertical to an integrated program) require years of training, TA, and other support activities to ensure a successful transition. Therefore, it is recommended that the component be extended beyond the 3/89 deadline. Reports on malaria activities in each of the participating countries - Belize, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Costa Rica, and Panama - are included in the evaluation.","Companion evaluation: PD-ABA-789","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","3/1/1988 12:00:00 AM","","Malaria|Disease vectors|Disease prevention and control|Regional development","Central America|Belize|Guatemala|El Salvador|Honduras|Costa Rica|Panama","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABA790.pdf","688 KB","001373 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of a project to assist women involved in small and micro businesses in Costa Rica and Honduras through training, credit, and TA.  Overseas Education Fund/International (OEF/I) implemented the project.  The evaluation covers the period 3/85- 1988. Of the women assisted, slightly fewer than half maintained or improved their enterprises, while the others are experiencing serious problems or have ceased activity.  Costa Rican beneficiaries showed more promise than those in Honduras, largely due to Costa Rica's more favorable economic and institutional environment.  Training and loan administration costs are excessively high -- $4,070 per beneficiary trained and $21 per dollar lent -- and OEF/I spent more than half of grant funds on its Washington office, a higher percentage of non-local charges than other small enterprise PVO's in Costa Rica and Honduras. Credit resources were underutilized, with less than half of available funds disbursed, and training and credit were not well integrated, since only 19% of trainees obtained a loan.  The project also failed to provide adequate technical support to field activities. Despite these weaknesses, it is recommended that the project receive funding for an additional three years, the ordinary length of time required for establishing such programs.  The project did make noteworthy accomplishments, including an increased institutional capability in small enterprise development at OEF/I, and the publication of two monographs about feasibility study and marketing strategy. Moreover, the project fills several institutional gaps.  For women it is one of the few, if not the only, sources of credit and extension, as well as assistance in integrating their family and economic roles.  It is also one of the few providers of rural nonagricultural credit and business support services for subsistence producers.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","4/1/1988 12:00:00 AM","","Credit|Women in development|Entrepreneurs|Small scale enterprises|Business support services","Costa Rica|Honduras","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABA936.pdf","1,037 KB","","","002290 - USAID.

"Mid-term evaluation of a project to strengthen the Government of Bolivia's policy analysis capability by establishing an Economic Policy Analysis Unit (UDAPE).  The evaluation covers the period 4/86-1988. At this point, UDAPE provides a series of policy inputs to the Government of Bolivia:  specific operational support for some ministries, advice to ministries on technical issues and policy alternatives, and longer-term research on policy issues.  The development of an active analytical team at UDAPE has been a major project success.  While there has been high turnover among UDAPE analysts, the new staff are very experienced and capable; even a strong critic of UDAPE gave them generally high marks. UDAPE's ability to operate successfully under Bolivia's difficult political conditions is evident in the number of organizations asking for assistance.  There are some internal management problems, however -- especially the uncertain stability of UDAPE's organizational structure and the inadequate monitoring of some activities -- which indicate the need for a new administrative structure for the Unit. UDAPE is clearly an important factor in Bolivia's policy process. Many of the Unit's large quantity of papers have had a direct effect on particular policy initiatives.  However, UDAPE studies have declined both in quantity (from 148 in 1986-87 to 103 in 1987-88) and in depth (analytical studies dropped from 74 to 46). There is some concern that the Unit's work has become too reactive and short-term, since the share of studies in direct response to external requests has risen from 35% to 62%.  It is recommended that UDAPE undertake longer-term research planning and increase emphasis on analytical, longer-term studies of an applied research nature.  The Unit should also expand its distribution list to facilitate a wider exchange of ideas. Key to UDAPE's future in regard to both internal management and policy influence will be the effectiveness of the recently reactivated Board of Directors.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","7/1/1988 12:00:00 AM","","Policy analysis|Government policy|Political aspects|Policy making|Government departments|Economic analysis","Bolivia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABA974.pdf","862 KB","008515 - USAID.

"Evaluates the Salvadoran Foundation for Economic and Social Development (FUSADES), a private, nonprofit organization which was established in 1983 by more than 100 Salvadoran businesspersons as a research center and a broker of services for private businesses and private sector sponsors of social development. FUSADES is the implementing agency for eight A.I.D. projects: (1) 519-0265, Agricultural Diversification and Agrarian Reform Sector Support; (2) -0287, Industrial Stabilization and Recovery; (3) -0303, Water Management; (4) -0304, Urban Small Business; (5) -0316, Association Strengthening Activities; (6) -0327, Agribusiness Development; (7) -0336, Private Sector Initiatives; (8) -0323 Free Zone Development.  As of 9/88, a total of $78.7 million has been authorized for these eight projects. This evaluation, however, focuses not on A.I.D.-supported projects, but on FUSADES programs (usually there is not a one- to-one project-program correspondence).  The programs reviewed are:  (1) FORTAS (Association Strengthening Activities); (2) DEES (Economic and Social Studies Department); (3) FIDEX (Development of Assembly Industries for Export); (4) PRIDEX (Promotion of Investments and Export Diversification); (5) DIVAGRO (Agricultural Diversification); and (6) PROPEMI (Promotion of Small and Micro Enterprises). The evaluation finds that generally, FUSADES has performed well. Programs such as PROPEMI have contributed to improved private- public sector relationships.  Within 5 years, FUSADES has been able to present draft legislation to the Government and see it approved.  It has presented an economic rehabilitation strategy to the government and seen much of it become policy. FUSADES has also fostered social consciousness in the private sector. It facilitated the rehabilitation effort following the 1986 earthquake, and it has promoted the establishment of private foundations with social programs in education (FEPADE), housing (HABITAT), and industrial safety (FIPRO). Also, FUSADES-generated nontraditional export growth is substantial and increasing rapidly. FUSADES has demonstrated a capability to expand its personnel and modify its organization as necessary to carry out A.I.D. activities, and there is no reason to believe it cannot conduct some additional activities -- as long as A.I.D. is willing to pay virtually all the costs (as it does now). However, the issue of sustainability has recently been raised by A.I.D., and while FUSADES is trying to respond, e.g., by developing a 5-year plan for reducing costs and generating additional income, it appears that A.I.D. is requiring that cash flow scenarios show full viability by 1992 as a pre-condition to additional grants.  Thus, it seems that A.I.D. is applying a higher than usual standard to FUSADES -- which is particularly unfair in the environment (military, political, economic, and social) in which it has had to operate. In sum, FUSADES has become a capable organization dedicated to Salvadoran economic and social development, and A.I.D. should be interested in seeing it have the opportunity to continue playing an important role.

"Interim evaluation of a project to conduct research aimed at improving integrated tick control methods and reducing the tick population in Kenya.  The external evaluation covers the period through 2/88. Project progress has been constrained by severely inadequate facilities for tick rearing, immunology, immuno-chemistry, and field stations for animal experimentation.  Laboratory space problems will largely be resolved when the implementing agency -- the International Centre of Insect Physiology and Ecology -- moves from Nairobi to new facilities in Duduville. Despite poor facilities, however, research quality has been impressive.  The methodology is appropriate, up-to-date, and competently applied.  Studies of host resistance, cattle productivity, tick ecology, and modelling have been soundly conducted and can be applied in other African countries. Biochemical techniques have identified some promising potential vaccine antigens, and socioeconomic studies have ensured that results can be integrated into current farming practices.  The expertise developed during the project will have benefits far beyond that of tick control. The project staff is of a good mix and quality but may lack the continuity needed in such a large, long-term project; the combining of chemistry efforts by placing immuno-chemistry in the core program should be strongly considered.  Also, it is essential that the project afford the staff the opportunity for substantial international contacts and information exchanges by granting study sabbaticals, funding attendance at international conferences, and engaging visiting scientists.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","4/1/1988 12:00:00 AM","","Ticks|Livestock diseases|Disease resistance|Integrated pest management|Laboratories|Disease prevention and control","Kenya","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABB091.pdf","795 KB","000180 - USAID.

"Final interim evaluation of a 20-year project to provide faculty development and institutional support to Morocco's Hassan II Agronomic and Veterinary Institute (IAV).  The evaluation covers the period 2/86-7/88. IAV produces highly qualified graduates who are responsive to the needs of the Moroccan agriculture sector, particularly in the civil service and in public enterprises.  IAV will have graduated 130 Ph.D's by 1992, an unparalleled output of high-level expertise in A.I.D. support for higher education.  Agronomic research conducted by IAV graduates has contributed to the goal of developing a Hessian Fly resistant variety of wheat.  The benefits to Moroccan farmers of this single accomplishment may more than compensate for the total amount of financial resources invested in IAV in the last two decades.  Other IAV graduates are nearing completion of agronomic studies leading to the introduction of a disease-resistant date palm variety capable of repopulating the date-palm plantations devastated by ""bayoud."" The application of these research results could have a tremendous socioeconomic impact on Moroccans living in the arid territories south of the Atlas Mountains. IAV has also been effective in indigenizing its faculty (now 93% Moroccan) and in mobilizing resources through contracts with national and international organizations, adapting programs to changing needs, developing new programs to address new priority sectors, and contributing directly to socioeconomic development. Despite these achievements, IAV faces continuing barriers to sustainability.  Government of Morocco support for operating, teaching, and research expenditures is already estimated to be about $750,000 less per year than is needed.  When A.I.D. support for teaching and research is cut off in 1992, an additional cost gap of about $675,000 will occur. IAV is aware of the sustainability issues and has initiated a strategic planning process to address them.  This process is being undertaken in the context of the restructuring of Moroccan agricultural education which began in 1986-87 and which has already resulted in a curriculum reform at IAV in keeping with the Ministry of Agriculture's move towards a single-degree system (Ingenieur d'Etat, which would involve a six-year program at IAV, the National School of Agriculture (ENA), and the National Forestry School of Engineers (ENFA).","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","9/1/1988 12:00:00 AM","","Universities and colleges|Agricultural education|Higher education|Agricultural research","Morocco","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABB202.pdf","2,307 KB","008579 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of a project to support Rwanda's Ministry of Health and Social Affairs (MOHSA) in a major expanded program of immunization (EPI) initiative and in broadening child survival efforts to cover malaria and oral rehydration therapy (ORT). External evaluation covers the period 12/84-5/88. The project achieved many significant institutional objectives. MOHSA established well-designed national plans and coordination systems for EPI, ORT, and malaria.  Also developed were an innovative check-list approach to supervision and a management information system to monitor coverage and supervision and to provide feedback to regional and local levels.  A national health information system is now in a pilot phase. Project interventions were integrated into several national divisions, and the previously vertical EPI program was expanded to the regional and local levels. fragmentation and insufficient institutionalized coordinating mechanisms still present obstacles. Health education efforts were impressive.  Repeated short-term TA was provided to develop MOHSA's capacity to implement formative studies, develop and distribute appropriate health education materials, and conduct an effective mini-campaign for EPI. Health talks and home visitations are in evidence throughout the country, and a pilot program is distributing ORT messages which are likely to have significant effect on knowledge and practices. Project-supported studies provided baseline data on knowledge, attitudes, and practices; identified appropriate treatment schedules for the national malaria plan; and guided the development of health education messages. Less positively, project-developed training programs did not reach sufficient numbers of heads of health centers, nor were the sessions long enough for adequate development of skills and knowledge.  The project failed to achieve its objectives of supporting operations research projects and developing self- financing approaches. In terms of its impact on health, the project had mixed results. Significant achievements were made in EPI, with impressive levels of coverage in all EPI areas and a dramatic decline in measles, pertussis, polio, and diphtheria.  On the other hand, there is no evidence yet of an impact on the incidence of diarrheal diseases, and malaria (for reasons beyond the control of the project) is actually increasing at an alarming rate.  The project's malaria activities, which addressed monitoring, studies, and treatment, are insufficient for the magnitude of this problem.","Attachment: XD-ABB-248-A|Project title: Africa child survival initiative-Combatting|childhood communicable diseases (ACSI-CCCD)","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","5/1/1988 12:00:00 AM","","Malaria|Immunizations|Oral rehydration therapy|Child health care|Child survival activities|Health care administration","Rwanda","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABB248.pdf","8,443 KB","000981 - Pragma Corp.","","000004 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (8/85-8/88) to explore the geothermal resource potential of the Qualibou Caldera in St. Lucia.  The project was co-sponsored by the Regional Development Office/Caribbean (RDO/C) and the UN Development Program's Revolving Fund for Natural Resources Exploration (UNRFNRE). Most targets were achieved, although only two of three planned geothermal wells were drilled, tested, and capped; the third was dropped due to budget constraints.  The wells established for the first time both the certainty and the location of St. Lucia's geothermal resource. An agreement has since been signed between the Government of St. Lucia (GOSL) and LUCELEC, the national electric utility, to develop the geothermal field. Despite this generally successful outcome, the project was plagued by conflict, perhaps because RDO/C had had little experience in the management of such a project.  (1) Due to a disagreement with the GOSL, the UNRFNRE project manager -- the project's overall leader and the primary force behind it -- was dismissed.  Two successive contractors who replaced him were unable to address the various management difficulties that arose over the life of the project.  RDO/C should have informed all parties when the project manager was dismissed that it would pull out of the project unless the dispute was resolved to its satisfaction.  (2) There was confusion regarding the roles of the consultants to the project, an Italian firm appointed by UNRFNRE. The consultants acted with direct responsibility on several occasions, but no responsibility on others.  (3) UNRFNRE also altered its role and duties midway through the drilling program. RDO/C should have insisted on a clear definition of roles at the beginning of the project, even if this caused conflict with UNRFNRE. (4) Another dispute concerned responsibility for carrying out infrastructural work (road realignment, construction of drilling pads, etc.) and for transporting the drilling rig and other equipment. UNRFNRE maintained that neither it nor its consultants had any obligation to do the work, leaving the GOSL solely responsible.  RDO/C, realizing it had wrongly assumed that UNRFNRE would take charge of these matters, helped the GOSL solve the problem. In addition to the above, the specifications for the drilling program which developed for RDO/C by Los Alamos National Laboratory were sometimes vague.  This was because Los Alamos was not fully knowledgeable about the type of geothermal drilling that was applicable to St. Lucia (e.g., wet well rather than dry well drilling).  While RDO/C was able to solve this problem, it would have saved itself a good deal of trouble if it had paid more attention early on to practical matters.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1988 12:00:00 AM","","Geothermal energy|Energy exploration|Drilled wells|Energy resource development|Constraints|Joint development projects","Saint Lucia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABB351.pdf","117 KB","001757 - USAID.

"Interim evaluation of a project to strengthen developing country capacity to conduct research and training related to integrated pest management (IPM) and to develop networks between plant protection and IPM specialists.  The evaluation covers the period 10/85-11/88. The project's activities and staffing patterns contradict the IPM philosophy in that they place more emphasis on pesticide use than on the promotion of ecologically sound pest management.  The project's original focus on IPM has been further reduced by cuts in core funding.  The primary contractor, the Consortium for International Crop Protection (CICP), has experienced several problems in implementation:  (1) networking activities to ensure a flow of IPM information between member institutions and developing country plant protection programs are weak and undeveloped; (2) a system for evaluating CICP's performance, though called for in the 1985 review, has not yet been established; and (3) research efforts have been meager, with only minimal short-term and no long-term research.  Regarding the last, the scope of work should place more emphasis on non- chemical pest control methodologies. In order to ensure compliance with the contract, CICP will need to reorganize and redistribute activities and resources.  In particular, CICP needs to develop a comprehensive outreach program to inform Missions of its activities and encourage buy-in support (for which more core funding is essential); expand its consulting base and provide better institutional support for consultants; and develop close links with other A.I.D.-funded IPM projects. On the positive side, CICP has provided high-quality training to some 1,153 participants through 34 courses (8 on pesticides and 26 on IPM-related issues).  However, training impact cannot be evaluated due to a lack of follow-up.  The project's ecological assessment activities have also been excellent, and could be expanded with measurable impact. CICP, or a similar organization, is essential if A.I.D. is to support IPM as a component of crop protection programs. Continued funding should be considered.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","12/1/1988 12:00:00 AM","","Integrated pest management|Pesticides|Environmental protection|Agricultural research","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABB394.pdf","1,302 KB","","","000180 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (1983-1988) to improve maternal/child nutrition in the Dominican Republic through growth monitoring and nutrition education activities.  Catholic Relief Services (CRS)/Caritas implemented the project. As a result of project activities, the prevalence of child malnutrition in the targeted communities dropped from 12.2% to 5.4% between 9/84 and 9/87.  This success is attributed primarily to the project's grassroots, participatory approach which utilized consciousness-raising, individual and community motivation, and the promotion of self-reliance and individual initiative.  Additional strengths included appropriate selection of participating communities and personnel, continuous supervision, technically well-defined and integrated activities, an effective communication strategy, and a simple and efficient information system for surveillance and evaluation.  A total of 8,798 children benefitted from the program. To help promoters provide sound advice during growth monitoring home visits, a series of illustrated nutrition messages, reinforced by flyers, were produced.  Four mini-workshops and 10 radio jingles were also produced.  The materials were well accepted and contributed to behavioral changes of most mothers, though it appears that the highest-risk children are in the upper brackets of the target group (children 0-5).  New materials need to be developed to address the needs of these older children. On the negative side, community works activities (e.g., water, sanitation, and gardens) were less than successful due to insufficient financial resources and litle support received by area supervisors. Community income-generating activities funded through project loans were also unsatisfactory:  of ten such activities, only two were successful. A major lesson learned is that it is more cost-effective to prevent malnutrition through growth monitoring than to cure it. The growth monitoring process also provides families with nutrition education which increases the mother's and family's capacity to make health care decisions.  Finally, efforts to decentralize the project were only partially successful, and should be given higher priority now in the interests of program sustainability.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1988 12:00:00 AM","","Child nutrition|Child survival activities|Growth monitoring|Maternal child health care","Dominican Republic","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABB584.pdf","919 KB","008537 - USAID.

"Mid-term evaluation of a project to provide TA worldwide in the areas of expanded program of immunization (EPI) and health care financing (HCF).  The evaluation covers the period 9/85-9/88. In the EPI component, overall management, leadership, and performance have been of high quality and demonstrated effectiveness.  Coordination with other donors has also been strong.  As indicated by the number of buy-ins, there has been high demand for project services, which include identifying cost- effective delivery mechanisms, developing methodology and information systems for monitoring coverage, strengthening the capacity of nongovernmental providers, and developing training and informational materials.  On the negative side, the technical advisory group (TAG) has not performed the expected in-depth technical reviews of project programs and strategies, but has instead functioned as a donor coordination mechanism, which could be performed more economically through other means. The HCF component is much less focused than EPI.  The component was plagued early on by staffing problems and inadequate economic talent during the early stages, making the refinement of strategies more difficult.  In addition, TAG efforts relative to the HCF component have been expensive and less beneficial than expected.  While the project has been extremely responsive to Mission requests, it is in danger of becoming overly burdened by institutional efficiency and reform activities, to the neglect of more promising interventions in cost recovery, partially because the latter is insufficiently emphasized in A.I.D.'s HCF guidelines.  With the demand for HCF assistance rising dramatically, the component needs to define its strategy and involve subcontractors as true collaborators in implementing it.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","BAS-0249-R-HI-4208-00","","11/1/1988 12:00:00 AM","","Immunizations|Health finance|Preventive health care|Health care administration|Cost recovery","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABB603.pdf","1,034 KB","006434 - Devres, Inc.|001441 - U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Services.

"Mid-term evaluation of a program to increase public awareness of the drug problem in Bolivia.  The evaluation covers the period 1/87-8/88. The program has been generally successful.  Project-funded activities, especially those in the private sector, have contributed to increased awareness of the drug problem and have laid the foundation for a more thorough understanding and commitment to increased drug prevention activity.  A private organization, Sistema Educativo Antidrogadiccion y de Movilizacion Social (SEAMOS), has been established which is dedicated to promoting awareness of the drug problem and the need to prevent drug abuse. SEAMOS has conducted a national media campaign and established a small grants program and a training program, the latter conducted by the Center for Interdisciplinary Community Studies (CIEC), a Bolivian research organization. Additionally, a Narcotics Trust Fund established by the project financed a number of narcotics awareness projects independently of SEAMOS; taken together, these efforts have resulted in a skill base and accumulated materials in such areas as television documentaries, news reporting, and graphic production -- all related to awareness of the drug problem. With proper management and support, SEAMOS has the potential to mature into a full-fledged national development organization that can function as a conduit for financial support and TA to local operational projects engaged in drug abuse prevention.  So far, however, SEAMOS has largely concentrated on a single area of activities -- mass communications -- directed at an undifferentiated general public.  In addition, SEAMOS and the institutions associated with it require increased training to perform their current functions and to expand efforts to such areas as training and TA, program evaluation, and networking outside the country.  In general, the various elements of the project need to be better coordinated in order to deliver a set of integrated messages to target audiences.","Work order no. 26","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-0085-I-00-6098-00","","8/1/1988 12:00:00 AM","","Drug abuse|Drug abuse education|Mass communication|Private sector","Bolivia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABB986.pdf","2,250 KB","000436 - Development Associates, Inc.","","008515 - USAID.

"Synthesizes evaluations of 33 agricultural and rural development projects in the Latin American and Caribbean region, including projects in Belize, Bolivia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Jamaica, Panama, Peru, Dominica, and Saint Vincent.  The evaluations included both interim and final evaluations, were carried out over the period 1984-1987, and represented projects totaling $36 million in A.I.D. investments. Eleven major lessons were learned from the projects.  (1) Crop diversification/export promotion activities must consider marketing as well as production, so that farmers who have successfully grown the new product will have a way to market it and pay back production loans.  (2) Agricultural research projects, particularly farming systems research, require strong association with extension services for success.  (3) Projects which utilize already functioning local organizations have tended to progress faster than those which use newly established organizations.  (4) Projects containing both loan and grant components appeared well-designed and performed well, considering the complexity of tasks.  (5) Local and international PVO's have been particularly successful in carrying out grassroots projects, e.g., community development activities.  (6) Full government support is necessary in almost all projects, even those involved in the private sector.  Where this support was lacking or where changes of administration diminished earlier cooperation, projects were delayed.  (7) Projects in which several government ministries, PVO's, and/or other private and public agencies all share implementation responsibility require special care in delineating planning and operational responsibilities.  In some cases it is better to make one ministry completely responsible for coordination and for all project funding, thus providing leverage with the other participating organizations. (8) Finding competent local project managers and qualified foreign advisors and keeping qualified local managers and technicians from leaving after training is completed has presented significant problems in a number of projects.  (9) Project designs sometimes cover too many activities or areas, are too casual about the relationship of inputs to outputs, and have unrealistic timeframes.  (10) Evaluation and monitoring provisions in project design need specific indicators (baseline data or specific targets) to measure progress.  (11) Scopes of work for evaluation teams should be specific, laying out points of special interest to A.I.D. and the host government.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","LAC-0000-C-00-6072-00","","4/1/1988 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural development|Agricultural research|Development project design|Rural development","Latin America|Caribbean","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABC097.pdf","3,520 KB","003366 - TvT Associates","","003052 - USAID.

"Evaluates implementation of the Central American Peace Scholarship (CAPS) II Program in Guatemala.  External evaluation focuses on the project's impact, as determined by a questionnaire administered to 101 of 1,723 scholars participating in the program from FY85 to FY87, including impact on their families and friends; it also reviews leadership training programs of the 1960's and 1970's and assesses knowledge of and interest in CAPS on Capitol Hill. Strongly influenced by its predecessor programs at Loyola University (New Orleans) and Rafael Landivar University in Guatemala City, CAPS/Guatemala has reached out to the disadvantaged (women, Indians, and especially campesinos) and offers courses targeted to identified needs. It employs a case study method adapted to Guatemalan problems and conditions, and has added in-country courses and other activities to expand the follow-up program.  Still, there is ongoing concern whether support for returned scholars is sufficient, and whether the project will result in ""critical masses"" of change agents to serve in Guatemala's communities and subregions. The questionnaire was used to determine measurable impacts in four areas.  (1) The program was found to have improved the individual lives of returned scholars, and of their families and friends, but there was no evidence of change in community situation.  (2) Scholars and their close associates believe that action, both individual and collaborative, can lead to positive changes for themselves and their community.  These beliefs seem to be the result of program experience.  (3) Characteristics of U.S. society related to wealth, power, and organization were rated highest by scholars, their families, and their friends. The quality rated by all three groups as least characteristic of the United States was compassion.  Friends of scholars tended to see less justice, honesty, and opportunity in U.S. society than the other two groups, but family members rated the United States highly as a land of opportunity.  Satisfaction with the experience of studying in the United States was widespread.  (4) Scholars see far less shortfalls in U.S. democracy than the other two groups.  This attitude seems to be the result of having actually lived and studied in the United States.  The questionnaire also revealed that:  (a) the responses given by men and women are strikingly similar; (b) those engaged in technical occupations see their personal situation as more improved by the program than do those engaged in manual labor; and (c) there is in all three groups a recognizable subgroup that is resistant to change, although whether this means they are more cynical or more realistic is unclear. Findings of the evaluation, whose methodology should serve as a model for future evaluations of the program, verify the assumption that returned scholars do, as a result of the scholarship experience, influence the attitudes and perceptions of their close associates regarding democracy, change, and other matters related to the development of Guatemalan society. Further, this impact is measurable in quantitative terms and can be traced over time.  Future efforts should build on this foundation.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","LAC-0000-C-00-7033-00","","3/1/1988 12:00:00 AM","","Participants|Scholarships|Leadership training|Democracy|Education for development|Evaluation methodology|Impact assessment|Change agents","USA|Guatemala","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABC249.pdf","3,791 KB","006568 - SES International Corp.","","008550 - USAID.

"The information systems of the U.S. Agency for International Development are ineffective and inefficient.  While costly, they are not providing needed information to users on a timely basis. These conclusions emerge from a review of A.I.D. reports and personal interviews with information users that focused on two critical information areas:  automatic data processing and evaluation. While A.I.D. is largely an information collection and processing operation, information systems are not satisfactory because senior officials have not been sufficiently involved to provide the necessary leadership and direction in developing them.  The result has been:  (1) the development and management of information activities by data processing specialists as opposed to information users; (2) redundancies and gaps in information activities; (3) a failure to ask the important ""overview"" questions, together with a failure to design information activities that respond to those questions. Meaningful improvements will not occur until senior management, in recognition of the cost and importance of information collection and processing activities to the Agency, takes back control over the development and management of information activities. To facilitate this happening, we recommend: (1) The establishment of a strategic planning unit, answerable only to the Administrator, with the sole responsibility of defining and addressing the ""overview"" programmatic and management questions facing the Agency; this unit should have a strategic, forward-looking focus, that is, it should ask how programs and management can be improved upon in a rapidly changing world. (2) The establishment of an information committee comprised of senior A.I.D. officials that represent the Agency's primary information users; this committee should painstakingly review the cost-effectiveness of all information activities as compared with users' needs; as a result of this review, together with a willingness to make tough bureaucratic decisions, and the existence of new information technologies, the committee should be able to increase user satisfaction and still reduce existing systems and costs by at least one-third.

"Evaluates 1981-88 RSSA with the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), Office of International Health (OIH), to assist bureaus and missions in the area of nutrition. RSSA services were provided by a contractor, Logical Technical Services (LTS), a private consulting firm.  LTS received core central funding of slightly over $2.3 million from S&T/N, augmented by $1.6 million from regional offices (REDSO/UCA) and bureaus (ANE and Africa), A.I.D. missions,  WHO, UNICEF, and UNDP.  Most of the personnel involved were regular LTS staff; only a few outside consultants were utilized, primarily because of resource limitations. Generally, the RSSA did, as originally proposed, reinforce and expand A.I.D.'s capability to provide leadership and supporting role in nutrition components in primary health are (PHC) projects.  Its greatest achievements were its catalytic and advocacy activities, its systematization of growth monitoring/promotion (GM/P), and its development and promotion of a simple/immediate feedback management information systems (MIS). In terms of outputs, the RSSA produced a large volume of publications (78), provided TA in 20 countries, and carried out operations research (OR) in 8 countries.  It also organized and managed 2 major global conferences plus 1 regional workshop and 15 country meetings in 8 countries on nutrition programming issues. The RSSA increasingly focused on GM/P and nutrition surveillance systems (NSS) and, to a lesser extent, on dietary management of diarrhea (DMD) as part of child survival and GOBI (growth monitoring, oral rehydration therapy, breastfeeding, and immunization) efforts.  Despite this narrow focus on technical activities, the RSSA effectively promote nutrition activities within A.I.D. missions.  It also:  generated useful guidelines for GH/P and DHD; served as a catalyst by promoting coordination which led to standardized nutrition activities among PVO's and the Ministry of Health in several countries; developed indigenous skills and institutional capacity; and reoriented GM/P projects from curative to preventative/promotive. On the qualitative side, activities were too narrowly focused on GM/P to the exclusion of other activities mentioned in the RSSA (e.g., nutrition education, supplementary feeding, control of infection, child spacing, infant weaning/breastfeeding, vitamin A and iron).  In addition, in several countries OR activities met with little local interest and lacked evidence of how the activities would fit into larger programs.  In several cases the RSSA staff had a tendency to take control of local research efforts, thus reducing local participation. There was concern expressed that a RSSA consultant was too directive. In some field activities, GM/P (education and management objectives) and NSS (policy making) were intermingled.  The limitation of bureaucracies to implement large-scale, community-based programs was not accorded sufficient attention, raising concern about the sustainability of some of the RSSA activities.  The RSSA tended to concentrate on technical details at the expense of larger process issues (e.g., ongoing data collection and processing in the Dominican Republic to the detriment of other important elements such as nutrition education). Though the limited French capability of the LTS core consultants adversely affected their field work in Francophone, West Africa, their fluency in Spanish was a benefit in Latin America.  The RSSA was responsive to bureaus and missions and typically provided the same consultant or team over time to a project effort; continuity was mentioned as a strength of the RSSA.  In addition, the RSSA was viewed by the bureaus and missions as an inexpensive, easily accessible mechanism to get good quality TA. It proved to be a cost-effective means of providing technical support to missions. The RSSA was not directly involved in service delivery, and, therefore, impact upon nutrition status is impossible to evaluate.  But positive effects on service delivery programs (supported through the RSSA) were noted, particularly in the Dominican Republic. The OIH did not act as a service provider but did act as an important facilitator.  S&T/N in most cases dealt directly with the contractor. The RSSA did not, therefore, fully satisfy A.I.D.'s desire to broaden its support or reduce its administrative load.  The OIH provided considerable support to the RSSA contractor (e.g., communications, publications, library) and kept the project going for extended periods when the RSSA had officially lapsed.  It also monitored RSSA ""deliverables"" and did most of the RSSA budget analysis and projections. The evaluation team recommends that S&T/N design a new project in which the goals and implementation mechanism are more clearly defined. The  project should be a direct relationship between S&T/N and a contractor.  The new project should take the form of a nutrition-in-health service delivery/support project having a broad focus, maintaining the primary goal of promoting nutrition in other health efforts.  As with the RSSA, services should be easy to procure, and the maximum continuity of TA personnel for each task should be encouraged.  The project should have central funding to begin work and be designed in such a way that local missions and regional bureaus, as well as UN organizations, other governments, and PVO's, could buy into the project. From the experience of this project, OR might be left to existing projects such as PRICOR, but in general, missions and bureaus can be expected to be specific about their requests for help.

"AID's assistance on behalf of agricultural research and teaching tries both to improve the substance of research and training and to build institutional capacity.  Evaluations of these efforts reveal a number of successes but also explain why building institutions to pursue relevant research and training is generally a low priority within the Third World.  The role of institutions conducting agricultural research and training has changed considerably.  Currently, observers emphasize that increasing agricultural production depends less on technological breakthroughs than on political and socioeconomic support factors, such as government pricing policies and the responsiveness of smallholder farmers.  The most important social and economic issue confronting agricultural institutions is the need to make research and training relevant to farmers.  The institutional issue is whether the institutions are providing training and research that address the actual constraints that farmers face. Evaluations note that many institutions have had a positive impact on agricultural productivity, especially when there are: strong administrative leadership; an institutional sense of purpose and mission; close linkages between training, research and extension services to farmers; multidisciplinary emphasis; incentives for faculty to emphasize farming systems; supportive economic pricing policies; and adequate inputs and services. However, institutions have a hard time fulfilling these conditions. Universities emphasize disciplinary boundaries.  It is logistically difficult to tailor research to farmers' immediate concerns.  Political leaders tend to pursue policies that benefit urban consumers rather than rural producers and favor short term benefits.  Governments lack resources to provide sufficient inputs and services.  Ministries make it difficult for research and extension work to support each other. Because of these difficulties, such institutions depend on long-term support from external organizations.  Donors, however, also find it difficult to provide assistance for activities where the benefits are only apparent in the long run.  A.I.D. usually contracts with a U.S. university to establish a long-term relationship with a Third World institution and provide it with technical assistance (TA) and participant training.  Many of these activities have been successful in building an institutional capacity, particularly when the assistance continues for a long time.  Because it is difficult to build lasting and relevant institutions, however, A.I.D. should design its project assistance to deal with the constraints described earlier, such as encouraging universities to reward faculty for farming systems research, and developing linkages among those doing research, teaching, and extension work.

"Mid-term evaluation of a project to support country-specific applied research aimed at controlling and preventing diarrheal disease.  The project is managed by the Harvard Institute for International Development (HIID) and implemented by Johns Hopkins and Tufts Universities.  Evaluation covers the period 9/85-3/88. For a variety of reasons -- including an overly ambitious design, difficulty in recruiting host country researchers, a lack of clear objectives, problems among the three universities, inadequate participation and high turnover among USAID Cognizant Technical Officers, and HIID's lack of experience in implementing a project of this sort in the health sphere -- the project has been slow in finding its way.  Nonetheless, prospects for success during the second half of the project are real and substantial: the project has an important role to play in developing research capabilities of the countries in which it is involved. The project is active in seven countries (vs. a targeted 20): Indonesia, Thailand, Pakistan, Peru, Mexico, Nigeria, and Kenya. To date, it has funded 22 research projects, conducted two proposal development workshops, and carried out evaluations of two other USAID-funded diarrheal disease research projects. However, the integration of epidemiology and social science in some research projects has not been adequate, despite the fact that interdisciplinary collaborative research is one of the project's main objectives and most promising aspects.  As for the individual research proposals, those with a specifically designated consultant-mentor are better prepared and have more limited objectives, making their successful completion more likely. The evaluation team supports the three broad themes selected for the project:  home use of fluids and foods during diarrhea; invasive and chronic diarrhea; and changing behaviors in preventing and treating diarrhea.  It recommends that a fourth theme be added: intervention and prevention of diarrhea, to include studies in water supply, excreta and solid waste disposal, personal hygiene, food handling, measles immunization, supplementary feeding, and other aspects of convalescent care. The team also recommends that a common definition of chronic diarrhea be agreed upon.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","DPE-5953-C-00-7027-00","","3/1/1988 12:00:00 AM","","Diarrhea|Disease research|Applied research|Research collaboration|Institution building","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABD541.pdf","424 KB","000553 - Harvard University.

"An evaluation of the Cross Sectoral Participant Training Program in Yemen was conducted for the USAID Mission in Yemen.  Over 100 interviews were conducted, including a sample of 45 returned participants. The program is highly regarded by both Yemen Arab Republic Government (YARG) officials and participants.  YARG officials expressed a preference and a need for more U.S. training, and rated it higher in quality than Soviet Bloc and other European or third country training. YARG officials interviewed were enthusiastic and cooperative, providing significant input to various evaluation issues such as selection, placement, monitoring, and follow-up, in addition to training needs assessment, policy, and planning.  It is clear that YARG officials view U.S. participant training as an important component of human resource development. The participants also praised the USAID participant training program and had very positive experiences during their study at U.S. institutions.  The majority of those sampled had taken BS and MS degrees in education, engineering, economics, and public administration, with the largest proportion in education and engineering.  Other fields of study included city planning, social sciences, health, and the physical sciences.  Short-term technical training covered a variety of professional fields, but emphasized management and administration. The participants were for the most part satisfied with their academic training, with over 85% expressing a positive experience.  Moreover, most said they would recommend their training program to colleagues. Participants who studied in the United States not only learned academic and technical skills but also felt they experienced attitudinal and behavioral changes critical to their personal development as well as job performance.  For example, the majority said that one of the most important skills they gained was the ability to analyze problems and propose practical solutions.  A second major skill learned was the ability to plan and organize, as well as new attitudes toward thinking about and approaching problems.  These abstract skills were seen by most participants to be as or more important in bringing about change than their academic and technical training. The question of U.S. training versus third country training is primarily one of cost, assuming that the quality is at least on a par with U.S. institutions.  In cases where adequate training could be provided in Arabic-speaking countries, it would be more cost effective to place participants in Middle East programs (in Egypt and Jordan), particularly for selected agricultural and public administration training. Overall, the program is a good one which is meeting Yemen's needs in various sectors, including education, agriculture, and in general participant programs such as the National Institute for Public Administration and the National Water and Sewerage Authority. However, there are critical areas in which improvement is needed, especially with regard to improved coordination and planning with YARG ministries to identify national priorities.  Another key area to examine is the provision of English language training to participants through the Yemen American Language Institute. Also, YARG officials differ somewhat with USAID on the focus of academic training in terms of BS and graduate degrees.  YARG wishes to emphasize developing a critical mass of trained manpower while much of USAID's strategy is to support upper level graduate training to strengthen Sanaa University. The Mission is well aware of the issues and problems in participant training and is moving aggressively to resolve them. A major recommendation of the evaluation team is to centralize authority and responsibility by appointing a coordinator for participant training. The purpose of identifying a key person is to establish high level dialogue with YARG officials on training policy, strategy, planning and operations.  Major functions of this position would be external coordination and planning, as well as internal planning and coordination within USAID and the various development sectors.  USAID has already begun to move in this direction and is looking at options to develop a new major participant training policy and initiative.

"Final evaluation of a rural water supply and sanitation project (1980-87) in Togo. The project was highly successful, having provided potable water to 864 villages (some 600,000 persons).  A total of 1,048 boreholes, 3 springs, 256 cisterns, and 473 latrines were constructed.  Key to both the construction effort and the long-term operation and maintenance of the systems was the establishment of a Village Development Committee (VDC) in each project village. Coordination was difficult in the beginning because of a complex project structure involving four donors and three Government of Togo (GOT) ministries.  Nonetheless, after a mid-term review considerable improvements were made, especially regarding coordination between the drilling and village development components. Training of GOT field agents and of VDC's (each including a president, secretary, treasurer, pump repairman, woman pump caretaker, woman oral rehydration therapy (ORT) demonstrator, and committee advisors) was an integral activity and effective participatory methodologies were used.  VDC members received specialized training in their fields, and 120 GOT field agents each received about 160 days of training, an amount which was well justified. The project's community participation strategy included village meetings, workshops for villagers, and follow-up and evaluation of community activities.  This process of community organizing and training required careful follow-up by the field agents for several years.  In the majority of cases, where the field agents were motivated and persistent, this strategy was very effective. Contracting for borehole drilling with a private firm was effective and efficient; costs were cut by one-third by this means.  Siting of boreholes was also effectively accomplished through contracting with a French geologic firm.  Due to procurement delays, however, 340 boreholes were without pumps for more than 2 years.  Pump maintenance has been generally effective but improvements are still needed.  The cost and availability of some pump parts have not been satisfactory, and overworked regional repair teams have not been able to respond quickly to village needs. Springs and cisterns as alternative water supply technologies were found to be effective.  Cisterns, in particular, are important alternatives in areas without groundwater resources. (About 33% of the boreholes were dry.)  The cisterns are rather expensive, however, and studies on less expensive models are needed. Latrine construction was also effective but covered only a small percentage of project villages.  Again, studies are needed to find less expensive designs.  More emphasis is needed on latrine construction. Increased emphasis is also needed on protecting the water quality of boreholes.  Some 15-20% of boreholes have bacteriological contamination.","English ed.: PD-AAX-801|WASH activity no. 413","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","DPE-5942-C-00-4085-00","","2/1/1988 12:00:00 AM","","Community participation|Potable water|Water supply engineering|Villages|Beneficiary count","Togo","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABI541.pdf","2,656 KB","000333 - Camp Dresser and McKee, Inc.

"Final evaluation of a project to institutionalize an agricultural training program for small farmers and Government of Togo (GOT) extensionists and trainers.  The evaluation covers the period 1/84-5/88 against a 12/88 PACD.  The project was implemented by Opportunities Industrialization Centers International (OICI). During this Phase II project (Phase I ran from 1976 to 1982), OIC Togo evolved into a fully mature and viable Togolese institution providing effective agricultural training to young farmers and capable of surviving without USAID support. Its impact is limited, however, by the small number of students it can train annually. Project obligations were substantially met by USAID, OICI, and the GOT.  Infrastructure and commodities were procured under budget.  Young farmer training targets were significantly exceeded, while the targets for upgrading GOT agricultural agents and instructors were not met. Pro-Ag Amendment No. 1 revised project outputs to comply with this changing reality. Recommendations of the mid-term evaluation were satisfied where appropriate. The following lessons were learned.  (1) The fact that OIC Togo solidified its institutional status during the final years of a 12.5-year period of USAID support underlines the long-term nature of institutional development.  (2) To a large extent, project success is attributable to OIC Togo's and OICI's clear sense of mission, commitment, and focus on the individual. (3) OIC Togo represents a different private/public sector relationship that is working very well in the Togolese context.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","8/1/1988 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural training|Agricultural extension training|Private voluntary organizations|Institution building|Farmer training|Indigenization|Youth|Beneficiary count","Togo","","","008614 - USAID.
