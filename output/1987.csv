"Evaluates the women's entrepreneurship development program (WEDP) in Bangladesh, a project component to provide credit to enterprises managed by women and those in which women play a major role.  External evaluation covers CY86 and is based on visits to 4 WEDP centers and interviews with personnel from the implementing Bangladesh Small and Cottage Industries Corporation (BSCIC), center staff, and clients. The WEDP is operating far below potential, primarily because of limited support from headquarters level to field offices in planning, programming, and evaluation.  As a result, management varies from center to center, with particular problems in Laksam. Improvements in the management and support system can probably be made using existing BSCIC resources. Loan experience is mixed.  As of 6/86 sufficient loan funds were available for another 2 years, but these funds are being kept in a non-interest bearing account.  Also, the reported recovery rate - an exact figure is not available due to inconsistencies in reporting procedures - is only 76%, and the overhead rate is unacceptably high: it costs 1.47 taka to lend and recover one taka.  Between 7/84 and 6/85, the rate of increase in new clients varied from 73% to 473% at 3 of the centers; as more clients are signed up, decline in these rates is unavoidable.  Finally, only 22% of clients are actually involved in making investment decisions and evidently only 35% are actually involved in managing their enterprises. WEDP's impacts on living conditions also appear mixed.  If labor wages are imputed (labor is almost always provided by the family), nearly all WEDP-funded enterprises are operating at a loss, except for those related to tailoring and packaging.  On the other hand, 81% of respondents at 3 centers reported increases in income and 67% reported improved nutritional levels. (Virtually no increases in income or nutritional levels were reported in Laksam.)  Also, 25-50% of loan funds are diverted from their intended use and spent on consumer goods. USAID/B provided adequate financial support, but TA from both USAID/B and BSCIC was inadequate.  USAID/B and BSCIC have not agreed on statistical goals for loan recovery or on measurement of WEDP progress. It is recommended that:  (1) WEDP headquarters be expanded and improved to better assist in resolving operational problems in the field; (2) the recovery rate be increased to 85% by 6/87 (except that Laksam's recovery rate should be established in an independent review) and subsequently to above 90%; (3) the overhead rate be reduced by 15% by 6/87 and subsequently reduced to less than 0.5 taka; (4) WEDP guidelines be revised to properly describe its conceptual focus and modus operandi; (5) qualitative and quantitative benchmarks goals be established for measuring progress; and (6) USAID/B continue its support pending implementation of these recommendations.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","2/1/1987 12:00:00 AM","","Women|Entrepreneurs|Industrial credit|Small scale enterprises|Cottage industries|Management operations|Beneficiary interviews|Sampling method","Bangladesh","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAV017.pdf","6,171 KB","008511 - USAID.

"Evaluates a project to help Burundi's National Institute for Nature Conservation (INCN) preserve the Bururi Forest and to develop alternate sources of firewood and construction timber in the Bururi area.  Final evaluation, conducted 6 months prior to the project's 6/87 termination, is based on site visits, interviews with project personnel and beneficiaries, and a review of the mid-term (1984) evaluation. Despite diligent efforts to implement the recommendations of the 1984 evaluation, the project has been only partially successful. Protection of the Bururi Forest has been furthered by establishment of a block plantations of several exotic wood species on more than 750 ha of cleared land inside the forest boundaries.  In addition, subsequent plantings have reforested former areas of encroachment; a clear forest boundary delineation has been created; and forest guard system and firebreak systems have been installed.  In order to protect the remaining natural forest, the project has extended the inner buffer zone of black wattle trees, originally restricted to the forest's eastern side, to the northern and western sides as well. Agroforestry activities in the buffer zone outside the forest, aimed at using fast growing species to provide alternative wood and agricultural supplies, did not begin until late 1985.  The major focus has been on tree plantings by small farmers, although extension agents have also helped to establish community woodlots and demonstration plots.  Despite considerable progress in these efforts, however, wood harvesting still exists in the galleries, the forest, and the black wattle belts, all three protected by law from such gathering and harvesting activities.  Until farmer-managed and communal woodlots are actively producing the agricultural and construction materials needed on a daily basis, the natural forest cannot be protected nor can the project be deemed a complete success.  INCN staff are currently working toward this objective. A key recommendation is that the project be extended for 6 months at no cost to enable current activities, i.e., nursery operations, the forest guard system, maintenance of firebreaks, and most agroforestry extension to continue uninterrupted until INCN can fund their activities through normal budget processes in 1/88 and to allow a participant to complete his B.Sc. program in agroforestry.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1987 12:00:00 AM","","Forests|Natural resource conservation|Agroforestry|Afforestation|Firewood|Timber|Beneficiary interviews|Limited data plus","Burundi","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDBBG379.pdf","1,023 KB","008522 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to build an indigenous Sahelian capacity in demographic data collection, processing, analysis, and use. Final external evaluation covers the period 1982-1/87 and is based on site visits, document review, and interviews with project personnel. The project more than achieved its institutional goals.  Research and TA capabilities were developed throughout the Sahel, at both the national and regional levels, through training (long- and short-term), the provision of materials, and TA.  The development of a regional institutional capacity is quite impressive, starting as it did from nothing at the project's beginning.  The Sahel Institute's Socioeconomic Demographic Unit (USED) has matured into a center capable of guiding demographic research and providing TA and training throughout the Sahel. USED has strengthened national institutions through long-, short-term, and ad hoc TA, data processing services, and seminars and workshops. USED's major weakness is in computer technology. The project also contributed significantly to analyzing existing data and alleviating the conditions which lead to unanalyzed data.  All major planned data collection and analysis activities have been completed or nearly completed.  USED carried out infant mortality studies in two countries and, per A.I.D.'s request, undertook a third in Mali; all three studies are nearing completion.  USED is assisting with a health survey in Mali and plans are being made for a similar study in The Gambia; studies of health statistics were conducted - after a late start - in Cape Verde and Senegal; and studies of the impact of development project on population variables are underway in Senegal, Burkina, and Mali.  In addition, USED has participated in a number of joint studies with outside organizations, e.g., a migration study with the Organization of European Cooperation and Development, which have had policy impacts. Overall, project administration has been very good.  However, as the project has grown, financial management has lagged, notably due to the lack of computerized accounting.  Nonetheless, USED's coordinator oversaw the project's progress during a difficult political time and should be commended.  The USED staff, though small, is competent and has excellent rapport with collaborators in national research and statistical institutions. It is recommended that A.I.D. support a follow-on project which will emphasize the applications of demographic data in policymaking.  While USED's infant mortality, health statistics, and development impact studies provided valuable data and experience, these should not be continued during a second phase.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","2/1/1987 12:00:00 AM","","Population and demography|Data collection|Data analysis|Institution building","Sahel","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAV114.pdf","2,157 KB","000032 - USAID.

"Final Mission report on a project (1979-12/85) to help the Government of the Philippines (GOP) strengthen research and extension capabilities in 8 of the 16 national and regional centers that make up the Philippine Council for Agriculture and Resources Research (PCARR).  The report is based in part on two evaluations conducted in 1984. The project was a success.  Training activities far exceeded expectations.  Some 398 M.S. and 70 Ph.D candidates were trained vs. targets of 237 and 7, respectively, and 71 persons received B.S. training as planned.  Short-term training and travel grants were provided for 186 individuals.  A major step was taken in meeting the main project goal of decentralizing PCARR: two-thirds of the training grant awards were made to institutions outside of the Manila/Los Banos area. The increased research capabilities of the PCARR network had a positive impact on agricultural production.  Advances were made in reducing disease and pest problems for corn (yields increased by 8%), rice, and rubber crops, and varietal research for sweet potatoes is expected to result in significant increases in yields.  Also, a tobacco farmers' organization benefited from project training and TA in determining floor prices and identifying which varieties should be grown, resulting in yield increases of about 80% in one location. PCARR's institutional infrastructure was upgraded.  Some $2.4 million of equipment and library materials were delivered to the eight centers and the PCARR Secretariat.  Four of the centers are now well-equipped, well-staffed facilities which are actively engaged in problem-oriented research; a fifth has only recently installed project-financed research equipment.  Underutilization of laboratory equipment has been a problem at the remaining centers, which have either lacked funds to install or operate the equipment, or in some cases, may not have had a strong need for the equipment.  A plan has been devised in which PCARR institutions can acquire unused equipment from other institutions by paying the shipping.  As of 7/87, the GOP will be billed for equipment not in use. The project's success notwithstanding, two important activities were neglected:  (1) a program for collecting and analyzing data on the project's research impact was never implemented; and (2) planned evaluation activities, including an impact assessment, were not conducted, frustrating efforts to publicize the project's success and thus mobilize support for research. The project has taught that each institution should be provided with a basic research library (rather then purchasing materials based on each institution's requests).  Conversely, the provision of research equipment should be specific to each institution's needs and capabilities.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1987 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural research|Research centers|Institution building|Limited data","Philippines","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAV129.pdf","118 KB","008592 - USAID.

"Evaluates projects to fund Government of Jordan (GOJ) and USAID/J feasibility studies and TA for project planning, design, evaluation, etc.  External evaluation covers the period 5/82-3/87 and is based on document review, interviews, and findings from 64 activity questionnaires comprising a project management data base developed by the evaluation team at the Mission's request. Overall, the projects have been effective, well-used, and relevant. They have provided an appropriate mechanism by which to facilitate development program and project planning and activities, and have involved the Ministry of Planning (MOP) and GOJ executing agencies in meaningful and largely efficient ways.  GOJ activities funded by the projects have played catalytic, bridging, institutional development, and ""cutting edge"" roles in the areas of technology development and transfer, development administration, and planning, or in support of policy dialogue and policy reform. Project management has improved markedly over time, especially during the past 6 months, after creation of a review committee to set priorities, define selection criteria, and approve or disapprove GOJ requests over $10,000.  With slight improvements, project and activity management can be strengthened, especially monitoring, evaluation, and reporting.  A key need is to pay greater attention to the nature and quality of outputs (at both project and activity levels) vs. a stress on programming inputs, as has been the case in the past.  Recommendations are made for streamlining project management, revising the project purpose to reflect changed conditions, and initiating a follow-on. Three lessons have been learned.  (1) Projects such as these increase a mission's ability to respond flexibly and quickly to a range of host government (HG) requests, even as A.I.D. and HG priorities and needs change.  Such projects - which may be the only or major form of scarce flexible response resources to remain for programming as A.I.D. funding levels decrease - should be encouraged in other countries where geopolitical concerns warrant and HG's have good management capacities. (2) Where flexibility and speed of funding have high priority, attention to monitoring and output assessment tends to suffer.  However, more attention in these areas can actually increase flexibility rather than reduce it, as is sometimes feared.  (3) Attempting to introduce a project management data base and a management system derived from it in the context of a 3-week evaluation is not maximally efficient.  Missions and HG counterparts need more time to participate in data base development and to review and adjust their concepts of data-related priorities and needs.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-1096-I-04-4164-00","","3/1/1987 12:00:00 AM","","Development administration|Development planning|Technical assistance|Feasibility studies|Development cooperation","Jordan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAV209.pdf","5,270 KB","003002 - Ronco Consulting Corp.","","008564 - USAID.

"Evaluates the National Development Foundation of Jamaica's (NDFJ) program of credit and technical assistance/training (TAT) for small businesses.  External evaluation covers the period 1982-3/87 and is based on document review, and visits and interviews with 270 loan clients. NDFJ has delivered 1,202 loans (mostly in the manufacturing and services sectors) totalling $9 million.  Annual growth in the number of loans averaged 50% in 1983-83 but fell to 9% in 1986 due to inflation and currency devaluation and to a severe shortage of field officers and vehicles for servicing loans and processing applications. About 74% of loan-financed enterprises are growing impressively, due to adequate financing, TAT follow-ups, and a favorable environment (13% are closing, citing a lack of these factors). Average sales for businesses have increased from $42,000 to $70,000, gross profits from $16,000 to $32,800, and relative profitability from 38% to 47%.  Some 90% of client businessowners now depend on their businesses as their sole source of income and 72% (up from 51%) work 40 hours or more each week.  Total employment is 4,278, vs. 2,507 prior to the loans; women have especially benefited, since both garmentmakers and the service sector (heavily represented among clients) traditionally employ women and since women represent a larger pool of available labor. The bias in loans, however, is toward males, who own a greater share of established businesses, which are favored by NDFJ to reduce risk. TAT was provided to over 10,000 clients and was particularly useful since few had ever received business training.  Group training has exceeded target because of its low cost, but follow-up TAT to loan clients has been undersupplied by 32%, due to NDFJ's vehicle and personnel shortages.  Although frequency of follow-up visits has been strongly correlated with clients' success, 50% or fewer receive the minimum monthly visit.  TAT should focus more on growth and competitiveness rather than accountability, and field officers need more business training. Far too much TAT was provided to non-loan recipients; there is no system to follow up on these clients. NDFJ's portfolio is low-risk:  34% has been fully repaid, and only 2% is considered bad debt (although 15% is in arrears). However, the loan/TAT program has not been able to meet self-financing targets or to satisfy demand (which exceeds loan supply by $5 million).  Further, administrative costs have run over 40% and cannot be reduced until NDFJ increases its portfolio fivefold.  Key recommendations are that loan recovery periods be rationalized (reduced to 6-30 months) and TAT self-financing potential exploited (only 27% of clients can pay for TAT at receipt, but 80% would be able to pay within a 4-year period).","Contents: v. 1.

"Evaluates P.L. 480 Title III program in Senegal.  External, final, ""lessons learned"" evaluation covers the period 5/80-12/86 and is based on site visits, interviews with USAID/S and Government of Senegal (GOS) personnel, and document review. The Title III program financed more than 25 development projects and contributed to several GOS policy reforms concerning protection and rejuvenation of the natural resource base, strengthening of parastatal regional development agencies and of agricultural cooperatives, and improved capabilities in agricultural economics.  Its achievements, however, were hindered by management deficiencies which occured due to uncertainties as the roles of USAID/S and of the two key implementing entities:  a joint GOS/USAID Management Committee (MC), responsible for allocating Title III funds to development projects, developing project guidelines, and selecting projects for funding; and a ""Permanent Secretariat"" (PS), headed by a GOS official but primarily staffed by freelance personnel, responsible for monitoring financial management and project implementation.  The MC was unable to exert effective control over the PS, which lacked the qualified personnel needed for administration, and which, in the absence of restraining authority, exercised far too much autonomy, to the detriment of overall program implementation. Policy guidelines concerning USAID/S's monitoring responsibilities should have been better elaborated by AID/W, while program-specific implementation procedures needed better definition by the Mission.  The lack of clarity evinced in the Senegal program is not surprising, however, given the legislative history of Title III, and A.I.D.'s limited experience in implementing Title III programs. The program's management deficiencies occurred even though the GOS possesses the institutional capacity to administer the program and similar deficiencies have been found in other countries' programs, suggesting that alternative programming and administrative structures should be considered.  Properly administered, Title III programs have potential advantages over other forms of development assistance - cost-efficiency, conservation of host country foreign exchange, and the strengthening of host country management and technical skills through the direct involvement of local personnel in planning and administration.  Several recommendations are made for improving future Title III programs. For USAID/S's summary of this evaluation, focusing more on project-level achievements, see abstract of PD-AAV-408.

"Since 1980, A.I.D. and other donors have increasingly stressed programs to reform the misguided economic policies - aimed at fostering industrial and urban development at the expense of rural producers - which have been the main cause of Africa's poor economic performance over the past three decades.  This report assesses the impacts of such donor programs in five countries in sub-Saharan Africa - Zambia, Somalia, Mali, Zaire, and Zimbabwe. Notable in each case study is an assessment of the impact of policy reform programs on the agricultural sector and an analysis of the role of U.S. assistance.  A summary section indicates the positive effects of the economic reform programs on agriculture and the economy, while acknowledging that bad weather, falling export prices, and debt service have generally slowed macroeconomic progress.  It also notes some problems involved in implementing economic reform programs (e.g., the difficulty of managing price interventions) and the critical role played by donors in promoting policy reform.  A strong affirmation of the need for donors to continue stressing policy reform concludes the report.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","3/1/1987 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural policy|Policy reform|Nonproject assistance|Economic growth|Economic policy|Economic reform","Africa south of Sahara|Zimbabwe|Congo DR|Zambia|Somalia|Mali","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAW854.pdf","1,127 KB","000009 - USAID.

"Evaluates follow-on project to upgrade the capacity of the Radio Education Division (RED) of the Nepali Ministry of Education and Culture (MOEC) to provide radio-based, in-service training (i.e., the School Leaving Certificate) to primary school teachers who lack a high school diploma.  Mid-term evaluation covers the period 1984-4/87 and is based on document review, a survey of 126 teachers in 4 of the 5 participating districts, and interviews with teachers and with personnel from RED, MOEC, and the Research Center for Educational Innovation and Development. RED's ability to create and deliver educational radio programs has shown continuous development.  The RED office has been expanded and additional recording equipment has been installed. Radio Nepal has received equipment and training that has enhanced its ability to support educational programming.  The GON set up 45 temporary RED staff positions, including a second class officer position for the Chief of RED, the highest level yet sanctioned.  USAID/N has provided TA in management, evaluation, and program production; a scriptwriting/production/evaluation process has been put in place; staff have been trained; and 117 20-minute English language lessons have been tested with 171 teachers in 5 districts.  A revised version of this series will be broadcast to over 400 teachers in 10 districts during 1987. Despite this progress, however, the project is behind schedule, with little chance of meeting its ambitious targets.  RED has been slow to develop due to leadership and staff changes and a lack of institutionalization.  In the 8 years of A.I.D. support, RED has had as many directors, many of them ""Acting,"" and has changed its administrative location 4 times.  Of 20 staff members sent overseas for training during Phase I, only 6 still work at RED; thus, the project, has frequently had to restart the personnel development process.  A delay in fulfilling grant covenants hindered the flow of funds and further restricted progress. RED is at a critical stage, finally having reached the point of institutionalization within MOEC:  the GON has given permission for 20 permanent positions and MOEC has ordered RED to move from its present location and merge with the Training Sub-Division. If these processes are well managed, RED will emerge as a professional institution of great value; if poorly, RED will be so weakened as to no longer merit A.I.D. support.  The project should delay development of a mathematics course and focus instead on areas essential to RED's institutionalization - staffing, organizational locus, ability to serve MOEC's needs in distance education, further development of an English language program attractive to a broader audience than teachers, and the identification of new programming directions.

"Evaluates project to upgrade the capacity of North Yemen's Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries (MAF) to support increased fruit production.  External evaluation covers 2/83-2/87 and is based on site visits, document review, and interviews with involved personnel. Overall performance has been unsatisfactory.  Although the subcontractor, California State Polytechnical University/Pomona (CP) ugpraded its staff, procedures, monitoring, and relations with field and USAID/Y staff in 1985, CP's relationship with MAF remains weak and future staff changes may nullify these advances, brought about mainly through the efforts of two key (CP and USAID/Y) personnel.  CP has had serious problems in fielding experienced staff, which resulted in delays, technical and managerial errors, and, ultimately, a loss of credibility with the MAF.  The Consortium for International Development (CID), the prime contractor, has provided little support. USAID/Y management has been weak, as the Mission in effect abrogated its responsibilities to CID and CP (their performance raises serious questions about A.I.D. reliance on Title XII universities for project design and management functions).  The Mission's acquiescence to MAF's tree production goals and plans to build a third horticulture station diverted project resources and further impeded progress. MAF's production goals have greatly undermined key applied research goals.  MAF still lacks vital technical information, a lack which has contributed to two production disasters -  loss of 180,000 trees in Al Jarouba to citrus canker and the project's introduction of crown gall disease at Al Irra due to a failure to listen to plant protection advisors. Positive economic impacts are unlikely.  Area under production has increased, but yields have decreased, while lack of available inputs (fertilizer, pesticides, water, and credit) and MAF extension inefficiencies (despite good TA in extension) have constrained small farmer fruit production.  Demand for trees exceeds supply, but MAF's distribution system, while far-reaching, is inefficient and expensive, and MAF's low tree prices preclude private sector entry into the tree production market. Short-term training has been helpful; long-term training is far behind its unrealistic schedule.  Little progress has been made in institution building (except in plant protection, which also benefited from German TA), due to MAF staffing problems and the project's emphasis on technical rather than managerial and organizational skills.  It is doubtful, given MAF budget and staff, that the horticultural stations can be sustained if MAF assumes total responsibility.  Transfer of station management and research functions to Yemen's Agricultural Research Authority is suggested.","Companion evaluation summary: PD-AAX-528","Special Evaluation","Documents","279-0052-C-00-7012-00","","1/1/1987 12:00:00 AM","","Fruit trees|Agricultural production|Horticulture","Yemen","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAV526.pdf","3,500 KB","005159 - Labat-Anderson, Inc.","","008624 - USAID.

"Evaluates private-sector commodity import program (CIP), part of a structural adjustment program to provide balance of payments support to the Government of Kenya (GOK) and promote economic reform.  Midterm external evaluation covers the period 9/84-1/87 and is based on site visits, document review, and interviews with USAID/K, GOK, bank, and private sector personnel. Although the CIP did not become operational until 8/85 due to expected GOK delays in meeting conditions precedent and certain covenants, the program is now progressing steadily, with $777,327 of FY84 funds disbursed as of 1/87.  Conditions precedent for FY85 have not yet been met, but a resolution is expected very soon.  While the pace of the program has been too slow to accomplish macroeconomic objectives, the projections made during CIP design were unrealistic.  Demand for U.S. products is fully adequate and at expected levels.  With the current application rate of $1-$1.3 million per month, and the possibility of increases, FY84/85 funds should be fully committed by early in 1988. Firms participating in the CIP are pleased with the program and report positive effects of CIP commodities on employment, sales, and productivity.  However, about half the firms interviewed reported difficulty in obtaining bank credit to participate in the CIP, a situation that might be rectified by using the local currency-programmed Credit Guarantee Programme to make credit available to clients who would otherwise be unable to use the program. Another obstacle to CIP success is that its procedures and benefits are not well understood by many Kenyan importers.  Five banks are actively participating in the CIP, but to widely varying degrees, possibily because of differences in bank clientele and in staff ability to explain the CIP to prospective clients.  Two other banks have very low participation; one, perhaps both, should be dropped and their funds reallocated to more active institutions.  At present, however, there is little incentive for the banks to aggressively market the CIP since their only income is from letter of credit opening fees.  New and better financial incentives for the banks may be needed. Management and monitoring of the CIP have generally been excellent. If progress is also being made with regard to policy reform, it is recommended that the CIP be continued in FY88 and after at about $15 million annually.  While the decision to continue the CIP should take account a recommended study of the CIP's development and beneficiary impact, it is important to preclude or at least minimize any gap in the availability of funds.","Attached to PD-AAV-547","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","2/1/1987 12:00:00 AM","","Commodity import programs|Private enterprises|Economic development|Beneficiary interviews","Kenya","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAV547A.pdf","3,876 KB","008565 - USAID.

"Final Mission report on a project (1980-9/86) to increase food fish production in small fisheries in Indonesia. The project's accomplishments were satisfactory, although its influence at the national level cannot easily be measured.  While several of the 6 subprojects (SP's) operated at levels substantially less than projected, most major outputs were met and fish production generated by the project was sufficient to meet demand.  The Pilot Flake Ice Plant SP, for example, was delayed 2 years by construction and equipment problems and was forced to operate well below capacity, but was still able to produce enough ice for the projected number of participants. Similarly, due to lack of GOI support for maintenance and facility improvement, the Freshwater Shrimp Production SP did not produce as many fry as expected, but because the market for fry was considerably smaller than was first estimated the demand was met. Other SP's were more successful.  The Tambak Extension Service SP improved the availability of new technologies to tambak (small pond) fish farmers, despite the large size of the territory the SP had to cover, and the Floating Fish Cage Culture SP introduced new and improved technologies for the production of fish in floating cages.  The Rice Fish Culture SP improved fingerling production at Kerasaan hatchery, although production at Ambarita hatchery was constrained by economic, management, and ecological problems. A final SP, the Artisanal Fishery Management SP, was to develop a coordinated plan for fisheries management and collect species and marketing data, but proved almost impossible to implement because of changing government regulations, the large scope of the SP, and the need for long-term baseline studies. Among the technologies introduced by the various SP's were a fish feed formula, hormone-induced spawning, shrimp-fish polyculture, and a water aeration-circulation technology for freshwater shrimp production. It appears the project was remiss, however, in programming the socioeconomic pre- and poststudies that are needed to upgrade fisheries management.  Nor was enough emphasis put on training GOI staff to continue the data collection/analysis and management activities begun under the project. The project teaches that Indonesian fish farmers are capable of using new technologies to improve production, but that the GOI has difficulties in providing enough funding and management support to be of much help.  In the absence of GOI support, better research needs to be carried out in order to get a fuller understanding of existing private sector fish farming systems and their potential for development, and future activities need to be concentrated in smaller, more manageable, areas.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","5/1/1987 12:00:00 AM","","Fish hatcheries|Fish culture|Fishery development|Fishery management|Technological innovations","Indonesia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAV587.pdf","199 KB","008558 - USAID.

"Evaluates the cost-effectiveness of renewable energy technologies (RET's) used in A.I.D. projects.  Special evaluation is based on review of project documents, especially evaluations and audits. Results varied widely.  (1) Photovoltaic (PV) systems seem to be cost-competitive only for specialized uses (excluding water pumping) where electric power is costly or non-existent, e.g., isolated health clinics.  Further, management and labor requirements could prevent widespread acceptance of PV units. (2) Conventional wind machines are feasible in certain cases (e.g., water pumping), but only if there is enough wind at the site.  (3) Solar water heating, while limited in scope, is cost-effective, requires relatively little maintenance, and, if used widely, can have a quantifiable effect on energy problems. Other solar techologies have proven unpromising.  (4) Given a suitable site and the necessary design, installation, and maintenance resources, small hydro can be a practical source of electricity and have a major developmental impact. (5) The need for long-term protection of the environment seems to make forestry plantations an essential option despite their cost and mixed success in A.I.D. projects.  Due to the managerial problems they typically encounter, these projects seem to require qualified technical backstopping.  They are often cost-effective when part of forestry schemes with larger economic and environmental goals. (6) Producer gas is cost-effective but requires maintenance and support services which outweigh this RET's limited, short-term benefits. Such projects are difficult to justify.  (7) Household biogas and woodstove projects have generally not been successful except in countries (e.g., Nepal, India) able to afford the high level of maintenance and support required.  Industrial and large-scale biogas projects should be delegated to the private sector.  (8) Due in part to technical and consumer acceptability problems, early wood/charcoal stove projects were only modestly successful.  More recent metal stove projects have proven more promising where supported by the private sector; such support is also important in fuelwood/forestry programs and would be useful in wind system maintenance.  A key factor is the extent to which users can keep the stoves operational. Despite some notable failures, biomass fuel, wind, small hydro, and, more recently, gasification RET's have met crucial local needs for energy.  The ultimate cost-effectiveness of these RET's is yet to be fully ascertained. Lessons learned are that:  of all energy programs, fuelwood and forestry projects have the most organizational problems; a simple technology (e.g., solar dryers) can generate an impossibly complicated project; and project success depends on continuity and especially on the effective involvement of project staff and energy users.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","3/1/1987 12:00:00 AM","","Renewable energy resources|Alternative energy technology|Energy costs|Small scale energy systems|Cost benefit analysis|Energy conservation|Cost-effectiveness","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAV570.pdf","836 KB","001257 - Volunteers in Technical Assistance, Inc.

"Evaluates project to strengthen primary health care (PHC) systems in 20 African countries.  Final, external evaluation primarily covers 1983-86 and is based on site visits and interviews with participating officials and beneficiaries. The project succeeded in its main objective of building a consensus for and increasing competency in PHC in participating countries (PC's). Two signal achievements were (1) the use of the training of trainers (TOT) method and a competency-based experiential learning model to build PC capacities in PHC training and (2) development of a network of African trainer consultants.  Some 2,400 persons took part in regional, national, and local TOT programs. Several training institutions were strengthened, especially through faculty development.  Strong TOT capacities for PHC were developed at Regional Training Centers (RTC's) in Lagos and Lome, TOT capacities in health management were developed in 4 institutions, and the curricula of Cuttington University College and 2 other institutions were reoriented towards PHC.  A continuing education program was initiated at the Western African College of Nursing (WACN), and staff of WACN and of 2 other postbasic nursing schools were trained as consultants on PHC training for nurses.  Also, health management training was introduced and pedagogy revised at 7 management training facilities which previously had no health programs. The project also:  developed informal networks of epidemiologists and PHC researchers by sponsoring conferences on these topics; provided applied research training and grants; produced several quality training manuals (some are now standard texts); and developed a materials production capacity at the Lome RTC. A Review Committee with representatives from WHO, A.I.D., and all 20 PC's met every 2 years to review broader goals; a smaller Coordinating Committee met annually to review work plans and project reports. Despite a lack of continuity in the representation of some PC's, the committees contributed to intraregional sharing of resources and ideas. PC's benefited to varying extents, depending on the degree to which they chose or were able to participate; participation was influenced by political issues and amount involvement by local WHO and A.I.D. personnel.","Work order no. 16|Abstract available under PD-BAW-773","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","PDC-1406-I-16-4068-00","","2/1/1987 12:00:00 AM","","Primary health care|Management training|Medical education|Teacher training|Institution building|Regional development|Educational facilities|Beneficiary count|Beneficiary interviews","Africa south of Sahara","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAV658.pdf","2,362 KB","000673 - International Science and Technology Institute, Inc.

"Final Mission report on a subproject (10/83-9/86) to help Chad's Ministry of Public Works rehabilitate the National Roads Office's (OFNAR) workshop and repair 18 pieces of heavy equipment. The subproject (SP) achieved its purpose of strengthening OFNAR's road maintenance capacity and thereby facilitating the transport of food, medicines, and other goods to Chad's drought- and war-stricken interior.  Phase I (10/83-12/84), which was implemented by Africare, succeeded in repairing directly or indirectly 24 pieces of heavy equipment, organizing and repairing the central workshop, assembling and providing technical on-the-job training for Chadian workcrews, and compiling workplans and inventories of tools and equipment, despite low worker morale and productivity, and delays in construction and in procuring imported parts.  By transforming the workshop into a fully operational repair facility, the SP made a major contribution to OFNAR's ability to maintain Chad's road system. The severe problems with poor work attendance during phase I were ameliorated by arranging a supplementary Food For Work program and by providing worker transport.  In its final report, Africare recommended that worker productivity be further improved through a system of rewards and punishments and through more training (refresher courses and on-the-job sessions).  Africare also recommended a follow-on project to build on the improved work habits developed by OFNAR personnel during the SP. Phase II (1/85-9/86) was implemented by USAID/C using two personal services contractors (a spare parts inventory specialist and a master mechanic/shop superintendent) and a U.S. Department of Transportation engineer.  Although the contractors arrived 2-3 months late (due to difficulties in recruiting technically skilled French-speaking personnel), this phase successfully laid the groundwork for start-up of the Strengthening Road Maintenance Project (6770050). The SP's programming method (umbrella financing and an AID-approved project paper, followed by activity justification papers and further defined by individually approved work plans) was an effective and flexible method for rapid response to Chad's drought- and war-related emergency.  This was further enhanced by Africare's extensive capabilities as a PVO operational in Chad following the civil disturbances of 1979-82.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","2/1/1987 12:00:00 AM","","Road maintenance|Construction equipment|Equipment maintenance","Chad","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDBBG569.pdf","139 KB","008528 - USAID.

"Presents final Mission report on a rural electrification (RE) project (3/78-12/84) in Indonesia. Results were mixed.  On the positive side, all 10 targeted rural electrical systems are in operation; more than 948 persons from both the State Power Company (PLN) and from Rural Electrical Cooperatives (REC's) were trained in all aspects of electric systems operations; and all loan-funded materials and equipment were delivered to project sites (although not all have been put to use).  To assure the affordability of electric services, both the PLN and the REC's offered low-interest loans to rural households for wiring costs.  PLN consumers were also offered loans to cover the up front payment, the connection charge, and a consumer's deposit; these loans were not needed in REC areas, since REC's do not charge for connections. On the negative side, only 2,953 km of the targeted 5,863 km of distribution line were built by the revised PACD of 12/84, and these served only 69,467 consumers in 387 villages, vs. a target of 183,000 consumers in 700 villages.  Specifically, PLN built 69% of the targeted distribution lines and reached 45.7% of targeted consumers; corresponding figures for the REC's were 18.9% and 18.7%.  The major reasons for the slow achievement of outputs were the lengthy process of procurement through international tender (a process complicated by the fact that A.I.D. funded 119 supply contracts under the project), and the unavailability of local wood poles. After the PACD, the Government of Indonesia (GOI) committed itself to complete the project as originally planned and USAID/I agreed to fund an additional year of TA to monitor the use of AID-funded commodities.  By the end of 1986, PLN had reached over 132,000 consumers and the REC's over 25,000.  The GOI and USAID/I have now agreed to provide $5.4 million in P.L. 480 Title I proceeds to procure diesel generator sets to enable the three project REC's to serve the original target of 50,000 consumers. Due to the project delays, the social and economic impacts of RE have not yet been significant.  However, the provision of electricity has resulted in longer night activity, improved lighting, greater household security, and increased business productivity and incomes.  Further, the project - the GOI's first major RE program - has successfully triggered a nationwide RE program, funded mostly from the GOI's own resources. The project taught the importance of: procurement time, especially when using international tender; and (2) avoiding the temptation to show progress by fully staffing the consultant team before they are needed.","Loan no. 497-T-052","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","5/1/1987 12:00:00 AM","","Rural development|Electrification|Electric power distribution|Cooperatives|Limited data","Indonesia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAV785.pdf","139 KB","008558 - USAID.

"Most of the agricultural credit programs funded by A.I.D. between 1950 and 1985 encountered serious implementation problems and failed to meet their objectives.  This report, the first in a series of reference guides for project managers, summarizes A.I.D.'s experiences with small farmer credit and its current policy, and describes two new approaches to providing agricultural credit. The lessons learned to date revolve around four issues.  (1) Certain pre-conditions must be met if a credit program is to succeed:  favorable market conditions and government pricing policies; adequate postharvest support; sufficient land and labor resources among target farmers; and the existence of an appropriate, profitable agricultural technology. (2) Positive real interest rates should be charged; this is a fundamental lesson, but often requires long-term, sector-wide policy reform. (3) In the area of loan administration, A.I.D.'s experience suggests certain steps (outlined herein) that can help project managers design an appropriate loan portfolio, identify possible alternatives to big banking institutions, minimize transaction costs, protect against inflation and bad debt, and address equity concerns.  (4)  Standard methods of evaluating credit programs are costly and inefficient; perhaps evaluation should focus less on changes in farm income and more on the development of self-sustaining rural financial institutions. Two experimental approaches to funding agricultural credit programs - rural savings and private equity investment - are currently underway. (1) Early results from a program in Honduras and the Dominican Republic suggest that local agricultural banks and credit unions can successfully mobilize deposits in conjunction with their lending, although they might require substantial technical assistance and training.  (2) A USAID/Honduras project is testing the feasibility of establishing a private company to share investment risks with small livestock farmers. Appendices include excerpts from A.I.D. policy papers and annotated bibliographies (along with ordering instructions). This report, and others in the Project Manager's Reference series, will be made available to A.I.D.

"Evaluates project, implemented by a South African NGO and a U.S. contractor (Birch &amp; Davis - B&amp;D) to develop training materials and provide training and counseling for disadvantaged Black entrepreneurs in South Africa.  Mid-term external evaluation covers the period 9/83-4/87 and is based primarily on document review and interviews with A.I.D. and implementing agency personnel. Substantial changes in management and implementation are needed if the project is to achieve its goals.  Completion of curricula and training materials for entrepreneurs, instructors, and counselors is more than a year behind schedule, in part because B&amp;D made limited use of materials already available in South Africa.  Materials that have been completed (e.g., the basic accounting curiculum) are often too sophisticated for entrepreneurs' basic skill levels, and are designed to last 3 weeks, not the 3 days that entrepreneurs have indicated they can afford to be away from their businesses. The South African NGO has had difficulty recruiting trainers and counselors (both as employees and volunteers); its procedures for selecting candidates are not well-defined and few of those selected have actual business experience.  Also, as B&amp;D's instructor/counselor training packages are not complete, this phase of the project - and consequently entrepreneur training - are far behind schedule.  Although a few entrepreneurs have received training in pilot courses, and a modest program is due to begin soon in the Orange Free State, the project has not yet formulated a strategy, timetable, or estimate of resource requirements for delivering training to entrepreneurs. A steering committee to coordinate activities between B&amp;D and the NGO has not been established, and the NGO's unfamiliarity with basic project information contained in B&amp;D's contract has led it to take a less active role in project decisionmaking than is required.  B&amp;D's Project Coordinator seems ineffective at improving interagency cooperation. Although institutional strengthening of the NGO is one of B&amp;D's project responsibilities, the NGO stills lack sufficient management capacity to deliver training and counseling on a nationwide basis; nor are its financial resources adequate to ensure project sustainability when A.I.D. funding ends. A total of 29 recommendations are made, covering curriculum and training materials development, selection and training of trainers, counselor development, entrepreneur training, and project management.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-1096-I-14-5049-00","","4/1/1987 12:00:00 AM","","Management training|Curriculum design|Entrepreneurs|Racial groups|Private sector|Counseling services|Educational materials|Trainees|Teacher training|Training personnel|Private organizations|Project sustainability|Management development","South Africa","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDBBG907.pdf","1,983 KB","006727 - Development Alternatives, Inc.

"Evaluates project to strengthen Mali's livestock sector. External mid-term evaluation covers the period through 10/86 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with project officials. The project is progressing very well, except for one component, the On-farm Cattle Feeding Credit Program, which is to be terminated.  While this program is technically feasible, serious flaws in its management have resulted in decapitalization - in 1984/85 some 25% of farmers were unable to repay their loans for subsidized feed.  Nor have field support functions been transferred to Rural Development Organizations as planned. Management has otherwise been generally good, though costly, and has benefited immensely from financial, logistic, and planning/oversight systems installed by the Management Development Support Team (MDST) - even though USDA's performance on the MDST (which is jointly staffed by advisors from USDA and Chemonics, Inc.) has been disappointing.  The high-level Joint Management Committee (JMC) is also a positive innovation in donor/recipient coordination, but has been too involved in administrative details.  The project's focus on implementation has limited the development of the Ministry of Natural Resources and Livestock's (MRNE) management skills.  These should be now emphasized; attention should also be given to introducing a management information system, reducing management costs, and improving USAID/M-MRNE communications by strengthening the JMC's policy while reducing its involvement in day-to-day management. The MDST should serve as an independent advisory body, with particular responsibility for strengthening the management of the MRNE's Veterinary Extension Service. The Forage and Livestock Production Research component has identified some promising legumes for forage production packages and has laid a basis for future work in integrated crop/livestock systems; it will now focus more on commercial dairy operations in sub-humid areas and on coordinating research with other agencies. Construction and equipping of expanded diagnostic and research facilities at the Central Veterinary Laboratory are nearly complete and staff have been trained.  Stronger links to the diagnostic service and to veterinary extension agents are needed, however. Thanks mainly to project-provided equipment and supplies, the Veterinary Extension Service has increased vaccination coverage by 50%. Key needs are to reduce costs, increase system efficiency, and develop a privatization plan. The project should continue, with certain mid-course corrections. A follow-on, to emphasize the livestock sector's self-sustainability, is recommended.","French ed.: PD-AAV-895","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","2/1/1987 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural research|Agricultural extension|Veterinary medicine|Management development|Agricultural credit|Agricultural management|Livestock|Beneficiary interviews","Mali","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAV894.pdf","14,019 KB","000594 - Institute for Development Anthropology, Inc.","","008575 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to strengthen the capacity of PVO's in Thailand to address the needs of socially and economically disadvantaged groups. Mid-term evaluation covers the period 10/84-5/87, and is based on document review, subproject (SP) site visits, and interviews with beneficiaries and participating officials. The project is playing a significant and positive role in assisting PVO's.  Although the majority of project grants have gone to U.S. PVO's, the project has gradually expanded to include the growing number of indigenous PVO's (IPVO's) that are development (as opposed to welfare) oriented, including less well-known, action-oriented IPVO's that are based outside of Bangkok and have good potential to promote development in poorer regions of the country. The IPVO's have gained valuable experience by administering SP's, either by themselves or jointly with a U.S. PVO, and have also received TA from a project consultant.  Workshops sponsored by the project have proved a less successful institution-building strategy, however, having been too academic and too oriented toward A.I.D.'s needs, rather than those of the IPVO's. The 12 currently financed SP's are all reasonably effective and all directed toward the disadvantaged.  Most are being carried out in the poorer regions of the country, often with handicapped groups or minorities.  Although most of the SP's develop the capacities of individuals, some work directly with government agencies and others encourage community participation or the strengthening of local institutions; these last appear to be the most sustainable. It is recommended that USAID/T simplify and speed up its procedures for administering the project to eliminate barriers to participation by less experienced IPVO's (some steps have been taken in this direction already), and clarify its SP criteria to reflect its concern with development of the rural poor.  USAID/T should also encourage U.S. PVO's to play a larger support role in the institutional development of IPVO's and should modify its training approach, e.g., by encouraging IPVO's to exchange SP experiences, by utilizing the training resources of other groups interested in IPVO's (including IPVO's not receiving A.I.D. funds in training events), by developing simpler training methods; and by placing more emphasis on regional and grass roots development.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","6/1/1987 12:00:00 AM","","Private voluntary organizations|Indigenization|Institution building|Development projects|Beneficiary interviews","Thailand","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAV899.pdf","4,705 KB","000981 - Pragma Corp.","","008613 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to strengthen public and private sector family planning (FP) services in Costa Rica.  Interim evaluation covers the period 1983-86 and is based on document review, field visits, a beneficiary survey, and interviews with officials. It is difficult to assess project progress - due to the Ministry of Health's (MOH) failure to collect comprehensive service statistics - but it appears that progress, while minor, is being made in all areas and that the prospects for success at project completion are improving.  The only figures currently available show that FP is being delivered in 311 of a targeted 400 government facilities and that efforts to make a private contraceptive supplier (PROFAMILIA) partially self-sufficient are still at an early stage.  However, the implementing agency, the Costa Rican Demographic Association (ADC), has done a commendable job of training Government of Costa Rica (GOCR) health workers, conducting research, and increasing public FP awareness. Public sector FP delivery has been constrained by the integration of MOH facilities with those of the GOCR's Social Security Agency (CCSS); the latter agency has problems in its delivery chain and evidently does not see FP as a priority.  Private sector contraceptive marketing has been hindered by GOCR restrictions on mass media contraceptive advertising and by regulations concerning the registration of oral contraceptives; the latter have limited PROFAMILIA sales to one product - condoms. Moreover, project sustainability is in doubt.  The GOCR, due in part to its financial problems, has no plans to take over contraceptive procurement.  Training, research, and information, education, and communication may also falter. Recommendations address the project's need to:  (1) obtain better data and analyses regarding training, IEC, and impacts on women; (2) explore means of recovering training, research, IEC, and contraceptive marketing costs; (2) computerize contraceptive logistic management and gradually lessen the reliance on ADC for contraceptive procurement; (3) review curricula and initiate a training of trainers program within the MOH, CCSS, or the Ministry of Education; (4) improve the collection of service statistics and upgrade research capabilities and the dissemination of findings; (5) study the possibility of PROFAMILIA sales of related, non-contraceptive products, of FP services at the workplace, and of innovative FP educational methods; and (6) upgrade ADC management.  USAID/CR should encourage the GOCR to institutionalize and better coordinate FP services and to legalize contraceptive advertising.","Attached to PD-AAV-909|Project title: Population technical assistance (POPTECH)","Special Evaluation","Documents","DPE-3024-C-00-4083-00","","4/1/1987 12:00:00 AM","","Family planning policy|Family planning services|Family planning clinics|Family planning research|Commercial retail sale of contraceptives|Social marketing|Clinic-based contraceptive distribution|Technical training","Costa Rica","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAV909A.pdf","1,248 KB","000673 - International Science and Technology Institute, Inc.

"A.I.D. and other donors mounted a massive emergency effort to feed the 1.5 million Chadians affected by the 1984-85 drought. Despite its shortcomings, the program was a success, according to this evaluation. Based on secondary sources review and interviews and observations in Washington, D.C.  and in the field, the evaluation presents detailed findings, conclusions, and recommendations in five key areas -- timing, management, impact, health and nutrition, and transition to development. Timing.  Due to a lack of early warning, emergency preparedness, and contingency plans, available amounts of emergency food were insufficient in late 1984 and early 1985, diluting program effectiveness.  Chad's weak transportation and logistical systems -- compounded by political problems -- proved major obstacles. Management.  The management strategy of using the World Food Programme (WFP) and PVO's, supported by a network of action committees under the Government of Chad (GOC), as the main implementing agencies proved very successful.  Fuller and earlier delegation by AID/W to USAID/C of contracting responsibility would have helped avoid delays. Impact.  Although insufficient in late 1984 and early 1985, emergency food assistance was targeted successfully and saved many lives, especially among the needy who received food in targeted programs of the WFP and PVO's rather than through general distribution.  Resettlement programs successfully limited the creation of spontaneous camps; some of those resettled were taught productive agricultural techniques. Health and nutrition.  The GOC depended heavily on donors and PVO's to define the health and nutritional impacts of the famine. PVO's in particular did an excellent job of identifying geographical areas for emergency food distribution.  However, lack of infrastructure greatly inhibited health efforts.  Vitamin A deficiency was neither assessed nor treated, nor was oral rehydration therapy used extensively. Transition to development.  The shift from emergency relief to development was facilitated by mechanisms such as food for work and resettlement.  The transition needs, however, to account for persons still at risk and to develop a strategy in case the drought recurs in 1986. Included are 10 general recommendations for future emergency food distribution programs.","Related document: PN-AAV-790","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","6/1/1987 12:00:00 AM","","Emergency food distribution|Drought|Famine early warning systems|Development program implementation|Disaster relief|Beneficiary count|Beneficiary interviews","Chad","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAL091.pdf","3,365 KB","006434 - Devres, Inc.","","003433 - USAID.

"An emergency food aid program of A.I.D. and other donors helped the Government of Mali (GOM) combat the 1984-85 drought, the worst on record in that food-deficit, drought-prone country. This evaluation, based on document review and interviews, provides findings and recommendations in key areas of the program, to which A.I.D. allocated 95 MT's of emergency food (worth $46 million). Poor timing reduced program impact and cost-effectiveness. A 6-month delay in the arrival of emergency food at port -- a problem compounded by lack of contingency planning -- led to shortfalls in the emergency food available in the period (March-June) before the rains and again early in the July-August rainy season. USAID/M devised an effective food distribution strategy, which consisted of: using the well-established mechanisms of the Mali Grain Marketing Board (OPAM) to distribute food supplies in urban areas (where they were augmented by monetization of Title II foodgrain); using indigenous private voluntary organizations and donor agencies to manage free distribution in rural areas; and promoting close donor cooperation with the GOM. This strategy overcame the serious deficiencies of prior programs and got emergency food supplies to some 2 million people. Distribution was well targeted, rations were appropriate and sufficient, and losses and misuse of food were small. However, an inadequate needs assessment led both the GOM and donors to seriously underestimate the need for emergency food in rural areas. Also, while donor coordination was strong at the national level (despite strained GOM and USAID/M resources), local-level planning largely ad hoc and uncoordinated. Even so, the program was decisive in averting massive rural famine and exodus. USAID/M also helped establish an effective system of cholera control and treatment and financed important studies to assess Mali's overall drought situation and its 1985-86 agricultural situation. The report includes general recommendations to relate emergency food programs in Mali more closely to national food strategies, as well as several detailed annexes.","Earlier ed.: PN-AAV-789","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","6/1/1987 12:00:00 AM","","Emergency food distribution|Drought|Famine|Disaster preparedness|Urban areas|Rural areas|Beneficiary count","Mali","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAL092.pdf","8,087 KB","006434 - Devres, Inc.","","003433 - USAID.

"A.I.D's massive emergency food program to combat the 1984-85 drought in Sudan is evaluated in this report. Although the program critically benefitted millions of people, it could have had greater impact and been more cost effective. A.I.D.'s plans to have foods in position prior to the rainy season failed, causing serious delays and shortfalls in food delivery.  As a partial result, timeliness was a continuing problem -- nearly 12 months elapsed between each USAID/S request and full distribution of the foods requested.  An added problem was the inability of other agencies and the host government to meet their obligations on time. Program management was good given the small and inexperienced USAID/S staff, AID/W's inflexible management system, and a decision to coordinate with other donors at the country level (thus placing the burden on USAID/S).  USAID/S effectively used the private sector, local governments, and private voluntary organizations (PVO's) in managing the program, a strategy that helped develop local food emergency capacities. On the other hand, USAID/S's failure to link the food emergency with long-term development led to very late rehabilitation responses.  PVO's proved especially effective, but private contractors were reluctant to deliver food to remote areas.  Rural people, especially in those areas, received too little food and did not receive it when needed. remote villages by 11/85, just as most of the neediest had exhausted their monetary and often their nutritional reserves. The program did substantially limit migration out of villages, but initiated supplemental feeding late and health inputs hardly at all.  Title II monetization in urban areas did not work well due to lack of distribution and financial controls.","Earlier ed.: PN-AAV-791","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","6/1/1987 12:00:00 AM","","Emergency food distribution|Disaster relief|Drought|Famine|Management operations|Disaster planning|Rural areas|Private voluntary organizations|Beneficiary count|Beneficiary interviews","Sudan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAL093.pdf","11,583 KB","006434 - Devres, Inc.","","003433 - USAID.

"Although a developed communications system is central to increased growth in isolated rural areas, only the recent introduction of earth-satellite technology has made such networks feasible.  Utilizing beneficiary interviews and site visits, this final report evaluates the Rural Communications Services Project (RCSP), a pilot project to establish a telecommunications network in San Martin, an isolated high jungle area in northeastern Peru. RCSP, as implemented by the Empresa Nacional de Telecomunicaciones del Peru (ENTEL), installed earth stations at three major cities in San Martin, and linked four secondary towns to the stations through radio telephone service.  While project duration was expected to be three years, site selection and installation alone took three years, and the project itself lasted six years.  Cost underestimates also contributed to the delay in implementation, and once the equipment was installed, technical problems caused further delays.  The radio telephone equipment was especially prone to failure, although it should be noted that performance of the system improved markedly over the course of the project. Despite these problems, there was immediate demand for the systems, especially from business and commercial interests. During the project's first two and one half years, some 207,441 calls were placed, generating $272,000 in revenue. Audioteleconferencing (ATC) services, developed in cooperation with the Ministries of Agriculture, Health, and Education, were used by the Ministries and ENTEL, primarily as a substitute for face-to-face training. Despite demand, however, system revenues were unable to cover operating costs, let alone contribute to capital recovery during the first two years of operation.  Benefits to individuals and communities were harder to assess, although communication alternatives (e.g., letters, telegrams) were more expensive than phone calls, and interviews suggested that the value of the call exceeded its price.  Similarly, the cost of face-to-face training far exceeds that of a typical ATC seminar. While the evaluation concludes that the RCSP makes a good argument for projects of this type, it warns that transfer of sophisticated communication technology is very difficult and requires thorough planning and innovative management practices to be successful.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","2/1/1987 12:00:00 AM","","Communications infrastructure|Telephone systems|Telecommunications technology|Pilot projects|Rural areas|Satellite communications|Beneficiary interviews","Peru","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAX685.pdf","4,107 KB","005306 - Florida State University.

"Based on desk reviews and/or field studies of 102 projects related to women, this report synthesizes the results of A.I.D. experience since 1973 in targeting women in development (WID) activities.  The major finding is that mainstream projects that ensure women's participation in accordance with their roles within the project's baseline situation are more likely to achieve their aims than projects that do not. Agricultural projects that delivered resources directly to women according to their role in the local farming system were much more likely to achieve their purpose than projects which did not. Employment projects (i.e., projects to generate income or to provide job training and credit) that adapted mainstream training and credit programs to women's needs were more successful than projects designed specifically for women. Similarly, the success of energy and water/sanitation projects was dependent upon adequate knowledge of women's responsibilities and patterns of water/fuel use rather than on strictly technical criteria. In education projects, the level of women's education clearly correlated with improvements in health, hygiene, nutrition, and family planning, as well as higher productivity and employment. The correlation between the level of female participation and achievement of immediate project purposes was difficult to document, however, since most of the reports studied overlooked gender disparities in enrollment when assessing educational institution-building projects. A review of the relationship of gender variables to the achievement of socioeconomic goals found that understanding gender factors in agricultural production - differential access to and control over resources, gender-linked labor constraints, control of income from crop sales, and differing stakes in and incentives for increasing output - is crucial to successful technology transfer.  Also crucial at the level of socioeconomic impact is an understanding of the various sources of and control over income and of gender roles in consumption. Ten practical suggestions are made to improve gender analysis techniques, delivery of resources to women, and tracking of women's participation in project activities.  A concluding review of the various types of women's projects finds that:  (1) mainstream projects with ""gender sensitive"" designs are the most effective at meeting WID objectives; (2) women-only components in larger projects can be effective, although they may lead to tokenism if gender differences are ignored; and (3) women-only projects tend to be small in scope and costly in staff time, and are best suited for the delivery of training.","V.

"Evaluates the effectiveness of seminars on housing policy for Central American private and public sector officials, as developed by the Regional Housing and Urban Development Office/Central America (RHUDO/CA) and the Instituto Centroamericano de Administracion de Empresas (INCAE). Evaluation is based on document review and meetings with project officials and beneficiaries, and covers the period 3/85-6/87. The INCAE seminars for the most part have been very effective, due to a number of factors.  For example, the program was jointly developed by RHUDO/CA and INCAE, and so reflects RHUDO/CA's agenda; participants have been from appropriate institutions around the region, due largely to INCAE's ability to recruit key officials as participants; the seminars have been effectively promoted by INCAE, which chose themes that were appropriate and attractive to the participants; the case study method used in the seminars maximized active participation by those who attended; and the seminar faculty were generally knowledgeable and experienced teachers. The seminars have suffered from certain weaknesses, however.  Few concrete solutions to specific housing problems (e.g., housing finance, municipal development, etc.) were presented; the schedules of some seminars were too intense for the topics covered; and some faculty did not know the material well. The impact of these seminars on housing and urban development in Central America is difficult to measure, but clearly (1) 350 regional housing professionals have spent two or three days in intensive study of the problems with which they must work; (2) institutional and professional networking have been enhanced; (3) levels of awareness have been raised, new approaches suggested, and new perspectives opened; and (4) the policy dialogue that took place contributed to Housing Guaranty project implementation. RHUDO/CA needs to:  (1) give INCAE more guidance in selecting the substance of seminars (particularly important is the role of the private sector in low cost housing production); (2) draw up a series of written agreements with INCAE about the program and seminar development; (3) finance follow-up TA to take advantage of the momentum created by the seminars; and (4) collect the considerable documentation which the seminars have generated. Finally, INCAE is encouraged to have faculty provide more guidance in small group discussions.

"Evaluates project to strengthen the data collection and analysis capacities of Egypt's Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) - primarily those of the Undersecretariat of Agricultural Economics and Statistics (UAES) - and to establish a national agricultural data base.  External evaluation covers the period 8/80-2/87 and is based in part on document review. The project, which is due to end in 8/87, has not lived up to expectations.  There has been no real progress toward a national data base, and the data analysis component has been a disappointment as well. Although the MOA's understanding of microcomputer technology has increased, the actual use of computers on real problems has been limited.  Nonetheless, because of recent institutional, organizational, personnel, and management changes (especially by the MOA, but also by USAID/E), there is good potential for UAES to develop into a dynamic, cohesive data collection and analysis unit - provided that strong USAID/E support to the unit is continued under a related project, the National Agricultural Support Project (NASP), and that the existing PASA with the U.S.D.A. is extended. Several factors have combined to encourage this optimism, including inter alia, the recent establishment of UAES's Official Agricultural Statistics Information Service (OASIS), the relocation of the Agricultural Economics Research Institute to the same building as UAES, and the procurement for OASIS of a sophisticated mini-computer mainframe with several remote terminals. Recommendations for follow-on support under the NASP include, inter alia:  focusing of data collection and analysis on activities that will contribute to establishment of a national agricultural data base; provision of top-level TA in policy analysis, commodity analysis monitoring, and assessment of ongoing agricultural reforms; and intensive training of agricultural economists.  Several detailed recommendations are provided as well.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","2/1/1987 12:00:00 AM","","Institution building|Agricultural surveys|Computers|Data collection|Statistical data|Data analysis|Government departments|Statistical analysis|Policy analysis|Limited data","Egypt","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAV993.pdf","6,205 KB","","","000558 - Egypt.

"A.I.D.'s direct agricultural assistance to Senegal (which dates mostly from the mid- and late 1970's) generally has not met its objectives of increasing crop or animal production, but the Agency's more recent initiatives in policy reform and nonproject assistance have benefited the rural sector by contributing to liberalized agricultural marketing and pricing, credit restructuring, and reductions in government debt.  Thus concludes this review of A.I.D's impact in rural Senegal from 1961 through the present.  The review examines A.I.D.'s program in Senegal (volume, content, sectoral distribution) in some detail, explains A.I.D's assistance strategies, and then analyzes six specific agricultural projects which, taken together, constitute nearly half of all A.I.D. obligations to Senegal between 1975-84.  The author notes that project aid to Senegal has often exceeded the country's limited absorptive capacity and that A.I.D. has sometimes been slow to learn from its projects' failures. Other problems have include unrealistic designs, inadequate monitoring, and the A.I.D. bureaucracy (high staff turnover and an emphasis on funding levels rather than project success).  Finally, while nonproject assistance to promote policy reform can have long-term impacts, it cannot form the basis of a long-term development strategy.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","2/1/1987 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural development|Economic development|Rural development|Development projects|Development strategies|Nonproject assistance|Policy reform|USAID|Bilateral aid","Senegal","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAX882.pdf","1,826 KB","001799 - World Bank (IBRD)","","000004 - USAID.

"The shape and impact of A.I.D.'s program in Nigeria from 1961 to 1984 is documented and evaluated.  Separate chapters of the study provide a detailed breakdown of the program, analyze its rationale, examine the appropriateness and implementation of seven specific projects, provide an indepth study of A.I.D.'s assistance in agricultural research (including assistance via regional and centrally funded projects), and evaluate the program's impact on agricultural and rural development. The study concludes that agricultural educational support and scholarship programs were successful in Nigeria.  However, the A.I.D. program was hampered by lack of adequate monitoring, the stipulation that projects use difficult-to-maintain U.S. commodities (e.g., tractors), a misplaced belief that technology alone could solve Nigeria's problems, and the limited effectiveness of the AID-established (and still supported) International Institute for Tropical Agriculture research center. Recommendations for improving the effectiveness of A.I.D.'s program are included, as are 9 tables, 10 figures, and a 7-page bibliography.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","2/1/1987 12:00:00 AM","","Development assistance|USAID|Agricultural development|Rural development|Limited data","Nigeria","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAX883.pdf","3,620 KB","001799 - World Bank (IBRD)","","000004 - USAID.

"The impacts of A.I.D. assistance to Cameroon's agricultural and rural sector are assessed in this report, which traces A.I.D.'s involvement there from 1961 to the present.  Although initial levels of aid were low (the Yaounde Mission, like many others in Africa, was in fact closed for 6 years, 1968-74), subsequent events - most notably the Sahel drought and the 1973 New Directions legislation - have gradually increased the level of U.S. bilateral assistance to Cameroon to $22.5 million (as of 1984), while at the same time focusing this assistance on agriculture (the sector accounted for 80% of A.I.D. assistance in 1982).  Separate sections of the report (1) provide a detailed breakdown of the volume, content, and sectoral distribution of A.I.D. assistance to Cameroon since 1961; (2) examine the rationale behind A.I.D.'s program; (3) examine in detail the appropriateness and effectiveness of six agricultural projects from the period 1975-85; (4) discuss the impact of the program; and (5) recommend changes to maximize the program's effectiveness.  It is concluded that while USAID/C has done relatively well in developing a coherent development strategy, implementation has been hampered by lack of accountability within the A.I.D. bureaucracy, lack of staff continuity, unrealistic project designs and uneven evaluation quality, and legislative restrictions.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","2/1/1987 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural development|Rural development|Bilateral aid|Development projects|Development administration|USAID","Cameroon","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAX884.pdf","1,863 KB","001799 - World Bank (IBRD)","","000004 - USAID.

"Evaluates disaster assistance in Peru following upon the El Nino drought and flood disaster.  Final evaluation covers the period 1983-87 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with participating officials. The disaster assistance program was very successful in both the North and South of Peru, which, because of their different economies and opposite disasters, received distinct modes of assistance.  Emphasis in the North, with its commercial agriculture, was put on restoring economic infrastructure (roads and irrigation systems), and secondarily on rebuilding sewer, water, educational, and medical systems destroyed by flood.  In the South, where extreme drought had destroyed the crops of virtually all subsistence farmers and with them the seed and capital for the coming year, emphasis was on providing seeds and interim employment.  The program was strongly supported by the government and generated considerable good will for the United States. The experience in Peru showed that different disasters require very different responses even within the same country, while the same type of disaster may have be addressed differently in different regions or even departments.  Decentralized implementation works best, as demonstrated by the fact that the efforts of central, sectoral agencies in health and agriculture were less successful than were local subprojects chosen and carried out by the relatively inexperienced departmental development corporations (CORDE's).  Local agencies may initially require more TA and supervision; however, as a result of the program, the new National Institute for Development (INADE), i.e., the coordinating agency, and certain CORDE's are now capable of future development activities. The selection of program rather than project financing was reasonable under the circumstances, although some activities (especially potable water and irrigation subprojects in the South) required more design and implementation time than is possible in an emergency program. The program also teaches that housing assistance in a disaster program has strong multiplier effects, positive or negative. Temporary housing was wisely excluded from the program in favor of housing repair credit (which was successfully provided). The major lesson relates to procurement.  When lives are at stake, it may be necessary to take risks (e.g., the risk of procuring more costly or lower-quality commodities) to ensure timeliness.  In addition, flexible procurement mechanisms, e.g., abbreviated bidding procedures, broader delegation of waiver authority, and liberalized customs procedures for emergency commodities, should be designed before they are needed.","Delivery order no. 5|Spanish ed.: PD-AAW-036|Companion evaluation summary: PD-AAY-550|Evaluation period: 1983-1987","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-0085-I-00-6097-00","","4/1/1987 12:00:00 AM","","Disaster relief|Disaster reconstruction|Disaster rehabilitation|Drought|Floods","Peru","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAW035.pdf","7,042 KB","000356 - Checchi and Co.

"Evaluates CARE project in Haiti to construct potable water and sanitation systems.  Mid-term evaluation covers the period 7/84-2/87 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with participating officials and beneficiaries. After a period of lengthy delays and slow implementation, project management and construction are generally proceeding well.  CARE has requested an 18-month extension so that it can complete 39 of the 40 targeted systems (at no additional cost); however, even if the extension is approved, it is likely that only 29 systems can be completed.  The original target of 40 systems in a 4-year period was far too optimistic. Engineering design, construction quality, and logistics have for the most part been satisfactory.  Drainage is also generally good, but watershed protection needs to be addressed. Community participation (i.e., donations of labor) is also going reasonably well, especially where the local water user committees (Comites d'Approvisionnement en Eau Potable - CAEP's) are well-motivated and have high levels of cooperation with project promoters; provision of Food for Work incentive rations has been less successful in mobilizing community labor contributions. Training of CAEP members and local plumbers appears sound, and more is planned. Cost recovery plans and operations and maintenance (O&M) plans appear appropriate, but have not been sufficiently tested under operating conditions.  O&M will be dependent on revenues from household connections, which have not yet been installed. To maximize the project's production rate and number of beneficiaries, CARE should prioritize future sites, and to increase cost-effectiveness, it should consider clustering sites and expanding existing systems and should emphasize springs over drilling. Before construction begins, a contract should be made detailing how much community volunteer labor will be required, how it is to be organized, and how reimbursed; the FFW ration should be specified and care should be taken to see that these rations are not late, short, or spoiled. Other recommendations are, inter alia, to:  (1) conduct studies of O&M costs, beneficiaries' willingness to pay, and the benefits of improved water systems; (2) develop a cheaper latrine model and expand the pilot latrine program (currently targeted at 6 sites and 1,800 latrines) to all sites where water systems are built; (3) reassess the suitability and effectiveness of water use/sanitation education; (4) ensure the timely collection and analysis of water quality samples, before the systems are placed into operation and thereafter.","Companion project evaluation summary: PD-ABC-606","Special Evaluation","Documents","DPE-5942-C-00-4085-00","","2/1/1987 12:00:00 AM","","Water supply structures|Sanitation engineering|Sanitation education|Community participation|Community development|Potable water|Water supply structure maintenance","Haiti","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAW068.pdf","2,975 KB","000333 - Camp Dresser and McKee, Inc.

"Evaluates project to establish the Federation of Private Development Organizations (OPD's) of Honduras (FOPRIDEH) as an umbrella organization supporting indigenous PVO's.  Interim evaluation covers the period 1985-7/87 and is based on document review, project and subproject (SP) site visits, and interviews with FOPRIDEH, participating OPD, and Mission officials. Much has been achieved.  FOPRIDEH has developed internal structures for providing client OPD's subgrants for development subprojects (SP's) and related TA; its staff is adequate to meet increasing demands for these services; and equitable use of FOPRIDEH resources is assured by administrative checks and balances and by the growth and diversity of OPD membership. FOPRIDEH has also developed a sound and self-sufficient SP design/review/approval process, as well a notable portfolio of SP's and a system for monitoring them. Overall, the project is:  (1) strengthening FORPIDEH as an umbrella organization; (2) contributing to the continuity and growth of the OPD community and raising its national importance as a developmental alternative; and (3) providing, through the SP's, opportunities for new employment, job security, and increased incomes to the target group. There are some problems, however.  Poor communications with USAID/H have seriously delayed disbursements and, consequently, slowed FOPRIDEH's progress as a funding mechanism; a project extension will probably be needed.  Also, it is doubtful that FOPRIDEH can become financial self-sufficient in the 8 months remaining in the project.  In other areas, the role of the U.S. long-term advisor remains unclear, and OPD directors suggest that FOPRIDEH improve its training program and educational facilities and develop integrated training formats. Several lessons were learned.  (1) Because project activities can have unintended outcomes (in this case, the retarding of FOPRIDEH's progress by the slowdown in funds), planned monitoring and evaluation activities should be periodicially reviewed.  (2) The basis for the assumption that FOPRIDEH would become self-sufficient in 3 years should have been made explicit during project design.  Private sector efforts to help people at the lowest economic levels can only become self-sufficient when the target group is able to pay for the services rendered them. Until this occurs, both FOPRIDEH and the OPD's will have to rely on grants and other sources of revenue.  (3) OPD's should share their SP experiences in order to increase the effectiveness of future SP's.  (4) Institutional strengthening of FOPRIDEH and OPD's is the best means of helping the target group.  FOPRIDEH and the OPD's should systematically evaluate the development impact of their activities.  A total of 27 recommendations are included.","Work order no. 80|The correct project no. is 5220266|Number on title page (522-ESF-0280) is the one used by the mission|to track local currency (per Honduras desk officer)|Companion project evaluation summary: PD-AAX-102","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-1406-I-00-7011-00","","8/1/1987 12:00:00 AM","","Institution building|Private voluntary organizations|Poor|Rural areas|Urban areas|Low income|Community development|Development projects","Honduras","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAW138.pdf","2,296 KB","000480 - Experience, Inc.","","008555 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to encourage the development of and/or strengthen Palestinian cooperatives in the occupied West Bank and Gaza by providing training and TA.  Internal evaluation covers the period 2/86-6/87; methodology is not indicated. Although activities in Gaza have been delayed, pending the approval of Israeli authorities (which has only recently been received), the project is functioning effectively on the West Bank, having established a clear collaborative relationship with the Palestinian cooperative leadership and members there.  After 14 months of operation, 24 training courses have been provided together with approximately 310 person days of short-term TA. These efforts should result in increased production of perishable food, higher producer prices, the improved ability of service cooperatives to deliver essential services (electric, water, etc.), increased incomes, and, over the long run, stable consumer prices. The project has a unique opportunity to affect the role of women in the cooperatives.  Not only are women beginning to play key roles in dairy cooperatives, but there are also five women's cooperatives in existence.  The project should develop specific training and TA for the women's co-ops, and should work with the members and leaders of these co-ops to bring other women's groups (e.g., charitable and service organizations) to precooperative status. The project should also begin to provide additional training services to co-op members in general, perhaps by expanding the production of educational materials within the library services component.  Other recommendations include: (1) improving baseline data collection methods to help in project evaluation; (2) working with officials of the Cairo-Amman Bank to develop project credit activities; (3) developing a long-term U.S. training of trainers program; and (4) extending project life to five years and scheduling subsequent evaluations.","Cover title: Final report : internal evaluation of the|ACDI/OCDC/CRC cooperative development project in the West Bank and|Gaza","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","6/1/1987 12:00:00 AM","","Refugees|Cooperatives|Management development|Management training|Limited data","West Bank|Gaza Strip","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAW156.pdf","2,172 KB","000238 - Agricultural Cooperative Development International (ACDI)","","002062 - USAID.

"Evaluates communication component of project to distribute and promote the use of oral rehydration solution (ORS) to mothers in Pakistan.  Evaluation covers the period 6/86-2/87; methodology is not indicated. The project has trained 12,000 health providers in the use of ORS and has started an ORS mass distribution campaign.  The project has also promoted ORS name recognition through radio and television advertisements and has initiated KAP surveys of consumers, health providers, and pharmacists.  ORS production levels have been adequate and the project has succeeded in hiring a full time program manager and developing a program logo. ORS is still underutilized in homes, however, and the project has been plagued by ambiguous communication and promotion strategies and by uneven performance on the part of both Pakistan's National Institute of Health (NIH) and the private contractor, the D.J. Kymer advertising agency.  The NIH has failed to make clear decisions and has delayed payments for approved work done by the Kymer agency; the agency, for its part, has not developed a strategic plan and its print products have been of uneven quality.  Although these problems are probably due to NIH's and the agency's inexperience with projects of this sort, rather than to any gross incompetence, they are a serious barrier to achieving project goals.  Another problem facing the project is the lack of a field research program to test ORS packaging concepts.  As a result, the Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) has become far too involved in decisions regarding design details, e.g., colors, typeface, etc. In view of these problems, recommendations are made to focus on resolving the issues of ORS package size and design, appropriate mixing instructions, and design of the instruction leaflet by (1) providing the NIH's program director with a technical advisor in ORS communication; (2) creating a subcommittee of three persons within the TAC to act as an advisory group to the project manager; (3) not allowing the full TAC to review design details of the packaging; (4) financing field trials on packet size and style, mixing instructions, and leaflet design; (5) completing analysis of KAP and field trial results by 6/87; (6) sending the project manager to Egypt to review model ORS delivery programs; (7) proceeding with the development of an emergency leaflet based on the four glass measure for use by 3/87; and (8) reviewing the Kymer agency's work in 3/87 and cancelling the contract if improvements have not been made.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","DPE-5927-C-00-3083-00","","7/1/1987 12:00:00 AM","","Diarrhea|Disease prevention and control|Oral rehydration therapy|Limited data","Pakistan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAW177.pdf","776 KB","000750 - Management Sciences for Health (MSH)","","000186 - USAID.

"Although A.I.D. enthusiastically embraced integrated rural development (IRD) projects in the 1970's as a way of reaching remote and disadvantaged populations, this retrospective study, a synthesis of impact evaluations of 11 IRD projects implemented in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, reveals them to have been plagued with a number of management and implementation problems. Although most of the projects examined increased agricultural productivity and incomes, they also tended to benefit wealthier farmers. The projects' social service components did reach the needy, but their impact was undermined by a general tendency to reduce services when faced with financial or administrative problems.  In fact, the projects' sustainability in general is dubious, mainly because the host governments have neither the will nor the resources to maintain inputs and services at project levels.  The IRD projects were only modestly successful in achieving national level objectives, such as food self-sufficiency. The problems experienced in IRD frequently stem from the choice of implementing agency.  Four types of agencies have been used for IRD projects (project management units, national line ministries, subnational government bodies, and private voluntary organizations) - each type having its own advantages and shortcomings.  As a general rule, however, IRD management has been hampered by poor coordination among participating agencies, overreliance on public bureaucracies, poor timing of outputs, and inflexible project design.  Other problems have been inappropriate national economic policies, inability to establish effective beneficiary organizations to promote sustainability, inadequate attention to socioeconomic factors, and inadequate (or nonexistent) technical packages. In sum, IRD is a valuable strategy for certain special circumstances (e.g., narcotics control development, multisectoral assistance to remote or famine-affected areas), but IRD projects should be designed so as to minimize coordination requirements, while maximizing the use of private sector firms to provide services.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","7/1/1987 12:00:00 AM","","Integrated rural development|Development strategies|Development project management|Development project design","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAL095.pdf","1,838 KB","003433 - USAID.

"When Malawi attained independence in 1964, few of its citizens had any advanced training in the agricultural sciences, and most top-level agricultural jobs in the public and private sectors were filled by expatriates.  This impact evaluation report reviews A.I.D.'s involvement with the Bunda Agricultural College, which was founded within the University of Malawi (UM) in 1966 to address this personnel constraint. Bunda has been the focus of two A.I.D. projects (covering the periods 1966-70 and 1976-82) to finance campus construction, provide long-term expatriate faculty, and train Bunda faculty at U.S. universities. Bunda's record over the past 20 years has been one of outstanding accomplishments as a teaching institution.  During this period, Bunda has granted 861 diploma degrees and 300 B.S. degrees; nearly all the expatriates in the agricultural sector have been replaced by Malawi nationals.  The relevance, quality, and efficiency of Bunda's educational program remain high, even though the College has had to adjust in recent years to a shrinking operational budget. Despite Bunda's success, changes in Malawi and in the College itself now dictate a new approach.  Demand for Bunda graduates is projected to decline during the remainder of the 1980's.  At the same time, Bunda's still growing Ph.D. faculty focuses almost exclusively on teaching and has had but little involvement in Malawi's national research program. Clearly, Bunda's traditional emphasis on teaching needs to be adjusted to focus more on research, but such a change would require a closer institutional link with the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA).  Bunda's relative isolation from the MOA and even from other colleges within the UM has caused problems in faculty career development, in designing educational programs that address national priorities, and in the college's ability to contribute to the larger agricultural research/extension systems already in place in Malawi.  Future programs to develop agricultural colleges should include measures to strengthen inter-institutional relations.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","7/1/1987 12:00:00 AM","","Participants|Indigenization|Faculty|Agricultural education|Agricultural colleges","Malawi","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAL094.pdf","173 KB","003433 - USAID.

"A.I.D.'s assistance to Morocco's Hassan II Institute of Agriculture and Veterinary Medicine (IAV) has been uniquely successful among projects to train agricultural researchers and educators in Francophone Africa.  This impact evaluation reviews A.I.D's support to the IAV over the past 18 years, and assesses the kind of support required to ensure continued success. Starting with a single Moroccan faculty member in 1969, the IAV now has a 350-member faculty, more than 85% of which is Moroccan, and IAV graduates now occupy a wide range of management positions in government agencies and state-run and private agricultural enterprises.  The IAV has played a central role in the modernization of the Moroccan agricultural sector, and has become a major regional resource as well, drawing many students from other African countries. IAV's success can be traced to many factors, including the commitment and excellence of the IAV's charismatic leadership, a complementary long-term commitment on the part of A.I.D. and the primary Title XII contractor (the University of Minnesota), a curriculum model that integrates classroom experience with rural realities, and the existence of a broad base of secondary school graduates in science.  However, IAV remains fragile; it must now face the problems of a change in leadership, mounting operating costs, and concerns on the part of private sector employers as to the relevance of IAV training. IAV's experience illustrates the crucial importance of high-level political commitment; strong, effective institutional leadership; and the flexibility to adapt a wide range of faculty experience and attitudes that ""fit"" institutional needs.  Building a successful university faculty is possible, but takes time: in this case, 18 years of hard work by A.I.D. and the University of Minnesota.  Withdrawing support too early may jeopardize the gains achieved.

"Final Mission report on a project (9/77-9/86) to upgrade horticultural research and economic analysis in Egypt's agricultural sector. Project targets, as modified by amendment, were largely fulfilled. Outputs include:  a horticultural laboratory with tissue culture and greenhouse facilities, located at the University of Cairo; project-generated technologies and extension reports; various improved horticultural crops and increased production; baseline studies for economic policy formulation; extensive training (six Ph.D. degrees, 12 postdoctoral assignments, and short-term training for 260 persons); 10 economic policy workshops; and support funding for 450 Egyptian researchers.  Relationships were facilitated between the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) and academic researchers, both Egyptian and American, where before there had been little contact.  The horticultural laboratory, the result of extensive collaboration between Egyptian institutions and the University of California, produced a high-yielding tomato variety which has been extensively adopted and, it is estimated, has increased Egyptian farm incomes by an amount as great as the total U.S. contribution to the project. The sustainability of these achievements is, however, seriously in doubt, for they were generated in an environment that basically stood outside of Government of Egypt (GOE) institutions such as the MOA, the local university system, and the Agricultural Research Center.  Although sustainability was identified as a problem as early as 1983, a strategy for institutionalizing project activities was never developed.  In fact, since the PACD the horticultural laboratory has been underfunded by the GOE, while the agricultural economics component, which generated no facilities, has dissolved. Although it is not known exactly why sustainability issues were neglected, it may be that the project was intentionally designed to circumvent GOE institutions so that it would have the financial flexibility to more quickly generate research.  And this is the project's major lesson - while circumvention of host government institutions may produce useful results, it cannot produce institution building.  Additionally, project objectives, expectations, and management roles should be clearly understood by all parties from the outset.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","2/1/1987 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural research|Research facilities|Institution building|Agricultural economics|Economic analysis|Economic studies|Varietal research|Tomatoes|Laboratories|Horticulture","Egypt","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDCAV003.pdf","128 KB","008539 - USAID.

"Evaluates English Language Training (ELT) policy, programs, management, and implementation in 12 countries:  Bolivia, Ecuador, Egypt, Haiti, Mali, Morocco, Pakistan, Peru, Tunisia, Somalia, Indonesia, and Yemen.  External evaluation is based on site visits, interviews, and document review. Though ELT policy, management, and implementation vary from country to country, the evaluation identified a number of in-country ELT programs that are quite capable of meeting A.I.D.'s training needs in a cost-effective manner.  However, these programs are successful because they have evolved to meet the specific needs of the Missions and to work within the constraints of local resources and conditions; no generalized model applicable in all locations and contexts can be drawn from them. On the other hand, a number of Missions appear to be unprepared for the anticipated significant increases in the number of participants requiring ELT. In most cases the role of ELT is on the increase, due to the perceived importance of English as a technical, commercial, and development tool.  As a result, a number of adequate ELT institutions were identified in each country for possible Mission use, and there seems to be a growing tendency to use standardized language proficiency tests, especially the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL), to screen and evaluate trainees.  The evaluation found that regardless of program costs, in-country ELT resources, or participant linguistic background, academic candidates in most countries attain TOEFL call-forward scores in about the same period of time. The evaluation culminates in a ""decision tree,"" a decisionmaking model to assist A.I.D. officers responsible for participant training in determining ELT program needs and making choices among ELT options available for their trainees.  A separate set of recommendations is made as guidance for the improvement of management and implementation of the ELT component of the participant training program.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-1406-I-00-4052-00","","1/1/1987 12:00:00 AM","","Language training|English as a second language|Participants","Bolivia|Ecuador|Egypt|Haiti|Indonesia|Mali|Morocco|Pakistan|Peru|Somalia|Tunisia|Yemen","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAW293.pdf","9,765 KB","000223 - Academy for Educational Development, Inc.

"Evaluates project to upgrade Nepal's Institute of Agriculture and Animal Science (IAAS).  Interim evaluation covers the period 7/84-4/87 and is based on site visits, interviews with Government of Nepal (GON) and other officials, and document review. The project is making definite progress toward its objectives, despite some delays.  Especially impressive have been the project's faculty development efforts: there are currently 31 faculty members with B.S.'s, 78 with M.S.'s, and 16 Ph.D.'s, but when those currently on study leave return, these figures will become 23, 71, and 31, respectively.  The additional Ph.D.'s are needed not only to strengthen IAAS - Nepal's only institution of higher education in agriculture - but also to fulfil key IAAS goals of initiating selected M.Sc. programs and securing Royal Charter status from the GON.  Nonetheless, even more Ph.D. training is needed.  U.S. training, while more expensive than schooling in India or the Philippines, is recommended for the valuable linkages which it affords. Much evidence suggests IAAS's committment to playing an active role in Nepal's agricultural development:  the drive to obtain Royal Charter status, for example, and IAAS's expanding role in research (including joint research with other entities).  IAAS is also beginning to explore the possibility of contracting its services to agricultural development projects, which would further enhance faculty development. On the other hand, IAAS leadership needs to establish a planning unit, to finalize and implement a farm development plan (rules permitting IAAS to utilize farm-generated income should be an incentive here, if IAAS's budget is not cut, concomitantly), and to continue pressing on budget allocations for recurring costs. A planning unit would not only strengthen IAAS planning at the departmental level, but would also help to prioritize IAAS needs so that they can be met incrementally and to package them so that they are attractive to donors. Other needs are to:  strengthen the role of the Academic Administration Advisor in the planning process and in establishing links between IAAS and the Ministry of Agriculture; and improve the Junior Technical Assistant program, especially in the area of practical skills training.","Companion evaluation summary: PD-AAW-304","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-1406-I-00-4054-00","","4/1/1987 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural education|Teacher education|Institution building|Graduate education|Agricultural colleges","Nepal","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAW305.pdf","4,731 KB","003211 - Wu P'i, Inc.","","008583 - USAID.

"Presents final Mission report on a project ending 12/86 to assist small farmers in the Congo. The project, which was implemented by CARE, achieved all targets, except for seed farm multiplication targets which were added by amendment in 1984.  However, the project's success in achieving its purpose of raising farmers' incomes is uncertain. Specifically, the project built new storage hangars and renovated old ones; constructed a farmer training center, houses, and offices; established a revolving credit fund and a seed farm; and provided training in storage techniques to farmer precooperatives in 20 villages in which there were warehouses.  The seed activity, however, was hindered by difficulty in hiring staff, poor relations with the collaborating Congo Agricultural Research Center (ARC), and the fact that the ARC, which is located in a savannah climate, was unable to provide seeds appropriate to the project's forest climate.  Although some progress was made, it was decided after a 7/85 evaluation to discontinue the seed component.  The seed farm is now being used as an adjunct training facility for farmer groups. Apparently, a combination of weather and economic problems limited the project's impact on production and farm income. Drought completely destroyed one year's crop, and the resultant lack of seeds forced farmers to cut back on plantings the next. Another year, marketing presented a problem - the government had abolished its marketing parastatal and private traders did not have enough capital or vehicles to buy farm products.  In the one year with both good rains and strong markets, farmers did receive prompt payment, but there is no evidence as to whether farm income increased.  Also, although production seemed to increase for a small number of farmers (i.e., 60-70) who participated in an on-farm seed multiplication program during the last year of the project, this apparent increase may have simply resulted from larger planting. The project did show the farmers that they can expect better results, other factors cooperating, if they use project training and facilities to help increase production and marketing. Project activities have now been turned over to a governmental organization - Projet d'assistance aux Petits Agriculteurs (PAPAN). The two major lessons to be learned from the project are:  (1) careful research is needed during design, as evidenced by the ARC's inability to provide appropriate seeds; and (2) cooperation from parastatals (e.g., the marketing agency) cannot be expected if they lack political importance, money to carry out their roles, or interest in the project's success.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","6/1/1987 12:00:00 AM","","Small farms|Agricultural productivity|Seed production|Farmer training|Agricultural storage facilities","Congo PR","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDBBH890.pdf","117 KB","008532 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to establish a central umbrella fund in Zaire to support efforts to upgrade indigenous PVO's and to finance PVO subprojects (SP's).  Final evaluation is based on interviews with project personnel and beneficiaries, document review and site visits, and covers the period 6/85-5/87. The project, which has three SP's (bridge construction, rural health upgrading, and mini-hydro construction), has achieved most of its objectives.  Of nine planned bridges, seven are finished and the other two will be completed by the end of the project. Rural health inputs have complemented and reinforced the work of USAID/Z's major health project, Sante Rurale (SANRU), by providing commodities and strengthening administrative and financial management (in particular, the installation of solar electric systems has made it possible to protect the vital cold chain for vaccines and has provided back up electrical power to operating rooms).  The mini-hydroelectrification facility is 65% complete as of 4/30/87, and scheduled for completion in 11/87. The project also had a major institution-building impact on the cooperating Zairean PVO in the Bandundu region, which was provided financial, management, and technical training, as well as TA in institutional reorganization. Overall, the Organization for Rehabilitation through Training (ORT) has an excellent record in managing this project - about 80% of commodities arrived on schedule, engineering and electrical contracting have been of good quality, and, while the project was first envisaged as a commodity supply project, ORT successfully developed an important institution building component as well, elements of which should serve as a model for future PVO development programs. The umbrella approach offers a means to reduce the A.I.D. management burden and costs, while at the same time encouraging indigenization. Such an approach, with some modifications, should serve as a point of departure for future PVO assistance projects. The project also teaches that (1) PVO assistance projects should focus on means rather than ends (i.e., development of local PVO's as viable development agencies rather than building roads, etc.); (2) efforts should be made to ensure that participating PVO's are truly indigenous, or at least fully committed to becoming so; and (3) sustainability must be carefully planned for from the beginning. In view of the delays caused by the bankruptcy of one of the mini-hydro contractors, concerns about inadequate Zairois involvement in the facility's development (and eventual management), and the deplorable working conditions at the construction site, it is recommended that the project be extended till 12/31/87, to ensure close supervision.","Attached to PD-AAW-368","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","5/1/1987 12:00:00 AM","","Private voluntary organizations|Institution building|Management development","Congo DR","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAW368A.pdf","15,257 KB","008626 - USAID.

"Final Mission Report on a project (8/79-6/87) to establish a series of Integrated Rural and Artisan Learning Centers (CERAI's) in Rwanda to extend and improve rural postprimary education for boys and girls and increase the number of women trained in agricultural sciences. The project was only a limited success.  Perhaps the largest constraint was the 3 years' delay between project design and the arrival of the TA team.  By the time the team arrived, the project's institutional context had changed completely as Rwanda's Ministry of Education had been divided into two separate Ministries, while responsibility for adult education had been transferred to a third.  The project should have been formally redesigned at the team's arrival, not 2 years later as was the case. This delay reduced A.I.D.'s role in reshaping the project, but it did give the team an opportunity to review CERAI operations and those of the newly created Ministry of Primary and Secondary Education (MINEPRISEC), which led it to focus on on-the-job training for CERAI personnel in school management and curriculum adaptation, through an ""open university"" style series of workshops. Planned adult education activities were dropped and only limited TA was provided to the Nyagahanga Secondary School. Another project output, computer training for MINEPRISEC personnel, was not fully successful: more computers, more trained operators, and Ministry policies that encourage the use of computers will be necessary to fully realize the potential of this component.  Although 30 CERAI's were constructed as planned and major emphasis was put on the training of agricultural teachers, facilities and learning materials are not adequate at all CERAI's and, most importantly, the project's impacts on the skills training (and hence employability) of CERAI students remain uncertain. The project teaches that TA contracts should not be ""set aside"" unless it has been determined that the needed services are in fact available from the recommended source (in this case, the TA contract had initially been set aside for land grant universities, but proposals from these institutions were found to be nonresponsive). Secondly, since Rwanda and cooperating donors (e.g., UNESCO) had gone ahead with the project prior to the arrival of the TA team, when the team did arrive it was hard for them to be accepted as valuable contributors.  This weakness was exacerbated by the low rank of many of the team's MINEPRISEC counterparts.  Thus, although the team proved highly capable, it was unable to get beyond basic implementation issues, and had little effect on rural education policy.  The team also became overly involved in administrative details, due to a lack of support staff.","Annex no. 7 not available","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","3/1/1987 12:00:00 AM","","Secondary education|Agricultural education|Teacher training|Educational planning|Curriculum design","Rwanda","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDBBI008.pdf","1,143 KB","008598 - USAID.

"Final Mission report on a project (4/79-12/84) to provide employment for the rural under/unemployed in poor subdistricts in Indonesia through construction of simple infrastructure (e.g., canals, fish ponds, reforestation, etc.) and to improve the project management capabilities of the Government of Indonesia's (GOI)s Department of Manpower. The project funded the construction of 2,885 infrastructural subprojects (SP's) employing more than 1.1 million workers, including 46,000 women.  About 9.6 million persons directly benefited from the project, and 7.2 million more were indirect beneficiaries of project activities.  Finally, 6,000 persons were trained in project management, selection, design, implementation, monitoring, and evaluation. The greatest achievement of the project, however, has been the development of a selection and evaluation system for small-scale, labor-intensive, rural infrastructure SP's.  The system is designed to ensure that SP's will provide significant employment, that they can be successfully implemented using labor-intensive methods, that socioeconomic benefits will accrue, and that feedback on the sucess of the SP is used to improve the design of future SP's. Only one output was not achieved as planned.  The Labor Intensive Technology Research and Training Center (LITRTC) was not operational prior to the end of project activities, due in part to the late delivery of equipment and incomplete development of curriculum and training materials by the GOI.  However, a successful initial training session was held at the LITRTC in 8/85. It has been learned that rural works programs can effectively address the problems of rural poverty and seasonal unemployment, but while it is comparatively easy to provide short-term employment to large numbers of people, it is far more difficult to identify activities and sites that will provide long-term economic benefits.  Decisions about locations and types of SP's are best made at the local level, especially in a country of diverse geographic conditions such as Indonesia.

"Evaluates subproject (SP) to use labor-based construction methods (LBCM's) to build upland access roads, trails, and bridges in the Philippines.  Special evaluation covers the period 8/84-9/87 and is based on document review and interviews with Government of Phillipines (GOP), Mission, and contractor officials. Although the project will not achieve its construction targets (completion of only 63% of roads, and of a less significant amount of trails and footbridges is expected) or spending goals ($500,000 for equipment has not been used), it has been successful in establishing an LBCM system involving community organization and employment generation. This system identifies, designs, and implements upland access projects in cooperation with local communities and uses previously under- or unemployed local labor. The project is generating employment of about 4,000 person/days per km (vs. 485 per km for equipment-based methods, which would also have cost about 33% more).  The philosophy of LBCM is consonant with present GOP development policies. A redesign (and concomitant extension) of the SP is recommended which would allow it to complete works already planned or in progress and, in addition, to rehabilitate or maintain 150 km of provincial roads.  Such a redesign would encourage national recognition of the economic and social value of LBCM and strengthen the SP-created Upland Access Unit as LCBM's institutional locus within the GOP Department of Local Government.  The A.I.D. contribution would remain unchanged in size though not in components (equipment funds would be transferred), but the GOP contribution would need to increase by 16%.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","9/1/1987 12:00:00 AM","","Access roads|Road construction|Labor intensive technology|Employment|Rural areas|Community participation|Access to services","Philippines","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAW467.pdf","1,796 KB","000673 - International Science and Technology Institute, Inc.

"Final Mission report on a project (8/79-7/86) to strengthen the capacity of Indonesia's Bogor Institute of Agriculture (IPB) in campus and program planning, its graduate programs in agricultural sciences, and related research and outreach activities.  Construction activities under the project are discussed in an attached report (XD-AAW-468-A). The project was a success.  U.S. doctoral training was provided to 8 IPB staff, U.S. Master's degrees to another 8, and U.S. technical training to 45.  TA from the University of Wisconsin (UW) helped IPB to develop new graduate programs in Community Nutrition and Family Resources, Watershed Development, and Rural Communications, and strengthened existing graduate programs in natural resources conservation and management, the basic sciences, and rural home and family studies.  A campus Master Plan and an academic Master Plan were designed and approved, administrative functions were improved and several operations were computerized, the staff capacities of IPB's research and public service centers were strengthened, and physical and academic planning models and guidelines were developed for use throughout Indonesia's higher education system. The success of this project points up the value of well-timed ""second generation"" assistance to relatively mature institutions. This project built on the work of earlier assistance efforts (some financed by A.I.D.) and attempted to fill gaps in staff training and develop long-range plannng capabilities.  TA was provided through a selective and flexible plan, which included extensive use of short-term consultants on an as-needed basis. The UW team leader had substantial previous experience with the IPB; his familiarity with the Institute enabled him to assume a role far greater than described in the scope of work.  This flexibility extended to programming and funding procedures; for example, UW took advantage of a project extension caused by construction delays to further strengthen several graduate programs. The project also demonstrated how the benefits of TA can extend well beyond the completion of the project, an example of which is the strong institutional relationship that has been established between IPB and UW. Finally, the strengthening of IPB's planning functions has had a significant spread effect to other universities.","Attachment: XD-AAW-468-A|Loan no. 497-T-060","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1987 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural colleges|Institution building|Educational planning|Educational administration|Graduate education","Indonesia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAW468.pdf","585 KB","008558 - USAID.

"Final Mission Report on a project component (8/79-7/86) to develop a campus master plan and to construct an Information Resources Center (IRC) and Environmental Studies Center (ESC) at the Institut Pertanian Bogor (IPB) campus in Darmega, Bogor, Indonesia. The planned outputs were achieved:  the campus master plan (to the year 2000), following the requirement of the Directorate General of Higher Education, can accomodate 25,000 students and was completed satisfactorily, as was construction of the IRC and ESC buildings, which total approximately 10,000 sq. m. Construction quality was excellent and the buildings were finished within the planned budget. Building designs proposed by the contractor, Perkins and Wills, Int. (PWI), as accepted by USAID/I, were adequate, except that review revealed that the traditional red clay tile to be used for the roof would leak badly and should be replaced by another material, and that provisions for gutters, downspouts, and protection for stairwells were insufficient.  Other issues in building design centered around air conditioning costs (ultimately only the IRC recieved a full air conditioning system) and the addition of emergency exits with remote control electromagnetic locks (the latter was vetoed by IPB). Construction was delayed due to a disagreement over which regulations were to be enforced (the Mission wanted the project to conform with A.I.D. Handbook 11, while the IPB wanted to comply with Kepres 14 and 18), and problems in qualifying Indonesian construction companies through A.I.D. regulations for participation in the project.  As a result, the project was extended two years, from 7/84 to 7/86.  Further delays, caused by problems getting imported construction equipment through customs, resulted in the completion of the construction in 1/87. Despite the design problems and delays, this project is a good example of how A.I.D. can effectively monitor and control a project using A.I.D. Handbook 11.  These problems did point up the need for the project officer to be familiar with the procurement procedures of both the USG and the host government, however.  The project also served to illustrate the advantages of contracting the two buildings as one complete package, rather than having the Government of Indonesia (GOI) prefinance the project according to the Fixed Amount Reimbursement system, which has consistently resulted construction delays and poor quality.","Attached to PD-AAW-468|Loan no. 497-T-060","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1987 12:00:00 AM","","Building construction|Agricultural colleges|Universities and colleges|Research centers|Information centers","Indonesia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAW468A.pdf","387 KB","008558 - USAID.

"Final Mission report on a project (8/78-12/85) to build small, relatively simple, irrigation systems (e.g., gravity systems) in Indonesia. Approximately 500 small irrigation systems were constructed and a water users' organization was formed at virtually every site.  A manual of standard design details was also prepared and some 400 provincial engineers and over 3,000 non-technical staff were given short-term or long-term training.  In connection with the High Performance Sederhana Irrigation System (HPSIS) component (which was added in 1982 to test a farmer-participatory approach to system design and construction), more than 500 farmers were trained in systems operation and the purpose of water users' associations. The project showed that there are still excellent returns to be gained from investments in irrigation infrastructure, particularly in new systems (as opposed to rehabilitating existing ones).  Most project systems performed extremely well. Those that performed poorly generally suffered from poor site selection (in terms of either water supply, soil conditions, crop systems, or farmer preferences), and not from poor construction or management.  In some cases sites chosen for systems were already well-irrigated. The HPSIS component demonstrated that farmers can be successfully incorporated into the system design process; for example, farmers were able to negotiate several important design changes with the Ministry of Public Works (PU), and constructed or rebuilt parts of the irrigation systems themselves.  The result was substantially better systems (for example, the number of main system canals in good condition rose from 38% to 85% over the course of the project).  Farmers gained confidence in their ability to communicate with the PU, and PU personnel became more receptive to farmer suggestions.  The project also improved coordination among the Ministries of Agriculture and Home Affairs and PU at the provincial and kabupaten levels. The project also showed how community organizers, with basic knowledge of the technical issues involved in the project, can be an effective liaison between water users' associations and public works officials. The Sederhana project provided considerable guidance in planning the follow-on Small Scale Irrigation Management Project.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1987 12:00:00 AM","","Irrigation system construction|Irrigation sites|Pilot projects","Indonesia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAW469.pdf","143 KB","008558 - USAID.

"Evaluates FY86 commodity import program (CIP) to support private agricultural development in Mozambique.  Evaluation is based on document review and interviews with beneficiaries. The CIP, by providing needed inputs to private sector farmers and agricultural manufacturing firms in the Green Zones around Maputo and in the Xai-Xai and Chokwe target areas, has met its goal of stimulating agricultural production and alleviating (though by no means eliminating) food shortages in the Maputo area.  As in previous years, the CIP has been one of the few sources of agricultural inputs and of raw materials for private manufacturing firms. The CIP was also well-managed and implemented in a timely manner, despite the inadequacy of financial management support services provided by USAID/Mbabane.  It should be noted, however, that contrary to the PAAD there remains a high level of public sector involvement in the implementation of the CIP (including some questionable practices regarding the allocation of CIP goods and the charging of fees). Recommendations are made to the Office of the A.I.D. Representative (OAR/Maputo) to (1) maximize private sector involvement in CIP implementation; (2) improve financial management by training a local accountant and ensuring regular reporting on local currency accounts; (3) implement the planned follow-on CIP at current funding levels and in the same target areas, as expansion may require additional staffing and/or lead to security problems; (4) continue its low-key approach to policy dialogue (the CIP is too small to leverage major policy changes) and develop a better understanding of policy constraints on private sector development; and (5) utilize counterpart funds in a way consistent with IMF targets in Mozambique.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","656-0206-S-00-7101-00","","9/1/1987 12:00:00 AM","","Commodity import programs|Private sector|Food production|Agricultural inputs|Agricultural production|Counterinsurgency","Mozambique","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAW475.pdf","3,237 KB","008580 - USAID.

"A.I.D.'s Family Planning Management Training (FPMT) project is developing a case study evaluation protocol for use in assessing/refining the assistance it provides to developing country FP organizations.  Details of the protocol's development, supporting documentation, and the results of a pilot test - an assessment of FPMT's assistance to the AID-supported Family Health and Population Project in Senegal - are reported here. Findings suggest that FPMT assistance was successful in three areas: (1) supervision (FPMT developed functioning supervisory protocols for clinical and IEC personnel); (2) management systems support (a central warehouse inventory management system was developed and implemented, as were systems for estimating contraceptive needs, tracking client service information, and accounting/budgeting); and (3) participation in the Francophone Regional Advisory Committee (regional relationships with other FP directors were strengthened, and the resolve of the Senegalese director to play a key role in developing a national FP policy was fortified).  FPMT's experience in Senegal underlines the importance of open, frequent communications with clients and, on a broader level, the need for FPMT to communicate more effectively to both clients and Missions the comprehensive and ongoing nature of its management development approach.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","DPE-3039-C-00-5075-00","","6/1/1987 12:00:00 AM","","Health care administration|Case studies|Management development|Management training|Development project evaluation|Evaluation methodology|Family planning services","Senegal|French speaking Africa","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAY369.pdf","1,624 KB","000750 - Management Sciences for Health (MSH)","","000191 - USAID.

"Management problems can occur at any time in the project cycle.  An increasingly recognized way of identifying and correcting these problems is through use of a monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system.  This paper discusses issues pertaining to the design of M&E and related information systems.  After summarizing the problems commonly found in past M&E activities (poorly defined data collection needs, reliance on overly sophisticated data collection and analysis methods, inadequate data analysis, insufficient staffing and funding levels), the paper presents guidelines for future M&E planning.  (1) No single approach to M&E is uniformly applicable.  (2) Direct measurement of project impacts is not always necessary or feasible.  (3) M&E systems should begin by identifying user needs, and should let the nature of the project, not research criteria, determine information requirements.  (4) Multiple data collection methods (including informal methods) and multiple data sources should be used.  (5) Collaborative implementation of M&E systems can build host country data collection and analysis capabilities and increase host country responsiveness to M&E findings.  A final section describes three alternative approaches to organizing M&E units.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","10/1/1987 12:00:00 AM","","Development project management|Development project evaluation|Management information systems|System design","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAY391.pdf","29 KB","003433 - USAID.

"The extent to which A.I.D. Missions comply with the A.I.D. policy that management decisions be based on hard, empirical evidence varies greatly from Mission to Mission.  This paper describes the exemplary performance of USAID/Jakarta in this area.  The paper sketches and exemplifies the three stages in the evolution of the Mission's strategy for using empirical information - developing problem-oriented evaluations, coordinating information activities for project, program, and policy purposes, and disseminating information to potential users - and delineates the central roles played in this evolution by the Mission Director, the Project and Program Support Office and the Evaluation Section, and Mission technical offices.  The report also specifies problems limiting the Mission's further improvement and greater use of its information system.  A review of the lessons which other Missions can learn from USAID/Jakarta's experience stresses the need for a clear commitment to information activities by senior Mission managers and active involvement therein by the Mission Director; insights for developing a Mission information strategy are also provided. A concluding section suggests that in the face of the low priority accorded within the Agency to information activities (in fact, if not in policy), A.I.D. focus on developing regional information services rather than in-house Mission capabilities.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","10/1/1987 12:00:00 AM","","Development administration|Management information systems|Data collection|Data analysis|Information dissemination|USAID","Indonesia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAY392.pdf","55 KB","003433 - USAID.

"Evaluates programs of the Asian-American Free Labor Institute (AAFLI) in Bangladesh, Thailand, Indonesia, and the Philippines. External evaluation covers the period through 2/87 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with AAFLI field and Washington staff and A.I.D. officials. The AAFLI field activities of AAFLI programs have achieved a substantial impact in the four countries, and tend to be highly valued by local labor leaders.  AAFLI's core activities in particular - training programs and corollary research and publication efforts - seem to be economical and well run, and have contributed significantly to the strength, size, and organizational capacity of free labor unions. Membership service activities, such as health clinics, on the other hand, have had only mixed success, primarily because AAFLI/W and field managers lack specialized expertise in these activities.  Where membership services are successful, this is often attributable to AAFLI's use of contracted experts, a practice which raises serious questions concerning sustainability.  Further, lack of planning for phasing over these activities to local support leaves AAFLI with no choice but to remain 100% dependent upon external funding, or eliminate programs as budgets are reduced. While the programmatic costs of AAFLI's field activities are generally modest, the same cannot be said of AAFLI's administrative and headquarters expenses.  AAFLI's management of its activities is nonevaluative and unnecessarily costly; monitoring and reporting requirements are high and come at the expense of time better spent improving program design.  At the same time, although AAFLI derives almost all its financial support from A.I.D., A.I.D.'s guidance to AAFLI has been sporadic. It is recommended that AAFLI focus on those activities which are directly related to its mission of union development and which it can clearly manage.  All activities should include plans for phasing over to local support.  Further, as A.I.D. budgets are declining, AAFLI should eliminate activities in non-A.I.D. countries and take steps to reduce its administrative costs and diversify funding sources (seeking more support from unions and the AFL-CIO in particular).  In the meantime, A.I.D. should be given proper credit for its support in AAFLI programs and publications.  A.I.D., for its part, should regularize management of the AAFLI grant (in the person of the PVO Officer), provide technical advice on improving AAFLI programs, and increase Mission-level oversight of AAFLI country activities.  Specific recommendations are also made for each country examined.

"Evaluates Economic Policy Reform Program (EPRP) to support fiscal, budgetary, and business environment reforms by the Government of Mali (GRM).  Midterm evaluation covers the period 9/85-7/87; methodology is not stated. Considerable progress has been made on virtually all targeted reforms during the first 20 months of the program, and three of five tranches, amounting to $10.115 million of the $16.7 million available, have been released.  The following reform measures are among those enacted:  a halving of the payroll tax rate; a 5% reduction in maximum business taxes and a 25% reduction in minimum profits tax; an average increase of 17% in administratively determined customs valuations; price decontrol of selected consumer items; enactment of a new Commercial Code; complete computerization of the payroll; a substantial reduction in civil service hiring; and planning and start-up of a voluntary early departure program (VED) for civil servants.  Although it is too early to assess the program's economic impact, progress to date demonstrates the GRM's commitment to policy reform. One area where progress has not been made is in initiating a plan to privatize state enterprises; however, there has been a positive change in the GRM's perspective on the role of the private sector (as seen by its willingness to enact tax cuts, despite the economic difficulties it faces) and there is sufficient time remaining in the EPRP for the GRM to comply with the privatization condition.  Progress has also been very limited in the area of improving administrative efficiency. The recent decline in the value of the dollar has led to a misunderstanding on the part of the GRM over whether funding levels are specified in CFA francs or dollars (the latter is in fact the case). This should be clarified. If EPRP is representative of economic policy reform programs, then these programs are not a means of reducing management requirements for A.I.D.  The program has been far more staff intensive than expected, even though USAID/M's management has been responsive and competent, excellent support has been provided by the Ministry of Finance and Commerce, and TA has been sound. Recommendations are, inter alia, to:  continue to make privatization planning a condition for disbursement; conduct a thorough study of the first group of VED participants and consider reprogramming funds the program is performing poorly; conduct other studies on means of private sector development; and support further reforms of tax and customs systems and further improvements in MFC information systems.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","7/1/1987 12:00:00 AM","","Economic policy|Policy reform|Fiscal policy|Civil service|Economic reform|Commercial law|Private sector|Privatization","Mali","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAW560.pdf","1,641 KB","008575 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to test the ability of four nongovernmental organizations (NGO's) to promote small and medium business (SMB) development in member countries of the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN).  Final evaluation covers the period 1984-6/87 and is based on interviews with SMB participants by a Philippine businesswoman-psychologist; examination of NGO operations by two A.I.D. officers; and appraisal by an Indonesian scholar of NGO research into SMB constraints. Under the project, 4 NGO's - Technonet Asia, the Asian Institute of Management (AIM), the Institute for Southeast Asian Studies (ISEAS), and the U.S.-ASEAN Center for Technology Exchange (CTE) - assisted SMB's in Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand.  In general, SMB's were helped to improve their use of technology and/or their general management practices; AIM's case method proved exceptionally useful in the latter area.  Technonet's and CTE's greatest successes came from hands-on assistance to SMB's and one-on-one exposure to experts (as opposed to formal training).  Employment effects of the project were positive, although macro-economic studies are needed to measure SMB contributions to national employment targets in each country. Although CTE has obtained U.S. private sector cooperation in bringing otherwise unavailable technology into the ASEAN region, cost bars greater use of private U.S. technology in the region, which, given A.I.D.'s limited funds for the ASEAN program, cannot compete with other industrial countries in this regard. ASEAN countries' interest in SMB development increased during the project.  Even Singapore, which was initially only interested in labor-saving technology, now emphasizes national SMB development over its previous stress on hosting large, multi-national firms. The NGO's had some problems.  Technonet increased its dependence on A.I.D. funding, and costs forced both it and CTE to limit their use of U.S. experts.  ISEAS encountered delays in editing its SMB research for publication.  AIM decided it is not suited to instruct SMB's directly and will concentrate on training trainers of SMB's.  Some NGO's did not submit the required annual reports; although no operational problems resulted, A.I.D. was not fully aware of how their programs were progressing until the evaluation. Continuing modest A.I.D./ASEAN asistance to SMB's is recommended. Lessons learned are:  (1) there are benefits from greater NGO (vs. governmental) implementation; (2) policy recommendations may be more effective if made at the regional rather than national level; (3) the case method has great promise for teaching SMB's general management principles; and (4) a design team member on an evaluation team can usefully compare original design intent with actual outcome.

"Evaluates the P.L. 480 Title I wheat import program in Honduras. Impact evaluation covers the period 1975-86; methodology is not specified. Since 1975, more than 400,000 tons of wheat have been imported under Title I and the program now accounts for about 80% of annual wheat imports.  Overall, the program has had substantial positive - though not always evenly distributed - nutritional and economic benefits.  Wheat is a significant source of nutrition in Honduras and it is unlikely it could be completely replaced by domestic grains; clearly, even without Title I, wheat imports would be high.  These wheat imports (which are subsidized due to, inter alia, declining world market prices and the overvaluation of the lempira) have influenced the domestic prices of other crops, especially corn.  The wheat is mostly consumed by urban and higher-income groups, but the associated decline in corn prices has also benefited poorer, more rural consumers, and also very small (under 2-ha) farmers, i.e., those who must purchase more corn each year than they could sell.  The biggest losers are the medium-scale farmers; the largest farmers face production disincentives, but they also consume proportionately more wheat. However, it must be remembered that these are effects of wheat imports (which are essentially demand-driven) per se, and not necessarily effects of Title I. Title I local currency generations have benefited the agricultural sector when used for development projects, but their principal use - to provide 32% of the budget of the Ministry of Natural Resources (MNR) - has not contributed to the strengthening of that institution; it appears that the Government has compensated for MNR's receipt of these funds by reducing other funding for the Ministry.  In fact, the MNR budget has been declining in both absolute and relative terms in recent years and MNR's effectiveness as an institution has actually weakened; both average salary levels and the availability of supporting funds have declined.  A program of contracting some MNR staff at higher salaries through Title I does not appear to have improved the Ministry's performance and is not, in any case, sustainable. On the positive side, the program has meant foreign exchange savings of millions a dollars a year, both in deferred principal payments and in interest savings.  Also very successful have been the agricultural development projects funded through an adjunct Title I/III local currency program; their greatest impact has been on export crops. Recommendations address, inter alia, the volume and composition of Title I imports, Honduran pricing policies, and strengthening of the MNR.","Cover title: Report to Agency for International Development,|Honduras, Office of Rural Development|PIO/T no. 522-9103-3-60149|Companion project evaluation summary: PD-AAX-744","Special Evaluation","Documents","522-9103-I-00-6249-00","","9/1/1987 12:00:00 AM","","Food for Peace Title I|Imports|Wheat|Human nutrition|Economic impact","Honduras","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAW647.pdf","1,454 KB","004307 - Winrock International.

"Evaluates the P.L. 480 Title II program in Honduras.  Impact evaluation covers the period through 3/87 and is based on document review, site visits, and a random sample survey of rural and urban beneficiaries of the school feeding (SF) and maternal/child health (MCH) programs run by CARE. CARE administers about 90% of all Title II commodities and distributes most of them in its SF and MCH programs, which reach about 446,000 persons in 16 of the Honduras's 18 departments. (CARE's other programs - food-for-work and refugee feeding - affect only about 10,000.) In the SF program, drinking of a supplemental beverage made from nonfat dry milk and corn-soy-milk (CSM) was found to be positively related to mathematics and science grades, but not to several other academic measures, to height or weight, or to absenteeism.  At the same time, most participating mothers and children felt that the beverage did improve children's health and school performance; a longitudinal study of the impact of the beverage in these areas should be conducted.  Also, the Ministry of Education should consider increasing the caloric content of the beverage, which currently provides only 8-10% of the children's caloric requirements.  Program benefits were greatest among the poorest children. In the MCH program, consumption of the foods (nonfat dry milk, rice, wheat flour, soy oil, and CSM) was found to improve both women's success in childbearing (thus exacerbating the population problem, however) and children's height-for-age.  Food is delivered in this program either at a feeding site under the supervision of the Ministry of Public Health (MOPH) or via a take home program run by the National Welfare Board (NWB) and community agencies.  While the program as a whole was targeted at individuals with nutrition problems, few of the take home programs have surveillance mechanisms to ensure that intended beneficiaries actually receive the food; these programs require better supervision and should be evaluated by outside personnel to determine their actual impact. In general, CARE is doing a good job of controlling food delivery until it reaches the feeding or take-home program site, but sufficient problems exist at the sites to suggest the need to improve communication between the sites and government agencies, voluntary agencies, and CARE. In addition, the MOPH should consider using a chart to record weight gain during pregnancy and then target women with insufficient weight gain for additional food, and both it and NWB should establish quantifiable targets for the program.  Finally, nutrition education should be part of the MCH program, as it is of the SF program.","Cover title: Report to Agency for International Development,|Honduras, Office of Rural Development|PIO/T no. 522-9103-3-60149|Companion project evaluation summary: PD-AAW-860","Special Evaluation","Documents","522-9103-I-00-6249-00","","9/1/1987 12:00:00 AM","","Food for Peace Title II|Maternal child feeding programs|School feeding programs|Dietary supplements","Honduras","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAW648.pdf","3,301 KB","004307 - Winrock International.

"Evaluates project to combat childhood communicable diseases in Guinea.  External evaluation covers the period 6/85-6/87 and is based on site visits and interviews with involved personnel and other donors. Impressive progress has been made despite major and unusual constraints.  The project has been instrumental in assisting the Government of Guinea (GOG) to plan and operationalize programs in immunization, diarrheal disease control (DDC), and malaria control. There are many indications that the project, if extended, can achieve most of its objectives.  These indications include:  (1) the GOG's major fiscal commitment to the health sector (albeit reduced in the last several years); (2) sustantial other-donor commitments in complementary areas, offsetting GOG budget reductions; (3) the availability of a substantial number of highly trained health personnel (although the need for further training and skill upgrading remains great); (4) the GOG's strong commitment to project goals; (5) the assignment of a full-time national project coordinator; (6) the existence of national programs, directors, and plans for immunization and malaria control (though not for DDC); (7) a demonstrated capability to undertake major vaccination campigns, both in Conakry and in the interior; and (8) the establishment of demonstration centers for oral rehydration therapy at the central and prefectoral level. Some of the constraints which have delayed the project are:  the national economic crisis and changes in the manner of handling of counterpart funds, which has hindered the availability of local currency; major limitations in transportation, communications, and energy infrastructure; a serious lack of management training at all levels of the health system and of technical training in immunization, DDC, and malaria control; inadequate support in the areas of epidemiology, data processing and analysis, health and management information systems, microcomputer applications, and applied research; and a limited health education/communications capacity (although significant media help was mobilized for Conakry vaccination days). In view of the GOG's commitment to child survival activities and to overcoming project constraints, it is recommended that the project, which is due to end in 12/87, be extended for 5 years. Other recommendations are, inter alia, to:  focus on DDC and malaria control; disburse no U.S. funds until the GOG has assigned a national coordinator for DDC and has advanced at least 50% of its annual local currency contribution; enhance activities in project areas so that these can become demonstration sites; and conduct applied research in technical and socioeconomic areas.

"Evaluates project to build the adaptive research capacity of Cape Verde's Institute for Agricultural Research (INIA).  Mid-term evaluation covers the period 10/83-9/86 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with project personnel. The project is technically sound and has achieved real successes when measured against planned quantifiable outputs: (1) 7 students will have completed or will complete M.S. degrees in 1988 and 2 students are studying for Ph.D.'s (though one is in Agrometeorology instead of the planned Crop Science/Plant Physiology; (2) TA in management and fiscal administration have been provided and the administrative framework appears to be in place; (3) the library is functional (but will require more materials and better systems); (4) housing units are nearing completion; (5) rural economy surveys are underway; and (6) preliminary research projects are being carried out.  However, research is behind schedule due to various management and TA problems. The critical task of defining research priorities and updating the research plan of work has evidently not yet been completed. It is recommended that: (1)  short-term TA be utilized so that research staff are not overburdened by the large number of potential research activities; (2) the rural surveys be completed so that they can be used in planning INIA's farming systems research (FSR) program (special attention should be given to the reasons for not shifting irrigated cash crop production to food crops); (3) FSR focus on rainfed areas (some 95% of the islands) as well as irrigated lands; (4) multidisciplinary teams of 8-12 INIA scientists be formed to concentrate on FSR in two to four staple crops; (5) the fragile, steeply sloping uplands, the key constraint to increasing agricultural productivity, become the primary focus of FSR, and crops that will stabilize soils and increase overall productivity receive priority; (6) the project receive some TA from the Small Ruminants and Sorghum-Millet CRSP's, and short-term training be arranged at participating institutions; and (8) continued A.I.D. support be given to INIA's institutional development; and (9) in future, food crop research and watershed development should be combined in a single project. Project experience suggests that, given the great cultural and environmental differences between Cape Verde and its nearest neighbors on the continent, technology developed in Africa is not always suitable for direct adoption on the islands.","Work order no. 5","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-1406-I-00-4093-00","","2/1/1987 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural research|Research organizations|Institution building|Food crops|Farming systems research","Cape Verde","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAW774.pdf","2,111 KB","001037 - Resources Development Associates International, Inc.","","008525 - USAID.

"This report, the first in a series of comparative historical evaluations of the sustainability of U.S.-supported health projects, examines all completed health projects in Honduras funded by A.I.D. or its predecessors since the 1940's.  Findings are based on document review, statistical analysis, site visits, and interviews with Honduran and U.S. Government personnel. The projects examined include water system and health facililty construction, anti-malarial campaigns, and family planning efforts undertaken from the 1940's to the 1960's and primary care activities (nurse training, hand pump and latrine provision, and nutritional planning) implemented in the 1970's.  Sustainability was defined as the continuation of project outputs and benefits after A.I.D. funding ends, and was divided into immediate outputs (e.g., trained personnel, or hand pumps and latrines installed during the project) and ""replicating"" outputs necessary to reproduce immediate outputs (e.g., schools, a construction agency).  It was found that when A.I.D. funding stopped, some outputs could be sustained with national funds, but replicating outputs were usually sustained with funds from other donors. Analysis of three cases of high sustainability (nurse training, rural water supply, latrines and pumps) and three of low sustainability (family planning, malaria, and nutrition projects) indicated that:  (1) a high national commitment to project goals is a necessary but not sufficient condition of sustainability; (2) projects that were perceived as effective during their life were more likely to be sustained, as were those characterized by cooperative A.I.D./Honduran planning and implementation (projects viewed as A.I.D.-imposed were not well-sustained); (3) vertically organized projects often generated institutional resentment which jeopardized sustainability, while integrated projects tended to be sustained but at lower levels of effectiveness (a matrix-like organization which combines vertical and horizontal components is suggested); and (4) sustainability can be jeopardized if several donors support the same project and terminate funding simultaneously - on the other hand, projects which receive other donor support after A.I.D. funding ends are likely to be sustained. Factors found not to be clearly related to sustainability were: size of A.I.D. funding, national assumption of recurrent salary costs, cost recovery, proportion of the national health budget devoted to hospitals. Nor were size and duration of TA, training components, or community participation significantly related. Therefore, A.I.D. should more clearly define its objectives for sustainability in future projects, and it should not expect all outputs to be sustained.","Bibliography: p. 129-146|Work order no. 15","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-1406-I-00-4063-00","","1/1/1987 12:00:00 AM","","Project sustainability|Health care","Honduras","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAW778.pdf","3,312 KB","004293 - University Research Corp.

"Evaluates project to combat childhood communicable diseases in the Ivory Coast.  External evaluation covers the period 6/85-5/87 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with involved personnel. The project is off to a somewhat slow start, although significant progress has been made in certain areas.  Major achievements have been: (1) completion of draft workplans; (2) elaboration of training modules for the mid-level management course and of guides for paramedical training in the project's three major technical interventions - immunization, diarrheal disease control (DDC), and malaria control; (3) development of a training strategy; (4) implementation of 2 training of facilitators courses and 2 mid-level management courses; (5) completion or initiation of 6 operations research projects; (6) development of a national malaria control strategy; and (7) beginning of centralization of health statistics in the Direction of Public Health and Population (DPSS). However, a number of problems have been encountered, some of which were identified earlier and have not yet been corrected. For example, national plans have been drafted for DDC and malaria control, but they have certain weaknesses which need to be addressed; there has been no progress in locating a French-speaking yaws consultant; the Project Agreement has not been amended to reflect revised training goals; feasibility studies of alternative health care financing have not been performed; nor has documentation concerning the host government's monetary contributions been adequately clarified.  The procurement process has begun for certain materials and needs to be undertaken for others. Other more general problems which continue to affect project progress include the difficulty of integrating project activities into the existing Ministry of Public Health and Sanitation (MSPP) structure; inadequate planning at the central MSPP level; and lack of support for the project from REDSO.  There are also a number of more specific technical problems. Agreement needs to be reached by A.I.D. and the MSPP as to exactly how the project can contribute to improved child health care in the Ivory Coast.  In addition, issues such as the DPSS's lack of support for project-related activities will have to be addressed, and Ivorian project and technical coordinators must be permitted to play more active roles.  Other recommendations address planning and management, health information systems, support systems, immunization, DDC, malaria control, yaws, training, and health education.

"Evaluates U.S. food aid to Guinea, especially the Government of Guinea's (GOG) progress toward meeting policy conditions of a 9/85 Food for Progress (FFPr) agreement.  Interim evaluation covers the period through 8/87 and is based on document review and interviews with Mission and GOG officials, businesspersons, and farmers. Initiation of Guinea's FFPr program effectively doubled the amount of U.S. food aid to Guinea (previously provided solely under a 26-year-old P.L. 480 Title I Program).  Under FFPr, six GOG reforms are required: (1) private rice imports will continue without restriction or unfair advantages to government importing agencies; (2) food rations and (3) consumer food subsidies will not be reintroduced; (4) officially established prices for imported rice will gradually be removed; (5) a schedule for privatizing the import and sale of agricultural inputs will be elaborated; and (6) measures to improve the security of the port of Conakry will be taken. The GOG has complied in general with the six measures, and completely with four of the six.  Compliance was weakest regarding the removal of official prices, which still exist (although they now realistically account for costs and margins). However, the GOG has complied with the spirit - if not the letter - of the reform, in that it has not enforced the official prices, and has thus allowed free market pricing to go forward, resulting usually in higher prices to importers and distributors.  The opposite situation - letter, but not spirit - prevails concerning the privatization of imports and sales of agricultural inputs.  A schedule for selling the parastatals concerned has been elaborated, but has met with resistance from the Agricultural Ministry; this resistance may cause difficulties for other A.I.D. economic reform efforts.  Given that the GOG has complied with the FFPr agreement, and has made progress in implementing reforms in other areas (e.g., civil service reduction), it is recommended that negotiations for the second FFPr tranche commence immediately. Although Guinea possesses the natural resources needed for food self-sufficiency, in the short term, U.S. food aid must continue in order to build confidence in the consistency of the GOG's policies and to allow the GOG time to increase its investments in the agricultural and transportation sectors. placed on meeting Guinea's food needs with FFPr rather than Title I aid because of the loan aspect of the latter agreement, which, even at its low terms is not easily supported by the GOG; Title I can then be used to cover unexpected situations.  However, rice imports should be monitored carefully to be sure that domestic production is not lowered and, over the medium and long run, food aid should be phased out.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","8/1/1987 12:00:00 AM","","Food for Peace|Food for Peace Title I|Imports|Rice|Policy reform|Agricultural policy|Food policy","Guinea","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAW821.pdf","11,719 KB","008551 - USAID.

"Evaluates vocational, agricultural, and entrepreneurial training programs developed by Opportunities Industrialization Centers, International (OICI) in Africa.  External evaluation covers the period through 8/87 and is based document review and visits to OICI and to 6 OIC's in 4 African countries. OICI's record in institutional development is perhaps unsurpassed by any comparable organization working in Africa.  Individual OIC's have continued to operate in 7 countries after termination of A.I.D. funding, and 4 of these - in Ghana, Liberia, Nigeria, and Lesotho - have developed into fully independent, self-sustaining institutions carrying out programs with strong development impact.  There are several reasons for OICI's success.  (1) Its programs are ""reactive"" rather than ""proactive"" - the burden of starting an OIC is put on the local group. (2) Its philosophy appeals to both self-interest and moral concerns and is intensely shared by all who work in the OIC's.  (3) Individual OIC's are permitted a flexible approach to management styles, funding sources, etc.  (4) The OIC's receive strong support (including funding) from host governments.  (5) OICI's training methodology - which includes attitude training, individualized attention, practical experience, counseling, and job placement - has proven effective. The demand for OIC training far exceeds capacity; applicants generally must wait up to 5 years for admittance.  Through FY86, some 14,000 disadvantaged youth have been trained (40% or more of vocational and entrepreneurial trainees have been women), and 75% of vocational trainees were placed in jobs which generally pay above minimum wage. Satisfaction is high among both trainees and their employers.  OIC's also have strong positive impacts on their communities. Moreover, OICI/OIC programs have been cost-effective.  During FY84-FY86, OICI doubled the number of its field programs and began intensive preparations for 3 new programs while staying within its A.I.D. grant budget and increasing its headquarters' annual operating costs by only 53% (and personnel by only 2%). In FY86, OICI obtained 39.6% of its revenues from non-USG sources (vs. a target of 30%, and vs. the 28% achieved in FY84).  At the same time, OICI has streamlined its approach to program development - new OIC's are smaller in budget and require less long-term TA than did their predecessors.  Both new and mature OIC's are benefiting from regional workshops, short-term TA, and standardized management tools - all cost-effective support mechanisms which were unavailable when the earliest OIC's were being developed. Recommendations address personnel needs, institutional development, and financial controls.","An AID `success story'","Special Evaluation","Documents","AFR-0453-A-00-3063-00","","8/1/1987 12:00:00 AM","","Vocational training|Agricultural training|Management training|Institution building|Project sustainability|Private voluntary organizations|Cost-effectiveness","Africa south of Sahara","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAW824.pdf","3,943 KB","000833 - Robert R.

"Evaluates project to establish the Fundacion Hondurena de Investigacion Agricola (FHIA), a private Honduran agricultural research organization.  Midterm evaluation covers 9/84-11/87 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with USAID/H and FHIA officials. FHIA should be highly commended for establishing itself and addressing its institutional mandate within the relatively short period of 3 years; however, it lacks the resources to carry out research in crops of national (cacoa, etc.) and international (banana, etc.) importance and at the same time investigate potential export crops (e.g., mango, black pepper, etc.). Original project funding and staffing levels were totally inadequate for the scope of effort required.  It is estimated that another 10 years will be required to lay the groundwork for FHIA to sustain an impact on Honduras's agricultural economy. FHIA's original mandate was too broad and has not changed as FHIA has evolved.  In addition, FHIA's governance system is cumbersome and inefficient; an organized base of constituents (producers and other parties) has not been developed to ensure long-term viability; and FHIA is critically understaffed in technical areas.  However, good research progress has been made in some areas.  The banana/plantain program has made important advances in controlling Black Sigatoka disease (within 5 years, FHIA should release resistant banana varieties that should save producers $100 million yearly), but it needs to establish connections with firms that can exploit the new technology; similarly, the cacao program is progressing well and cacao shows good promise as an export. The citrus and vegetable programs are well organized, but it is doubtful whether Honduras can gain a comparative advantage over other citrus/vegetable exporters in a highly competitive regional market. Recommendations are to (1) redefine FHIA's mandate, giving emphasis to research on export crops and requiring FHIA to refrain from direct involvement in production development; (2) prioritize research efforts, add or reassign staff, and ensure long-term research funding by asking USAID/H to apply funds programmed to 1992-93 to 1988 and 1989, requesting endowment funds from the Honduran government and USAID/H, and initiating aggressive fundraising efforts; (3) continue to develop national and international linkages to improve research dissemination; and (4) publicize the role of FHIA in the development of Honduras' agricultural export capacity. The project teaches that good fiscal planning and careful definition of the institutional mandate is essential when developing new entities like FHIA, as is developing an international identity through strong institutional relationships.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","522-9103-I-00-6249-00","","11/1/1987 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural research|Varietal research|Research planning|Research organizations|Institution building","Honduras","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAW840.pdf","2,774 KB","004307 - Winrock International.

"Evaluates project to promote nutrition in Jamaican primary school children through a reading program that uses a nutrition-oriented primer.  Evaluation, prepared by the contractor (the International Nutrition Communication Service, or INCS), is based on students' pre- and post-test scores and a survey of participating teachers, and covers the 1986-7 school years. The project introduced innovative reading materials (which had been developed using a ""fusion methodology"" - a combination of techniques from formal curriculum design, nonformal education, and social marketing) to 4th and 5th graders in 15 pilot schools in Clarendon parish.  The primer, called ""The Nutrition Magician,"" was designed to convey nutrition messages relevant to the everyday life of the child through a number of formats (e.g., comics, stories, essays) in order to engage readers of varying abilities. Test results show that pupils in the pilot schools made modest but statistically significant gains in nutrition knowledge, while the control group made no gain, and that the pilot group also made better progress in reading than the control students. More importantly, pilot students' interest in learning was reported to be very high, and in many instances was translated into behavior change - there was a trend toward eating better breakfasts and less junk food.  Teacher evaluations of the project were favorable; they recommended that the lessons be expanded to cover more grades, and that new topics (dental care, the digestive process, food preparation, etc.) be introduced.  Most teachers thought that the project should expand to other schools. While the success of the materials can be attributed to the use of different presentation formats and pictures based on local settings, another factor in project success was the ""bottom up"" approach to the development of the primer, so that teachers collaborated from the outset, retained a special interest in the project, and remained an important source of feedback throughout the process.  Teachers were also given the latitude to use the materials as they saw fit, and were allowed to proceed at their own pace.  This sparked their creativity and demonstrated the project's respect for them as professionals.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/DSAN-C-0209","","3/1/1987 12:00:00 AM","","Primers|Nutrition education|Child nutrition|Primary education|Educational materials|Reading instruction|Reading skills|Pilot projects","Jamaica","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAW846.pdf","746 KB","000461 - Education Development Center, Inc.

"Evaluates project to cofinance activities of U.S. and local NGO's (USNGO's and INGO's) in Indonesia.  Interim evaluation covers the period 9/81-11/87, and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with NGO, USAID/I, and other-donor personnel. Although the Co-Financing II Project (Co-Fi) is a follow-on to Co-Fi I (4970225) which began in 1974, this is the first external evaluation of either project and reflects conditions of both. The two projects have supported 146 subprojects (SP's) addressing a variety of development needs (often in an innovative manner) and involving 18 USNGO's, 10 large INGO's, and several hundred small INGO's.  While the economic returns of specific SP's are not easily separable or quantifiable, the overall impact of the program on Indonesian Government (GOI) policy and on the goal of involving Indonesians in their own development has been significant.  This is especially so in areas which receive proportionately less GOI attention such as health, family planning, rural credit, community and outer island development, and rights issues. The INGO movement, which has emerged only in the past 20 years, is a vibrant and important domestic voice on development, yet it remains vulnerable to possible GOI control; retention of independence is of key importance.  Also, the movement is dependent largely on financial aid, and there is increasing need to diverisfy its funding base (especially to seek funding from the private sctor).  USNGO's have shown consistent abilities to attract contributions from other donors and to provide highly cost-effective services (although the long-term impact of these services is questionable). Despite the Co-Fi program's overall success, it lacks a sense of strategic purpose as it reacts to, rather than channels, project proposals.  It is recommended that USAID/I should develop guidelines for the overall program and should fund three categories of activities:  (1) long-term institutional development assistance for selected large INGO's; (2) indirect support for small INGO's - possibly through the block grant mechanism (which has proven effective when administered by NGO's with good management capabilities); and (3) systemic support to upgrade NGO management skills, networking, and fundraising. Finally, lessons learned are: (1) political, social, and cultural impacts and the sustainability of project benefits may be more important than quantified economic returns; and (2) contrary to much of development literature, Indonesian NGO's may have had more policy impacts than direct grassroots impacts - the reasons for this unexpected outcome should be explored.","Companion evaluation summary: PD-CAY-901","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-1096-I-00-5049-00","","10/1/1987 12:00:00 AM","","Private voluntary organizations|Indigenization|Institution building|Government policy|Policy reform|Community development|Rural areas","Indonesia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAW861.pdf","4,339 KB","006727 - Development Alternatives, Inc.

"Evaluates project to support the Center for Rural Development Administration (CADER), which provides training for public and private sector agricultural and rural development administrators in the Dominican Republic.  External evaluation focuses on a project amendment which proposed measures to correct CADER's high staff turnover and uncertain financial viability.  The evaluation covers the period 1984-87 and is based on interviews with staff from CADER and its parent institution, the Instituto Superior de Agricultura (ISA). Although CADER has exceeded its training targets in several areas, little progress has been made with regard to CADER's personnel and financial problems.  Resident staff members have continued to decline, from 11 in 1985 to 4 Dominicans and one advisor in 1987, as measures to reduce staff loss have been ineffective.  Morale is low because of inadequate salaries and limited faculty participation in decisionmaking. What efforts were made to improve CADER salaries created resentment among other ISA staff and still fell far short of what CADER employees believed they had been promised.  Moreover, changes mandated by the amendment concerning CADER decisionmaking authority have not been fully implemented by ISA.  Nor has ISA provided counterpart funds (generated under the P.L. 480 program) to CADER as planned, although recently its financing efforts (through P.L. 480 and other channels) have improved. It is recommended that:  ISA consider placing P.L. 480 funds designated for CADER's endowment into an interest-bearing account and using the interest to increase CADER salaries (as much as 40% for staff with foreign M.S. or M.B.A. degrees); CADER be given more autonomy in developing training programs; USAID/DR consider providing additional training and TA to rebuild CADER staff capabilities); and ISA try to increase its presence in Santo Domingo, by mounting an aggressive marketing campaign and increasing activities in the city. Over the long-term, USAID/DR should consider a broad-based institutional development program to promote ISA as a national and regional leader in its fields of interest.  Such a program would require staff upgrading and retention, increased decentralization of program and financial decisionmaking, and increased development capabilities, including marketing and income generation activities.  This program could address the question of financial viability by continuing to encourage creation of an endowment, innovative income generation strategies, and better government support.  Such a program could also provide support for training programs for middle level managers in areas outside CADER's focus (e.g., forestry, animal production, and aquaculture).","","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-1406-I-00-7011-00","","9/1/1987 12:00:00 AM","","Management training|Training centers|Institution building","Dominican Republic","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAW878.pdf","817 KB","000480 - Experience, Inc.","","008537 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to reconstruct schools and homes destroyed by earthquake in the Friuli Region of Northern Italy.  Ex post eval, focusing on lessons learned that can be applied in a similar program in southern Italy, covers the period 1976-82 and is based on site visits and interviews with local officials. The following lessons have been learned from A.I.D.'s experience in Friuli.  (1) Little advantage was gained from the use of an Italian veterans' organization as a contracting intermediary. The southern program has found direct contracting to be more efficient and effective. (2) Homes for the aged appear to be as needed and as well utilized as schools.  Ultimate operating responsibility and resources should be determined in advance in either case.  (3) Steel or reinforced concrete faced with brick seems to be the most attractive and least troublesome construction material.  (4) Pressed chipboard should only be used for construction above ground level; if it comes into contact with the foundation, it will absorb moisture.  (5) Brick and tile facing require less maintenance than does plaster.  (6) Kitchen and dining facilities are unlikely to be used in schools above the elementary level.  The furnishing of kitchen and dining equipment should be left to local authorities.  (7) Laboratories and shops should also be furnished by local authorities; it is clear that the resources to do so can be found if the community wishes.  (8) Requests for libraries should be reviewed carefully. Funds are limited and there is apparently little interest in stocking and staffing them.  (9) Gymnasiums and multipurpose areas should not have panelled ceilings, lights, or heating units that can be damaged by thrown balls and the like.  (10) Without exception, all external doors should open out - even if this exceeds local safety standards.  All auditoriums should have large exit doors opening directly to the outdoors.  (11) Stairways should be wide and no decorative glass panels should be used on stairways or balconies. Balcony and terrace railings should be vertical - not horizontal - to prevent children from climbing them.  (12) If flat roofs must be used, careful attention should be given to waterproofing.  Copper is apparently the best roofing material, although it is initially expensive. (13) Shrubs should not be provided by A.I.D.  If local authorities provide them, there is more chance they will be cared for.

"Evaluates project implemented by Catholic Relief Services (CRS) to reestablish a viable agrosystem on the Sare Plain of East Timor, Indonesia.  Special evaluation covers the period 1981-9/87, and was based on document review, site visits, and interviews with project, Mission, and host country officials. The project is progressing well, though unforeseen difficulties have forced planners to concentrate on only one area.  The use of tractors to break the mass of growth which had invaded the rice paddies during the years of civil war was successful, and is being phased out in favor of traditional soil preparation methods which include trampling by cattle. The lack of cattle at the project's start, also because of the war, has been remedied to a certain extent by the continuing distribution of Balinese cattle and water buffalo under a revolving credit program. Some farmers have shown interest in project efforts to introduce innovations such as fish ponds and vegetable growing, but, in general, the project has not been able to induce greater crop diversification either on lowland ricefields in the off-season or on the upland dry fields (where farmers traditionally raised secondary crops between rice harvests).  Nor have soil protection measures, e.g., tree planting, been widely adopted in the uplands, which are now overburdened and severely degraded.  Government attempts to resettle upland dwellers to the lowlands have met resistance; no land titles have yet been issued to those who have relocated, although the Governor has agreed to take action on this. The farmer groups established by the project - owners of the lowland ricefields - are the only direct beneficiaries.  The farmer groups are largely a conduit for tractor organization, cattle distribution, and agricultural extension; most have little autonomy or initiative, although some constructed household water systems with project funding. Women have thus far not been involved in the project, nor has the project been able to organize water user associations. Although project management is already almost entirely East Timorean, the impending transfer of legal authority from CRS to a new, indigenous foundation has prompted this evaluation.  Major questions have yet to be resolved, and, in fact, continuation of the project depends on the eligibility of the nascent local PVO to use the remainder of the A.I.D. grant while it seeks other funding; its organization is unusual because government employees participate in its decisionmaking (which would make it ineligible under normal circumstances).  Other issues involve agricultural inputs; upland vs. lowland residence; broadening of benefits; and responsibilities of farmers' groups.","Companion evaluation summary: PD-CAY-890","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","11/1/1987 12:00:00 AM","","Irrigated farming|Traditional farming|Seedbed preparation|Tractors|Cattle|Soil management|Agricultural water management|Plains|Plateaus|Rice|Coffee|Civil war|Beneficiary count","Indonesia","","","007337 - Catholic Relief Services (CRS)","","008558 - USAID.

"Final Mission Report on a project (1978-1/85) to provide the Government of Indonesia's (GOI) National Family Planning Coordinating Board (BKKBN) with loan funding for contraceptive procurement in order to ensure the availability of oral contraceptives at all contraceptive service outlets in Indonesia. The project succeeded in bridging the gap between free provision of contraceptives by A.I.D. in the 1970's and BKKBN procurement of all needed supplies locally.  USAID/I provided $55,565,636.00 for some 331 million monthly cycles of orals, procured from the United States through 1983 (with delivery through 1984), while the GOI provided $31,570,000.00 for the procurement of some 192 million cycles, primarily from local sources.  Except for a small Dutch grant, BKKBN now purchases all of its own contraceptives. As of 7/87, about 7 million A.I.D.-procured cycles remained in BKKBN warehouses. The project, which ran in tandem with Project 4970270 (Family Planning Development and Services I), was evaluated in 1985 and found to be a positive factor in BKKBN's logistical development. Also, more orals were purchased at a lower price than originally planned because of competitive bidding for the central procurement contract.  The principal problem encountered involved slow reporting, via AID/W, on procurements through the General Services Administration.  As a result, $1.318 million in funds which were committed could not be used, and must now be deobligated. The project demonstrated that a host country commitment to family planning is necessary in order to get the recurring cost of commodities paid out of the national budget.  Perhaps the interim loan funding available under this project provided the impetus for the GOI to move in that direction.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","7/1/1987 12:00:00 AM","","Oral contraceptives|Procurement|Family planning policy","Indonesia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAW915.pdf","134 KB","008558 - USAID.

"A.I.D.'s project to provide primary health care (PHC) in rural Lesotho by creating a cadre of paramedical physician-extenders (mainly, nurse midwives) and by strengthening the existing PHC management system to support this approach has proved sustainable, according to this evaluation. A dovetailing of host country capacity and donor design contributed to this outcome.  The project's technical package was appropriate to Lesotho's conditions and capabilities, while training, supervision, management, and logistic requirements were successfully institutionalized within the Ministry of Health.  To alleviate the chronic problem of financial sustainability, the project was designed to gradually phase in Government of Lesotho (GOL) funding, so that by the end of the project the GOL was paying all personnel and nearly all training and supervision costs.  The only threat to financial sustainability is the low level of user fees.  For political reasons, the GOL has decided not to charge patients for the full cost of treatments, but GOL revenues have been falling and an International Monetary Fund reform package will require increased budget stringency. The GOL is already having problems with financing the current level of health services.  The only choice is to increase the fees charged, and combined A.I.D. and World Bank pressure should persuade the GOL to do so. A number of lessons about health project sustainability can be learned from the Lesotho project; these include (inter alia) that:  (1) project design should match the country's level of development and economic conditions; (2) adequate fees are necessary for financial sustainability, and fee structures should not discriminate against the poor (as was sometimes the case in Lesotho); (3) projects stand a better chance of success when they build on existing capabilities and personnel rather than start from scratch; (4) developing countries can better handle recurrent costs when they are gradually phased in according to a well ordered plan; (5) designers should stress the need for appropriate counterparts early in their dialogue with the host country; (6) health workers at all levels should receive appropriate guidance and supervision; and (7) it is important to involve all interest groups in the project early on (e.g., the Lesotho project worked hard to alleviate physicians' fear of competition from paramedicals).  Includes references (1977-85).","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","12/1/1987 12:00:00 AM","","Primary health care|Health care administration|Paramedicals|Project sustainability|Recurrent costs|User fees|Institution building","Lesotho","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAL099.pdf","87 KB","003433 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to field test renewable energy (RE) technologies (e.g., wind energy technology, etc.) in Egypt. Midterm evaluation is based on document review, site visits and interviews with Government of Egypt (GOE) and USAID/E officials; no time frame is indicated. Management shortcomings by USAID/E, the TA contractor, and the GOE, along with design flaws, have put the project far behind schedule.  Had the project been evaluated a year earlier, the implementing schedule and strategy could have been modified to eliminate many of the delays.  As things now stand, the project should be substantially redesigned before any new activities are approved.  The provision of TA has been most notably inefficient: the objectives of joint work and technology transfer components have not been achieved, and there have been numerous reported incidents of problems with personnel and document quality. On the other hand, RE is receiving increased political support from the GOE, which expects it to play a key role in its development strategy.  Also, largely due to project efforts, a GOE institution capable of implementing project-type activities is in place (the New and Renewable Energy Authority - NREA), and many of the technologies appear to be viable for particular end uses given current economic conditions in Egypt. Among possible options for the future, the evaluation team strongly recommends that the PACD be extended and that the project undergo an extensive redesign that would continue some activities (the information system and already approved field tests and initiatives) and add new ones (tests not yet defined, specialized training, programs to involve the private sector). The redesign should consider the following aspects: (1) project management and implementation; (2) technical (technology/system) focus; (3) institutional and other support activities; (4) private sector activities; and (5) procurement procedures for both TA and hardware/software.  More specifically, the project management structure should be revised to include:  an NREA project manager devoting nearly full-time attention to the project; a new project management committee; better management controls; and replacement of the Resident Project Manager with a Technical Assistance Project Coordinator to coordinate firms participating in field test procurements.","Companion project evaluation summary: PD-AAX-786","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-5730-I-00-6110-00","","6/1/1987 12:00:00 AM","","Renewable energy resources|Alternative energy resources|Technological development|Energy resource development|Alternative energy technology","Egypt","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDWAC590.pdf","1,321 KB","005612 - deLucia and Associates, Inc.","","008539 - USAID.

"Evaluates Phase II of a subproject (SP) to rehabilitate the Zim-Zam Road between Kafue, Zambia, and Chirundu, on the Zambia/Zimbabwe border; Phase II purpose is to reconstruct 30 km and restrengthen the paving of another 18 km.  Mid-term evaluation covers the period 1981-11/87 and is based on document review, interviews, and site visits. The first contractor, Whyle & Co. (W&C), was fired in early 1986 by the Government of Zambia (GOZ) for its inability to perform the road work and replaced in 1/87 by Lendor & Burton.  The quality of the latter's work is good, as is supervision by an engineer from Tippetts-Abbett-McCarthy & Stratton (TAMS).  The GOZ has exceeded its financial commitment to the SP, which has more than adequate funds. Chances are good that the SP will be successfully completed by 10/88. While Phase I resealing has held up well (and incidentally, represents an excellent cost saving achieved by A.I.D.), as has Phase II construction by W&C, heavy overstressing of the road due to excessive axle loads renders long-term maintenance doubtful. The GOZ should revise its maintenance plan to address this problem and determine whether excess SP funds will be needed for maintenance; it should also locate the maintenance equipment supplied by A.I.D. for exclusive use on the road. SP management by A.I.D. and the GOZ, ineffectual early in Phase II, has improved greatly, but there is a need for the GOZ Director of Roads to become more personally involved in SP management.  Also, while the USAID/Z project officer, helped (intermittently) by the regional office in Harare, is providing good oversight, both should visit the SP site regularly and report on their findings.  Other needs are to have the GOZ clarify TAMS' authority; gather baseline and follow-up data; and resolve claims pending from the work of W&C. Several lessons were learned.  (1) Many problems were caused by neglect of A.I.D.'s regulation forbidding invitations for bids to be issued on construction contracts before the preparation of technical specifications, drawings, and other key documents. (2) There is no substitute for designing and budgeting for assessments and evaluations throughout a project's life.  A formal evaluation (including budget analysis), if conducted before 1/85, would have shown W&C's shortcomings and the adequacy of funds to hire a new contractor.  (3) Even with host country contracting, road construction projects require effective, timely A.I.D. oversight.  Early on, neither the GOZ nor A.I.D. heeded TAMS's criticisms of W&C - a problem compounded by A.I.D.'s 1985 decision to shift the engineer position at USAID/Z to the regional office in Zimbabwe.  No formal understanding between USAID/Z and the regional office regarding SP management occurred until 5/87. A PES faceseet listing USAID/Z action decisions is included.","PES no. 611-88-01 (facesheet) included in text.|Evaluation period: Sep 1981-Dec 1987","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","11/1/1987 12:00:00 AM","","Road construction|Contracting|Road maintenance|Development project management|Development project evaluation|Financial resources","Zambia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAW932.pdf","3,993 KB","008627 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to develop programs to improve the health of Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza.  Interim evaluation covers the period 2/85-3/87 and is based on site visits and document review. Project activities on the West Bank have been overwhelmingly successful.  The health education (HE) program is the most extensive preventive health program in the area and the only village-based child survival effort that extends through the West Bank. Two elements in particular are responsible for the project's success.  First, the HE curriculum is an outstanding teaching tool which corresponds directly to the daily needs of village mothers.  It has provided an excellent foundation for training village teachers and can serve as an excellent manual for village teachers to use in teaching village mothers. Regular, in-service education for the village teachers is essential, however. Second, the HE teaching methodologies are excellent; the teaching is lively, pleasant, interesting, and participatory.  Unfortunately, no written record necessary for the replication of the teaching techniques exists. The instructors and field supervisors provided by the implementing PVO, Catholic Relief Services (CRS), are well trained and knowledgeable; in general, they appear conscientious and hard-working.  Despite these strengths, however, the present combination of personnel is not sufficient for the task of institutionalizing the project. Other aspects of the HE program have been less successful.  An advanced training curriculum for village teachers was developed but, for unknown reasons, never used.  Also, although it has been recognized as important to establish on-going linkages with medical care providers, this has not been accomplished, Accomplishments in several other project areas, too, have not met expectations.  HE objectives have not been achieved in Gaza and almost certainly cannot be achieved by project end.  One HE class has been offered, but other anticipated activities have not been carried out nor are they planned.  However, the provision of services in Gaza was a lower priority and, thus, should not be considered a major failing. Finally, there has been little progress toward institutionalizing the project, in large part because of financial and political constraints facing Palestinian organizations that were planned to take over responsibility for the project.  The Union of Charitable Societies has now agreed to take on this responsibility for the northern region of the West Bank.  The Union appears to have the will, though not the means, at present. Recommendations are included.","Companion evaluation summary: PD-AAY-501","Special Evaluation","Documents","NEB-0159-G-SS-5065-00","","3/1/1987 12:00:00 AM","","Health education|Teacher training|Educational methods","West Bank|Gaza Strip","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAW935.pdf","5,801 KB","007337 - Catholic Relief Services (CRS)","","000088 - USAID.

"Evaluates project, implemented under the direction of the Omani-American Joint Commission (OAJC) to develop Omani human resources in priority fields related to national development, with emphasis on educational institutions.  Interim evaluation covers the period 5/83-10/87 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with Omani officials and other knowledgeable persons, including participants. The project has not lived up to expectations, especially in the area of long-term training.  A.I.D. funding of graduate and undergraduate scholarships has had almost no influence on the field of study of Omani students in the United States.  The responsible agency, the Ministry of Education and Youth (MOEY) has received no additional budgetary support from the project. It has, however, been required to provide the documentation to the OAJC for the Ministry of Finance - not the MOEY - to receive reimbursement from project funds; thus, the project has been, in effect, nothing more than a burdensome means of providing general budgetary support to the Omani government.  In partial recognition of the problem, Amendment no. 1 transferred some $3 million from long-term to short-term training in June 1987. Government-wide budget cuts resulting from the drop in oil prices and the consequent drop in Omani revenues caused serious problems and delays in all sectors of the project, but were most evident in the short-term training and training planning activities.  The budget cuts and parallel hiring freeze made it extremely difficult to provide counterpart and other logistical support needed for effective utilization of TA.  In addition, it became difficult for the participating Ministries to release employees for training and to pay the required special benefits during their training period.  It was only after the MOEY obtained exemption from payment of required supplemental allowances to short-term trainees that significant progress toward short-term training implementation was achieved.  While there were also serious delays in approving draft training plans for the first four of the priority Ministries, these plans, procedures, etc. are now in place in several Ministries.  The pace of implementation is accelerating rapidly and should continue to do so. There were also significant delays in installing a management information system (MIS) in the MOEY, due to initial uncertainty as to what type of equipment and software to utilize and then to the advisor's inexperience with the equipment and software selected.  Most of these problems have been resolved and plans have been approved to complete the basic implementation of the MIS. It is strongly recommended that all uncommitted long-term training funds be used instead for short-term training.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","10/1/1987 12:00:00 AM","","Education for development|Management training|Masters degrees|Bachelors degrees|Doctoral degrees|Participants","Oman","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAW950.pdf","2,850 KB","008587 - USAID.

"The experimental Gambia Mass Media and Health Practices project was extremely successful in using mass communications techniques to promote the use of oral rehydration therapy for treatment of acute childhood diarrhea, but it failed to ensure that the methodology it developed would continue to be used once A.I.D. support was withdrawn.  Although some elements of the project methodology are still in use, the Gambian government has been unable to continue project activities at a satisfactory level. Sustainability problems began with the project design.  From the outset, a premium was placed on the development and refinement of the experimental health intervention techniques, the assumption being that if the techniques were successful the project would be continued; little attention was given to sustainability.  Second, the project's time frame was too short - the project was planned to last 2 years and was extended a third, when A.I.D. experience shows that most projects take 5 years or more to institutionalize new techniques.  Lack of a formal long-term training component also adversely affected sustainability.  When the project ended there were not enough trained Gambians to run the communications program, and there was no phased plan for the withdrawal of technical assistance - the project was terminated abruptly when A.I.D./W and USAID/G could not agree on how to structure future assistance.  When A.I.D. pulled out, most project activities simply stopped. The Gambia experience raises important questions about A.I.D.'s responsibility in a pilot research and development effort. Clearly, A.I.D. should have explored ways in which the Gambian government could have assumed financial responsibility for the project and - given the high cost of developing new approaches to health education - project designers should make specific plans for sustainability if the pilot approach proves successful.  A plan for phased withdrawal of donor assistance is essential. Includes bibliography (1978-86).","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","12/1/1987 12:00:00 AM","","Health education|Development project design|Pilot projects|Project sustainability","Gambia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAL098.pdf","91 KB","003433 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to expand earthquake and volcanic eruption early warning capabilities in southern Italy's Campania Province. Final evaluation is based on site visits and interviews with USAID/Naples, Italian research center, and U.S. Geologic Survey officials. The project established a seismic network, provided for installation of ocean bottom seismometers and a low data rate telemetry system, and funded related research and training activities.  As a result, equipment is in place which can provide improved real time information on seismicity, tilt, uplift, and gas emissions.  Increased speed of analysis and greater detail of monitoring ground motions and chemical changes, along with greater geographic coverage, are all possible with the expanded systems of measurement.  Valuable research has been carried out, expanding the knowledge of geologic structure and risk in the region. Unfortunately, due to political factionalism and the lack of a formal structure for equipment management, the needed institutional framework for fully utilizing project equipment, namely effective data sharing between the Osservatorio Vesuviano (which is staffed by the national government) and the Centro Geremicca (where the data collection center is, and which is staffed by the regional government) has not been established, raising the possibility of an embarassing incident in which the two groups of scientists, working from different sets of data, arrive at contradictory conclusions about hazards. There is serious doubt as to whether activities begun under the project will be able to continue at their current level. A number of technical recommendations are made to improve the performance of the seismic monitoring system, but the major concern is the establishment of an institutional framework capable of supporting data collection, analysis, and utilization. Such a framework should (1) clearly delineate the roles of organizations involved in seismic monitoring and analysis; (2) develop a coterie of scientists capable of maintaining and analyzing the data flow; (3) provide for managerial and administrative support for the data collection and analysis systems; (4) provide budgetary support for recurrent operating costs; and (5) have the legal authority to operate in the best interests of the Italian people in the region.  Without these features project objectives will not be met.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","11/1/1987 12:00:00 AM","","Volcanoes|Volcanic eruptions|Earthquakes|Disaster prediction|Disaster preparedness|Seismic monitoring","Italy","","","","","008561 - USAID.

"Evaluates the Cooperative Agrobusiness Enterprise Development Project (CAEDP), funded with P.L. 480 local currency, to strengthen Indonesian agribusiness co-ops at the district level. Mid-term evaluation covers 11/85-10/87 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with project personnel and co-op members. CAEDP is well-managed and making good progress toward objectives, although implementation has been hampered by a 30% shortfall in P.L. 480 Title II funding and by CAEDP's inability to date to obtain any of the promised Title I funds; moreover, the Government of Indonesia (GOI) has decided to provide only $2.3 million equivalent in Title I funds, not $6 million as originally planned.  These funding shortfalls have delayed investment in infrastructure and reduced the amount of working capital available.  CAEDP has also dropped, or is considering dropping, various planned activities, partly for financial reasons and partly due to delays and design changes in the planned A.I.D./IBRD Uplands Agricultural Conservation Project, in which CAEDP had planned to participate. In addition, changes in the economic environment (tied to a fall in oil export revenues) have altered GOI priorities and shifted project emphasis toward export-oriented, labor-intensive ventures and experiments with joint relationships with private firms. This has resulted in several unforeseen outputs, including a profitable furniture-making operation in Central Java employing 240 cabinet makers and wood carvers.  CAEDP was also instrumental in arranging a joint venture between an Indonesian dairy firm and a large U.S. co-op (Land O' Lakes) for a nucleus estate which will import 20,000 dairy cows from the United States over the next few years, to be provided to small farmers, along with supporting inputs, as part of a credit package; CAEDP will provide feed and silage to the enterprise. CAEDP has identified several other potential enterprises: broiler and egg production, fish and shrimp production in brackish water, production and processing of vegetables and spices for export, and a rattan processing and furniture manufacturing joint venture. The only element of the project that can be broadly replicated in other situations is the establishment of a secondary co-op at the district rather than provincial level and providing it with managerial and financial autonomy to implement business operations outside normal government cooperative activities.  The project also teaches that: private sector/cooperative working relationships can have benefits for each side; diversification from government-sponsored activities is necessary for long-term viability; substantial research is essential before large-scale implementation of new economic activities at the farmer level; and strict control over credit for member co-ops is essential to financial solvency.","Companion evaluation summary: PD-AAY-295","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","11/1/1987 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural cooperatives|Private sector|Economic development|Agricultural management|Export promotion|Small farms|Farmers","Indonesia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAW983.pdf","3,438 KB","005626 - National Cooperative Business Association (NCBA)|001016 - Indonesia.

"Evaluates project, implemented by the Ohio State University Research Foundation (OSU), to test and implement experimental approaches to mobilizing rural savings in five LDC's.  Final evaluation covers the period 9/82-3/87, and is based on document review, a site visit, and interviews with OSU, AID/W, host government, Mission, and private sector banking officials. OSU's performance in implementing the project was exceptional; their research effort was of high quality, project staff were professional, and OSU has clearly emerged as a leader in research on rural financial markets (RFM's).  On the other hand, while OSU has done an adequate job of disseminating its results through publications, some question is raised as to whether more dissemination would be beneficial, especially to bankers in non-project countries.  Project impact on donors and host governments is unquestionable, though its magnitude is difficult to describe or measure. Among major findings:  (1) the project has demonstrated that its approaches can capture rural savings in certain countries; (2) saver-dominated institutions show lower loan delinquency, greater efficiency, and greater viability; and (3) loan targeting increases lender costs and contributes to poor loan recovery. Other findings supporting these include: (1) despite the high quality of research, only modest gains were achieved in the area of policy dialogue in Honduras, apparently due to political issues; (2) in the Dominican Republic, top administrators and central bankers were not fully converted to the project's approaches; (3) since no systematic procedure exists for selecting countries to receive RFM assistance, there is a risk of providing inappropriate policy or infrastructure support; (4) RFM's may not be limited to farmers or even to the more general rural population, but to all savers and borrowers who are considered marginal by the formal system; (5) questions of negative real interest are very difficult to deal with, even in an experimental setting (e.g., Banco Agricola in the Dominican Republic actually had a negative rate after considering the inflation factor); and (6) Banco Agricola's success in deposit mobilization may not be solely due to mobilizing rural deposits but also to attracting relatively large urban deposits. Recommendations are that A.I.D. continue to support research and development in RFM's, using the established strengths of OSU, itself, and others; that it develop a follow-on project; and that it support additional research in such areas as the similarities and differences in rural and urban financial markets, entrepreneurial financial needs, informal institutions and methods of integration into financial markets, and the role of credit unions.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","DHR-0000-C-00-6048-00","","4/1/1987 12:00:00 AM","","Financial institutions|Economic research|Management research|Capital markets|Savings|Rural areas","Honduras|Bangladesh|Niger|Philippines|Dominican Republic","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAW992.pdf","3,552 KB","004247 - Social Consultants International, Inc.","","003647 - USAID.

"Presents final Mission report of a project (1982-86) to upgrade, through management training, the effectiveness of the Government of Indonesia's (GOI) Departments of Public Works (DOPW) and of Manpower and Transmigration (DOMT).  Due to a change in GOI policy, the DOMT was split into a Department of Manpower (DOM) and a Department of Transmigration (DOT) during the second project year. The project financed short-term (3-5 months) overseas training for 41 instructors (24 from DOPW, 10 from DOM, 7 from DOT) in management skills and theory; these trainees in turn trained a cadre of 107 new instructors during in-country training of trainers (TOT) workshops.  In addition, the departments conducted three types of management training workshops:  (1) General Seminar Series (GSS) - focused on general management skills/knowledge, and covering such topics as communications, problemsolving, and management by objectives; (2) Project Management Course (PMC) - a course correlated to a particular project and given on request; and (3) Maintenance Course (MC) - a follow-up to GSS and PMC workshops.  The combined total of GSS, PMC, MC, and TOT workshops numbered 300.  Also, a management group of 24 trainers (whose activities are now well known in educational and training centers throughout the country) was formed within the DOPW, and the DOT produced and disseminated to the other two departments video programs on management behavior and skills. The axiom that management training is insufficient in itself to effect institutional change was verified in this project, which made only minimal progress in meeting its institutional objectives.  This failure was due to, inter alia:  (1) lack of high-level support; (2) lack of staff participation in efforts to improve organizational effectiveness/efficiency; (3) excessive concern with the number rather than the quality of those trained; and (4) lack of follow-up to help trainees integrate their training into their work.  Despite a high rate of innovation and application of new management technology within each training center by the teams of instructors, there remained deficiencies in communication between course participants and their supervisors, as well as between the training centers and high-level officials.  This was due in part to exaggerated expectations for the improvements to be generated by the project; when these expectations failed to materialize, the programs and their instructors lost credibility.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","12/1/1987 12:00:00 AM","","Government departments|Institution building|Management training|Management development","Indonesia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAW994.pdf","152 KB","008558 - USAID.

"Evaluates project, implemented by CARE, to install water systems and latrines in villages in Orange Walk and Corozal Districts, Belize. Mid-term evaluation covers the period 7/84-4/87 and is based on site visits and interviews with CARE, USAID/B, and Government of Belize (GOB) staff. The project has many positive aspects, but its long-term sustainability is in doubt. On the positive side, the facilities being constructed are sound, a good health education program for both adults and schoolchildren has been developed, and project personnel are using health education modules to work closely with participating communities to increase the impact of the water supply and sanitation infrastructure. Moreover, the level of community participation (in constructing latrines, providing materials, installing pipe) has been high. On the other hand, several factors threaten sustainability. (1) No counterpart personnel have been assigned to work with the project (except the national coordinator, who is also responsible for two other major projects). (2) Operations and maintenance (O&amp;M) training at the community level is poorly planned and sporadic. (3) Communities have had little involvement in planning and evaluating the project, or in other areas that will help to develop long-term organizational and management capabilities. (4) The concept of fee collection for O&amp;M and expansions has not been adequately addressed. Communities are ill-prepared to collect and manage operating funds. (5) The GOB Water and Sewerage Authority is inadequately equipped (in terms of personnel, equipment, and spare parts) to assume responsibility for handpump maintenance; there are, and will continue to be, delays of up to 6 weeks in responding to requests for maintenance. (The private sector could play an important role here.) (7) The GOB's capabilities to install well-constructed wells in a timely fashion are also inadequate. Better equipment and (especially) long-term training of drilling crews are needed. Reccomendations directly address the above-mentioned project deficiencies.

"Evaluates project to increase agricultural production, reverse environmental degradation, and provide supporting services in Thailand's Mae Chaem watershed.  Evaluation covers the period 1980-6/87. Unlike other projects in Thailand, this one attempts to assist lowland, upland, and highland (above 800 meters) populations. The project's first three years were troublesome, but the last four have been active and productive.  Most physical targets (e.g., roads, bench terraces) have been met (although quality is poor and maintenance may be a problem), and rice production has been increased so that the area as a whole is now self-sufficient in this commodity.  Much less progress has been made in behavioral change, e.g., in teaching farmers how to use the terraces.  Still, the overall quality of life in Mae Chaem has improved, especially in the lowlands (the project focus thus far), where income has increased significantly.  Change has been slower to come for the hill tribes, and to make sustainable changes there the project will need to be extended 2-3 years. In 1986 alone, irrigated rice yields in the lowlands increased by 18.5%, and in the uplands by a dramatic 33%.  Extending these gains to the hill tribes will be difficult, since many highland farmers have little or no education and are risk-averse. Similarly, activities to promote cash crops have been more successful among lowland farmers. Forest and watershed protection components have had fair success, but the Royal Forestry Department, despite its competency to carry out fire control work, will probably not have the budget to do so when the project ends.  As for other project activities, irrigation improvements are behind schedule, but have a high benefit-cost ratio; village potable water and sanitation facilities were successfully constructed and are being well used; marketing assistance to date has been provided only to one lowland co-op. The project-established Narcotic Detoxification Center has treated 341 opium addicts and has a long waiting list.  Despite a 35% recidivism rate, the center can be considered a success. Opium eradication efforts have destroyed 60% of the 2,168 rai of opium producing land in 1986. Replacement crops have yet to be extended to opium farmers, however. The project has succeeded to the degree it has due mainly to the dedication of key personnel, but management has emphasized physical outputs, with little concern about the effects of these on the population.  Many activities were not implemented in a way that enhanced local participation, self-reliance, and sustainability (although the project's use of interface teams to develop a self-help capacity did prove valid in many villages and is worthy of replication). Recommendations address the above issues.","Companion project evaluation summary: PD-AAY-573","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-1096-I-17-5049-00","","6/1/1987 12:00:00 AM","","Integrated regional development|Watersheds|Crop production|Natural resource conservation|Social development","Thailand","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAX124.pdf","8,361 KB","006727 - Development Alternatives, Inc.

"Evaluates project to strengthen the capacity of Ecuador's National Malaria Eradication and Vector Control Service (SNEM) to control malaria.  Mid-term external evaluation covers the period 3/85-5/87 and is based on document review and interviews with USAID/DR and SNEM personnel. The project faces a variety of administrative problems:  (1) the failure of the contractor, United Schools of America, to meet performance expectations; (2) the reluctance of the Ministry of Health to purchase DDT, although it is considered efficacious for many malarial situations in Ecuador; (3) continuing problems in labor relations; and (4) lack of management training in the past. However, the efficiency of the SNEM Directorate and the commitment and experience of the long-term advisor compensate for many of these difficulties, and training of mid-level administrators is scheduled for the near future. A variety of operations research studies have been undertaken, many with the help of external TA.  Topics include a computerized malaria information system; the sensitivity of Plasmodium falciparum to drugs; Anopheles vector incrimination; urban mosquito control; an urban anopheline evaluation system; insecticide resistance; and Aedes aegypti breeding and larval density.  Studies on other vector-borne diseases have also been conducted, along with a series of KAP studies. Actions to upgrade malaria surveillance and control have included strengthening of the malaria case detection system (which relies on passive detection by voluntary collaborators and the General Health Services; decentralization of malaria diagnosis/treatment through the location of microscopy laboratories in peripheral areas; staff training in entomological surveillance; revision of the information system; and stratification of malarious areas. The project is also expected to greatly enhance institutional capacity in the SNEM and related agencies through study tours and long- and short-term training.  On the other hand, little progress has been made in health education, except in urban areas, where workshops and seminars have been held to enlist the active support of various schools and other institutions. Appropriate TA for health education materials development and evaluation, mass media campaigns, and community participation strategies is currently being identified. Recommendations are made for each of the above-noted project areas.","Spanish ed.: PD-AAX-152","Special Evaluation","Documents","DPE-5948-C-00-5044-00","","5/1/1987 12:00:00 AM","","Malaria|Disease prevention and control|Institution building|Government departments","Ecuador","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAX151.pdf","2,185 KB","000769 - Medical Service Consultants, Inc.","","000186 - USAID.

"Evaluates Nigeria subproject (SP) of the Combatting Childhood Communicable Diseases (CCCD) project.  External evaluation covers the SP's first year (1986-87) and is based on discussions with concerned personnel. Thanks to extraordinary efforts by the Ministry of Health (MOH) and the CCCD staff and its partners, the SP is off to an impressive start. Within the first 6 months, the SP: established offices in Lagos and Kaduna; hired and trained local staff; purchased and received equipment; and established administrative and logistic support systems.  Additional funds are needed for transportation, however. Largely because of earlier efforts by UNICEF, the Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) is the SP's most advanced intervention.  All 304 Local Government Areas's (LGA's) will have received vehicles, cold chain and sterilization equipment, and other supplies by the end of 1987.  The EPI has also developed country-specific training and health education materials, and has computerized LGA-specific immunization data for 1986-87. Local training materials have also been developed for oral rehydration therapy (ORT), and 50 physicians and 70 health workers have been trained.  ORT demonstration centers are established in all states, and numerous ORT ""corners"" are functioning in the LGA's. CCCD has worked quickly to help develop a malaria database and form a national malaria technical committee.  In addition, training and studies have been conducted in two states, a national surveillance system to monitor drug efficacy is functioning, and a second surveillance system - for malaria cases and deaths - is ready for launching.  Substantial TA has also been provided in yellow fever control; inclusion of yellow fever vaccinations within the EPI at the state level is a key priority. Activities in health education/communications have focused on Niger State, and have included studies, materials development, and training of 43 health workers in the use of new EPI materials.  However, overall progress in training and training development has been sketchy at best - the EPI and ORT training materials developed under the SP have not yet been tested or made available to states and LGA's, the development of management training materials is behind schedule, and a planned management workshop has twice been postponed.  Operations research, on the other hand, is on target. The SP has also, inter alia:  provided equipment and training to improve health information systems; provided TA to strengthen state capacities to fund health care; and made plans to purchase ORT salts from a local, private producer and distribute them through the public sector (local production for commercial marketing will be encouraged as well).","Project title: Africa child survival initiative-Combatting|childhood communicable diseases (ACSI-CCCD)","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-1406-I-00-7113-00","","11/1/1987 12:00:00 AM","","Child health care|Oral rehydration therapy|Malaria|Yellow fever|Immunizations","Nigeria","","","004293 - University Research Corp.

"Evaluates the Combatting Childhood Communicable Diseases (CCD) project to strengthen child survival activities in African national health systems.  Internal, fifth-year evaluation, conducted by an advisory panel on the basis of interviews with staff of the primary implementing agency - the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) - focuses on CCCD's impact, the role of epidemiologists, and sustainability. Despite major constraints (e.g., economic crises, lack of trained personnel and infrastructure), CCCD has made impressive progress and is helping build sustainable child survival programs.  The special attention given to practical research and performance monitoring is having an important effect on host government (HG) policies and operations. (1) Impact.  CCCD has developed an excellent, standardized management information system.  However, the assessment of CCCD impact on child mortality is problematical, as the program's Mortality and Use of Health Services surveys have consumed significant personnel resources. Nonetheless, these data, including repeat surveys where appropriate, are essential.  The possibility of including Acute Respiratory Infections control activities to increase CCCD impact should be considered. (2) Role of Epidemiologists.  CDC's Atlanta-based epidemiologists have a variety of responsibilities, within and outside of CCCD, and generally feel their time is not being optimally used (they are often charged with inappropriate tasks, e.g., administrative support).  Also, insufficient attention is being paid to publishing valuable CCCD epidemiologic studies in peer-reviewed journals.  Field epidemiologists face other problems:  too many bosses; isolation from career opportunities; and, sometimes, insufficient equipment. (3) Sustainability.  (A) Financial - Overall, HG's have not contributed their share of project costs; some are at least 2 years behind in contributing.  However, others (Zaire, Togo, Liberia) have developed successful fee systems and drug revolving fund mechanisms. (B) Project Design - Most country projects are just now entering the operational phase, but the low cost of interventions and the flexibility of the CCCD design should help ensure sustainability.  (C) Institutional - Decentralized training, annual meetings, and supervision and management systems are CCCD's primary means of strengthening national institutions, which will be one of CCCD's most important goals as operational levels and disease targets are reached.  (D) Political and Social - Congo and the Ivory Coast are on probation and will likely be terminated due to lack of HG commitment.  Otherwise, HG support is generally good, but again, as most projects are just entering the operational phase, political and social factors will require significant attention. Numerous specific recommendations are made.","Project title: Africa child survival initiative-Combatting|childhood communicable diseases (ACSI-CCCD)","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","9/1/1987 12:00:00 AM","","Child health care|Impact assessment|Management information systems|Epidemiology|Project sustainability|Host country cooperation","Africa south of Sahara","","","001439 - Centers for Disease Control (CDC) (U.S)","","001554 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to control malaria and mosquitos and construct water supply and sanitation systems (WS/S) within a health education and commmunity participation context in Belize. Mid-term evaluation covers the period 3/85-2/87 and is based on document review, site visits, and interviews with Government of Belize (GOB), USAID/B, and contractor (Pragma) staff. The project's technical approach is sound and both Belizean and Pragma personnel are enthusiastic, but a number of management and logistic problems have impeded project implementation, and trends exist which, if not altered, could compromise the success of the project in the long term. For example, the implementation strategies focus on technical targets to the exclusion of a larger view of the project as a process, one which particularly emphasizes community participation, health education, and local institution strengthening and training.  Although all project personnel recognize the importance of community participation, no individual in authority has assumed leadership in this activity. Nor are health education needs being met, and the unit responsible for materials production is both overworked and undersupplied. Specific problems include the following:  late submission by the GOB of National Plans of Action; an inadequate inventory and supply system; lack of specific planning and documentation for the GOB's transfer of WS/S responsibilities from the Ministry of Health to the Ministry of Natural Resources; the GOB's failure to construct a vehicle maintenance workshop (a condition precedent); and procurement delays. effective internal monitoring, a stronger data management system, better coordination in the areas of logistics and transport, and an expanded training effort, particularly at the community level. Decentralized decisionmaking at the district level should be explored by the GOB. The various project components have yet to be fully integrated; in fact, poor coordination and communication between components could compromise the achievement of project goals.  The Pragma team needs to work more on developing integrated strategies which complement one another and emphasize community involvement in decisionmaking and maintenance.  Pragma should also maintain more direct contact with USAID/B. Specific technical recommendations are made the areas of WS/S, water quality sampling, vector control, operations research, and community participation.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","DPE-5948-C-00-5044-00","","1/1/1987 12:00:00 AM","","Malaria|Aedes Aegypti mosquitoes|Disease vectors|Water supply structures|Sanitation|Community participation|Health education","Belize","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAX158.pdf","2,465 KB","000769 - Medical Service Consultants, Inc.","","000186 - USAID.

"Evaluates development projects in Zimbabwe funded with local currency generations from P.L. 480, Commodity Import Programs (CIP's), and sector assistance programs.  External evaluation, which focuses on 10 such projects (out of some 140 implemented), covers the period 1980-11/86 and is based in part on interviews. The projects included activities in drought relief, agricultural cooperatives, agricultural education, literacy, housing, and small enterprises.  All 10 achieved at least a measure of success; some - the Drought Relief Crop Pack Scheme, Chegutu Bulk Grain Depot, Chibero Agricultural College, and University Agricultural Faculty - were exceptionally effective. The following general conclusions were drawn.  (1) While neither the number of donors involved nor the funding source (e.g., P.L. 480 or CIP) influenced performance, project success was strongly correlated with the institutional capacity of the implementing agent; long-established institutions fared best.  Also, the fewer the number of implementing entities, the greater the likelihood of success; if more than one entity is involved, it is essential that leadership be defined.  Projects confined to a single locality did better than national efforts.  (2) Delays in release of funds from Treasury caused serious problems for most of the projects.  Implementing agencies that applied unremitting pressure on Treasury were able to secure their funds when needed and thus ensure project success.  (3) For most projects, more money was budgeted than needed.  (4) Revolving loan funds were less successful than direct grants; inevitably, bureaucracies would develop around them, sometimes at the expense of the intended beneficiaries. At the program level, the following observations were made.  (1) Under CIP's, the requirement that counterpart funds be committed to projects before foreign currency is released can lead to, first, rushed proposals, and second, delays in the use of aid (although this is not necessarily the case).  (2) Some feel that sector assistance programs distort the pattern of development, and that beneficiary Ministries did not have an efficient approach to project proposals, as they were assured of the funds and not in competition with other sectors.  (3) The Working Group (i.e., committee) approach to programming local currency has worked well for the Zimbabwe Agricultural Sector Assistance (ZASA) Program, less well for the Basic Education and Skills Training Sector Assistance Program.  (4) The ZASA Program has itself been an exceptional success, but agricultural projects funded by P.L. 480 and CIP programs (which are therefore administered differently) have also shown considerable success. The technical knowledge of USAID/Z agricultural officials is no doubt a strong contributory factor.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","7/1/1987 12:00:00 AM","","Nonproject assistance|Counterpart fund|Food for Peace|Commodity Import Programs","Zimbabwe","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDBBJ208.pdf","2,106 KB","005431 - Agriserve (Private), Ltd.","","008628 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to improve corn production and marketing in Zaire's North Shaba region as well as improve the level of commercial activity and social and institutional development. Final impact evaluation covers the period 10/78-1/87. Corn production and marketing in North Shaba benefitted greatly from project activities.  Production is estimated to have increased from about 30,000 MT in 1977/78 to about 90,000 MT in 1985/86.  During this same period, the quantity of corn shipped by rail from North Shaba increased from about 12,000 MT to about 50,000 MT, or almost half of all the corn marketed in Shaba. While other changes in local conditions contributed to increased production from 1978 to 1981, project interventions were more directly responsible for increases in yields from 1982 onward. Demonstration plots show that Kasai I results in a 40% yield increase and the recommended improved practices account for an additional 30%, totaling a cumulative 80% increase over traditional farming.  Nonetheless, there are definite differences in the impact of the project on the two target zones, Kongolo and Nyunzu, as corn marketing increased by a far greater percentage in Kongolo.  In addition, consumption in Kongolo, where corn was and remains a staple, seems to have tripled.  Income generated from the marketing of corn also varies greatly between the two regions with more dramatic increases in Nyunzu where the top 50% of farmers earn more than even the largest farmers in Kongolo. These changes, however, are not large in terms of total income generated.  Further, the resulting increases in commercial activity, although significant in relative terms, were correspondingly small.  The effect was to increase the level of economic activity in the two major centers by a factor of two or three, and to create a noticeable level of commercial activity in the secondary centers (i.e., Mbulula, Sola, Lengwe) where almost none existed previously.  In terms of social services, more children are going to school in Kongolo and there are more pharmacies, but there has, in fact, been almost no social or institutional development as a result of the project.  The level of economic activity, both per household and in the aggregate, is not yet large enough to support this type of change. The project taught:  the value of using project farmers as extensionists and the value of multiple cropping for increasing farm income; that adaptive testing adds flexibility to technical packages; that contract farmers can produce seed at much lower cost than the mechanized farm at Ngaba; and that demand for open pollinated varieties can be easily overestimated.  A key sustainability issue is whether or not and to what extent road repairs are needed to ensure the evacuation of corn in some of the project areas.","Attached to PD-BBG-070","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","2/1/1987 12:00:00 AM","","Maize|Agricultural production|Agricultural product marketing|Agricultural productivity|Crop yield|Farm income","Congo DR","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDBBG070A.pdf","3,308 KB","008626 - USAID.

"Final Mission Report on a project (FY85-87) to strengthen the regional credit union movement in the Caribbean. The project contributed to the continued growth of the regional credit union movement, though at a slower rate than did its predecessor (5380035).  An evaluation conducted during the last quarter of 1986 disclosed that grants provided under the project were instrumental in permitting credit leagues and the more dynamic credit unions to employ permanent staff and expand their service portfolios, particularly in such areas as central finance, pre-audit, accounting, training, and insurance.  It also created an awareness among organizational units at different levels of the need to become self-sufficient.  The Caribbean Confederation of Credit Unions (CCCU) participated in the training of league staff and boards. The evaluation concluded that almost all Caribbean credit unions were self-sufficient from internally generated income and capable of sustaining membership, savings, and loan growth without external assistance.  CCCU and many of the leagues, on the other hand, were still dependent on external assistance to cover operating expenses, but they could survive as effective, scaled-down institutions if assistance were discontinued. At the time of the evaluation, CCCU had a core professional staff capable of providing technical and training services to affiliates. However, the organization had been plagued by staff turnover, and as a result, most staff were new, and only one had previous credit union experience.  For these reasons, CCCU performance was inconsistent over the life of the project. All special project provisions relating to procurement, other donor financing, and subordinate agreements were adhered to.

"Project Assistance Completion Report on a pilot project (8/82-5/87), implemented by the Omani-American Joint Commission (OAJC), to construct a water retardation system to facilitate recharging of aquifers at Oman's Wadi al-Khawd. The project has effectively met both its goal and purpose.  An earthen dam - 5 km long and 8 meters at its highest point - was built (on time and under budget) to capture flood water runoff; the dam included 11 culverts to allow the water to be discharged at a controlled rate and percolate into the ground.  Shortly after completion, in the Spring of 1987, the dam was blessed with several floods; analysis of dam performance showed that about 5.7 million cubic meters of water had been saved from flowing into the sea during these storms. While there are no clear lessons to be learned from this project, a number of factors contributed to its success:  Oman's Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries (MAF) actively participated in decisions affecting the dam's design and construction; working relationships among the OAJC, the MAF, and project engineer, and the contractor were excellent; low personnel turnover contributed to early completion of the project, within budget; ample funds were provided by MAF and the OAJC; and the project's goals were simple, quantifiable, and clear.  Two aspects of the project could have been improved:  (1) the TA component, which included drilling and monitoring wells and procuring recording devices, was not implemented from the outset of the project as envisioned in the PP, but through later amendments; this perhaps hampered TA provision; and (2) the design engineer should have taken percolation tests in the recharge area downstream of the dam himself, and not relied on another consultant's test data, which proved to be wrong.","Companion evaluation summary: PD-AAX-949","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","10/1/1987 12:00:00 AM","","Water catchment|Water management|Dams|Groundwater|Runoff|Water supply structures|Water supply engineering","Oman","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAX264.pdf","5,625 KB","008587 - USAID.

"Project Assistance Completion Report on a project (1980-87) to establish the Asia Regional Remote Sensing Training Center (ARRSTC) in Thailand. The project succeeded in creating a regional facility for training scientists in the analysis of remotely sensed data.  The center includes a variety of digital systems for data analysis, including a mainframe-based DIMAPS system, a superminicomputer-based ATLAS system, and microcomputer-based ERDAS and Pericolor systems.  The supermini system is also capable of processing data from French SPOT satellites. ARRSTC's analog data analysis system includes a photographic laboratory with sophisticated processing equipment and the capability of converting analog data to digital (and vice versa). About 300 scientists from 18 participating regional countries have received training on this equipment, and some also received advanced training in geographic information systems.  Initial efforts were also made under the project to establish a regional databank of remotely sensed data; while still small in size, the data bank has the potential to become a major resource in future remote sensing research programs. Long-term sustainability of the ARRSTC is threatened by less than expected financial contributions from participating regional countries. In some cases, individual countries have established their own competing remote sensing facilities, even though the ARRSTC is recognized as the premier facility of its kind in Asia. This, coupled with a shift in professional attitudes away from remote sensing as an end in itself and towards its usefulness as a tool for natural resource inventorying, caused the ARRSTC to not be utilized to the extent originally planned. One lesson that can learned from this is the importance of providing for the long-term viability of the project from the design stage on, and the need for a continuing financial commitment from A.I.D. to ensure this viability.  When ARRSTC's parent organization, the Asia Institute of Technology, responding to a mid-term evaluation recommendation, moved to integrate the ARRSTC with its Interdisciplinary Natural Resources Development and Management program (INDRM), the Asia Bureau was unable to respond to a request for an additional $350,000 for the INDRM program.  While A.I.D. cannot be expected to fund projects indefinitely, clearly modest requests for funding that can help ensure project sustainability should be met.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","12/1/1987 12:00:00 AM","","Remote sensing|Data collection|Data analysis|Technical training|Training centers|Regional development","Asia|Thailand","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAX280.pdf","91 KB","004200 - USAID.

"A.I.D. has placed increasing emphasis on creating health sector programs which are sustainable, that is, capable of being continued by the developing countries themselves and of providing benefits lasting beyond the period of A.I.D.'s technical, managerial, and financial support.  This review of the literature on the health programs of A.I.D. and other large donors such as UNICEF and the World Bank intends to generate larger and deeper discussion of the issue of sustainability. Five factors key to sustainability are identified:  financing, host country policy, community participation, program type, and management issues of resource allocation and information collection systems.  The author finds that programs are most likely to be sustained: when they are affordable by the country and the community, and include provisions for cost recovery or private sector participation; when beneficiaries have a role in planning and managing them; when simple, but effective management systems are in place, including information, monitoring, and evaluation subsystems; and when they are focused on but not limited to a single intervention, i.e., when they offer an ""integrated"" range of services and do not attempt too much with too few resources. Attempts have been made to incorporate these lessons into A.I.D.'s present emphasis on the four major child survival interventions (immunization, oral rehydration therapy, birth spacing, and nutrition) which combines the strengths of both the single target programs of the 1950's and the integrated programs of the 1970's.  The paper includes a review of A.I.D.'s health policy history as well as 7 pages of references.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","10/1/1987 12:00:00 AM","","Health policy|Project sustainability|Health care planning|Health finance|Primary health care|Child health care","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAL097.pdf","189 KB","003433 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to promote agribusiness, especially for nontraditional exports in Guatemala.  Mid-term evaluation covers the period through 12/87 and is based on discussions with USAID/G and government officials, businesspersons, officials of private banks and participating cooperatives, and other involved personnel. The project consists of three components.  The Bank of Guatemala (BOG) component, in which the BOG administers a $9.5 million loan fund, has had only marginal success.  Less than $1.5 million was disbursed as of December 8, 1987, due to unanticipated increases in the availablility of dollars and quetzales, overestimation of demand for nontraditional export financing, overly restrictive eligibility criteria, deficiencies in credit analysis training, and partial failure to recognize and react to the needs of participating banks and entrepreneurs.  Those loans that were made, however, have had a positive impact on rural incomes and employment opportunities, and USAID/G has revised the previously onerous eligibility requirements. The Non-Traditional Exporters' Guild component has succeeded in building Guild membership (to 550) and staff (to 34).  The Guild has made important contributions to export promotion and marketing through its Market Information, Export Expansion and Investment Promotion, and Training departments, in many cases providing services normally provided by the public sector. Although Guild reporting of progress to USAID/G has been poor, some measure of its effectiveness is seen in the fact that 34% of its grant had been spent half way through the project, while its collection of private sector counterpart funds was 75% of the required total. Finally, the Cooperative Development component provided $1.33 million to the National Cooperative Business Association to support management and operating procedures of cooperatives.  Ten cooperatives were chosen for assistance, and those that received the major share of help showed marked or substantial improvement in their operations.  Five cooperatives that received limited assistance showed little or no improvement, however, and none of the co-ops have a formal production schedule of more than limited use for planning. Key recommendations are to encourage private bank participation in the loan program by increasing the spread allowed to private banks by two percentage points; extend the loan program PACD to 3/91 with the goal of disbursing $2.7 million per year; provide the Guild with some postproject public sector funding to enable it to continue to perform quasi-governmental services; and reorganize the cooperative development component, improving marketing services and allowing co-ops to borrow in excess of $100,000, especially for processing facilities.","Delivery order no. 6|Companion project evaluation summary: PD-AAZ-290","Special Evaluation","Documents","OTR-0000-I-06-6177-00","","12/1/1987 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural credit|Agribusiness|Agricultural product marketing|Agricultural cooperatives|Financial institutions|Private sector","Guatemala","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAX289.pdf","6,977 KB","001310 - Arthur Young and Co.","","008550 - USAID.

"Evaluates the Rural Enterprise Program (REP) of a project to support small and microenterprises in rural Kenya.  Mid-term evaluation covers the period 6/84-6/87 and is based on document review, site visits to 14 subprojects (SP's), and interviews with project and NGO officials. The REP is off to a good start, especially in strengthening Kenyan institutions that promote micro and small enterprise development. Although field activities are only just underway, SP agreements have been signed with 14 NGO's (6 more agreements are expected soon) serving about 4,500 entrepreneurs, half of whom are women.  Another 19,400 individuals are indirect beneficiaries.  Linkages have been established with 40 NGO's in all, and the beneficiary figures are expected to double by 1989. As of 6/87, about $1 million in loan funds had been made available to entrepreneurs through the SP's, which are implemented by a variety of NGO's ranging from the National Council of Churches of Kenya (NCCK) to a small group of tinsmiths in the western highlands.  Loans had been made to 76 groups and 707 individuals, with an average loan size of $1,277. These were largely uncollateralized and provided working capital.  Since the SP's are in the early stages of implementation, repayment rates are not known; interest rates charged by the intermediaries typically are 14%, the maximum allowable in Kenya.  Some 2,000 new jobs have been created via the credit programs. Training and TA are at the heart of REP, including (1) training of businessmen and women in credit administration, financial management, bookkeeping, etc. before providing them credit and (2) TA to NGO's, and indirectly to entrepreneurs in market analyses.  To date, REP has worked closely with two dozen NGO's in the areas of SP design, market analysis, management and financial advice, credit management assistance, and training of both NGO staff and entrepreneurs.  Moreover, some 225 staff from 40 NGO's have participated in training workshops. A.I.D. funding has been approved through 1994, and REP, which was recently registered as a Kenyan corporation, is aggressively seeking other funding sources.  However, to be sustained over the longer term, REP will need increased Kenyan and donor funding. Staffing should be increased, linkages with other small enterprise projects developed, and a Kenyan director should eventually be appointed.  Project success should not be measured in terms of the number of successful SP's mounted, but rather in terms of progress towards goals for income generation, job creation, and efficient loan management.","Attached to PD-AAX-321","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","11/1/1987 12:00:00 AM","","Commercial credit|Business support services|Entrepreneurs|Small scale enterprises|Microenterprises|Private organizations|Rural areas|Beneficiary count","Kenya","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAX321A.pdf","2,054 KB","008565 - USAID.

"Evaluates two projects implemented by the Central American Technical and Industrial Research Institute (ICAITI) - Fuelwood and Alternative Energy (FWAE) and the Regional Industrial Energy Efficiency Program (PEEIR).  Evaluation covers the period through 8/87; the methodology included extensive interviews with project participants and beneficiaries. (1) PEEIR.  ICAITI has implemented the project with a high degree of competence and thereby earned positive marks from the industrial community.  Quantitative targets have been largely met except in regard to follow-up activities.  PEEIR's major flaw has been its focus on numerical targets (e.g., number of energy audits conducted, seminars held) rather than on energy saving. Nonetheless, the project has been very cost-effective, in terms of both energy audits and seminars and training; the latter recovered a greater portion of their cost than did the audits. Overall, PEEIR has been responsible for at least $2 million in energy cost savings each year (vs. a total life of project cost of about $3 million).  The project was less successful in promoting energy pricing and financing reforms.  The Permanent Secretariat of the General Treaty of the Integration of Central America (SIECA) prepared numerous policy reports, but these have not been seriously considered.  PEEIR should be continued, with some modifications. (2) FWAE.  At less than programmed cost, the project has met or exceeded its original and revised output targets and has been relatively successful in introducing new technologies, some of which have immediate potential for self-sustainability.  Among these are:  lumber and brick kilns; batch bread ovens; ceramic stoves; and others.  Some 13,000 households have benefited from the technologies, 4,000 businesses were established or assisted, and 200,000 cubic meters of fuelwood have been conserved. However, FWAE's lack of market orientation. along with some design and management inadequacies, are keeping it from reaching full potential.  Appropriate follow-ups, especially with the private sector, should be considered. ICAITI's overall competence and its ability to implement major donor-financed projects are critical skills for the region. However, the Institute has done little forward planning, operating rather in a reactive mode, especially in reaction to ROCAP's initiatives.  As funding for these two A.I.D. projects accounts for more than half the ICAITI's budget during the past years, ROCAP must share some of the blame for this stagnation and should assist ICAITI in making a transition to a more active role. Most importantly, ICAITI must become more market oriented (an effort which will require outside help) and it must undergo certain administrative and organizational reforms.","Work order no. 2","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-5730-I-00-6110-0","","9/1/1987 12:00:00 AM","","Research centers|Alternative energy technology|Appropriate technology|Regional development|Energy conservation|Firewood|Beneficiary count","Central America","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAX456.pdf","4,552 KB","005612 - deLucia and Associates, Inc.","","002290 - USAID.

"Evaluates A.I.D.'s management, dissemination, and use of development information.  External evaluation covers the period through 11/87 and is based on site visits, document review, and interviews with involved personnel. Overall, the A.I.D. development information system (DIS) is performing well.  The DIS has improved significantly in recent years: it is much more complete, organized (in computer format), efficient, and utilized than it was 5 or 10 years ago.  The system includes central database and document services, provided by the Document and Information Handling Facility (DIHF), reference and research services (R&RS), and the provision and analysis of basic economic and social data (ESDB) from developing countries.  The DIS is of a higher quality than the systems of most other national and international development organizations; it is more advanced, more widely used, and broader in coverage than the systems of, for example, the World Bank or the Canadian International Development Agency.  A.I.D. is also making important progress in ensuring that its own development experiences are documented, made widely accessible, and effectively linked with other sources of development information for use by A.I.D. staff and others.  In addition, all three aspects of the DIS are being competently managed by private contractors. Despite this progress, there continues to be room for improving the DIS.  First, each of the three aspects of the DIS could be improved through stronger networking efforts both within and outside of the Agency.  Second, the DIS, despite its progress, continues to lag behind some other public and private information systems.  In particular, the DIS does not link top-level managers with development information as effectively as it should.  Top Agency managers have not yet fully recognized that development information is a very valuable resource. A.I.D. is in a position to substantially improve the DIS.  Three key recommendations are made.  (1) The Agency should outline a policy governing its management of development information; specific needs are to assign responsibilities for development information management, establish uniform standards and procedures for acquiring and accessing development information, develop an informed acquisitions program, and set requirements for the use of development information by A.I.D. staff at all levels. (2) An Agency-wide Development Information Network (DIN), with participation required of all A.I.D. Bureaus and Missions, should be created.  (3) Increased technical and consulting support should be provided, by A.I.D./W and its DIS contractors, to DIN members, developing country personnel and individual A.I.D. projects.","Delivery order no. 8","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-0085-I-00-6095-00","","11/1/1987 12:00:00 AM","","Information dissemination|Information management|USAID institutional memory|Databases","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAX535.pdf","1,385 KB","006434 - Devres, Inc.","","003433 - USAID.

"A.I.D.'s assistance to sub-Saharan Africa for agricultural and rural development is assessed under five major headings. (1) A summary of the evolution of A.I.D. policy and strategy from the early 1960's to the present stresses the influence of evolving U.S. policy interests in the area.  (2) An analysis - both by general sector and, within agriculture, by subsector - is presented of the level and content of A.I.D. assistance to the region and its six countries (Nigeria, Kenya, Tanzania, Senegal, Cameroon, and Malawi).  (3) The present study's analytical framework is described, with an emphasis on its view of development as a generalized process of the balanced accumulation of ""capital"" - a term defined broadly to include human and other forms of productive resources.  (4) The ways in which the effectiveness of U.S. assistance is conditioned by A.I.D.'s decisionmaking processes and programming procedures are examined. It is argued that the pattern of the Agency's evolution has created a career system that militates against good programming, design, and implementation.  (5) The evidence from the country studies regarding the impact of major agricultural activities supported by A.I.D. is summarized, as is A.I.D.'s support for rural infrastructure projects and for rural health and population activities. Overall conclusions are that the impact of A.I.D. assistance in sub-Saharan Africa has been severely limited by:  distinctive conditions in the region (the physical extensiveness and harshness of the countries, the absence of infrastructure, the rise of central planning after independence); Africa's low priority in A.I.D.'s scheme of things; the absence of a clear political constituency for long-term foreign assistance, which has left A.I.D. vulnerable to faddish policy shifts and pressures from special interest groups; and the lack of an Agency-level consensus on the critical elements of agricultural development strategy, together with persistent overoptimism concerning technology transfer.  These conclusions are specified in terms of A.I.D. programs in selected subsectors, the potential advantages of A.I.D.'s emphasis on country Missions, and A.I.D.'s programming system; related recommendations are made. Includes 14 tables, 16 figures, and a 13-page bibliography (1950-87).","Cover date : April 1988|Also appeared as Managing Agricultural Development in Africa|(MADIA) research report no. 12","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","4/1/1987 12:00:00 AM","","Development assistance|Agricultural development|Rural development|Economic impact|USAID","Africa south of Sahara|Nigeria|Kenya|Tanzania|Senegal|Cameroon|Malawi","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAX204.pdf","7,254 KB","003433 - USAID.

"Project Assistance Completion Report on a project (1977-87) to strengthen rural education in Bolivia.  Report focuses on the period 12/85-1/87. Political instability forced suspension of the project in 1980 with only $4 million of the original obligation of $16.8 million spent.  The project was reactivated in 1982, focusing on teacher training, teaching materials development, facilities improvement, curriculum development, and schools administration improvement. During the last 14 months of the project, progress was made in the first three of these areas.  The first distance education course was carried out with 1,200 rural teachers, and five of six normal schools under construction were completed (the remaining school will be completed with GOB funds). The project suffered from inadequate administration and misuse of funds.  During the last 14 months, 70% of the USAID/B project officer's time was spent clearing up administrative and financial problems resulting from earlier USAID/B management deficiencies and from misuse of procurement funds on the part of both USAID/B and the Government of Bolivia.  USAID/B's direct involvement in financial management was a key to project achievements during this stage.  Direct administration of school construction, rather than contracting out, was another important initiative. The project teaches that complex projects such as this one should not be inserted in a politically vulnerable Ministry with limited operating capability; a closer look at these factors should have been taken prior to the reactivation of the project.  The extension then could have been limited to only those components that were achievable.","Attached to PD-AAX-639","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","8/1/1987 12:00:00 AM","","Teacher training|Rural areas|Educational materials|Curriculum design|School buildings|Building construction","Bolivia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAX639A.pdf","575 KB","008515 - USAID.

"Evaluates the P.L. 480 Title I and III programs in Bolivia. Interim evaluation is based on site visits, interviews with program personnel and beneficiaries, and document review, and covers the period 6/84-3/87. Providing about the equivalent of $20 million in support annually, the P.L. 480 programs have been USAID/B's single most important policy leverage instrument.  P.L. 480 wheat imports have relieved pressure on the Government of Bolivia's (GOB) balance of payments, helped to maintain food supplies, and, for many, modestly improved the quality of life.  Impacts in purely economic terms have been distorted by economic instability, but Bolivia's current economic reform program is likely to provide more opportunities for productive use of P.L. 480 funds. The programs fund literally hundreds of development projects, most of them small and widely distributed throughout the country, although there has recently been a shift toward larger programs in rural credit. However, in their efforts to help many people in many communities and to support GOB economic reactivation initiatives, the programs seem to have taken on more activities than their funds, facilities, and management can fully support. Recent trends toward utilizing intermediate credit institutions (ICI's) and trust funds should help ease the administrative burden. More specific findings fall into four areas.  (1) The GOB's P.L. 480 Executive Secretariat (ES) has not increased its administrative capabilities despite the rapid growth in the number and complexity of projects; further, there is some duplication of management functions between the ES and USAID/B. (2) P.L. 480-funded agricultural projects have helped prevent declines in production, but (due partly to climatic catastrophes) have produced little in the way of increases.  Increased funding is needed for TA, R&D, rural infrastructure, and services to small farmers.  However, some host agencies (farmer organizations in particular) have become financially dependent on P.L. 480 projects. Adequate project evaluation is currently beyond ES capacity.  (3) Credit projects have suffered from late disbursements by the GOB, from the fact that there are too many credit lines (complicating recordkeeping and accounting), and from problems caused by Bolivia's interest rate structure.  Also, while ICI's are moving money effectively, the long-range implications of reliance on them should be examined.  (4) P.L. 480 funding of PVO health projects (most are in rural areas, which are underserved by GOB health programs) has been effective. Key needs are more collaboration among PVO's and the GOB and more emphasis on community participation.","Attached to PD-AAX-642","Special Evaluation","Documents","511-0000-C-00-7203-00","","7/1/1987 12:00:00 AM","","Food for Peace Title I|Food for Peace Title III|Agricultural credit|Small farms|Farmers|Financial management|Development project management|Community health care","Bolivia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAX642A.pdf","5,077 KB","005072 - Tropical Research and Development, Inc.","","008515 - USAID.

"Evaluates project, implemented by Association Pour la Productivite au Togo (APP), to increase agricultural and related production in Togo's Zio River region.  Mid-term evaluation covers the period 8/84-3/87. APP's intensive approach to farmer training, credit, and management training has resulted in real gains in yields, income, and skills as well as changes in traditional economic behavior. APP has successfully integrated applied agronomic research, extension, credit training, and a small business program in ways that make it possible for small farmers to adopt modernizing changes - a rarity in Africa where these four services almost never function together successfully.  On a continent where agricultural extension systems are weak and do not treat farming as a business, the Zio Project deserves serious consideration as a model (or the beginnings of one) for transferring the benefits of modern technology - both production and management - to traditional producers on terms they can control. The biggest ""pro"" of APP's integrated approach to rural economic development is that in two years' time it has established the possibility of more profitable small farm agriculture in the region. People now know that they can intensively raise multiple crops, produce food crops of higher value, and effectively utilize modern inputs, practices, credit, and training institutions.  The ""con"" is that only the possibility of a modern agricultural economy has been established: much remains to be done.  The project's future viability will depend on its ability to serve larger numbers of farmers more cost-efficiently. Having both the ""quantity"" and the ""quality"" for this kind of transformation at the human, enterprise, local economic, and institutional levels is difficult to accomplish. Another bright spot is that other rural development agencies (e.g., the International Institute for Tropical Agriculture, the Ministry of Rural Development) are sharing the technical benefits of this project, and in turn helping to shape APP as an institution capable of serving a variety of public and private sector institutions.  Two questions of technology transfer are (1) how to replicate APP's systems approach that combines producer training with credit and small business development, and (2) how to deliver APP training and credit at a more affordable cost. APP faces many risks in building itself as a sustainable institution, as was dramatically apparent in 12/86 when its mother agency, Partnership for Productivity, went out of business, and A.I.D. switched its project contract to to CARE. Local APP staff continue in place, and CARE is conscious of the need for stable continuity.

"Project Assistance Completion Report on a project (3/84-6/87) to support the Caribbean Family Planning Affiliation (CFPA) in its efforts to promote family planning (FP) in seven countries in the Eastern Caribbean. The project was largely a success.  CFPA provided TA to member FP associations and governments in six of the seven countries specified in the Project Paper (Grenada was not ready for such assistance) in designing and implementing national information, education, and communication (IEC) plans.  The quality of the plans was generally good, although their complete success was hindered by a lack of counterpart resources and by delays arising from local policymakers disagreeing with certain sections of the plans.  CFPA also produced and distributed a wide variety of audiovisual IEC materials (e.g., posters and videos). Unfortunately, production of IEC materials for teen audiences fell significantly behind schedule, due to staff turnover.  CFPA also made several valuable studies of the effectiveness of its IEC activities. Another component required CFPA to provide TA to affiliated FP associations and governments in the design and implementation of in-country training for field workers, and to design and conduct courses for teachers to enable them to teach sex education. To this end, five workshops for FP staff and seven for teachers were carried out, all of which were well-received.  In addition, CFPA produced the manual ""Teaching Human Sexuality in Caribbean Schools,"" which was so well-received it was translated into Spanish for use throughout Latin America. All of these activities have added substantially to the prestige (and growth) of CFPA.  The project also led to a positive change in governmental attitudes and policies toward FP. The project teaches that (1) it is possible for a regional organization to find its niche, function effectively, and develop new capabilities at the same time; (2) working at the regional level can yield higher quality outputs with lower costs; (3) organizations like CFPA need a full-time, apolitical Chief Executive Officer; (4) changing project environments (specifically, changing governmental attitudes about FP) can have a positive effect on a project.

"Project Completion Report on a project (9/80-12/87) to control malaria and create an ongoing control program in East and West Timor, Indonesia. Overall, the project (which was extended 3 years following a 1984 evaluation) has had a positive impact on malaria control in the short run and has made progress toward building long-run disease management capabilities.  In addition to house-to-house applicaton of DDT, other project interventions included use of larvivorous fish, drainage improvements, and application of larvicides to standing water. Quantifiable targets regarding spraying and incidence reduction have been exceeded.  In fact, a 9/87 evaluation found that:  (1) the protected population in East Timor increased from 11.8% in 1982 to 42.1% in 1986, slightly exceeding the target of 40%; (2) in West Timor the gain was from 14.2% to 31.9%, again slightly above the 30% target; (3) malaria no longer ranked first among reasons for treatment at health centers as it had in 1982, the percentage dropping from 18.2% to 12.01% in East Timor and from 18.9% to 14.2% in the West; (4) in four of ten districts visited, prevalence reduction from 1982 to 1986 ranged from a high of 28.1-69% to a low of 1.4-7.3% in East Timor and a high of 17.2-41.7% to a low of 0.6-4.9% in West Timor. On the other hand, the malariometric and entomologic surveys which found reduced incidence also suffered from very high error rates in reading slides by field microscopists, and monitoring of malaria prevalence was still inadequate.  The discovery of chloroquine-resistant falciparum malaria, not yet observed in the West, is a disturbing aspect. The evaluators concluded that despite the progress made, Timor will continue to suffer from malaria.  Given the severe resource constraints facing health activities on the island, they recommended:  (1) reducing spraying to one application in areas already covered or with low incidence; (2) sending Ministry of Health teams from Jakarta to Timor to measure the disease more precisely; (3) increasing use of drug control measures, including radical treatment of positive cases; (4) conducting field operations trials on ways of promoting greater community involvement in malaria control. While expensive spraying can control malaria in the short run in selected areas, long-term control depends on the development of a self-sustaining program, a major aspect of which must be strong community involvement in alternative control measures, including case finding, treatment, and source reduction through improved sanitation and drainage.  USAID/I is now testing community activities of this type in West Timor through the Comprehensive Health Improvement Program (497-0325).","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1987 12:00:00 AM","","Malaria|Pesticide spraying|Disease prevention and control|Epidemiology|Morbidity|Preventive health care","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAX699.pdf","117 KB","008558 - USAID.

"Project assistance completion report on a project (9/81-3/87) to create a capacity within the Government of Madhya Pradesh (GOMP), India, to develop community forestry management and encourage private plantings. In view of the haste in which the project was designed, its mixed success was predictable.  Of eight assumptions important for project success, only two proved correct, and both of these were directly connected to private planting.  Perhaps the project's most significant output has been the distribution of some 200 million seedlings to about 1.25 million private landowners. Planted on land that was otherwise idle, these trees have provided farmers with a cash crop and helped to restablilize the soil and increase groundwater recharge; survival rates have been 50-80%. Community forestry was far less successful.  About 47,665 ha were planted, but production in most of the plantations will not meet expectations, due mostly to lack of community participation.  It proved almost impossible to get neighboring villages to cooperate in woodlot management - in one panchayat (administrative area comprising 3-6 villages) several battles were fought over the issue and one man killed. Another reason for public forestry's lack of success was the spotty quality of extension by the GOMP's Social Forestry Directorate (SFD), created by the project as a wing of the Forestry Department.  Although the SFD appears to be becoming institutionalized, its extension staff remain largely untrained and often uncommitted to community work. (In fact, the SFD, at the PACD, elected to drop all further efforts at community development.)  Nor were matters helped by the lack of continuity in SFD leadership (6 directors in 5 1/2 years). The project's problems have made clear the need to ascertain, during design or before, whether high-level counterparts have both the willingness and ability to implement the project as designed.  Also, in projects where extension is important, some member of the design team should be experienced in extension services.  Other lessons are, inter alia:  (1) arrangements for research and training should be made outside the project agreement (ProAg), since the GOI gives a low priority to these activities; (2) both the PP and the ProAg should be translated into the local languages if staff are expected to be familiar with them; (3) if implementation is meant to be flexible, this should be spelled out explicitly in the ProAg, since otherwise GOI personnel will rigidly follow the procedures outlined; (4) permissible sources of origin of international training should include China and other such countries (to do otherwise is nonproductive and sometimes embarrassing); (5) rural projects should have the village (not panchayat) as the decisionmaking level.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","9/1/1987 12:00:00 AM","","Forestry|Firewood|Agricultural extension|Institution building|Public land|Private land|Rural areas|Community participation","India","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAX706.pdf","2,563 KB","008557 - USAID.

"Project Assistance Completion Report on a project (1979-87) to support the Caribbean Epidemiology Center (CAREC), a regional research center affilated with the Pan American Health Organization. Project outputs - to establish a training unit and data processing center at CAREC, provide training courses to 19 CAREC member countries, procure laboratory equipment, and produce educational materials - have mostly been met.  By 2/85 training had been provided to over 3,400 course participants; CAREC's ability to produce appropriate training materials had increased; member countries had experienced a significant increase in both surveillance and laboratory capabilities; and some CAREC expatriate staff had been replaced with qualified West Indies staff. After 1985, three activities were funded: noscomial infection control, traffic epidemiology, and occupational safety and health.  The noscomial infection program trained ""infection control nurses"" in hospitals in 10 countries and implemented programs to improve hand washing facilities, containment and transport of soiled linen, use of hospital equipment and supplies, floor cleaning practices, and isolation of infectious patients.  The program (which included special training in AIDS control, production of a manual, and an improved regional reporting system) has proven that low-cost interventions can have significant health impacts. The traffic epidemiology program was less successful; surveys of frequency, severity, and causes of traffic injuries and fatalities were performed and recommendations made for each country, but in only two cases did this information make its way to the Cabinet for consideration.  The lesson here is that programs that require multisectoral cooperation should only be attempted where there is broad-based political will and a responsible coordinating agency. The occupational safety program, which was provided only start-up assistance by the project, conducted risk assessments of occupational hazards in five countries, and held a 2-week training program for 19 environmental health officers. The project teaches the following lessons: (1) the period of time required for CAREC to grow into a confident regional institution suggests that organizational development takes time; (2) new organizations should be allowed to gain skills (and take responsibility for exercising each new skill) one at a time; (3) CAREC's growth and expansion over the last 18 years highlights the importance of providing timely, relevant service to constituents to earn their respect and support; and (4) CAREC's organizational and management structure may be useful models for regional cooperation in other development areas.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1987 12:00:00 AM","","Epidemiology|Research centers|Institution building|Technical training|Regional development","Eastern Caribbean","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAX719.pdf","736 KB","001757 - USAID.

"Project Assistance Completion Report for project (8/80-10/85) to improve the capabilities of Eastern Caribbean Ministries of Health by supporting in-country training for Environmental Health Officers and Assistants (EHO's and EHA's) and Emergency Medical Personnel (EMP's) in St. Lucia, Barbados, and other Eastern Carribean nations. Three EHO classes were held in St. Lucia for a total of 40 students, and two EHA classes were held, in St. Lucia and Antigua, for a total of 58 graduates.  Most graduates of these programs have remained employed in their fields and respective countries, although in some cases the countries that requested the training cannot, once the training is completed, afford to hire the trainees.  For example, St. Lucia was unable to support all the EHA's it asked to be trained, and there was no support at all for dental assistants (a factor that caused the dental component to be dropped).  In general, however, the public health capabilities of the participating governments have been improved. A separate component provided EMP training and support for the Accident and Emergency Department (AED) of Barbados' Queen Elizabeth Hospital (QEH).  The contractor (Project HOPE) provided a physician who was appointed acting head of QEH's AED.  During his tenure, new emergency room protocols were introduced and 14 physicians were trained. Although an illness prevented the acting head from completing his assignment, progress was such that the project goal was broadened to include improving all AED services; the training program was expanded to include training Emergency Room nurses.  As a result, 26 nurses were trained and 42 emergency medical technicians were hired and trained to provide pre-hospital emergency services.  QEH's emergency medical capabilities were transformed. A number of recommendations are made.  Graduates of project training programs should undergo continuing in-service training, and their professional progress should be monitored to ensure that training in fact speaks to their professional needs.  Also, the support of local professional associations is important to ensure the appropriateness of the project-initiated training programs in St. Lucia, which will/may be revived by the newly formed Sir Arthur Lewis Community College. The project teaches four lessons.  (1) It is possible to design effective training programs which do not encourage graduates to seek greater opportunities in developed countries.  (2) Absence of regionally accepted accreditation for graduates has been an obstacle to getting further training.  (3) One cannot overemphasize the importance of clearly defining the positions for which training programs are being designed.  Some EHA's still do not have clearly defined jobs.  (4) In Barbados in particular, social norms play an important role in determining whether a particular innovation is adopted.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1987 12:00:00 AM","","Public health care|Hospitals|Nurses|Health professional education|Emergency medical care","Eastern Caribbean|Antigua and Barbuda|Barbados|Saint Lucia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAX721.pdf","3,547 KB","001757 - USAID.

"Project assistance completion report on a project (FY82-FY87) to increase productivity in St. Vincent and St. Lucia, particularly in the agricultural sector, and to provide dependable access by road from productive areas to major population centers and ports. In many ways, the project achieved more than was anticipated.  In addition to (a) the increased movement of agricultural and industrial goods resulting in a 25% increase in overall productivity in the two countries and (b) decreased operating costs on project roads resulting in a savings of $0.08 per mile, an added project benefit is the experience gained by the Ministries of Communications and Works (MCW) to undertake rehabilitation work.  The MCW of St. Vincent is continuing to do similar work under the St. Vincent Infrastructure Project (5380138.07). Only one aspect of the project has not been satisfactorily completed. Under the project grant agreement between the Government of St. Lucia (GOSL) and USAID and the Government of St. Vincent (GOSV) and USAID, it was agreed that all equipment purchased by USAID under the project would be turned over to the respective Government Funding Schemes  (GFS) at the conclusion of the project.  The GOSL and the GOSV have not yet completed this action, and RDO/C will monitor this activity to insure satisfactory completion.  This will be done together with the monitoring exercise on the on-going St. Vincent Infrastructure Project, which is basically a successor to this project. Several lessons learned include:  appraisal of a road project of any kind on these small islands should be based on an analysis of the entire system, rather than isolated segments; the force account method of construction should continue to be preferred, even at the risk of delays and cost overruns, to help create a local institutional base; consideration should be given to insistence on the use of crushed stone or gravel surfaces on some feeder roads with low traffic loads (and excepting steep grades) in place of hard surface, as a cost-saving measure; and more attention should be paid to the issue of road maintenance.  These recommendations were incorporated into the design of the follow-on St. Vincent Infrastructure Project.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","9/1/1987 12:00:00 AM","","Road construction|Farm to market roads|Agricultural productivity","Saint Vincent and the Grenadines|Saint Lucia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAX803.pdf","99 KB","001373 - USAID.

"Non-project assistance completion report on a FY86 program to facilitate structural adjustment in the Government of the Commonwealth of Dominica (GOCD). This program assistance proceeded very smoothly.  Within days of the 6/26/86 signing of the Grant Agreement, the GOCD provided A.I.D. with documentation in satisfaction of three conditions precedent to disbursement:  documentation attesting to the authenticity and binding nature of the agreement; documentation attesting to the authority of the individuals acting on behalf of the GOCD; and evidence that the GOCD had, in connection with the Tight Consultative Group process, drawn up a plan of action for developing a medium-term structural adjustment program, and the the GOCD was actively supporting that development. A.I.D. disbursed the single tranche of the program on 7/1/86, soon after the conditions precedent were met. Over the course of the ensuing nine months, the GOCD complied with the balance of its commitments under the program.  RDO/C sent a final ""close-out"" implementation letter to the GOCD in May 1988.  The final commitment met by the GOCD was to report that during the 12-month period following disbursement, Dominica had imported from the United States goods in value at least equivalent to the amount of the Grant. RDO/C is satisfied that all conditions and covenants were met in a timely manner, that the Agreement was adequately implemented by the GOCD, and that the ""project"" should be closed out. No evaluation of the program has been conducted, but an audit carried out early in 1988 was positive in its findings. Implications for the future, given new guidance on cash transfer programs, are that implementation will be far more labor-intensive, especially since tracking of Grant proceeds and local currency equivalents will be more detailed.  The management capabilities of the GOCD (with regard to cash transfers) is good enough that Mission does not anticipate undue hardship in the application of the new guidance should another round of program assistance be approved.

"Final, external evaluation (conducted 11/87) of a project to support research and advocacy activities undertaken by the Institute for Liberty and Democracy (ILD) on behalf of Peru's large informal sector. ILD has made a significant contribution to the intellectual and political debate on Peru's informal sector.  It has demonstrated the value of market-oriented regulatory analysis and energized discussions on the legal framework necessary for economic and social development. ILD has also helped to promulgate new laws aimed at alleviating some of the problems facing the informal sector, a necessary first step toward changing the policy and regulatory environment.  Local professionals are unanimous in praising the main thrust and effectiveness of ILD research, and ILD's best known publication, the book El Otro Sendero, has been influential both in Peru and in other Latin American countries.  The book's findings about the Peruvian informal sector appear applicable, with modifications, to other LDC's. Less positively, however, ILD has not succeeded in publicizing its economic analysis methodology.  And although it has built useful links to various other Peruvian organizations in the public and formal private sectors, some of these have been allowed to falter. Some institutional problems exist as well.  ILD needs to strengthen its internal management.  Its Board of Directors and founding members' organization do not seem to oversee ILD activities or advise on strategy, which means that no independent check on senior management exists.  Since ILD does not conduct cash flow and sensitivity analyses, management now makes important decisions such as increasing salaries, hiring new staff, and using consultants instead of staff without being fully aware of their financial implications.  ILD's problems stem from its inability to develop financial management systems to keep pace with its quick growth.  ILD's ambitious planned 5-year program to triple its budget and increase its staff correspondingly would strain the management and research capacity of the institution beyond reasonable limits.  Also, although ILD employs a few experienced lawyers and economists who serve as project leaders, most of the staff are junior. These individuals cannot represent the ILD in public debates on ILD's economic research. ILD has diversified its funding sources away from its original sole dependence on A.I.D.; it is now seeking funds from multilateral funding institutions and the Peruvian formal private sector.  Recommendations are included.","Attached to PD-AAX-903","Special Evaluation","Documents","527-0000-C-00-7307-00","","11/1/1987 12:00:00 AM","","Institution building|Informal sector|Advocacy|Economic research","Peru","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAX903A.pdf","2,532 KB","006727 - Development Alternatives, Inc.

"Final Mission report on a project (6/84-12/87) to increase small farm productivity in St. Vincent and the Grenadines. The project, which was twice extended to permit completion of construction, resulted in few lasting improvements.  Positively, the project:  (1) built an extension to the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Agriculture (MTIA) office building; (2) built a prefabricated marketing shed and purchased a rack/pallet system to store produce for export; (3) set up a $100,000 fund and distributed loans; (4) collected and analyzed agricultural data and provided some related training; and (5) conducted a pilot winter vegetable activity. On the debit side:  (1) traders are not using the marketing storage facility; (2) the rack/pallet system has not been assembled and the forklifts and pallets were never purchased; (3) no market price information system was established; (4) the agricultural census was delayed a year due to an interministerial conflict, and the accuracy of the data, which remain in draft form, is questionable; and (5) only limited markets were identified for the winter vegetables.  Moreover, there was little success in research or training activities.  Research facilities/equipment were not upgraded; varietal trials had little impact; the planned pesticide safety program was not undertaken, and MTIA staff were not trained to conduct special yield forecasting studies. Several unforeseen factors - a change in the host government administration, the suspension of CARICOM concessional terms and marketing protocols for 3 of 4 target vegetables, the demise of the sugar industry after a 4/85 policy change, and A.I.D.'s shift from bilateral to regional projects - led to numerous changes in the already overambitious project design, in particular, to the addition, without a budget increase, of the winter vegetable activity which doubled the allocation to crop production at the expense of other activities. Several lessons were learned:  (1) extending the PACD without extending the TA contract did not lead to successful project completion; (2) a final evaluation conducted 2 months before extending the PACD a year cannot assess final project impact; (3) widespread support is needed for an agricultural census to succeed; (4) crop research, especially when conducted by a regional organization (here, CARDI) and a local unit, should be carefully focused and structured; (5) market research and identification are critical before engaging in crop production; (6) adding new components without additional funds or TA demands paying greater attention to the original objectives; (7) when external factors intervene, it is necessary to reassess project assumptions and possibilities; (8) institutionalization requires early identification of counterparts and trainees; (9) MTIA lacks the capacity to manage USAID advance funds.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","12/1/1987 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural productivity|Agricultural product marketing|Agricultural research|Agricultural credit|Data collection|Data analysis|Project sustainability","Saint Vincent and the Grenadines","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAX956.pdf","216 KB","003002 - Ronco Consulting Corp.","","001757 - USAID.

"Final Mission report on a Housing Guaranty (HG) loan and companion grant (9/82-12/87) to promote private sector initiative in producing low-cost housing in Barbados. The project significantly expanded financing to lower-income borrowers.  Repayment rates have been good.  (1) The mortgage component made 237 loans - 143 totaling $4.2 million from HG funds and 94 totaling $4.4 million from loan reflows.  HG funds were lent through the Barbados Mortgage Finance Company (BMFC) and Caribbean Commercial Trust.  (2) The home improvement (HI) program used commercial banks and credit unions to make 3,407 loans worth $6.2 million.  The program's large scale and the positive attitude of borrowers (who represented a broad cross-section of the low-income population) suggest that there is a large pool of low-income homeowners who are interested in improving their property and are good credit risks.  (3) Due to the Ministry of Housing and Land's (MOHL) strong promotion of rural (vs. urban) tenantry lots which are affordable for cash, the tenantry loan program proved unnecessary. Nonetheless, its objectives have been achieved.  Also, many people used HI loan funds to purchase tenantry lots. TA was well justified, cost effective, and very instrumental in project success.  A Housing Credit Fund (HCF) was established within the MOHL as implementing agency for the HG; the HCF is expected to have a long-term impact on housing policy (continued TA is recommended).  The project also helped develop a National Housing Plan, computerized MOHL financial and research data, and provided other training/TA to credit unions, private builders and lenders, and other Barbadan staff. Moreover, the project gave commercial banks a positive experience which has led them to increase lending of their own funds to low-income borrowers, and also gave BMFC experience in lending to low-income homeowners, particularly those building chattel houses.  Project design was suitably simple and implementation steady. Lessons learned are as follows: (1) government financial resources should be directed only at beneficiaries below a specified level, and subsidies only at those at the bottom of the income ladder; (2) except when the private sector will not build and housing is needed, the Government should focus on planning and on providing financial incentives to private builders, using a turnkey approach; (3) HI loans are an effective way to improve housing stock and move money through the private sector; (4) economic motivation can induce the private sector to enter a low-income market perceived as risky and less profitable; (5) constraints to expanding the role of the private sector in low-cost housing include not only financing, but also small downpayments, unavailability of small low-cost lots, and reluctance to build modest units.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","12/1/1987 12:00:00 AM","","Housing investment guaranty|Low cost housing|Housing credit|Mortgages|Home improvement|Institution building|Private sector","Barbados","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAX953.pdf","712 KB","005964 - Barbados.

"Final Mission report on a project (9/82-9/87) to promote private agro-industry in Jamaica by delivering long-term credit through the Agricultural Credit Bank (ACB) and supporting the investment promotion (IP) program of Agro 21 Corp. Component 1 helped capitalize the ACB's Agro-Industrial Development Fund for projects submitted by private entrepreneurs through commercial banks (CB's). Implementation was hampered by the ACB's insistence that it review CB assessments of loan applications, which the CB's regarded as an intrusion into the banker-client relationship. Based on recommendations made by Checchi and Co. - which provided TA and ACB staff training and prepared pre-investment feasibility studies - USAID/J simplified the loan procedures and strictly limited ACB's role in loan approval. In all, the 5 participating CB's executed 24 loans for $4,950,164 - of which the Government of Jamaica (GOJ) provided $3,178,041 - for horticulture and food processing activities; the funding proved timely for Jamaican horticulture, which developed simultaneously with the project. Component 2 provided, during a critical period in the GOJ's agricultural diversification effort, a core staff and operational support to Agro 21's IP program for high value crops suitable for cultivation on marginally productive sugar holdings. Under a complex and ambitious Strategic Planning Program, Agro 21 prepared analyses of sub-sectors and commodities, enlisting for this effort the services of various local experts, the Ronco Consulting Corp., and the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Overall, Agro 21 commissioned 15 sub-sector profiles, 12 targeted studies, and 3 pre-feasibility studies. The Program, which as a whole established an information base for IP activities and institutionalized a capacity to generate that information, began and ended with a series of reports describing the investment potential of select import substitution commodities. (The specific commodities studied by Agro 21 are identified in the report.) The project also upgraded the computerized geographic information system of the Ministry of Agriculture's Rural Physical Planning Unit. Project experience reinforces the need for careful and realistic project design. The six amendments and the slow disbursement rate indicate that the project was overdesigned and overfunded. This is especially true of component 1, which overestimated private sector demand for long-term agro-industrial credit and failed to anticipate the problems posed by an investment environment in which even preferential interest rates ranged from 14.5% to 19%. Also, the ACB Fund, may not have been the best way to deliver credit in a country undergoing austerity and structural adjustment programs.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1987 12:00:00 AM","","Agribusiness|Private enterprises|Long term credit|Agricultural credit|Agricultural investments|Investment promotion|Investment environment","Jamaica","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAX988.pdf","303 KB","008563 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to provide TA and training to staff of the Ministry of Finance and Trade (MOFT) of the Government of The Gambia (GOTG) to improve their financial and economic analysis and policy making capabilities.  External evaluation covers the period 6/84-2/87. A.I.D.'s commitment of $2 million has remained unchanged, but certain expenses (e.g., unit cost of training) were less than expected, allowing for increased levels of TA and training.  By the end of the project in 9/88, 16.3 years of long-term training - twice the amount planned - will have been provided, and short-term training is expected to exceed projected amounts as well.  Long-term TA, originally scheduled for 42 months, has been stretched to 61 months by the addition of a second advisor. The project has had good success in helping the GOTG institute its Economic Recovery Program, and the project's senior advisor was instrumental in the GOTG's decision to float the dalasi's foreign exchange rate, a measure that has had profound impact on the economy and forms the basis for GOTG recovery efforts.  The senior advisor and the project's short-term consultants have also recommended developing a forward foreign currency market (to spread the risk associated with a floating currency system), reforming the customs collection system, and studying the feasibility of a sales tax; they have also advised the GOTG on other monetary reforms and on the reform of parastatal enterprises. The second long-term advisor's work in helping the GOTG implement the IMF Stand-by Agreement and in training MOFT staff in computers and economic analysis, have also been fulfilled successfully. With regard to formal training, seven GOTG employees are receiving advanced training in economic analysis in the United States or third countries, while others are receiving short-term U.S. training. The project has also worked to establish an MOFT financial analysis arm, the Statistics and Special Studies Unit (SSSU). The GOTG's austerity program has made the hiring of staff difficult, but the SSSU is nevertheless scheduled to be staffed in the near future. No significant changes in the project are recommended, although it is suggested that the overseas training contract be amended to allow the training of GOTG customs officials in Britain.  The PACD should be extended to allow the completion of overseas training. This has been an unusually successful project, thanks to the GOTG's recognition that reforms are urgently needed and the outstanding quality of the TA team.  Other factors influencing project success were: (1) the analytic unit's clear agenda, which enabled them to make straightforward decisions, (2) the decision to reserve training for GOTG staff who could bring about change; (3) the attraction of long- and short-term training in the United States for quality staff; and (4) the PP's flexibility, which allowed appropriate changes in inputs.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","3/1/1987 12:00:00 AM","","Policy analysis|Policy making|Economic policy|Economic reform|Institution building|Economic analysis|Technical assistance","Gambia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDBBS113.pdf","570 KB","008545 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to strengthen agricultural research (AR) in Bangladesh.  Final evaluation covers the period through 11/87. Results are mixed.  The Bangladesh AR Council (BARC) has become more effective in working with the nation's semi-autonomous AR institutes and in coordinating the drafting of a long-range, unified, national AR plan. It has also successfully managed contract research and P.L. 480 funds for the institutes, helped to shift AR focus to cropping systems and farming systems research (CSR/FSR), and sponsored an impressive number of seminars and workshops.  There remains room for improvement in all BARC services, however (particularly information management and training coordination). Project targets for overseas training were met, but to little avail, as all of the returned participants were assigned to BARC or Agricultural Research Institute headquarters, none to the regional AR stations or FSR work. AR outputs varied:  crops research was fairly successful, vegetable research unsatisfactory, livestock research nonexistent.  The new soil and plant analysis lab had only a limited impact, and although the project contractor made several water management recommendations, none were implemented.  CSR was a success, resulting in some useful farmer technology.  However, the current move toward a more complex, 24-site FSR program is too ambitious, given the cost of FSR and the limited in-country training which field scientists have received (training in economic analysis stopped when the contractor left; training in social systems analysis was never provided).  Finally, the project's women in development (WID) component was virtually ignored. Recommendations are made to improve BARC services, encourage BARC scientists to perform field work, strengthen training, and improve the FSR and WID components. In sum, while the project's objectives of creating a coordinating Agricultural Research Council, training scientists, and promoting FSR are valid goals, these are novel ideas in Bangladesh and will take more time than anticipated.  The BARC training unit must be given more authority and resources if it is to meet national AR needs.  Similarly, once trained, scientists must perform field work, if AR is to have any impact on rural farmers.  The project also teaches that FSR is expensive, demands strong inputs form conventional AR centers, and takes longer to develop than other forms of AR.  Because of its complex organizational problems, FSR has seldom been successfully institutionalized on a national basis.  Finally, if WID components are to have any success at all, there must be an agreement among all parties to create a program of on-farm trials with women participants, staffed by women scientists.","Companion evaluation summary: PD-ABB-592|Delivery order no. 8","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-1406-J-08-7011-00","","11/1/1987 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural research|Research planning|Research centers|Research management|Agricultural education|Farming systems research","Bangladesh","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAY005.pdf","5,287 KB","000480 - Experience, Inc.","","008588 - USAID.

"Evaluates institutional aspects of CARE's Food for Work (FFW) and Feeder Roads Programs in Bangladesh. Evaluation methodology included investigation of a stratified random sampling of 12 upazilas. In general, the Project Implementation Offices (PIO's) charged with implementation and monitoring functions in each upazila lack the staff and transportation to adequately monitor all FFW activities. Some 22 institutional bottlenecks in four broad categories (road planning and design, wheat utilization, road completion, and wage payment) were identified as reducing the efficiency and performance of the program. Specifically, road design and completion problems stemmed from inadequate planning and monitoring capabilities at the upazila and union levels; many times site selection was seen as politically motivated, and PIO's often lacked adequate transport to monitor construction progress. Inadequate wheat utilization in many cases could be traced to delays in construction start-up due to the rainy season, while in certain other cases it could be traced to labor shortages in the FFW program caused by unauthorized cash payments (workers will almost always prefer to be paid daily in cash than weekly in wheat) or because signs that were to be posted on site to advertise the wages were missing. Another possible cause for less-than anticipated wage payments could be the diversion of wheat at the upazila level by officials. The FFW program generally lacks a clear mandate for institutional development and, as a result, institutional development objectives have often been sacrificed to other development and accountability considerations. CARE has concentrated on providing guidelines and training, neglecting organizational structures and incentives. This approach, while not conducive to institutional development, has nevertheless tangibly improved technical capacity at the upazila level. A number of recommendations address these issues; specifically, plans to decentralize road maintenance and construction to the upazila level are not seen as feasible. Instead, it is recommended that the Zilas continue to tender for contractual services. Annexes include a variety of supplementary and statistical information.","Companion project evaluation summary: PD-ABB-398","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-1096-I-06-5050-00|388-0056-C-00-7001-00","","5/1/1987 12:00:00 AM","","Road construction|Road maintenance|Food for Work","Bangladesh","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAY010.pdf","4,200 KB","","","008511 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to develop a system for providing PVO's with training and TA from university experts in water harvesting and aquaculture (WH/AC).  Evaluation covers the period 7/84-5/87. Some progress has been made despite confusion between A.I.D and participating PVO's over the purpose of the project.  Originally the project was to (1) develop a collaborative management methodology involving PVO's and U.S. universities; (2) implement and evaluate a strategy for using WH/AC as a key development strategy; and (3) conduct nine field projects at 26 sites, directed toward moving villages toward self-sufficiency in water. Good progress has been made on implementing a system through which PVO's can obtain TA from university experts for WH/AC field operations and on fostering cooperation among participating PVO's.  Unfortunately, almost all project assistance to date has focused on fish production and been provided by the International Center for Aquaculture (ICA) at Auburn University; there has not yet been any evidence that the project's collaborative methodology will work with broader issues or achieve the cooperation of other universities.  In fact, most PVO and A.I.D. field personnel did not know about other assistance available under the project. ICA's training and TA have been uniformly praised by project participants, but it does not seem likely that the field activities supported by the project will achieve the project's purposes in promoting water self-sufficiency.  It does not even seem that the PVO's agree about what these purposes are, nor did the methods used to select the project's field activities particularly emphasize these purposes. Evaluation instruments developed to monitor the project have similarly been ignored. Project activities might have more impact if PVO's were required to fund more of the project's operating expenses.  In view demand for ICA assistance, A.I.D. funding should continue for another 2 years, as originally contemplated, but it is strongly recommended that A.I.D and the PVO's clarify the purposes of the project.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","5/1/1987 12:00:00 AM","","Aquaculture|Fish culture|Private voluntary organizations|Water supply|Technical assistance|Water management|Universities and colleges","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAY021.pdf","2,020 KB","000356 - Checchi and Co.

"This document presents lessons learned for child survival, gleaned from more than 100 recent (1980 forward) evaluations of A.I.D. health or health related projects; primary focus was on projects in A.I.D.'s child survival emphasis countries. Following an introduction and summary, the document is divided into three sections:  (1) lessons learned from child survival emphasis countries; (2) lessons pertaining specifically to oral rehydration therapy, nutrition, immunization, and birth spacing/family planning; and (3) other lessons (finance, research lessons from multicountry evaluations/analyses, and lessons from non child survival emphasis countries).  The material is presented in a format designed to facilitate use by Agency personnel - where available project numbers and DIS document identification numbers (DOCID's) are supplied. The major lessons learned can be synthesized into these: mobilize support; test purported interests; assess risks; plan well; effect simplicity in design; select contractors carefully; work with other donors; plan implementation wisely; prepare TA teams well; follow the A.I.D. handbook; procure in time and wisely; monitor projects closely; reprogram or deobligate as necessary; respect USA/host country concerns.

"Evaluates project to encourage land use policy reform and promote natural resource management activities in Niger.  Final evaluation covers the period 12/79-9/87. The project is on the verge of a major breakthrough, and with additional time, it could provide a number of valuable lessons learned and inspire future natural resources development projects Agency-wide. Creation of the Service de la Planification et de Documentation (SPD), the project-supported planning arm of the Ministry of Forests and Fauna (MFF) has started to sensitize the Government of Niger (GON) to the importance of natural resource planning in national policy decisions. However, the SPD is essentially without tools and staffing at present. If the project is to be extended, as is recommended, all remaining activities should focus on development of the SPD. Forestry research efforts have centered on development of model sites and natural forest management.  The model sites component has been particularly successful, but continued success depends on the determiniation of the MFF to follow through.  Emphasis needs to be placed on training MFF staff in all facets of land use planning. Other project components (training, documentation, resource inventorying) need refinement.  Training and documentation can play key roles in disseminating project accomplishments, but so far have been given low priority; further donor assistance is essential.  Resource inventory activities (mapping, fuelwood inventories) appear useful, although in some cases methodologies have been flawed and uses have yet to be found for some of the maps produced. Financial analyses show that the recurrent cost burden for the SPD will vary from $90,000 to $165,000 per year.  On the other hand, the project-managed Guesselbodi forest site will yield a profit over the next 10 years, in effect providing sustained yields of wood and forage with no recurring costs. The project should be extended 6 months, so that the present TA team can finish its work, and a Phase II should be planned, but first it is necessary to resolve a number of management issues concerning the relationships between the TA team and their counterparts and between the project and A.I.D.  Currently, none of the GON personnel assigned to the project occupy a decisionmaking position within the MFF.  USAID/N should insist that Division Chiefs within SPD have at least the equivalent of M.S. degrees, and that the current counterparts be assigned directly to the Division Chiefs.  It is also recommended that a team leader be assigned and given the authority to ensure that all remaining activities focus on strengthening the SPD and that financial discipline in project expenditures be maintained.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","12/1/1987 12:00:00 AM","","Natural resource management|Environmental planning|Institution building|Forestry|Land management|Natural resource rehabilitation|Land use|Firewood","Niger","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAY080.pdf","5,464 KB","008585 - USAID.

"Presents final Mission report on a project (7/84-10/87) to strengthen the capacity of Zaire's Centre d'Etudes pour l'Action Sociale (CEPAS) to help the rural poor apply appropriate technology (AT) solutions to development problems. After a critical mid-term evaluation in 1985 and staff changes in 1986, the project was amended to focus its direction on valid AT activities, delete the video production component, and allow subgranting of funds for worthy AT efforts.  By the PACD, CEPAS had:  (1) developed a well-stocked and effectively managed AT library with 2,000 books, 1,500 brochures, and subscriptions to at least 25 periodicals; (2) engaged in 60 AT interventions with PVO's, NGO's, institutions, or individuals nationwide; (3) published five documents on AT; (4) produced an economical charcoal grill and developed/tested other appropriate AT tools and methods; (5) trained the three Zairians constituting the project staff - the Project Director, the Project Engineer, and the Librarian - in photography and funded a total of 10 trips for them, including one to India by the Project Director; and (5) provided training related to income generating activities in Kinshasa, Kikwit, and Lubumbashi. CEPAS continues to implement AT interventions and has addressed the question of the project's financial and program sustainability by hiring two of the three project staff to maintain the AT library and answer the many requests for AT information.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","10/1/1987 12:00:00 AM","","Appropriate technology|Private voluntary organizations|Reference libraries","Congo DR","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAY144.pdf","708 KB","008626 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of a $750,000 ESF grant to the Government of Tunisia (GOT) to provide credit to Tunisians whose homes were damaged in the 1982 floods. The funds have been used effectively.  An Award Commission selected 1,444 beneficiaries from a list of 1,856 candidates for relief. Beneficiaries were chosen according to the amount of flood damage to their homes and their annual income (less than 2500 dinars per year). Each beneficiary received a loan of 200-300 dinars, free of interest and repayable in five years.  An average beneficiary had an income of 716 dinars and his/her home had been damaged 40.6%.  The average house was about 82 sq. meters, with 2-4 rooms, and no indoor plumbing. Most of the beneficiaries lived in remote areas; administrative assistance provided by the Direction Regionale de l'Equipment was inadequate, so local authorities (Omdas) helped beneficiaries to fill out the necessary forms.  Administrative procedures were very simple and a minimum of documents was required. The only negative side to the program was the poor repayment record for the loans, but this was perhaps to be expected given the extreme poverty of the beneficiaries (20% had no income). This is a social problem which must be resolved with the help of the institutional authorities. The program could perhaps have been improved by a system that adapted the loan amount to the financial capacity and needs of the lender.

"Presents final Mission report on a project (8/80-12/86) to institutionalize a Soil and Water Conservation System within the General Directorate of Water, Soils and Irrigation (DGASI) of the Peruvian Ministry of Agriculture (MOA). The project was one of the most successful in the Mission's portfolio.  Accomplishments were substantial and exceeded targets in several key areas.  Success was particularly notable in the areas of training, extension of soil and water conservation practices, establishment of test sites, and institutional coordination with MOA extension offices and universities. Specific achievements were as follows.  DGASI drafted a law and justification to establish a National Soil Conservation System, and interinstitutional regional coordination committees were established in 8 of the 11 project offices.  The project also: (1) published two reports on the economic impact of the use of soil conservation practices - a farmer's earning report and a socioeconomic report; (2) printed four major publications and several small brochures and published five technical booklets on various conservation practices and a summary edition of the ""Economic Impact"" of the Use of Soil Conservation Practices in the Peruvian Andes; (3) established 5,763 test areas in the Departments of Cajamarca and Junin for measuring the effect of conservation practices on soil erosion and water retention; (4) trained 8,100 farmers and technicians through short, onsite courses and field days, demonstrating soil and water management practices on 7,000 test plots, 3,800 terraces, 2,100 contour furrows, and 100 highland pastures. The soil conservation practices introduced by the project were very successful, increasing crop yields by as much as 119%.  The most significant indicator of the project's impact is the creation in 1/88 of a National Program of Watershed Management and Soil Conservation, based on the organization of this project. For this new system to be effective, the Mission recommends that: (1) the system continue to coordinate with other agencies, public and private, in identifying high priority watersheds in coastal and high jungle areas where soil erosion and/or water management are a problem; (2) more emphasis be given to the application of appropriate resources, native pasture/rangeland management, and reforestation; and (3) the project's data collection and analysis system be maintained and improved so it can adequately monitor longer-term results of the project's conservation practices.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1987 12:00:00 AM","","Soil conservation|Water conservation|Agricultural technology|Technology transfer|Institution building|Government departments","Peru","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDKAM581.pdf","54 KB","008591 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (6/79-9/86) to assist the Government of Lesotho's Ministry of Education (MOE) in developing an Instructional Materials Resource Centre (IMRC) to provide teacher-training services and instructional materials for primary and secondary schools. All project goals were met or exceeded, and the IMRC has become an integral and respected part of the MOE.  The IMRC facility financed by A.I.D. is attractive, functional, and appropriate in design, size, and cost.  Through a participant training program, seven IMRC staff members received M.A.'s in educational media and two received B.S.'s in education from U.S. institutions; six completed courses in production equipment maintenance and operation; and six received certificates in audiovisuals and graphic arts.  The project also provided on-the-job training for IMRC staff. The IMRC has 50 clients for its print and audiovisual products (e.g., charts, graphs, textbooks, radio programs, and teacher-training videos) and instructional design and research services.  IMRC products are generally as good or better than local commercial quality and produced at a lower cost.  The number and type of production jobs have increased steadily each year.  The IMRC now has a positive cash flow through its MOE revolving fund deposit account. Less positively, however, the IMRC Instructional Design and Research units are small, unfocused, and insufficiently organized.  There is also a need for text editorial services, which currently are not provided by either IMRC or the MOE's National Curriculum Development Center.  The MOE is currently assessing IMRC's present and potential role as national textbook publisher and/or distributor.  USAID/L will assist in long-range planning as part of its Basic and Nonformal Education Systems Project. Lessons learned are:  (1) Project designs should allow for maximum strategy flexibility by implementors.  (2) Five years is too short for institution building in cultures where the development of different work behavior skills is required.  (3) Professional and institutional development were allowed to occur at IMRC because of a high level of staff continuity.  (4) Projects must have the capability to provide products and services that are not exactly in line with USAID's strategies, such as the IMRC's innovative and potentially controversial media services.  (5) IMRC interim evaluations were useful because they involved all staff members.  (6) No project design can succeed without the right implementors.

"Presents final Mission report on a Phase II integrated rural development project (1983-86) conducted by Africare in the village of Tara, Niger. Despite the best efforts of all concerned, results of the project, which was largely implemented by local cooperatives, were far from its ambitious, perhaps even unrealistic, expectations.  Rice, poultry, and fish production activities had decreasing outputs each succeeding year, while the component to train rural artisans encountered serious problems as the artisans had little access to credit.  With the end of the project, all activities have apparently come to a complete stop and the project site has been completely abandoned. A mid-term evaluation by RONCO and Africare's own completion report cite various factors as hindering project implementation. (1) The people of Tara were not motivated because they never really suffered from serious drought problems or famine.  (2) Since the beginning of activities under Tara I in 1976, the members of the different cooperatives were not required to pay for inputs and services.  (3) The villagers did not associate their personal interests with the cooperatives' goals, objectives, or activities.  (4) The members were not trained or involved in all the operations a production cooperative must manage (inputs, marketing, transport, etc.).  (5) The village of Tara is split into different factions, and some people worked against the project because they were excluded from its decisionmaking hierarchy.  Also, the chairmen of the cooperatives apparently were not elected by the members but appointed by the village chief from his family.  (6) The TA team (agronomist, community development specialist) did not coordinate their activities in a way which supported one another, nor did they collaborate with similar projects in neighboring areas. A.I.D.-funded development projects should be set up according to A.I.D. standards.  It is difficult to use A.I.D. policies and regulations to assess a completed project if these have been ignored during the project's life.  Future grants should stress that village involvement - in terms of both labor and money - is required.  TA should be used for training and counsel, not as a substitute for villager participation.  Finally, marketing remains a critical problem in income-generating activities; the Tara experience shows that if grain stocks from previous campaigns are not sold, farmers will have no reason to continue farming during the dry season.  A project situated so close to countries offering more competitive goods and prices than Niger is highly influenced by the domestic, regional, and import prices of agricultural products.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1987 12:00:00 AM","","Integrated rural development|Agricultural production|Irrigated farming|Rice|Poultry|Fish culture|Private voluntary organizations|Agricultural cooperatives|Community participation","Niger","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDBBN070.pdf","5,503 KB","","","008585 - USAID.

"Evaluates a cooperative agreement with the International Center for Research on Women (ICRW) to provide TA to A.I.D. offices on Women in Development (WID) issues.  This external evaluation covers the period 4/85-9/87; the evaluation also assesses the extent to which the ICRW has supported institutionalization of A.I.D.'s WID policy (although this was not an explicit project goal. ICRW's services, both to Missions and to A.I.D./W's WID office, have been well-executed and well-received.  ICRW has made particularly strong contributions in:  defining gender issues; elaborating sex-desegregated data; and contributing design suggestions on the basis of primary and secondary data analysis. ICRW activities have had some limitations, however.  Short-term, project-specific TA has assisted specific projects, but has had minimal impact on the institutionalization of WID activities within A.I.D.  TA to Missions in the form of portfolio reviews and training has had a wider impact, particularly on heightening awareness, but has still fallen short of integrating WID concerns in Mission systems or procedures.  The impact of ICRW's TA has also been limited by insufficient dissemination of materials and lessons learned.  Also, ICRW's small staff size at times contributed to scheduling difficulties. And for reasons not clear to the evaluators but acceptable to A.I.D. and ICRW, ICRW did not implement the country needs assessments, workplans, and follow-on educational/informational components originally planned. In general, the cooperative agreement mechanism has proven inappropriate both for providing TA in response to ad hoc Mission requests and for supporting the institutionalization of WID policy. Although central funding and the ease of accessing services under the agreement has encouraged Missions to seek WID-related TA, more direct Mission control over the services is needed.  It is recommended that TA be continued, but through a Mission buy-in contract partially financed with central funds. A.I.D.'s WID policy is not being implemented fully or vigorously, and there is little enthusiasm and few incentives for doing so. Much more attention should be given to generating an A.I.D. commitment to WID policies.  Given the lack of systems and procedures, the initiative and interest of individuals is the most significant factor influencing the institutionalization of WID in A.I.D.  Future initiatives should focus on developing Mission systems, procedures, and staff capabilities to undertake WID activities that contribute to overall A.I.D. program impact. Specific suggestions are provided.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-0085-I-00-6098-00","","12/1/1987 12:00:00 AM","","Women in development|Technical assistance|Central funding|USAID|Development policy","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAY404.pdf","3,970 KB","000436 - Development Associates, Inc.","","003433 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to strengthen the African Confederation of Cooperative Savings and Credit Associations (ACCOSCA), a pan-African service organization for savings and credit cooperatives.  External evaluation covers FY85-2/87. Having received major funding from A.I.D. and other donors since its founding in 1968, ACCOSCA performs a valuable role in servicing the African credit union (CU) movement, especially through training of national CU leaders.  Its risk management program has gained wide support, while not yet generating significant revenue.  As an institution, ACCOSCA has performed its self-management and financial reporting roles with increasing professionalism and efficiency since the early 1980's when major criticisms were leveled at the organization. Affiliation of additional national CU movements, on the other hand, has proved exceeding difficult (in part because no project resources are specifically earmarked for this activity) and should be given less emphasis than is the strengthening of current affiliates. Specific accomplishments in the 18-month period being evaluated include:  effective training, ahead of schedule and above target; improved communication with affiliates; improved service delivery; attention to critical policy issues; resilient performance by member CU's, despite adverse economic and social conditions; and drafting of a medium-term development plan (1988-92). Major problem areas are those that have always plagued ACCOSCA - funding and income generation. generation are unrealistic and unachievable.  Collection of dues is below target, and not expected to increase significantly. While reasonable steps to collect dues should continue, the requirement that dues payment be required for full affiliate participation in ACCOSCA should be reviewed.","Attached to PD-AAY-451","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-1096-I-10-5049-00","","6/1/1987 12:00:00 AM","","Credit unions|Credit cooperatives|Institution building|Economic self sufficiency","Africa south of Sahara","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDAAY451A.pdf","16,078 KB","000436 - Development Associates, Inc.","","001554 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (1983-87) to promote agricultural diversification in St. Lucia through:  (1) increased banana export, (2) private sector marketing activities, and (3) creation of a land registry. Progress was made toward all objectives, although project design was modified in some areas.  For example, the banana industry improved dramatically without project assistance, so almost all of the funds allocated for this objective were transferred to the land registry component.  The remaining funds were used to finance computers for the Banana Growers' Association. To promote crop diversification, the project substantially upgraded three plant propagation facilities in Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) stations, established a Marketing Promotion Unit within the MOA, and designed an overall marketing strategy with a private sector focus. However, neither the GOSL nor RDO/C approved the strategy, which was a prerequisite for disbursement of remaining marketing funds.  Therefore, these funds were also reallocated to the land registry component. The bulk of the project was concentrated on TA for land registration and titling activities aimed at encouraging investment in agricultural infrastructure.  Prior to the project, approximately 45% of St. Lucian agricultural land parcels lacked secure title; only 20% had an adequate survey plan, and 23% had no written description of boundaries.  Land insecurity was a major constraint on the development of a more productive and equitable agricultural system.  The project demarcated, surveyed, and recorded a total of 33,287 parcels to create a land registry map of all parcels in the country.  The Land Registry office established by the project is now used on a daily basis by notaries and the general publc.  The number of transactions - mostly land certificates, land transfers, and mortgages - has increased from 178 in January 1987, to more than 600 in March 1988. Unfortunately, achievement in the land registry component was limited by difficulties in resolving family-land issues.  Due in part to inadequate or conflicting legislation, approximately one-third of all parcels are still unpartitioned family-land parcels, half of which do not possess absolute titles. Two lessons were learned.  (1) The project was blessed in that it enjoyed widespread popular and political support; without this support the project would have been doomed to failure.  (2) Projects must be flexible in responding to external influences, as demonstrated in the reallocation of this project's banana component funds.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","12/1/1987 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural diversification|Agricultural product marketing|Bananas|Land tenure|Land titling","Saint Lucia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAY489.pdf","343 KB","001757 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (8/84-12/87) to promote privatization of agriculture in Grenada and to strengthen the capacity of the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) and producers' associations. While immediate impact on the overall economy was not dramatic, several of the project's accomplishments will have long-term benefits. Refurbishment of the country's largest public market greatly improved its sanitation and orderliness.  Also, the Government of Grenada (GOG) has initiated a vendor fee system as a cost recovery mechanism, as recommended by A.I.D. A Pest Management Unit established within the MOA has made remarkable progress, providing training to farmers, commodity associations, and MOA personnel in pesticide management and plant protection.  These efforts contributed to Grenada's ""fruit-fly free"" status with the USDA, which allows fruit exports to the United States without phytosanitary restrictions. The prime TA contractor performed well, particularly in leading a multi-donor team to draft legislation to abolish the Grenada Farms Corporation and accomplish other land privatization goals. The MOA also adopted a contractor proposal to establish a Planning Unit, which has functioned effectively in the areas of staff analysis, policy planning, and monitoring of donor activities. Efforts to divest 35 GOG-owned estates have created a healthier agricultural investment climate.  Under an initial plan, 10 estates were returned to former owners who received project grants for land rehabilitation.  Under the newly elected GOG, this program was modified to support subdividing the estates for sale to smallholders.  Five estates were returned to former owners during this program, four were divested to smallholders, and four more were either retained for government use or recommended for sale as urban properties.  Project efforts to divest six parastatal agribusinesses made only limited progress: three were privatized or divested, two others were offered for sale but with no buyers, and one was retained by the MOA. An activity to deliver 12,000 tons of fertilizer to banana and cocoa associations was the most problematic.  The fertilizer arrived late, and at a time when storage space was inadequate. Temporary storage arrangements were poor, and considerable losses from weather damage and pilferage resulted.  After a formal investigation, the GOG made restitution to A.I.D.  Despite these setbacks, a survey of farmers who did receive fertilizer indicates that yields increased as a result. Two lessons were learned.  (1) Projects should allow adjustment to new conditions caused by changes in government.  (2) Projects must be closely monitored by technical project officers, even when an activity (e.g., fertilizer procurement) is solely the responsibility of the implementing agency.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","12/1/1987 12:00:00 AM","","Privatization|Agricultural land|Agricultural development|Divestiture","Grenada","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAY491.pdf","1,145 KB","008549 - USAID.

"This report presents the findings of an evaluation of the Madagascar Food for Progress program from 1986-87. With respect to macroeconomic impacts, the report found that barriers to international trade in rice have been eliminated. With respect to food sector impacts, the report found that the FFP program ""successfully accomplished its short-term goal of stabilizing prices for consumers in urban rice markets,"" and that the effectiveness of the buffer stock program was greatly aided by other rice supply factors in 1986-87.  Private operators in all sectors of the rice trade enjoy increased access to the market; a dramatically smaller proportion of rice is sold through official channels at subsidized prices now.  The report cautions, however, that the operation of the buffer stock has the potential for adversely affecting rice production and trade, since the government can be tempted to use the stocks to neglect the rural producers in favor of politically important urban consumers. This tendency of the government has resulted in some level uncertainty already, and thus operators have acted cautiously in production and trading. The bureaucratic management system supporting the buffer stocks is now unwieldy and stiff, and should be changed; the report also states that ""AID needs to drastically improve its monitoring and oversight of the operations of the buffer stock.""

"Evaluates two projects to provide development assistance (DA) funds to support PVO implementation of Food for Peace (FFP) Title II programs: the Outreach project, initiated in FY78 to encourage PVO's to expand their Title II programs, and the Enhancement project, initiated in FY85 to upgrade PVO capacity to manage feeding projects.  The evaluation focuses on possible funding alternatives to these projects. Both projects support the current trend toward Title II programs that have long-term development (as well as food assistance) objectives, and therefore involve more inputs, closer management, and higher costs.  In fact, in encouraging expansions, the Outreach project has created an ongoing need for more funding. A.I.D., however, has only a limited amount of funding available to support Title II, all of which is currently directed through the two projects.  PVO's, for their part, are unable and unwilling to increase their financial support, due to such factors as their own funding limitations, their increasing focus on development projects rather than feeding programs, and the restrictions placed by A.I.D. on integrating Title II foods into other PVO activities.  Nor do other ready funding sources exist. Host governments have been increasingly unable to support Title II, and food aid beneficiaries are generally too poor to contribute toward program costs.  Monetization has become an important funding source in some cases, but cannot be relied upon. Moreover, both A.I.D. and PVO's are increasingly questioning whether traditional programming represents the best use of Title II commodities and of their own resources.  Serious consideration of this issue is long overdue.  A.I.D. and PVO leadership should examine whether traditional feeding programs should be scaled back in order to mobilize food resources for development programs that have little or no feeding component.  They should also, however, consider whether FFP Title II should return to its earlier focus of food relief, perhaps in a child survival mode, with less emphasis on long-term development.  Or it may be that the current programs represent the best compromise between relief and development.  Once these issues are resolved, funding questions can be addressed. The evaluation proposes that DA funding be restructured to provide block grants to PVO Title II country programs and to central PVO management.  This format would explicitly recognize that A.I.D. funds constitute core support to Title II activities, not incremental funding for optional program improvements.  The grants should be provided on a multi-year basis in order to promote better PVO management and planning, and should be allocated on the basis of a formal set of Title II priorities.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-0000-I-04-6135-00","","10/1/1987 12:00:00 AM","","Food for Peace Title II|Private voluntary organizations|Development finance|Development program planning|Management operations|Block grants|Development strategies","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAY553.pdf","2,628 KB","000087 - USAID.

"Evaluates two Food for Peace (FFP) food distribution programs - a child feeding program and a drought emergency relief program - conducted under Section 416 of the Agricultural Assistance Act in Tunisia. External evaluation covers the period 2/85-9/87. The child feeding program had been part of the FFP Title II program for 20 years, and was gradually being phased over to the Government of Tunisia (GOT) during the early 1980's.  A Section 416 allocation of 8,843 MT was approved in 1985 so that GOT funds that had been budgeted for foods could be used instead - as a temporary measure - for infrastructural improvements to the program.  This occurred at a time when Tunisia had just had to relinquish its A.I.D. graduate status because of economic reversals. The program, which is strictly targeted to the poorest economic segments, delivers protein-rich foods to nutritionally vulnerable populations, and coupled with well-developed health and education components and committed GOT budgetary support, has had a significant impact on the health of vulnerable groups, school attendance and performance, and institutional quality.  In response to current GOT austerity measures that threaten the program's sustainability, A.I.D. has approved a short-term extension of Section 416 funding.  Overall, Section 416 has shown itself to be useful as a transition mechanism from Title II as well as boon during times of economic crisis.  The caution is that the hard-earned Title II phaseover gains made during the early 1980's be kept alive and well even in the face of economic pressure. The drought relief program allocated 57,000 MT during the disastrous harvest of 1986, but only part of the food was delivered prior to the 1987 harvest as planned, due to delays in the approval process, shipping, unloading, and distribution. Thus, rations intended for Fall 1986 delivery were not received by needy families until 3/87 and by small-farm families until 5/87.  Nonetheless, the food arrived during a period of economic stress and constituted a perceptible increment in rural family income:  wheat rations delivered to more than 200,000 families averaged 192 kilos, valued at 15 dinars ($18). The major lesson learned from the drought program was that processing and shipping procedures are not yet sufficiently streamlined to handle emergency situations requiring food delivery within 2-3 months of cable request.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","9/1/1987 12:00:00 AM","","Food for Peace|Child feeding programs|Emergency food distribution","Tunisia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAY563.pdf","487 KB","001690 - Development Assistance Corp.","","006215 - USAID.

"Evaluates Food for Peace (FFP) program conducted in Mexico under Section 416 of the Agricultural Assistance Act.  External evaluation covers 10/83-6/87 and is limited to FFP activities of the Mexican national social welfare agency (DIF) and Mexican PVO's. An FFP officer's 6/86 allegations of program mismanagement created undue alarm and lack of confidence in the A.I.D./M Representative and the program.  As a result, A.I.D./W increasingly and often unjustifiably delayed approval of project proposals, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture abruptly terminated milk availability in 2/87, thus temporarily suspending some projects and damaging program effectiveness. Nonetheless, the program exemplifies outstanding use of surplus commodities to alleviate the effects of structural adjustment on poor people and to demonstrate an advanced developing country (ADC) strategy. PVO's supervise milk distribution to more than 1 million recipients at over 1,500 locations, while the DIF distributes food to about 3 million people at 2,000 sites. Generally well-targeted to poor families and oriented toward self-help, the projects mitigate dependence, encourage local production, and provide incentives for use of family planning, health, and other services. Developmental outcomes have included an impressive mobilization of private funds and volunteers, institutional rehabilitation of DIF, and linking of private and governmental entities in a joint effort. Participating Mexican PVO's have improved effectiveness, strengthened development programming, broadened coverage and volunteer activity, and mobilized new donors. Achievements are greatly due to key individuals, particularly the DIF director, the A.I.D./M Representative, and the FEMAP (St. Mary's Food Bank) leader.  Although current impact seems likely to endure, eventual turnover of these leaders, in addition to national political and economic uncertainties, make the program's future unclear. Several lessons were learned.  (1) FFP needs a new approach for Mexico and probably for other ADC's.  A.I.D./M, DIF, and the Mexican PVO's merited a confidence that FFP frequently failed to give.  (2) Unless USDA can assure specific quantities on a multi-year basis, Section 416 projects are best limited to short-term budget or incentive support.  Even with a minimum guarantee, projects relying exclusively on one commodity, such as milk, involve unacceptable risks of irregular supply.  (3) Even temporary projects require commitments from local governments and PVO's that cannot be reversed quickly.  Sponsors and beneficiaries need at least 18-24 months notice of termination. (4) Although conversion of the Mexico program to FFP Title II would assure multi-year commodity availability, it would also institutionalize food aid in a country which, with the resumption of economic growth, will not need it.","Work order no. 4","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-1096-I-00-4165","","8/1/1987 12:00:00 AM","","Food for Peace|Commodity management|Private voluntary organizations|Milk products","Mexico","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAY565.pdf","2,605 KB","001690 - Development Assistance Corp.","","006215 - USAID.

"The purpose of this paper is to examine the P.L. 480 Title I program in Indonesia so as to better understand the extent to which it has contributed to the development process.  This paper concentrates on the period 1982-86 since during this time (1) significant macroeconomic issues confronted Indonesia and (2) A.I.D. was, in light of increasingly scarce Development Assistance (DA) resources, attempting to integrate the P.L. 480 program more fully with other development programs and policy concerns. The organization of the paper is as follows.  After an introduction, Section II outlines the macroeconomic situation facing Indonesia in the early 1980's and describes the efforts at stabilization and adjustment which were undertaken by the GOI. Then the basic elements of the P.L. 480 program during that period are described in Section III.  This includes the objectives of the program, the types and amounts of commodities provided, and the uses (primarily through self help measures) of local currencies generated from Title I sales.  Finally, Section IV discusses a variety of policy issues related to the Title I program.  These include whether the Title I program relaxes food or foreign constraints, the appropriateness of the program in light of Indonesia's macroeconomic adjustment efforts, and the extent to which desirable policy changes have been accomplished with local currency generated by one program.

"Final evaluation of two P.L. 480 Title III programs in Bangladesh. Evaluation covers the period FY78-FY86 and emphasizes the programs' policy aspects. The mix of commodities - foodgrains, vegetable oil, and cotton - seemed to promote policy reform and clearly helped fill the gap between production and consumption.  On the negative side, inclusion of rice seems to have been ill-advised because of possible disincentive effects on domestic rice production and the high cost of rice relative to wheat. It is recommended that rice be phased out during the next Title III program. Recent experience indicates that if Title III aid were not available, the Government of Bangladesh (GOB) most likely would have purchased food commodities on the world market, using its scarce foreign exchange and limited credit.  Thus, the programs have operated as a transfer mechanism for providing the GOB with foreign exchange. The programs were generally successful in promoting marketing arrangements that favored the private sector.  Rice and wheat were marketed mostly by grain dealers, through the Open Market Sales channel of the GOB's Public Food Distribution System; grain dealers also benefited from relaxed government control over business practices. Cotton was processed into yarn by public sector mills and sold to private handloom operators, who benefited from secure access to yarn and less restricted private mill capacities.  Soybean oil was processed by public sector plants and sold to private sector distributors. The GOB's record in providing adequate agricultural production incentives has been mixed.  While the GOB took positive steps such as increasing investment in irrigation, drainage, and flood control, it did not always uphold the foodgrain procurement prices announced prior to the crop season.  This failure may have lowered incentives to rice and wheat production, especially at a time when fertilizer subsidies were being reduced.  Similarly, incentives for oilseeds production may have been weakened by imports and subsidized sales (through the ration system) of non-Title III edible oil. All in all, the Title III programs achieved some notable policy successes.  In addition to encouraging private sector marketing, the program has helped to stabilize consumer grain prices and to reform the ration system.  The GOB has also taken steps toward a more efficient foreign exchange market, and it has made positive changes such areas as input pricing and the collection of outstanding agricultural loans. Although the World Bank was pursuing some of the same reforms, at least some of the GOB's favorable actions would not have been possible without Title III.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","5/1/1987 12:00:00 AM","","Food for Peace Title III|Policy dialogue|Agricultural product marketing|Policy reform|Agricultural prices|Agricultural production|Agricultural policy|Agricultural markets|Private sector|Economic policy","Bangladesh","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAY614.pdf","7,212 KB","008511 - USAID.

"An update on the status of the Title I program in Morocco covering events between May 1986 and August 1987, and addressing the four objectives of the program:  assisting in grain importing; encouraging economic policy reform; generating local currency for agricultural sector investment; and stimulating private enterprise through Section 108.  The report concludes that Title I resources have not distorted incentives for local production, consumption, or distribution, but may, through self-help, be contributing to the removal of distortions under the structural adjustment program. The Title I program has provided significant balance-of-payments support particularly in 1983-87, a role which was made explicit by a U.S. pledge to the consultative group to help Morocco's debt problem and was justified by Morocco's high debt service payments (68% of export revenues).  It is unclear exactly how much foreign exchange help is provided by the food aid, since heavy subsidies ""lead consumers to purchase more foodstuffs than they would without the subsidies, and so total import requirements are greater than they would be if the GOM were forced to eliminate the subsidy.""  Morocco has not purchased wheat on the cash market since 1979, benefiting from competition between donors. Most of the Title I assistance is wheat, and wheat's role as the dominant commodity has ""accorded the Title I program considerable leverage in agricultural sector self-help,"" except in the elimination of subsidies mentioned above.  The model proposed to describe Morocco's wheat situation is one where consumption is essentially ""exogenous to economic events, while domestic production is climate-driven, and the residual is imported."" Thus, P.L. 480 wheat imports are not serving as disincentives to local production (where producer prices are maintained higher than world prices), but rather climate is the constraining factor.  The structural adjustment program being implemented in the country is resulting in the removal of some distorting policies on the agricultural sector, but Title I is not the leverage point in these activities.

"This update report on Title I program assistance to Tunisia focuses on programmatic changes since the 1986 review paper was written.  The pre-1984 program was designed to support Tunisian agricultural programs and policies dedicated to accelerating production and farm income - balance-of-payments (BOP) support and budget support were not design elements of the program, nor were self-help measures targeted at economic policy reform.  This set of objectives could not maintain continued assistance, because the Tunisian economy is very broad-based and agriculture represents only 14 percent of GDP.  The objectives of the post-1984 program are unrelated to the old ones - Title I resources are programmed as a part of the total Mission resources, as a complement to ESF funds, targeted in the context of a severe structural adjustment process to provide a ""safety net"" within a ""relatively sophisticated economy undergoing difficulties and needing budgetary and BOP support."" ""If the structural adjustment process fails, or is greatly prolonged, then the Title I resources used in the safety net program will have provided nutritional benefits for those most affected.  If the government falls or greatly modifies its policies because of the hardships imposed by the structural adjustment process, then both the nutrition and foreign exchange benefits from Title I will alleviate some of those hardships."" Under the new regime, subsidies are being reduced, and although the price increase will reduce the quantity of food demanded, which may eliminate the anecdotally reported wastage of past subsidized grain, it will also directly affect the poorest segment of the population.  Thus, in such a transitional policy regime, any part of P.L. 480 resources which are targeted will contribute directly to nutrition, and will probably have some income effect, as will the restructuring of prices.

"Evaluates the P.L. 480 Title I programs in the Philippines in FY85 and FY86. The FY85 program provided $40 million worth of rice, while the FY86 program provided $35 million worth of wheat.  The selection of rice had several negative effects.  (1) The Philippine rice harvest in 1985 was very good and rice imports were not needed. In fact, rice stocks are still high, with growing risk of spoilage.  (2)  Since U.S. rice was much more expensive than rice from alternative sources, the FY85 rice program contributed about $17.5 million less in balance of payments support than would have been the case for wheat.  (3) Intense pressure from U.S. rice exporters made it impossible to switch to a more valuable commodity.  These U.S. market interests were exploited by the National Food Authority (NFA) in resisting self-help measures during both the rice and wheat programs. Specific policies were detrimental to the effective use of the foreign exchange resources provided by the Title I programs. Import restrictions and regulations were intensified and the exchange rate remained overvalued due to excessively tight monetary policy and manipulation of the ostensibly freely floating exchange rate. Nonetheless, policy dialogue was the most successful aspect of the programs, contributing to the development of several self-help measures, including:  (1) decontrol of milled rice prices, (2) opening of wheat importation and domestic flour distribution to full private sector participation, (3) NFA divestiture of all stabilization and trading activities except grain price stabilization, and (4) liberalized fertilizer importation and domestic distribution. Implementation of rice price decontrol has been satisfactory, and incentives to producers have been adequate.  However, an effective system for grain price stabilization needs to be established, and the Government of the Philippines' (GOP) capacity to enforce support prices needs to be strengthened. The apparent outcome of the wheat/flour privatization reforms has been essentially a transfer of monopoly power from the public sector to the private sector, and even higher consumer prices for flour.  This is in sharp contrast to the fertilizer sector reforms, which have moved prices favorably due to greater competitive forces. Contrast in implementation between the former and current governments has been striking.  The Marcos government readily sabotaged some of the reforms, demonstrating that little is to be gained by compelling an unwilling government to implement a reform. Even with a cooperative government, continued presence and significant allocation of financial and human resources will be required to help the GOP implement the complex, difficult reforms.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","3/1/1987 12:00:00 AM","","Food for Peace Title I|Rice|Wheat|Policy reform|Agricultural policy","Philippines","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAY618.pdf","867 KB","008592 - USAID.

"Since 1962 the equivalent of $773 million has been invested - 45% of it by A.I.D. - in the integrated rural development of the Jordan Valley. This paper measures the agricultural and socioeconomic impact of these efforts.  An overview of agricultural production rates and trends is presented, followed by an analysis of marketing constraints and resource efficiency. The paper then evaluates various institutions and services, including:  (1) regional department planning, (2) agricultural research and extension, (3) education, (4) health care, (5) agricultural credit and input supply, (6) irrigation systems, and (7) pest control.  Social indicators are assessed, such as population, migration, employment, income distribution, literacy, per capita income, contraceptive use, and housing conditions. Individual attitudes and expectations are presented through case studies.  Finally, the paper describes specific project activities in the land and water, public utilities, and transport sectors, as well as in institution building, followed by a summary of external financial assistance.  The paper concludes that the agricultural and quality of life improvements in the Jordan Valley may be unparalleled in development history.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","ANE-0260-C-00-7054-00","","1/1/1987 12:00:00 AM","","Integrated rural development|Agricultural development|Crop production|Quality of life|Socioeconomic development","Jordan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNABB302.pdf","14,350 KB","006235 - Tech International, Inc.|000241 - Louis Berger International, Inc.

"The role of U.S. private voluntary organizations (PVO's) in fostering and strengthening the development of local, host country PVO's is assessed in this study, which is based on a survey of 12 U.S. PVO's and 28 Third World affiliates or field organizations.  The study found that the U.S. PVO's had made a large and successful investment in training local affiliate personnel, but more needs to be done to help affiliates put in place the management and information systems needed for informed decisionmaking.  As part of a growing trend to emphasize financial autonomy for local affiliates from the beginning of the institutional development process, significant efforts have been made by PVO's to provide technical assistance in resource mobilization, with the result that even institutions long dependent on A.I.D. or parent PVO support have become largely self-supporting.  Accelerating institutional development, it is argued, finally depends on rethinking short- and long-term goals. Through technical assistance in resource mobilization, the period of time local affiliates are financially dependent on PVO support can be shortened, while the period PVO's provide training and technical assistance should be thought of as a cost-effective way of protecting the initial investment and so should continue indefinitely.","Later version: PN-ABC-822","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-0250-C-00-5123-00","","9/1/1987 12:00:00 AM","","Institution building|Private voluntary organizations","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNABB318.pdf","908 KB","000673 - International Science and Technology Institute, Inc.

"Evaluation of a Section 416 Program in Chile.  External evaluation covers the period FY83-FY87. All activities subsidized with Section 416 commodities are well-established, meet the statutory requirement to feed needy people, and include appropriate complementary services.  In the absence of a Mission in Chile, the U.S. embassy economic counselor and a local employee manage the program.  Their motivation, commitment, and ability, together with the high level of Chilean performance, produce excellent results.  A.I.D./W administration is less satisfactory and shows little consideration for Chilean capabilities or for the competing demands on embassy staff time.  The Government of Chile's (GOC's) National Secretariat for Development and Social Assistance effectively coordinates both private and governmental food programs.  Two Chilean PVO's monitor food distribution to centers operated by other local agencies, a role which is usually handled by U.S. PVO's in other countries.  The GOC pays embassy administrative costs, ocean freight and all local distribution costs, and makes substantial annual payments to the PVO's.  It will pay 1/3 of their ocean freight charges for FY87, increasing payments to 100% by FY89. On the negative side, shipping delays have been a significant problem throughout the program.  Agreements for FY87, for example, were not signed until early July, 1987, and commodity distribution will not start before FY88.  Lack of commodities has caused reductions in ration size, coverage, and regularity of distribution. From inception, the program has relied heavily on milk donations. Nevertheless, participating sponsors accommodated rapidly to the abrupt decline in milk availability in early 1987 by substituting rice and wheat.  The limited future availability of dairy products under Section 416 and the high cost of the program to the GOC make the program's future uncertain.  Although target group need remains strong, A.I.D. has not yet decided whether to continue the program and the GOC has not yet decided to continue participating.  Immediate resolution of these uncertainties is essential for effective program administration and for preserving the political benefits of past activities.  Program termination would require adequate notice to Chilean agencies and clear delineation of any political considerations involved.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","9/1/1987 12:00:00 AM","","Food for Peace|Emergency food distribution|Food subsidies|Milk products","Chile","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAY677.pdf","756 KB","001690 - Development Assistance Corp.","","006215 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (6/80-12/87) to strengthen the training capacity of Zaire's Ministry of Planning. Phase I of the project was a pilot program to test selected management training activities in collaboration with other national or foreign training institutions.  The project conducted a training needs analysis survey, established the National Center for the Coordination of Development Training (CENACOF), conducted workshops and seminars for 200 personnel, selected 50 candidates to be trained as CENACOF trainers, and developed a comprehensive management and training plan to be used in Phase II. During Phase II, CENACOF developed its core of trainers and conducted 16 in-country seminars for 153 trainers and 500 development personnel. The total number trained during both phases was 853, out of 1,500 planned.  The training provided has been well received by the GOZ and private institutions.  CENACOF received high marks in:  (1) use of participatory methods, (2) training in ""team-building"" and basic management techniques, and (3) training-related research and human resources planning services, such as training needs assessments. Although the project has been successful in producing outputs, general and financial management has been a serious and permanent problem at CENACOF.  Corrective actions recommended in two interim evaluations were not implemented, due primarily to a poor working relationship between CENACOF and long-term advisors. Internal problems will most likely persist, since two key members of the executive management committee and two professional trainers were fired or led to resign after denouncing the director general's leadership and financial mismanagement.  As a result, CENACOF is using two trainers who were not professionally trained, which may affect training quality.  CENACOF's ability to sustain itself through seminar fees is also uncertain.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1987 12:00:00 AM","","Institution building|Management training|Teacher training|Training centers","Congo DR","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDBBN868.pdf","404 KB","008626 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (9/81-9/85) to help the Tunisian Federation of Women Jurists (AFCJ) conduct research and disseminate information on women's legal rights in Tunisia. Overall, the project was a success.  AFJC published and distributed a question and answer guide providing quick answers to legal questions about women's rights; this work is now used as a valuable reference source in various regions of the country. The Federation also:  (1) hosted 9 public conferences and seminars, which were widely attended by jurists and women and proved very fruitful, despite difficulties in providing transportation to remote areas and in finding adequate meeting places; (2) conducted 21 extensions campaigns; and (3) produced a number of research and statistical studies which are to be published, along with their recommendations, in a special edition.  The main subjects treated in these efforts were women's employment, the causes of divorce, and women's participation in elective institutions; other subjects included, inter alia, juvenile delinquency and the guardianship of children.  The project also provided selected books and reviews to augment the AFJC library. On the negative side, the project suffered from its reliance on the President of the AFJC, who was very busy and did not have enough time to manage the project effectively.  The project officer attempted, with little success, to persuade the President to delegate authority in order to accelerate the pace of project activity.  The project was also delayed by the fact the the AFJC is under the sponsorship and financial management  of the National Union of Tunisian Women (UNFT), an organization headed by the then Minister and wife of the then Prime Minister.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","12/1/1987 12:00:00 AM","","Women in development|Women's rights|Legal education|Information dissemination|Legal research","Tunisia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDCBA009.pdf","147 KB","008616 - USAID.

"Evaluates human rights activities in Nepal, the Philippines, Thailand, Indonesia, Morocco, Egypt, and Jordan.  External evaluation covers FY79-9/87. Of 26 activities reviewed, 19 have successfully achieved project purposes and the remaining 7 have partially or mostly done so. Most projects were well-designed, with inputs delivered adequately.  Although an actual impact assessment is not possible due to lack of baseline data and sophisticated sampling methods, it appears that legal representation/counseling services have had the most immediate impact, while legal literacy and outreach programs through mass media have reached the most people.  As yet there is no evidence of impacts at the national level.  By themselves, the activities are too small to have any effect at the national level, and there is insufficient networking among activities to make a country program truly national. In Asia, A.I.D. directly manages human rights activities in Nepal. These activities are well-managed and generally on schedule.  The Nepal Women's Legal Services subproject has exceeded targets and positively affected thousands of women.  In the other 3 Asian countries, The Asia Foundation (TAF) has successfully managed activities involving research, seminars, institutional support, training materials, and legal assistance/education.  Only in Indonesia have activities been impeded by internal problems among local institutions.  TAF country staffs are small but knowledgeable in local languages, culture, and human rights. Activities in the Near East - implemented by America-Mideast Education and Training Services, Inc. (AMIDEAST) - include training law faculties and judges, study tours, books, seminars, research support, and TA.  Law faculty training at the International Institute of Human Rights in Strasbourg was the most effective activity; participants carried out several follow-on activities.  Successful seminars were also conducted in Morocco and in Jordan, while others, such as one at Zagazig University, Egypt, although less effective, nevertheless provided a forum for human rights discussion.  Research projects in the Middle East are rated low, on a par with similar projects in Asia.  There is also a need for projects to assist national legislatures and develop Arabic-language training and translation facilities. Several lessons were learned.  (1) Projects strengthening legal systems also strengthen human rights enforcement.  (2) Human rights activities should be mutually supporting and interdependent.  (3) Program designers and implementers should be sensitive to language requirements of participants.  (4) Human rights changes are more likely to result from political events, but the possibility of long-term impacts should not be discounted.  (5) These activities, though small, give Missions an opportunity to include human rights in policy dialogue.","Work order no. 13","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-0085-I-00-6098-00","","11/1/1987 12:00:00 AM","","Human rights|Legal aid|Civil and political rights|Women's rights","Asia|Middle East|Philippines|Nepal|Thailand|Indonesia|Morocco|Egypt|Jordan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDCBA565.pdf","2,666 KB","000436 - Development Associates, Inc.","","004200 - USAID.

"Interim evaluation of a project to promote watershed management in Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) through training and information exchange.  The evaluation was conducted 18 months before PACD. The project has wisely been directed away from its original, overly broad purpose of developing a watershed research network, and toward greater emphasis on training and information exchange. The training component has gained valuable organizational experience in overcomming regional constraints such as poor communication facilities and differences in languages, and already the goal of training 520 participants has been exceeded, although improvements are needed in selecting both trainees and training topics.  It is recommended that the project center in Los Banos, Philippines, be authorized to reject inappropriate candidates, and that project staff consult with national agencies to develop training curricula that cover only a few important subjects (four per country), the knowledge of which will help solve high-priority watershed problems.  The project also needs to develop a long-range strategy to organize training topics, target audiences, and prioritize activities. Information exchange also needs strengthening.  Although the Los Banos center is efficient and its publications are distributed using a continuously upgraded mailing list, the center could considerably lessen its workload by acquiring access to computerized documentation services. If direct link-up is not possible, commercial facilities in major cities should be contracted.  It is also recommended that the project develop a manual on watershed management. The research component has been implemented only to a limited extent due to poor design, questionable purpose, delays in receiving equipment, and, in some countries, by lack of solid commitment from national agencies.  At this late stage, efforts should at least be made to assure effective use of equipment already ordered. It is recommended that the project be granted an extension if funds are left over after the PACD and outputs are being achieved.  However, if more funds are to be allocated, the project should be redesigned. Concrete targets for the time remaining in the project are specified.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","4/1/1987 12:00:00 AM","","Regional development|Natural resource management|Watersheds|Environmental research|Information dissemination|Technical training","Thailand|Malaysia|Indonesia|Asia|Philippines","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDCBA635.pdf","7,367 KB","004200 - USAID.

"This paper presents the results of an analysis conducted at the request of USAID/Jamaica, examining the capacity of consumer dairy market to absorb an increase in the supply of cheese, butter, nonfat dry milk, and butter oil.  The review included an analysis of commercial imports of these commodities to ""determine the extent to which the P.L. 480 commodities affect commercial imports."" Over the three years of existence of the non-profit (JADF) which imports these commodities, the P.L. 480 imports have ranged from 31.3% to 41.9% of total imports.  This is below the informal guideline limits of 50-50 percent followed since the inception of JADF.  The dairy industry wholesaler buys JADF products at a lower cost than other cheese, which allows them to offer it at a lower price to consumers. Given the importance of price on consumption of dairy products in Jamaica, ""it is likely that more cheese is consumed"" through the subsidization effects of P.L. 480.

"PACR of a project (4/84-6/87) to repair, replace, or rehabilitate private, commercial, and public infrastructure and equipment damaged or destroyed during the military intervention carried out in Grenada in 10/83. At the Point Saline International Airport, damages totaling $1,743,617 have been paid, replacement equipment has been installed, and repairs have been completed.  All legitimate civilian claims ($1,983,264 in total) have been paid.  Repairs have been made on the Westerhall telephone exchange and the Radio Grenada station, which were severely damaged during the intervention.  Repairs were made at the Richmond Hill mental health facility as an interim measure prior to construction of new facilities. This construction was delayed initially by uncertainty as to what type of facility should be built, and later by design and site selection problems and heavy rains.  Eventually, a 26-bed acute psychiatric unit was finished at Rathdune in 11/86 and a multi-structure 80-bed facility for longer-term care was completed at Mt. Gay in 12/86; TA for improvement of community mental health services and associated on-the-job training were also provided.  The mental health facility is seen as a model for the region, but there is a good deal of concern that the facility's recurrent cost burden may be too great for Grenada to sustain. Several lessons were learned.  Under emergency conditions, A.I.D. effectively mobilizes financial and human resources to address discrete needs, especially for the renovation or repair of damaged infrastructure.  However, emergency and especially highly political conditions increase the difficulty of implementing projects that require intensive social and cultural understanding and delicate judgment calls. One potential problem is over-design.  Designs that meet minimum U.S. health/safety standards may be too costly for a developing country to maintain. At some point, A.I.D. might need to determine what is good enough given local conditions and standards, and build to those design criteria.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","6/1/1987 12:00:00 AM","","Foreign intervention|Economic infrastructure|Emergency relief|Project sustainability|Building design|Mental hospitals","Grenada","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAY831.pdf","694 KB","003002 - Ronco Consulting Corp.","","008549 - USAID.

"Evaluates a P.L. 480 Title II program in Ecuador for the purpose of assessing Catholic Relief Services's (CRS) proposal to extend the program by 2 years. The Maternal/Child Health Feeding and Food for Work programs have been moderately successful in fostering community development, but have suffered from lack of complementary resources and TA. Under the Other Child Feeding program, Title II commodities provided little more than an institutional subsidy to day care centers.  All told, neither CRS nor its counterpart, SENAPS, have sufficiently supervised and monitored the program; the few benefits are largely due to efforts of some of the dioceses. With the exception of the child survival component, no phase-out activities have been implemented.  This is due primarily to a 10-month lapse in assigning a CRS program director, the lack of a full-time CRS staff person for the food program, and the lack of complementary resources. In light of insufficient program management, supervision, and benefits, an extension would not be justifiable.  Although Ecuador is in need of development assistance, it is not a food deficit country.  It is recommended that CRS concentrate on development-oriented activities at the diocesan level, utilizing local food resources when required.

"Has the impact of project and program assistance by A.I.D.'s Asia/Near East Bureau over the past three decades been positive or negative?  The authors of the present study reviewed the existing literature, including some 100 impact evaluations, in an attempt to answer this question.  Their findings are presented in capsule reviews of the achievements and impacts of A.I.D. assistance in Egypt (11 projects/programs reviewed), India (9 projects/programs), Pakistan (8), as well as in Bangladesh (7), Indonesia (8), Jordan (7), Morocco (4), Nepal (6), the Philippines (5), Sri Lanka (4), Thailand (7), and Tunisia (5). Overall, the study found that, contrary to views put forth in some recent studies, Asia/Near East Bureau projects and programs have contributed to a variety of developmental effects.  These include:  (1) establishment of productive and durable institutions; (2) increase in small farmer incomes; (3) enhancement of private sector participation; (4) decrease in infant and child morbidity; and (5) decline in fertility rates. The areas of greatest impact seem to have been agriculture and population.  Also contrary to much of current development literature: both projects and programs were found to contribute to policy reform; benefit/cost analyses, when present, indicated that benefits were consistently greater than the cost; no negative unplanned effects on women were found; and many projects specifically benefited the poor.","Selected bibliography: p. 152-159|Also issued with cover date of June 1987","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1987 12:00:00 AM","","Development assistance|Social impact|Economic impact|Development projects|Development programs","Asia|Middle East|Egypt|India|Pakistan|Bangladesh|Indonesia|Jordan|Morocco|Nepal|Philippines|Sri Lanka|Thailand|Tunisia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNABB983.pdf","3,435 KB","004200 - USAID.

"Mississippi State University (MSU) entered into a contract with the International Cooperation Administration,  A.I.D.'s predecessor agency, in 1958 to provide TA on a worldwide basis in seed production, processing, storage, and distribution. Since then, there have been only 2 major changes:  (1) in 1984, Missions were required to fund activities in their countries through buy-ins; (2) in 1986, emphasis was put on research and research networking rather than TA, service, training, and technology transfer.  MSU has provided services under the centrally funded contract to 57 countries, as well as significant amounts of assistance financed by Missions or other donors. MSU's assistance has been clearly beneficial.  Training has been particularly impressive, but achievements in other areas are also substantial.  A functioning seed industry has been established in 4 countries, though the future viability of the seed industry in Niger is much less clear than in Honduras, Brazil, and Thailand. In each of the last 3 countries, an effective, profitable, and growing private seed industry has been established. Establishment of a viable industry was more readily achieved when there was also bilateral assistance in seed technology. Training has strongly influenced the initiation of seed programs in developing countries.  In countries such as Brazil and Thailand and at CIAT, training on a regional and country basis is now conducted by people trained by MSU. While research was not a major focus, the necessity for MSU to seek solutions to technological problems led to research which has made a substantial contribution to drying and storing seed in the humid tropics. MSU has been committed to fostering private enterprise involvement in the seed industry in the U.S. and overseas.  A characteristic of seed programs where MSU was involved is the development of a private seed industry when profile opportunities come into being. In comparison to services provided by similar institutions, MSU's cost of providing services has been low and greater amounts of total funding have been allocated to providing TA.  This TA has been of very high quality, as is recognized by private enterprise, other research organizations, LDC's, and the donor community. Lessons Learned and Policy Implications:  (1) Seed programs need to consider the roles of both private enterprise and public service.  (2) An ongoing agricultural research program dedicated to providing improved crop varieties is necessary for project success. (3) Continuity and integration into ongoing programs significantly improves the quality of services provided to A.I.D. by outside organizations and so does the use of permanent tenured staff. (4) Wide support by government is helpful to the establishment of a viable seed program. (5) International centers can be excellent locations for regional training. (6) Follow-on activities after project completion can be important to successful institutionalization of programs. (7) The buy-in system of financing has led to some delays and inefficiencies.

"Evaluates project to increase rice production in Guinea-Bissau. External evaluation covers the period 8/80-5/87. The principal development innovation tested was the use of tractors to construct contour dikes.  This technology can have immediate and obvious impact on increasing rice production in bas-fonds.  However, insufficient data are available to determine whether contour diking is sustainable or viable from economic and sociological perspectives. Other water management techniques, such as animal traction to create contour dikes, labor-intensive contour diking, construction of catchments, and use of low-lift pumps utilizing surface water for rice production, were not sufficiently tested.  Therefore, the implications of using these techniques cannot be determined.  No scientifically based agronomic packages were developed to extend to the farmers. There is serious doubt about the sustainability of the Credit Union with departure of the TA team from Aurora Associates, Inc. Moreover, the Extension Unit will have a difficult time surviving the departure of the team given the lack of financial support it receives from the Government of Guinea-Bissau (GOGB).  The Hydrology Unit, on the other hand, is well established, and if adequate financial support is forthcoming from the GOGB for operational costs, this unit can continue to function. The availability of agricultural inputs was a major feature attracting farmers to participate in the Rice Production Project. However, GOGB macroeconomic policies make implementation of an agricultural input provision program extremely difficult.  The Aurora Team was justified in moving the project's agricultural supply system away from credit and toward reliance on cash sales. Until the GOGB eliminates or drastically reduces the subsidies on agricultural inputs, it will be difficult to institutionalize a self-sustaining input supply system. The Aurora Team performed in a highly satisfactory fashion. However, its effectiveness was severely constrained by the difficult working environment, the lack of support from USAID/GB, the short time horizon in which it was directed to achieve heroic institutional objectives, and the lack of short-term technical resources to support the project. The GOGB is attempting to introduce wide-ranging modifications in economic policy in an effort to correct market distortions and encourage agricultural production.  Some increases in cereals production have already been obtained.  Increased supplies of agricultural commodities and consumer goods have begun to appear on the market.  It is hoped that the far-reaching changes now being negotiated will have an even greater effect in the long run.  There is reason for cautious optimism concerning the economic setting for project implementation.  It is critical that A.I.D. pursue policy dialogue to build a better development environment.  The GOGB wants USG development assistance and is prepared to take the steps necessary to obtain it. The evaluation recommends a bridge activity that would have the Aurora team continue for 12 months to consolidate the modest institutional gains to date, until a follow-on is initiated.

"Final external evaluation of the Rural Planning II Project (1981-86), the third stage of a 20-year effort by the Government of Kenya (GOK) to establish a decentralized administrative system for planning rural development policy at the district level. Substantial progress was made in refining and institutionalizing a new system for district planning and budgeting.  The Harvard Institute for International Development (HIID) fulfilled the terms of reference of its contract, and went beyond these to provide critical support for two major GOK policy initiatives: (1) The District Focus for Rural Development, which was announced in late 1982 and which has been the governmental umbrella for all rural development policy since 1983; and (2) Budget Rationalization, which the GOK began in 1984 to control government expenditures and raise administrative efficiency.  The intermingling of project objectives with those of District Focus and Budget Rationalization created a situation in which HIID was expected to expand and adjust the original scope of work.  HIID responded to these expectations, and so greatly increased the overall impact of the project. HIID succeeded in carrying out the scope of work in the original project agreement by:  (1) establishing a viable administrative system for decentralized planning and budgeting at the district level that will continue to operate after its departure, (2) improving project implementation at the district level, including projects specified in the 1979-83 and 1984-88 district plans, and (3) providing training to district level administrative personnel to support the decentralized system of planning and budgeting, as well as postgraduate training to young officers in the Rural Planning Department of the Ministry of National Planning and Development. In respect to the implementation of District Focus and Budget Rationalization, HIID developed important working relationships between the Rural Planning Division (RPD) and the Office of the President, and between the RPD and several central government ministries.  HIID also introduced microcomputer technology into the planning and budgeting process, and conducted important research and development work on problems of related interest including urban-rural planning, and the institution of administrative procedures for supporting private sector initiatives at rural development.  Finally, HIID successfully planned for the successor project - Resource Management for Rural Development - which began in 2/86.  Taken together, there can be little doubt that project accomplishments have improved the ""enabling environment"" provided by the Kenyan government to promote economic development at the local level.

"This paper evaluates the costs and benefits of a Farming Systems Research and Extension (FSR/E) project in the Les Cayes region of Haiti. Using a comprehensive survey of the rates of addoption of the FSR/E innovations, an ex-post analysis is made of the net benefits of the research and extension undertaken to date.  In a complementary approach, an ex-ante analysis is performed to determine the costs and benefits of a formal extension program of these innovations.  Combining the two analyses, it is shown that the relatively high costs involved in developing FSR/E innovations may be justified only if there is wide-scale adoption of such practices outside the FSR/E project's defined sites of intervention.

"This report is an evaluation of the P.L. 480 Title III small farmer credit program in Bolivia.  The program, known as the ""Trust Fund,"" utilizes private Bolivian banks and cooperatives to channel loan credits to small- and medium-scale farmers, and agroindustrial and artisanal enterprises.  The evaluation addresses three aspects of this Title III-funded project:  its institutional success, its fiduciary integrity, and its impact on credit recipients. Three groups receive credit under this program.  Agroindustrial and artisanal enterprises are probably not receiving optimally allocated credit, since (1) the artisanal sector is poorly defined and (2) no detailed evaluation of the Bolivian input and processing/distribution sectors exists from which to evaluate returns to investments. Medium-sized farms benefit directly from the availability of credit, but the evaluation was not able to document the magnitude of production response from the files. Very small farms benefit as well, but informal interviews indicate that these ""Trust Fund"" loans are substituted for other higher-cost loans, so little net increase in production is expected, while technical assistance is most likely necessary ""if small farmers are to make efficient use of increased credit for production costs.""

"PACR of a project (8/85-3/87) to improve the programs offered by the Jamaica Institute of Management (JIM) through various interventions, including special seminars, teaching aids, staff development, training needs assessment, and organizational development. Results were impressive.  Two components of the project were fully implemented and their effects continue.  (1) Special seminars trained 93 senior managers from the private sector and quasi-governmental agencies serving the private sector, as well as 236 middle managers from the private sector.  These seminars brought top-level managers into training, gave them a deeper appreciation of JIM, and demonstrated the benefits of in-country management training.  For the junior- and middle-level managers, the seminars introduced them to innovative operational principles and techniques.  (2) The grant for teaching aids enabled JIM to purchase 12 special programs and workbooks for supervisory management training, as well as films and workbooks for sales training. The other three project components have also been implemented but their completion requires further effort.  (1) The staff development component enabled eight full-time employees to receive U.S. training covering six areas of study and varying in duration from three days to two weeks; 15 part-time instructors also received training over two weekends.  (2) Training needs assessments were completed.  Then, after the needs were identified, six new courses were designed to meet them and are currently being marketed, with others in the process of development. (3) The project also supported efforts to install a new accounting system, establish and equip a computer classroom, and conduct an evaluation of JIM. The redefining of JIM's mission done prior to this evaluation has had a far-reaching impact, compelling JIM to synthesize and focus what had previously been set out in 21 discrete institutional objectives.  Finally, four of JIM's diploma courses and one certificate course have been accredited by the American Council on Education. JIM's training approach is more pragmatic than that of the formal systems in Jamaica.  A.I.D. should, therefore, try and target such institutions for future management training grants, since many, if not the majority, of those seeking training do not possess the requirements for entry to the formal system. Overall, JIM is providing a vital service for working professionals that is not provided by more traditional institutions.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","3/1/1987 12:00:00 AM","","Training centers|Management training|Private sector","Jamaica","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAZ686.pdf","74 KB","008563 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (9/85-9/87) to help the Kingston Restoration Company (KRC) generate inner city employment by rehabilitating a vacant factory complex in Kingston, Jamaica, into factory space for medium-scale light manufacturing and garment enterprises. While the cost of the project exceeded all estimates, overall it was a success.  (1) KRC completed the rehabilitation of the building, and the complex is 100% tenanted.  (2) The project created 134 new jobs (though the goal of 400 was not even approached).  (3) Building rehabilitation played an important role in improving the environment in the inner city.  (4) The project exposed KRC to the problems of downtown redevelopment and enabled it to develop more effective approaches in implementing the larger follow-on project, Inner Kingston Development (5320120). Several lessons have been learned and applied in the follow-on project.  (1) Because inner-city rehabilitation involves improving an existing structure, it is more difficult to complete on time and within the budget than is new construction. (2) To determine whether a building rehabilitation project is cost-effective and appropriate to pursue, it is essential to undertake a detailed feasibility study of both the costs of construction and a financial projection of the expected operating costs and expenses.  (3) Acquiring property or negotiating development arrangements with downtown property owners was much more time-consuming than expected.  (4) Tight review procedures and closer monitoring of construction work is needed to avoid costly overruns and construction delays.  (5) Real estate projects require a great deal of front-end investment in determining the feasibility of the projects and completing the legal, technical, and architectural work that is necessary.  (6) Regular and competent management by implementing agencies and A.I.D. is needed to insure the timely and efficient completion of real estate development projects.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1987 12:00:00 AM","","Urban renewal|Employment|Medium scale enterprises|Industrial facilities","Jamaica","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAZ687.pdf","121 KB","008563 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (9/78-9/88) to train extension agents and female village paraprofessionals to help women in Burkina Faso's Sahelian regions to develop labor-saving technologies, income-generating activities, health and hygiene programs, and local-language literacy. The project has had a two-cycle life.  During the first period (9/78-9/83), tremendous management difficulties resulted in the achievement of only 50% of program and financial goals.  These problems were mainly the result of an approach which centralized administrative responsibilities under the Ministry of Social Affairs (MSA), while implementation was carried out by a provincial agency.  One of the project's major outputs, the construction of a women's training center at Dori, was abandoned, due to a combination of MSA delays in extending the original invitation for bids, the lack of local business response to the invitation for bids, MSA delays in submitting building plans to USAID/B for approval, and the suspension of project funds by USAID/B during the last 9 project months.  Associated with poor management was the MSA's inability to establish and maintain project monitoring and evaluation systems on the national, regional, and village levels.  A credit fund set up to finance gender-specific income-generating activities was decapitalized after a short period of operation, due to management problems. Another major cause of failure was the involvement of local authorities, who misinterpreted the project as a rural credit effort rather than a training effort. Despite its general poor performance, the project was credited with: training in the areas of animation, nutrition, hygiene, maternal/child health care, home economics, and literacy, as well as management for paraprofessionals, extension agents, and project personnel; carrying out home economics and agro-pastoral activities; and provision of equipment. After a project suspension from 10/83 to 11/85, an agreement was reached with the Ministry of Family Welfare and National Solidarity (MOFWNS) to finish the construction and equipping of the Dori women's training center, and provide limited training. However, the MOFWNS did not carry out implementation responsibilities in a timely manner.  The center design was completed in 8/86 instead of 1/86, and even with a 3-month extension, only 90%-95% of the center was completed.  Although the center is functioning in this state and has assisted in training and in establishing village gardens and 4 grain mills, project impact was lessened by the suspension.  Development of a core of paraprofessionals was not fully achieved and programs such as local language literacy were picked up by larger national programs and dropped by the project.","Project title: training women in the Sahel","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1987 12:00:00 AM","","Training centers|Women in development|Financial management","Burkina Faso","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAZ773.pdf","109 KB","008520 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of a project to help Rwanda's National Population Office (ONAPO) and Ministry of Health (MINISAPASO) improve family planning (FP) information and services.  External evaluation covers the period FY81-8/87. Despite financial and socioeconomic constraints, the project made considerable progress and the overall environment for FP has grown more favorable since project inception.  Mass education was the most successful component, with 30% of Rwandan women exposed to FP information through radio or direct contact with ONAPO personnel. Research activities were also successful, resulting in a data base for use in forming population policy and increasing public awareness of the country's severe demographic crisis; the National Fertility Survey was a particularly important project output.  Components to improve service delivery were less successful.  MINISAPASO capability is greatly underdeveloped, largely because FP responsibility is assigned to a low organizational level within the Ministry.  Although a great deal of training in IEC and FP service delivery took place, only 140 medical assistants and nurses received some form of FP training, compared to the target of 250.  Moreover, the staffing of health centers lacks uniformity and supervision. The construction component was fraught with delays and cost overruns caused by inadequate planning, an overly costly model for rural health centers, and inadequate attention to the skills of host-country contractors.  Design problems will hamper effective utilization of both the training center and the health/nutrition centers.  Purchasing and management of commodities were inadequate with respect to financial controls and contraceptive stocking and storage.  Input delivery was also problematic, as flaws in financial tracking and planning were identified relatively late, and the position of ONAPO Financial Manager was vacant throughout most of the project.  Among other financial problems, construction's share of funds were increased at the expense of more central budget items, notably, TA and local costs of activities. An array of socioeconomic issues continue to hinder contraceptive acceptance and need to be addressed in any future project.  These include, inter alia, demand for child labor (e.g., for carrying water, and agricultural activities), misconceptions about the effects of contraception, weakness of the professional midwifery tradition, resistance among health professionals to community-based contraceptive distribution, strength of the Catholic Church and its importance in the health sector, low levels of literacy and schooling, logistical constraints on access to service delivery sites, and biases against providing FP services to unmarried and childless women. Overall recommendations are to sustain the momentum the government's population policy reform, continue mass education, and extend the role of the private sector (especially Protestant PVO's) in service delivery.","Attached to PD-ABA-066","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","8/1/1987 12:00:00 AM","","Family planning services|Family planning education|IEC|Socioeconomic aspects","Rwanda","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/XDABA066A.pdf","3,364 KB","008598 - USAID.

"Evaluates a project (1978-86) to provide U.S. Master's Degrees to faculty of Latin American universities.  Evaluation is based on interviews with alumni/ae, their supervisors, and their colleagues. The program selected 164 faculty members (teachers, administrators, and researchers) from 23 post-secondary institutions in 12 countries: Belize, Bolivia, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Jamaica, Nicaragua, Panama, and Peru. Participants' studies were in the areas of agriculture, engineering, education, and less frequently, health and the social sciences. The population served by the project was ""high-risk"" in that most came from provincial universities, were not members of an academic elite, and had no command of English before coming to the United States. Nonetheless, most (90%) performed well.  On the other hand, only 50% felt that their U.S. experiences were wholly appropriate to their home institutions. The project had a significant impact on returned participants' regional outreach activities, and on their positive self-image and the level of innovations they initiated within their departments. Participants learned to act on their own to bring about change and utilize regional resources.  After returning from the United States, their involvement in research and administration increased, while their teaching decreased. The overall impact of U.S training was greater at institutions that lacked other sources of graduate training opportunities abroad, institutions where a ""critical mass"" of professors had been trained, those with a positive disposition toward change, and where supplemental financial resources were available from international or national agencies. Other findings are as follows.  (1) Training of faculty from rural universities is probably more costly, but the pay back may be greater. (2) Candidates should have clear plans and goals for their U.S. academic work, but the project is responsible for providing them with realistic expectations.  (3) Placement of participants was most successful at those U.S. schools with genuine interest in Latin American studies.  (4) A TOEFL score of 520-550 at time of admission is generally adequate. Good English language training programs are usually available in participants' home countries, and their use reduces expenses and periods of family separation.  (5) Allowances for books and materials should be increased.  (6) Funds for family maintenance were not available, and some participants withdrew early rather than remain apart from their spouses and children.  (7) More follow-up activities, and networking activities of all sorts are recommended.","Cover date: December 1987","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID/LAC-C-1346","","3/1/1987 12:00:00 AM","","Participants|Faculty|Universities and colleges|Teacher education|Masters degrees|Participant preparation|Participant follow ups|English language|Language training","Latin America","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABB081.pdf","610 KB","","","001373 - USAID.

"The credit component of the Freedom From Hunger Foundation's (FFH) applied nutrition program in Sierra Leone aims to increase food production by providing loans of rice and groundnut seeds. Loans were given to 53 rice farmers in 1984, 66 rice farmers and 33 groundnut farmers in 1985, to 84 and 54 farmers respectively in 1986, and to 116 and 57 respectively in 1987. All loans are in-kind; other inputs (fertilizer, transportation, and TA) are provided free of charge.  Individuals and families who participate are identified at growth monitoring sessions (periodic weighing of children aged 0-5 is an integral part of the program), and selected by Village Development Committee's (VDC's).  The average loan in 1987 was equivalent to about US$34; payback has averaged 95%-98%. Currently, 91% of those receiving loans for rice are men (an improvement from the first year when only one rice loan was given to a woman).  All recipients of groundnut loans are women.  Traditionally, groundnuts are grown by women, and rice farming on a large scale is done by men.  As is shown in some detail in this report, women undertake a variety of income-generating activities on their own. The goal of increasing annual farm income by US$80 per year has been met, but due to exchange rate variations this achievement is more illusory than real.  It is more important that improved seed varieties and improved agricultural techniques have been introduced to smaller villages, and that rice and groundnut production in the villages have increased. There is little doubt that extra production in these communities can be absorbed -- 72% of farmers purchase rice at least 5 months a year due to inadequate storage facilities and a pattern of selling rice for cash (and using large amounts of grain for secret society feasting).  The demand for rice outside the village is also considerable; Sierra Leone produces only 60% of the rice it consumes each year and imports the remaining 40%. This report includes a plan for an economically self-sufficient credit program, which would be administered by VDC's (whose participation till now has been limited to suggesting candidates for participation).  Appended are excerpts from interviews with VDC's as well as information on other loan funds in the area.

"PACR of a project (8/82-3/87) to strengthen Radio Santa Maria (RSM), a non-formal educational radio service in the Dominican Republic, by supplying equipment, evaluation services, and training. Despite having to be extended three times due to persistent bottlenecks in the procurement process, the project made several notable achievements.  Project-purchased equipment enabled RSM to expand broadcasting and increase its listening audience by approximately 30%, now reaching more than 40,000 adult students each year.  The evaluation process contributed to increased operational efficiency, while the training component improved RSM's capacity for innovation in instructional techniques. Studies have shown that the RSM system is cost-effective. The content of RSM courses is adapted to the psychology and life context of rural, lower income adults and is designed to equip and motivate students to contribute to social and economic development. Overall, the radio school students score significantly higher than formal school students on official government achievement tests.  In addition to the graded educational service, RSM provides a series of programs in agriculture, nutrition and health, home-making, child care, and community development. The major lesson learned is that procurement delays should be minimized by allowing longer lead-time, ensuring more aggressive monitoring of the procurement process, and identifying a continuing source of supplies and parts for commodities procured under a grant.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","10/1/1987 12:00:00 AM","","Educational radio|Adult education|Nonformal education","Dominican Republic","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABB931.pdf","239 KB","008537 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (9/81-9/86) to enhance energy efficiency in Jamaica by strengthening the Energy Division of the Ministry of Mining, Energy, and Tourism (MMET); implementing conservation and alternative energy resource programs in the public sector; and providing energy credit to the private sector. With the two exceptions noted below, project objectives were achieved.  Highlights of the MMET Energy Division institution- building component included:  (1) long-term training (including 6 M.S.'s) of 35 persons and short-term training of 225; (2) several publications, including manuals on energy auditing and solar heating, assessments of wind and other renewable energy resources, a review of fleet fuel conservation, and preliminary design of solar heating systems for Jamaica; and (3) establishment of an Energy Information Center and expansion of a public education campaign.  On the negative side, plans to upgrade positions in MMET's Energy Division in order to recruit and retain a competent professional staff went awry, as more than 20 professionals resigned during the project, and the total number of professionals on the staff dropped from 23 to 9.  This was the result of MMET's failure to obtain formal authorization; this problem is not unique among Jamaica's public agencies, however. The alternative energy component assisted in the creation of 7 private solar hot water companies and 32 solar hot water installations; establishment (not yet completed) of a solar standards and testing facility at the Bureau of Standards; improvement of the meteorological data base; and establishment of an Energy R&D Center at the College of Arts Science and Technology, of an alternative energy demonstration center at Knockalva, and of two pilot projects (fuelwood and sugarcane). The energy conservation program significantly proved the technological energy infrastructure in Jamaica by supporting private energy auditors and retrofitting contractors, organizing an Energy Coordinator's Association, publishing an energy conservation manual for the construction industry, completing 66 energy audits, retrofitting 53 enterprises, and conducting 8 post-audits which verified energy savings within 95% of the audit estimates. The project also established an Energy Credit Fund to finance private sector retrofits and alternative energy investments. Disbursements from the Fund were low, however, due to high market interest rates, a time-consuming application process, and a weak overall national economy.","Loan no. 532-W-016","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","4/1/1987 12:00:00 AM","","Energy conservation|Alternative energy resources|Institution building|Energy research|Technical training","Jamaica","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABC180.pdf","829 KB","008563 - USAID.

"This evaluation of the A.I.D. Cash Transfer program in Costa Rica concludes that the program has had positive effects on public policy formation and actual economic development, leading to successful short-term stabilization and intermediate-term structural adjustment. Dollar transfers under the program have been linked to policy reforms designed in consultation with the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.  These reforms have included privatization, exchange rate unification, tariff rationalization, export promotion, fiscal deficit reduction, and financial sector restructuring.  Successes have included complete exchange rate reform, limited privatization, substantial nontraditional export promotion, substantial fiscal deficit control, and substantial liberalization of the private financial sector.  Success is not yet evident in the area of tariff reform, however, and the progress of privatization is slower than originally scheduled. Local currency projects under the program have had more immediate impacts, since they involve direct expenditures. project funded under the Costa Rica Cash Transfer program established a private sector investment promotion agency (CINDE) which has had significant success in promoting foreign investment and exports.  Later projects supported the divestiture of the state holding company (CODESA), the development of the private financial sector, and several infrastructural activities. Though the evaluation team concluded that most of these projects yielded positive results, performance in terms of project selection could be improved by reducing the number of projects funded and by subjecting local currency projects to scrutiny similar to that given to development assistance projects. The project team found no overt evidence of dependency created by the A.I.D. Cash Transfer program in Costa Rica. the existence of a single external foreign currency source reaching 5% of GDP does at least create the possibility of a growing economic dependency on that source.  One of the prime recommendations of this report is that future ESF Cash Transfer programs be designed with a specific timetable for phaseout and a prior analysis of potential dependency creation. In summary, the evaluation team concludes that the objectives of the Costa Rica ESF Cash Transfer Program have been met, but that certain administrative reforms are advisable.

"PACR of a project (1980-1984) to provide skills training and employment counseling to low-income, urban women in the Dominican Republic. The project far exceeded targets.  The implementing agency, Accion Pro-Educacion y Cultura (APEC), recruited and screened 5,200 women and provided skills training to 1,328 -- more than twice the target number. Of the trainees, 1,127 received training in human resources and 132 in microbusiness management, while 341 received individual counseling in legal matters and psychological problems.  The project adapted well to specific needs of the participants and realities of the job market.  By the end of the project, about 46% of the registered women were working, as compared to 2% when the project started.  Although income benefits are hard to measure, some 56% of women interviewed reported having a monthly income above the minimum wage, as compared to 5% before the project. APEC continues to provide training through the center established under the project, and a rotating fund has been established to finance microenterprises initiated through the project. The project demonstrated that women in low-income, marginal neighborhoods can increase their income with a little additional training, proper guidance, and individual willingness.  However, one of the major difficulties was the lack of credit for the target group.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","5/1/1987 12:00:00 AM","","Women in development|Management training|Low income|Disadvantaged groups|Urban areas|Employment","Dominican Republic","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABC668.pdf","55 KB","008537 - USAID.

"PACR of a pilot project (1976-1987) to strengthen on-farm water management (OFWM) in Pakistan by funding watercourse improvement and providing TA, training, and other services to local government agencies and farmers. Despite a slow start, a financial shortfall, and several implementation problems, the pilot project was an innovative and successful program which has been copied by several organizations around the globe.  The most significant accomplishment was in the area of institutional development.  The creation of Pakistan's provincial OFWM organizations was a direct result of this project.  The project also established a federal-level water management cell and four provincial training institutions (which by 6/81 had trained 6,351 irrigation and other government personnel, farmers, bankers, contractors, and tractor operators). In addition, 1,319 watercourses were improved by this date, and five volumes of technical manuals were developed (and are still in use). On the other hand, extension services were neglected (due to emphasis on watercourse improvement by the provincial OFWM directorates) and precision land level activities failed to generate the level of farmer interest that had been expected. The institution strengthening element of the project registered remarkable growth following the 1982 project amendment, when the project emphasis shifted away from construction (which had become the focus of the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank).  The project TA team accomplished the following:  (1) establishment of a functional management information system in each provincial directorate and training center and at the federal cell; (2) surveying and training field personnel in the operation of six widely separated micro-irrigation systems in Baluchistan; (3) establishment of a training farm in each province to demonstrate OFWM practices and provide on-the-job training for field staff, extension workers, and farmers; and (4) establishment of a media center and materials production center at the federal cell. Special water management studies were conducted on the following subjects:  (1) canal roads feasibility, (2) sociological study of earth borrowing for canal rehabilitation, (3) status of precision land leveling, (4) surface drainage of irrigated land, and (5) water user associations.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","7/1/1987 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural water management|On farm water management|Irrigation|Water flow control|Institution building","Pakistan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABD163.pdf","194 KB","008588 - USAID.

"This report presents the economic and social impact of credit assistance on a sample of micro and small businesses in the Dominican Republic.  Specifically, it examines changes experienced by beneficiaries of loans provided by the Association for the Development of Microenterprises (ADEMI) and the Fund for Industrial Economic Development (FIDE).  Since 1983, ADEMI and FIDE have been the principal programs through which USAID/DR has executed its strategy in the small-scale enterprise sector. The experience of ADEMI and FIDE beneficiaries has demonstrated that loans for working and fixed asset capital and related assistance have a dramatic economic effect on micro and small businesses. The loans have generated substantial employment at low cost, and have contributed substantially to the small entrepreneur's and his/her family's economic and social welfare. A few examples are illustrative.  The case of Jose Heromi Suero shows how loans to micro enterprises can have a dramatic impact on the business and the beneficiaries.  Mr. Suero sold vegetables, meats, and fruit from a tricycle in Santo Domingo. Three loans from ADEMI, ranging from 300 to 12,000 pesos (US$95 to US$3,800) led to a doubling of his monthly sales.  The loans enabled him to purchase a food stand and hire a full-time employee.  Moreover, his income increased to a level enabling him to make major purchases for his home and to cover several large emergency expenses. Loans to small businesses have also shown dramatic results.  Nine years ago in Moca, a small town in northern Dominican Republic, Agustina Mercedes Taverez set up a small garment workshop in her backyard with only one sewing machine and two employees. In 1985, at the time of her loan from the FIDE program, she had 20 workers and assets of nearly 79,000 pesos.  In the two years since her loans, her work force has increased by 25 percent and her monthly sales have more than doubled to 20,475 pesos (nearly US$6,500).  As a result of the Caribbean Basin Initiative Program, she buys material from New York for her line of children's clothing and sells exclusively to a distributorship in Puerto Rico.  Mercedes Taverez has been able to build her own house and buy a new car.  Soon, she plans on taking out a line of credit with a commercial bank. These two clients exemplify some of the characteristics and types of impact which are representative of two broad categories of small-scale enterprise:  microenterprise and small business. USAID assisted the microenterprise segment through the ADEMI program and the small business segment through the FIDE program. Each program is designed quite differently to meet the specific needs of these two separate target groups.  Throughout this report the results of the survey are presented in a comparative form showing ADEMI client versus FIDE client performance and impact.  It is important to emphasize that the ADEMI-FIDE client data compare not only the results of these two service programs, but also the size categories of micro and small businesses assisted by ADEMI and FIDE respectively.  Brief case studies of the 100 program beneficiaries interviewed for the present report are included among the appendices.

"This first external evaluation of the Cyprus-America Scholarship Program (CASP) focuses primarily on the performance of AMIDEAST (the A.I.D. contractor responsible for implementing CASP) and the Cyprus Fulbright Commission (CFC) which oversees the program in Cyprus. The evaluation study involved:  (1) a mail survey of some 90 CASP participants studying at U.S. universities; (2) onsite interviews with a sample of U.S. CASP participants on campus; (3) interviews with A.I.D. and AMIDEAST staff; (4) review of documents and records; and (5) a field visit to Cyprus to interview program staff, U.S. embassy officials, Greek and Turkish Cypriot authorities, and a sample of returned CASP participants.  Over 100 interviews were conducted in Cyprus during the field visit. The study results indicate that CASP is functioning at high levels of performance in Cyprus, regarding recruitment, selection, and counselling, as well as in the United States, where AMIDEAST places scholarship students and monitors their activities in addition to performing other administrative support activities.  CASP participants are being selected in accordance with Cypriot planning priorities although scholarship students generally have wide latitude in choosing fields of study. The CASP is very highly regarded by both Greek and Turkish Cypriot authorities and students.  It is also clear that U.S. colleges and universities were considered by many Cypriot authorities and educators as having higher standards than many European and Eastern Bloc educational institutions. Thus, while Cyprus as a whole has a high number of college trained persons, it is CASP graduates who, according to officials of the planning bureau and the mayor's office, are usually the first to be absorbed into the economy and are highly considered for government jobs when opportunities are open. The CASP also appears to provide a positive and constructive forum for bi-communal relations, albeit in a limited manner, between the Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities.  One recent CASP project which brought members of the two communities together to work on a master plan for restoration of Nicosia was viewed as a model project by all concerned parties, and similar projects should be encouraged in the future.  Also, short-term training opportunities should be increased, as it was evident that such projects had significant development impact on both Greek and Turkish communities. While the program is functioning well in all aspects, several administrative issues need to be addressed.  These issues and possible resolutions were brought to the attention of AMIDEAST, the CFC, and the U.S. Embassy in Cyprus, and there appears to be agreement on steps needed to improve the situation and establish clear lines of administrative authority for CASP. In summary, CASP is by all accounts an important program to Cyprus and to both Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities.  The result is not only progress toward achievement of Congressional goals for this program and A.I.D. objectives, but a strong contribution towards a positive U.S. image in the views of Cypriot students, educators, and government officials.
