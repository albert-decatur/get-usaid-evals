"The USAID/Nicaragua Health Program (2008-2013) worked to achieve a more educated and healthy population with a greater ability to contribute to and share the benefits of a growing economy and strengthen the health sector of Nicaragua (e.g. public and private sectors, NGOs, universities and communities) by providing technical and financial assistance.&nbsp; The purpose of this evaluation was to: (1) determine the extent to which the objectives of the program were met and their contribution to the gender approach; (2) to evaluate the implementation of the mid-term (2007) evaluation recommendations; and (3) to identify the key factors that contributed to or prevented achieving the proposed results.&nbsp; In general, during the period studied, Nicaragua has made significant progress in family planning and maternal and child health.&nbsp; The Government of Nicaragua-led implementation of health policies, plans and strategies, coupled with the harmonization and coordination of international health cooperation (including USAID cooperation), has contributed to progress in the main demographic and maternal and child health indicators: (1) total fertility rate (TFR); (2) maternal mortality rate (MMR); (3) mortality rate (MR) in children under 5 years of age; (4) infant mortality rate (IMR); (5) neonatal mortality rate (NMR); and (6) chronic malnutrition (CM) in children under 5 years of age.&nbsp; In the case of HIV/AIDS, as expected, increasing the coverage of counseling and voluntary testing in key populations has increased the disease's prevalence and incidence, but has reduced its lethality and mortality.&nbsp; As this report shows, implementing the Family and Community Health Model (MOSAFC) has been fundamental to the country's health achievements, especially the role of the Family, Community and Life Committee (GFCV), which is the cornerstone of Ministry of Heath (MINSA) health promotion and prevention work.&nbsp; (Excerpt, modified)","'Period December 2008-January 2013'|Footer title: USAID/Nicaragua: health program performance for the 2008-2013 period|Project title: Global health tech bridge III (GH tech bridge 3)","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","AID-OAA-C-13-00032","","6/1/2014 12:00:00 AM","","","Nicaragua","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00JXGB.pdf","10,155 KB","011492 - Development & Training Services, Inc.

"PACT's Community&nbsp; REACH 2 in Swaziland was designed to facilitate the efficient flow of grant funds and to deliver targeted technical assistance and capacity building services to organizations contributing to the HIV/AIDS response.&nbsp; The overall goal of REACH is to reduce the impact of HIV/AIDS and improve health care for the people of Swaziland by developing a strengthened, coordinated civil society response to HIV/AIDS.&nbsp; The 8 evaluation questions to be addressed were: (1) to what extent has PACT made progress towards effectively building the organizational capacity of its sub-partners [and] what have been the factors behind observed progress or lack of progress towards organizational capacity building; (2) to what extent has PACT made progress towards effectively building the technical capacity of its sub-partners [and] is PACT's technical backstopping capacity adequate for the different technical areas in which sub-partners engage; (3) to what extent has sub-partner service delivery improved to date under PACT's support in terms of quality and targeting [and] how has PACT supported sub-partners to balance beneficiary coverage/targets with quality and dosage of services; (4) how does different coverage of sub-partners (national versus defined geographical areas) impact on the quality and dosage of services [and] how has PACT support helped sub-partners to engage and align with national strategies and systems, and to refer to government services; (5) what approaches for delivering sustainable community services for orphans and vulnerable children (OVC) are working well; (6) to what extent has PACT strengthened efforts to improve the OVC response beyond sub-partner service delivery through activities related to developing of standards and other national processes; (7) what progress has CANGO made towards developing its institutional capacity to become an Umbrella Grant Mechanism [and] how relevant is PACT's Institutional Capacity Building Plan (ISP), and what progress has [the] Coordinating Assembly of Non-governmental Organizations (CANGO) made on its ISP; (8) what are the strengths and weaknesses of PACT's approach to engage with civil society organizations that were recipients (or slated to be recipients) of Global Fund resources [and] how did PACT engage with National Emergency Response Council on HIV and AIDS (NERCHA) in order to strengthen civil society?&nbsp; The evaluators' overall conclusion was that each sampled organization underscored the importance of PACT's organizational capacity building to their present stability and all were interested in continuing support from PACT in their organizational development.&nbsp; Most would also like additional HIV/AIDS technical capacity building in the future, at least some refresher training.&nbsp; As the HIV epidemic continues to have a heavy impact in Swaziland, further strengthening of the overall response to the epidemic by civil society organizations is needed.&nbsp; (Excerpt, modified)","Header title: Midterm evaluation : Swaziland REACH project : final evaluation report|Evaluated project title: Rapid and effective action combating HIV & AIDS (REACH)","Special Evaluation","Documents","AID-674-TO-14-00001|AID-674-I-12-00002","","4/1/2014 12:00:00 AM","","HIV/AIDS|Disease prevention and control|Civil society|Local level|Disaster response|Epidemics|Contraceptive distribution|Access to services|Orphans and vulnerable children (OVC)|Community mobilization","Swaziland","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00JXNH.pdf","2,155 KB","010506 - Khulisa Management Services (Pty) Ltd.","","008605 - USAID.

"While traditional dispute resolution (TDR) mechanisms have been remarkably resilient over the past 30 years in Afghanistan, decades of conflict have weakened TDR capabilities in many areas by disrupting the informal justice institutions through which elders and other locally legitimate actors adjudicate disputes.&nbsp; Lack of access to justice, whether it comes from formal or informal providers, is a source of instability that USAID Afghanistan is addressing through programs such as Rule of Law Stabilization - Informal Component (RLS-I).&nbsp; The RLS-I program was designed to achieve the following three objectives: (1) strengthen TDR mechanisms; (2) strengthen linkages between informal and formal justice sectors; and (3) develop approaches that successfully resolve long-term intractable disputes.&nbsp; This evaluation measured the achievements and challenges of RLS-I in six provinces of Afghanistan: Baghlan, Faryab, Kandahar, Nangarhar, Uruzgan and Wardak.&nbsp; A set of mixed quantitative and qualitative methods were used for data collection.&nbsp; The evaluation found strong performance on some RLS-I program objectives and weaker performance on others.&nbsp; Direct beneficiaries that participated in training activities for TDR actors -- a central facet of the RLS-I program -- noted general satisfaction with the training experience and reported gaining valuable knowledge of legal principles and procedural justice.&nbsp; These TDR actors also seemed to put their training to good use, a significant majority of the indirect beneficiary population reported that the quality of traditional justice had improved compared to before the RLSI program.&nbsp; Further, direct and the indirect beneficiary population alike reported a reduction in the incidence of cultural practices that are harmful to women such as baad (the exchange of daughters to settle disputes or debts).&nbsp; Confidence in the ability of TDR actors to resolve disputes generally increased, though this strengthening of TDR mechanisms was not accompanied by a perceived strengthening of the formal justice system or a greater rate of referrals of cases from traditional to formal justice providers.&nbsp; (Excerpt, modified)","Evaluated project title: Rule of law stabilization-informal component (RLS-I)","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","AID-306-O-14-00051","","5/1/2014 12:00:00 AM","","","Afghanistan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00JXPM.pdf","2,640 KB","040788 - Sayara Research","","008504 - USAID.

"The USAID supported Expanding Maternal and Newborn Survival (EMAS) program aimed at contributing to the reduction of maternal and newborn (MN) deaths in Indonesia.&nbsp; Maternal mortality in Indonesia remains substantially higher than expected in comparison with other south Asian countries having similar economies and states of development.&nbsp; Also, despite progress in reducing mortality among older infants and children, during the past decade Indonesia has not substantially reduced mortality among newborns (the first month of life).&nbsp; As a result, the country is losing momentum in its in child survival.&nbsp; The purposes of the mid-term evaluation were to: (1) assess EMAS progress in achieving the goal, objectives and planned outputs as stated in the agreement's project description and in approved workplans; (2) provide recommendations to improve EMAS program effectiveness over the remaining 2-plus year life of project; and (3) provide recommendations for USAID to consider in the design of future projects aimed at improving maternal and neonatal health in Indonesia.&nbsp; The evaluation team concludes that the approaches developed and implemented by EMAS have important potential to improve the performance of Indonesia's health services in managing the complications that are the major causes of maternal and newborn morbidity and mortality.&nbsp; To realize this potential at scale, however, EMAS needs to address critical challenges.&nbsp; One is to identify the connection between the process changes that EMAS has succeeded in generating with improvement in patient outcomes.&nbsp; Equally important is strengthening communication and connection with the government of Indonesia (GOI) -- especially the Ministry of Health -- at the central level.&nbsp; EMAS also needs to work with USAID, the GOI, and other stakeholders to develop a strategy for implementation at scale that goes beyond its direct engagement, to link its results with national-scale initiatives and programs.

"The Tunisia Transition Initiative (TTI) program was designed to support Tunisians in their pursuit of a democratic society by creating viable space for the transition to succeed. &nbsp;The transition was a result of revolution in response to long-simmering grievances, including inequality among regions, the marginalization of social groups (i.e. unemployed, youth, rural women), and the highly centralized state (directly in response to the events of the Arab Spring). &nbsp;Despite disappointment in the pace of reform, many citizens still see the transition as a real opportunity to promote social modernization and democracy, strengthen civil society, give greater voice to youth and women, and rebuild regional and local governance. &nbsp;In an effort to support the transition, activities focused on civic engagement, women and youth political participation, civil society organization capacity, and countering violent extremism, among others. &nbsp;The evaluation focused in general on assessing two primary aspects of the TTI program: (1) strategic approach to programming, examining in particular the adaptability to changes in the political landscape, relevance to critical issues or events of the transition, and overall strategic targeting; and (2) the effectiveness and impact (intended and unintended) of the TTI program, primarily through the lens of TTI's four priority sub-objectives. &nbsp;Recent studies, news reports, and interviews with country experts, staff and grantees point to a rise in extremist violence throughout Tunisia, including in areas where TTI programming is being implemented. &nbsp;There is a growing concern among civil society organizations regarding what they perceive as increasing levels of anti-establishment beliefs and attitudes among youth. &nbsp;These beliefs include an alienation from the political and economic system that took over ""their revolution"" and that has not addressed corruption or unemployment. &nbsp;This dynamic speaks to cognitive radicalization processes referenced by the Countering Violent Extremism (CVE) Desk Study and Framework for the Office of Transition Initiatives/Tunisia &nbsp;(OTI/Tunisia) and further validates CVE programming. &nbsp;As such, the evaluation team found that the program is responding to an evolving context of a growing social dynamic that poses a serious threat to the political transition. &nbsp;Specific evaluation analyses on program findings, conclusions and recommendations are provided in detail. &nbsp;(Excerpt, modified).","Cover title: Tunisia transition initiative final evaluation|Evaluated project title: Tunisia transition initiative (TTI)|Project title: Program development quickly III (PDQ III)","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","AID-OAA-I-13-00007","","6/1/2014 12:00:00 AM","","","Tunisia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00JZD7.pdf","2,068 KB","011976 - QED Group, LLC|003950 - Training Resources Group","","010972 - USAID.

The evaluator, through field visits, noted that the program has addressed the most significant hazards: (1) drought and excessive rain (impact to food insecurity); (2) landslides; (3) floods; (4) prairie fires; and (5) lack of clean water. &nbsp;Many activities have taken place like agroforestry, social forestry, soil and water conservation, appropriate agricultural technology, watershed management and low fuel technology. &nbsp;However, there were limited activities that have been conducted to tackle the hazards like: (1) plant pests, (2) typhoon/hurricane, (3) livestock disease; and (4) earthquake.</p>","Includes annexes","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","AID-497-A-10-00005","","7/1/2014 12:00:00 AM","","","Indonesia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00JZFC.pdf","1,956 KB","005151 - World Neighbors, Inc.","","008558 - USAID.

"This document reports findings from the final evaluation of Kore Lavni Nou-2, a food voucher emergency relief project implemented by CARE in three communes of the Upper Artibonite and North-West Departments of Haiti.&nbsp; This intervention aimed at providing food to the vulnerable households affected by the extensive drought and recurring food insecurity to offset harmful coping strategies of the beneficiaries and support them in recovering assets.&nbsp; CARE and its partner pursued the following objectives: (1) providing food vouchers as a short-term safety net for 8,000 food insecure and extremely poor families to fill gaps exacerbated by the disasters and to reinforce local markets in Gonaives, Mole Saint Nicholas, and Terre Neuve; and, (2) piloting healthy diet promotion with fresh fruit and vegetable paper vouchers approach in Terre Neuve commune to reach 1,000 food insecure and extremely poor families.&nbsp; The evaluation team looked first at to what extent the activities and outputs of the program were consistent with the overall goal, the specific objectives, the intended effects, and how these specific objectives and expected effects met the identified needs in the targeted areas.&nbsp; Second, we sought to understand the extent to which the objectives were achieved or not.&nbsp; In the case the expected results were attained, we also analyzed the strategies that have been used to minimize the gap between planned and realized activities.&nbsp; The objectives of this evaluation were to: (1) assess the outcomes of the project, intended and unintended, positive or negative, on the direct beneficiaries and the population living in the 3 target communes of the project versus non-beneficiaries; (2) determine the adequacy of the program design to meet the identified needs in the target area; (3) compare the final conditions with the baseline findings and present persisting gaps in coping strategies used by the households to mitigate their vulnerability; (4) relate lessons learned to appropriate stakeholders; (5) identify key obstacles preventing the correct execution of the program; (6) identify key successes and recommendations for future consideration; and (7) evaluate the partnership approach in the commune of Terre-Neuve and added value of the combined methodology for the food vouchers.&nbsp; This project was a short term emergency intervention. &nbsp;Interviewed beneficiaries and community leaders indicated resurgence of the previous hunger situation.&nbsp; Petty traders in Terre-Neuve reported a decline in their number of clients, after end of Kore Lavni Nou-2, despite beneficiaries claimed a higher share of consumption of vegetable.&nbsp; Local authorities' wondered why CARE did not invest or reinforce agriculture and irrigation systems for a sustainable intervention.&nbsp; Specific evaluation findings, conclusions and recommendations are provided with detailed analysis for each project objective.&nbsp; (Excerpt, modified)","'CARE Haiti'","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","AID-FFP-G-13-00028","","6/1/2014 12:00:00 AM","","","Haiti","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00JZG3.pdf","744 KB","040505 - Diagnostic & Development Group (DDG)|010850 - CARE USA","","010990 - USAID.

"Yes Youth Can! (YYC) is a program to promote youth empowerment in Kenya.&nbsp; The goal of YYC is to address the underlying social, economic, and political factors that drive youth marginalization in Kenya.&nbsp; In so doing, YYC seeks to affect a range of outcomes related to these factors, as well as to prevent a recurrence of the violence that followed the 2007 elections in Kenya, in which youth played a significant role.&nbsp; YYC's approach is to work with young people in communities to organize themselves into groups called ""bunges.""&nbsp; In accordance with the learning and accountability objectives described in USAID's Evaluation Policy, YYC includes an independent impact evaluation to assess the impact of the program on the outcomes it seeks to influence.&nbsp; The key findings of the evaluation are as follows:&nbsp; (1) bunges tended to remain active and engaged throughout the evaluation period; (2) YYC improved relations between youth and their communities; (3) YYC was successful in terms of increasing participants' self confidence and self-esteem; &nbsp;(4) YYC led to some improvements in political engagement, but youths continue to feel alienated by political elites and the political system; (5) the impact of YYC on economic outcomes was limited; (6) important sources of benefits from YYC were the skills and lessons derived from the process of participating in the bunge; (7) youth groups such as bunges could benefit from ""mentoring"" relationships with respected members of the community; (8) youths perceived the trainings they received as part of YYC to be a particularly valuable aspect of the program, and (9) post-election violence was minimal throughout Kenya following the 2013 presidential elections, which was a major goal of YYC.&nbsp; (Excerpt, modified)","Annex volume has been appended|Evaluated project title: Yes youth can!
