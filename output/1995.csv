"Evaluates project to improve basic educational systems in developing countries, with an emphasis on gender issues and productivity (ABEL project).  Interim evaluation covers the period 1989-94.  Of $13.9 million expended so far, $8.8 million (60%) has come from buy-ins, with 95% of buy-ins coming from Africa and 76% from Mali and South Africa. To date, the project has:  (1) researched and written educational sector assessments in Malawi, Paraguay, Ghana, Uganda, and Ethiopia; (2) published and disseminated 12 issues of FORUM, 41 issues of the ABEL Information Bulletin, two major research studies (on the economic and social impact of girls education and strategies for increasing their access and achievement in school), a case study from Bangladesh's experience with primary education, and a handbook guiding policy makers in improving educational testing; (3) designed a family of educational policy modules and disseminated them in South Africa, Malawi, Botswana, Namibia, Bolivia, Chile, Guatemala, and Paraguay; (4) maintained a database on women's education (SARA) at Creative Associates International and another on developmental education (SHARE) at Harvard Institute for International Development; (5) conducted workshops and conferences for professional educators in policy dialogue and modeling using the new group of education modules; (6) responded quickly and appropriately to USAID Mission requests for TA in 13 countries and established field offices in South Africa and Mali; and (7) initiated South African policy dialogues on educational options using computerized simulation tools developed by Research Triangle Institute. Overall, the project has been successful in responding to USAID Mission and USAID/W requests and its support to other USAID projects, grantees (NGOs), ministries of education, and educational institutions has been well received.  The Women in Development (WID) buy-in was matched with other core or Mission buy-ins and was probably the best investment.  Dissemination of useful lessons learned and research on gender issues added value to advancing basic education worldwide, though more effort is needed to assure that publications, tools, and research results get into the hands of Mission Human Resource Development Officers and target audiences.  Training programs in South Africa and Mali have had an impact on strengthening educational institutions and schools.  The managerial support from both USAID and the prime contractor allowed the subcontractors and their consultants to perform their roles in a professional manner.  Financial management improved over time, but never was able to clearly account for Mission and WID buy-ins related to specific activities of both the prime and subcontractors.  Also, USAID's financial management system for buy-ins is not sufficient to allow for the field missions to monitor their expenditures. Ceilings on buy-ins prevent Missions from using them in creative ways to augment their needs. Lessons learned were as follows.  (1) The synergy that develops among different groups of stakeholders through use of common tasks will enhance institutional change.  (2) Micro-level planning is a key element in having an impact on schoolchildren at the local level.  (3) Policy dialogue is key in maximizing the cooperation among government agencies. Other donors' efforts, working within a democratic environment, must be included so that the audience is broadened to effect change.  (4) When cultural sensitivities are taken into account, WID activities that are integrated into the educational system will become more sustainable. (5) Since ABEL depends on Mission buy-ins for funding, the logframe for the project should cover only core activities, although buy-ins which are for significant amounts of resources could benefit from developing a logical framework as they are conceived.  (6) Buy-ins allow missions to obtain consultancies and TA relatively easily without implementation delays caused by an extended bidding process.  (7) The financial management system is an important tool in monitoring Mission buy-ins and contributes to sound management.  (8) A monitoring and evaluation function in a global project is important in understanding the relationships between investment and impact on target audiences.  (9) Sending large numbers of publications does not guarantee the most impact on target audiences.  Greater attention must be given to the distribution systems.  (10) Letting a project like ABEL become very heavily involved in a limited number of countries severely limits its ability to reach a larger target audience worldwide.

"Evaluates project to provide secure and efficient financial intermediaries to small and medium-scale savers and borrowers in Costa Rica.  Mid-term evaluation covers the period 6/90-10/94. Due to delays in negotiating a grant agreement with the Government of Costa Rica (GOCR), implementation did not begin until mid-1991. Productivity in the economic policy analysis and reform component has been high and outputs are generally of excellent quality.  Inputs have included directed research, training, and TA.  Results have been disseminated through published books and articles that have effectively reached public and private sector leaders and the public at large, as well as through seminars and conferences.  As a result of these efforts, the policy and regulatory environment in the financial sector has been improved, mainly through Central Bank administrative actions. Significant progress has also been made on the legislative front, with the preparation of a new draft Central Bank Law.  Good relations have been developed with Central Bank leadership, which has expressed interest in continuing project involvement in financial sector reform. The credit union supervision and system development component has made reasonable progress on institutional development but is yet to demonstrate tangible impacts on credit unions' financial intermediation efficiency.  Progress has been made towards improving the financial solvency of the credit unions and public confidence in the credit union system (8 of the 13 credit unions are now financially viable). Membership has increased and savings deposits have expanded.  Project support also facilitated enactment of a law regulating financial intermediation activities, and establishment of the central liquidity facility. Fedecredito, the key implementing agency of this component, has demonstrated outstanding leadership in organizing and implementing new financial entities, although there is a danger that excessive concentration of authority at the upper levels of the credit union systems might prove unhealthy.  Additionally, there is a need for (1) prudential regulation and supervision measures aimed at reducing potential risks derived from the concentration of net debtors on credit union boards, and (2) innovative prudential regulation to ensure that credit unions function with an adequate base of permanent capital. In the financial management and innovation component, the contractor (Ohio State University) considered it essential to focus initial efforts on strengthening the institutional capability of financial PVOs such as ACORDE, FINCA, and Avance. As a result of this strategy, efforts under this component have largely consisted of TA and training in areas such as management capabilities, strategic plans, internal procedures and controls, and portfolio management, with less attention to planned innovative activities. Lessons learned include the following.  (1) Costa Rica provides an unusually complete case study of how excessive government control can foster a parallel and dangerous underground financial system.  (2) The pace of change in countries with highly developed democratic processes can be excruciatingly slow.  (3) A long project development process with piecemeal modifications along the way can result in a loss of coherence. (4) High-level personnel with manifold responsibilities -- in the present project, the Central Bank president -- are not prudent choices for chairing the Project Coordinating Committee.","Technical services order no. 16","Special Evaluation","Documents","LAC-0797-C-00-2046-00","","1/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Financial institutions|Economic policy|Policy analysis|Policy reform|Credit unions|Central banks|Savings and loan associations|Financial management","Costa Rica","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABK475.pdf","3,746 KB","004304 - Nathan Associates, Inc.|007732 - AG International Consulting Corp.","","008533 - USAID.

"The effectiveness of USAID agribusiness programs in generating economic and social growth is assessed through case studies of 21 programs in 7 countries -- Bangladesh, Cameroon, Ecuador, Guatemala, Sri Lanka, Thailand, and Uganda.  The report reviews: the strategies employed in the programs (whether assistance focused on strengthening agribusiness support institutions, individual entrepreneurs, agribusiness markets, or, in two cases, promoting privatization); the design of the programs and the economic environment in which they operated; their effectiveness in expanding the agribusiness sector (including support organizations) and increasing nontraditional exports; effect on employment and income; cost-benefit ratios; and factors affecting program performance.  The study found that the programs had generally succeeded in boosting agribusiness growth.  The following are among the lessons learned.  (1) USAID agribusiness programs should focus on improving the policy, regulatory, and institutional environment; assistance to individual enterprises should be secondary.  (2) Foreign direct investment in agribusiness is an effective means of transferring production technology and developing export markets.  At the outset, however, it is best to promote limited dealings between international and local firms, rather than try to establish fully owned foreign subsidiaries or joint ventures. (3) Contract farming is an effective mechanism for linking small farmers with processors and marketers.  (4) Efforts to assist agribusiness cooperatives have not been encouraging, as many lack the will and ability to subject themselves to the discipline of free markets. (5) Although women benefited from the growth of agribusiness, they were not full and equal beneficiaries from the ownership of firms.  (6) Improper use of pesticides emerged as a major problem.  (7) USAID should specify early on when assistance will end and stick to that timetable.  (8) Enterprise development should focus on the transfer of production technology and the establishment of export links.

"PACR of a project (8/83-12/94) to strengthen the capacity of Pakistani institutions at the federal, provincial, and local levels to increase fuelwood and timber production. Project assistance has increased awareness of the environmental and economic benefits of tree farming, changed the Government of Pakistan's (GOP) attitudes towards forestry, and helped to break down the overwhelming dominance of the public sector in forestry and its isolation from farmers.  Today, activity on the farms, whether it is row planting, block planting or agroforestry, is reasonably understood, gainfully practiced, and praised by farmers, although they still need information from the government on a regular basis. Due to the enormous interest exhibited by forestry staff and an effective and useful training program, targets for farmer involvement in nursery operations, tree planting and management, training, and construction were not only achieved but well exceeded.  Slow responses from the GOP sometimes caused delays, but the project handled gracefully any conflicts which arose. Specifically, the project:  supported establishment of over 5,000 private farmer nurseries; produced over 150 million seedlings from these nurseries; trained over 20,000 farmers, forest officers (including professional women extensionists), and industrial wood users in nursery and plantation management and in marketing principles; produced 100 multiple-language technical training packages for extension workers and farmers; conducted 50 studies on topics covering tree-crop interface, tree management, and the economics of tree farming; provided grants to 71 NGOs involved in farm forestry and environmental aspects of natural resource use; helped to establish marketing channels to industries throughout Pakistan; helped to involve about 150,000 farmers as tree producers with about 130 million additional trees planted; and helped afforest 5,000 acres in Sindh. Numerous lessons were learned.  (1) Ensuring host country approvals should be a prerequisite to any project.  In the present case, the GOP funding document for the project was not approved until 2 years after the Pro-Ag was signed.  (2) Despite the thousands of hours spent on structured workshops, seminars, and conferences for farmers, informal farmer training proved the project's most successful extension activity. (3) Understanding of market linkages is a prerequisite in farm forestry extension programs.  This project originally placed sole emphasis on wood production by farmers to the neglect of wood users (industries). Correction of this oversight resulted in an unlimited number of opportunities to sustain the farm forestry program.  (4) Effecting change in GOP forestry policies takes time:  while a revised policy was approved in 1991, legislation for its implementation is still pending. At the provincial level, on the other hand, farm forestry activities are being formally incorporated into forest departments.  (5) Members of the TA team were generally highly qualified and possessed relevant experience, which facilitated smooth implementation of the project.  (6) For projects in new areas, infrastructure can play an important role in attracting and retaining staff.  Besides the construction of hostels and training facilities, the project financed construction of 7 divisional forest offices, 19 range offices, and 20 nursery units.  (7) Women's participation is indispensable for forestry activities on private farms and in rural areas.  The project was a pioneer in training 30 women at the BSc. and MSc. graduate levels.  (8) Poor linkages between field foresters and researchers hamper the effectiveness of farm forestry research. (9) The NGO grant program did not begin until 1992.  An earlier start would have allowed time for NGOs to ready themselves for the critical role of developing private forestry in Pakistan. The project has provided a good base for sustainability:  it has reformed the government's attitude toward private forestry; shown farmers the monetary benefits of tree planning; and provided physical infrastructure for training and research.  Most importantly,, the GOP has shown commitment to continue farm forestry activities.  In addition, the World Bank and Asian Development Bank are engaged in efforts to develop social forestry projects in North West Frontier Province and Punjab, with this project serving as a model for their design.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","2/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Forestry|Agroforestry|Social forestry|Small farms|Trees|Institution building|Agricultural extension|Farmer training|Beneficiary count","Pakistan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABK506.pdf","2,408 KB","008588 - USAID.

"This interim strategic evaluation of the World Environment Center (WEC) Local Accident Mitigation and Prevention Program (LAMP) was carried out in India, Mexico, and Thailand from August to October, 1994. Indonesia, the fourth country in the program, was omitted from the evaluation because of a U.S. Embassy ban on official travel. WEC-LAMP is designed to meet Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) objectives of reduced loss of lives, increased awareness of accidents, and improved response to technological, namely chemical, emergencies.  Begun in late 1992, LAMP is funded at $3.5 million for 5 years. The most consistent feature of chemical emergency planning in India, Mexico, and Thailand is that such planning is industry and government driven.  Citizen groups, particularly those of a grass roots nature, are generally on the outside looking in, despite the fact that WEC-supported courses and workshops have stressed the role of citizen awareness. Beside the constraint of inadequate citizen participation lies the related problem of training for rank-and-file emergency first responders.  Since much of the WEC-LAMP emergency training is directed to management and technical personnel, first responders such as police and fire personnel have until now been widely overlooked. Important questions for this evaluation are:  (1) how useful has the LAMP program been in the three countries and (2) what are its chances of being sustained?  For the first question, all three countries have benefitted from this program.  As to the long range sustainability question, answers vary substantially.  In India, management of the LAMP by the highly regarded National Safety Council along with the creation of a National Advisory Council should assure progress long after OFDA's funding has ceased.  In Mexico, the execution of agreements with national and state governments and the presence of a culture of disaster awareness should contribute to its post-funding continuation.  In Thailand, the program is almost entirely carried by the vigor and commitment of the project manager; however, because WEC has not fully engaged top national disaster managers, continuation of its results will mostly occur at the industrial estate level, which in itself is an acceptable outcome given the shorter remaining time-frame of WEC-Thailand. It is expected that the LAMP program could have long-range impacts. As detailed in this report, all three country programs have made contributions of considerable value to chemical safety. No doubt some of these achievements will have a favorable impact in the years ahead. The program has achieved significant progress in the technical and management domains of emergency preparedness.  However, little progress has been made in the social and community development areas. Insufficient attention, for example, has been given to technical assistance in developing a corps of trained emergency responders either through a train-the-trainers approach or otherwise.  This is due in part to a top-down orientation in the three countries, but also because of a lack of assistance from WEC-Washington to the three countries in addressing this constraint. Secondly, the three country programs have not demonstrated significant advances in encouraging the enrollment of the community as an equal partner with the industrial and government sectors in the chemical emergency planning process.  Furthermore, there is no evidence that WEC-Washington has in any significant manner encouraged the correction of this shortcoming through technical assistance of community development or social science experts, including members of active local emergency planning committees in the U.S.  (Author abstract)","","Special Evaluation","Documents","AFR-1520-C-00-1128-00","","1/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Local level|Environmental disasters|Disaster preparedness|Disaster mitigation|Chemical technology|Disaster planning|Chemical industry","India|Mexico|Thailand","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABK563.pdf","1,026 KB","008485 - Basic Health Management International (BHM)","","007747 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (5/83-2/95) to strengthen the capacity of Pakistan's Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA) to manage rural electrification. WAPDA's new management structure and realignment of responsibilities, which were developed under the project, have improved its efficiency and scope; 40% of WAPDA's system expansion has been financed by internal cash generation resulting from increased tariff rates and improved efficiency.  The reorganized headquarters of the WAPDA Distribution Wing (DW) and the decentralized field formations -- Area Electricity Board's (AEB) Circles and Divisions -- have improved accountability through the adoption of new procedures; DW continues to use project-produced operating manuals as well as the computerized system for expansion/rehabilitation planning, billing, stores inventory, purchase order tracking, and load management systems. However, field staff have viewed the reorganization of the DW along functional lines as an infringement on their administrative powers and authority. Distribution training, of only a rudimentary nature prior to the project, has been given new impetus with the addition of a new general training manager, the development of an incentive-based system to attract high-quality training faculty, and the establishment in Islamabad of a modern training academy, which is expected to meet the DW's future training needs. The Energy Loss Reduction (ELR) program has helped WAPDA to apply improved standards, policies, procedures, and methods applicable to distribution planning, engineering, construction, maintenance, and safety and system operations.  Headquarters and all fields are utilizing the simplified computerized work order system, which has greatly expedited the development of work orders. The headquarters and AEB offices were provided with large quantities of surveying and computer equipment, and with training in inspection of maps and installation and utilization of computerized data tapes submitted by the mapping and surveying contractors.  Almost all AEBs have reached a uniform understanding of the use of computerized maps, but require expertise to guide them in the task of updating the computerized maps on a periodic basis.  The GOP is arranging with the World Bank to complete the surveying and mapping (55% of total kilometers assigned to the project), which should take up to a year to complete.  This will impede the continuity of the project. Under the power generation component, a 600 MW combined cycle plant was built, the first such plant in Pakistan; hands-on and classroom training were provided at the site by the contractor (Gibbs and Hill -- G&H); and WAPDA staff were sent to the manufacturer's facility as well. In addition, spare parts, which were essential for continuous operation, were provided to WAPDA. Other plants have since been constructed, and WAPDA has gained expertise in combined cycle plants and in the use of evaporative coolers.  The new plants have contributed about 1000 MW of electricity to the national grid, providing considerable relief from load shedding.  The component yielded the following lessons learned. (1) Selection of a good Architect/Engineer is the key factor for successful completion of any construction project. (2) A TA team serves much better under a direct contract with USAID than under a host country contract; G&H faced considerable administrative and logistical problems in supervising construction of a 300 MW plant under a contract with the Pakistani government, in contrast to the smooth execution of the 600 MW plant under a direct contract with USAID. (3) USG regulations sometimes result in losses to the very economy which they are intended to benefit. General Electric submitted a conditional proposal to supply equipment to WAPDA which claimed exemption from FAR clauses, namely audit access by the government, and submission of certified cost and pricing data. Because USAID could not waive these clauses, which are mandated by Federal Procurement regulations, GE withdrew its proposal, and the contract was awarded to Siemens. The following lessons were learned from the project as a whole. (1) The contractors' progress reports, which tend to focus on accomplishments only, should be supplemented with field visits. (2) While implementing a large project such as this, USAID should constantly review whether its own staffing is adequate to manage the project successfully.  (3) Before undertaking a program as complex and innovative as the mapping/surveying program, a pilot activity should have been undertaken to reduce risks and delays. (4) Adequate lead time must be allowed for the training of contractor staff before start of actual work on the program.  (5) Contracts that are as technically complex as this must always be reviewed by an independent authority, with demonstrated experience in similar work.  (6) As far as possible, proven and reliable ""off-the-shelf"" software and hardware should be used in future projects of this type.  (7) A program to guide and train WAPDA operation/maintenance staff is necessary; the operation staff responsible for maintaining the distribution system after its installation by the construction staff lacked the acceptable training levels on systems maintenance and operations.  (8) The ELR program quality control, handled by a TA contractor under the project, should be entrusted to an outside agency to improve the quality of works on a sustainable basis.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","2/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Electric power distribution|Rural areas|Institution building|Management development","Pakistan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABK611.pdf","1,040 KB","008588 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (3/84-3/94) to promote social marketing of contraceptives in Pakistan. The project has made a tremendous contribution toward increasing the acceptance, availability, and use of condoms in Pakistan, and is one of the most successful family planning (FP) efforts ever undertaken here. Social and cultural taboos associated with FP and with condom use have been overcome as a result of the project's successful marketing strategy and effective advertising and promotional campaign.  Accomplishments include: (1) popular acceptance of Sathi brand condoms, which have now become a generic name for condoms in Pakistan; (2) nationwide urban distribution of the condoms through approximately 40,000 outlets including medical stores, general stores, grocery stores, and multi-purpose tobacconist shops in 210 urban and semi-urban towns; and (3) high sales volume, totaling 346 million condoms between 1986 and 1/94.  Condoms are now the most popular FP method in Pakistan. Lessons learned include the following.  (1) Social marketing has played and will continue to play a major role in achieving FP objectives in Pakistan.  (2) A simplified management and organizational structure is highly important and essential for swift, smooth, and effective implementation of project activities.  The project's use of two contractors -- Woodward, a for-profit firm, and Population Services International (PSI), a nonprofit organization -- proved highly inadvisable.  Future projects of this kind should employ a single lead contractor. (3) The Government of Pakistan's (GOP) highly bureaucratic approach and excessive control is detrimental to social marketing programs, which can make marketing decisions in a timely and coherent manner only if they adhere to a private sector marketing model free of government control.  (4) The enormous revenue generated by sales of Sathi condoms remained grossly underutilized.  There was no effective mechanism in place for utilizing sales revenue to offset the project's operating costs. Sustainability issues were not addressed until 1990, when the Pressler amendment made it obvious that further project funding would not be possible.  Accordingly, increased focus was placed on cost recovery through price increases (which were accepted by consumers).  In addition, USAID and PSI made presentations about the project to other donors, and a German agency is now in process of signing an agreement with the GOP to continue Sathi distribution for 5 years.  The GOP, showing its own commitment, has made arrangements for PSI to continue operations until the German project gets underway.  As such, sustainability has been fully achieved.  Nevertheless, future projects should address the sustainability issue more systematically.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","3/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Social marketing|Commercial retail sale of contraceptives|Condoms","Pakistan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABK688.pdf","2,466 KB","008588 - USAID.

"PACR of a multi-donor project (1988-94) to mobilize private sector resources for electricity generation in Pakistan. Originally intended as a 10-year, $170 million effort, the project was terminated after 6 years and the expenditure of only $37.3 million. In particular, only $7 million was expended for power projects vs. a target of $125 million.  Nonetheless, the project met its major objective of creating a sustainable private sector in Pakistan's electric power industry; an enabling environment and a formal structured process have been established where there was previously no private electric power in Pakistan. Specific accomplishments are noted below. The key achievement of the institutional development component was the establishment of two key organizations at the Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA):  the Private Power Cell (PPC), and the Private Power Generation Cell (PPGC -- later renamed the Power Privatization Organization WPPO) after the privatization of WAPDA in 1991.  Project consultants also helped the PPC and WPPO develop two model negotiating agreements for WAPDA's Private Energy Division (PED): the Implementation Agreement and the Power Purchase Agreement.  The Implementation Agreement covered the concessions and assistance to project sponsors granted by the GOP as part of the initiative to establish private power and defined/allocated the risks and schedule to be assumed by the project sponsors.  The Power Purchase Agreement, which obtains between WAPDA and the project sponsor, defined the conditions of sale and purchase of power. In the area of technology transfer, GOP organizations gradually took the lead from project consultants in reviewing and negotiating proposals from the private sector.  The project also provided guidance in conducting environmental assessments; financed a successful conference to promote the Thar coal reserve, seminars and conferences to promote cogeneration from sugar mill operations, and a trade mission from California on cogeneration which led to several projects; refurbished an atmospheric monitoring station, resulting in the first meteorological report of its kind issued in Pakistan; and developed criteria for an Environmental and Social Soundness Assessment for proposed projects. The GOP now has a strategic plan for privatizing the power industry, and plans and legislation for a National Electric Power Regulatory Authority have been submitted to the cabinet for approval. Lessons learned are as follows.  (1) Despite the project's successes, the reduction in funding and time as a result of the Pressler Amendment and changing U.S. foreign aid and foreign policy priorities proved a significant constraint.  (2) In a project of this size and complexity, USAID, while cooperating with other donors, must maintain the lead in implementation. More could have been accomplished if project design had not been so closely tied to the World Bank's Hub project.  (3) Strengthening the position of the technical Project Manager by putting him in charge of the financial, procurement, engineering, and technical aspects of his project would enhance project implementation.  (4) The USAID financial management and reporting system is not geared to project management needs.  A project financial monitoring system is required. (5) If USAID cannot maintain a staff of tenured professionals in technical fields, recruiting professionals under term contract is an appropriate way to attain project objectives.  Recruited staff should share in the policy and management decision processes at the top mission levels.  (6) The creation of three organizations with overlapping roles (PPC, WPPO, and PED), led to conflict and confusion.  (7) The involvement of international advisors in Pakistan's development plans gave confidence to the GOP and foreign investors through increased credibility and transparency. (8) Being a U.S. government agency and a bureaucracy itself, USAID is not structured to promote privatization. Managing venture capital successfully requires courage to cross barriers and violate norms, whereas USAID's management and control functions require the rigid following of procedures, even at the cost of inefficiency.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","3/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Private sector|Electric power|Technology transfer|Procedural development|Institution building|Government departments","Pakistan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABK736.pdf","1,416 KB","008588 - USAID.

"PACR of a grant (6/87-6/94) to the Economic Affairs Secretariat of the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS) to promote foreign and regional investment in the Eastern Caribbean by helping to establish the Eastern Caribbean Investment Promotion Service (ECIPS) and supporting local efforts of the national Industrial Development Corporations (IDCs). The project was a qualified success in achieving many of its objectives.  It helped to generate a significant amount of new investment in export manufacturing and service industries, facilitated the introduction of new business opportunities into the region and OECS member states, and provided training to both public and private sector personnel in business development techniques and approaches. ECIPS has largely succeeded in demonstrating its value as a U.S.-based window to promote and represent regional business interests. This success, as noted in the 1992 evaluation, can be measured by the growing commitment of OECS members -- even those who have received little or no benefit from the business development initiatives of the present project -- to fund basic staffing and administrative costs needed to maintain ECIPS as their joint representative to the U.S. market. Other achievements noted in the 1992 evaluation included the following.  (1) The ECIPS-IDC investment promotion model has strengthened the capacity of OECS members to undertake investment promotion activities.  More specifically, it has strengthened local business development capabilities by demonstrating the effects of different types of investment promotion activities, developing leads for potential co-ventures, promoting the Eastern Caribbean as a good place to do business, and facilitating new ventures in specific industries such as data entry and 807 assembly operations.  (2) The ECIPS-IDC model has provided Eastern Caribbean governments with a first-hand introduction to the problems of identifying and developing new international business opportunities. The experience of ECIPS, like previous investment promotion activities, indicates that effective trade promotion activities are best led by an active private sector, with government playing a supporting role -- providing trade regulation and creating a favorable policy, legislative, and regulatory environment.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","2/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Regional development|Business enterprises|Private enterprises|Investment promotion|International trade|Institution building|International trade promotion organizations","Eastern Caribbean","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABK739.pdf","101 KB","007707 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to reduce the transmission of HIV in Ethiopia. Mid-term evaluation covers the period 9/92-8/94 against a PACD of 8/95. The project has achieved some significant accomplishments, although start-up and implementation have been seriously delayed by factors beyond the project's control, most notably by reorganization of the Ministry of Health (MOH). The upgrading of sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinical services has been impaired by a number of problems:  a 9-month delay in refurbishing facilities; a lack of laboratory testing to determine the effectiveness of existing STD treatment regimens; delays in obtaining needed equipment; sub-optimal community outreach IEC activities; and a lack of access to STD client profile information due to a failure to initiate targeted intervention research.  Only three of four focus sites are delivering improved STD management, with some outreach/IEC activities occurring through local NGOs, but not through MOH centers. Focus Site Intervention teams have been formed at only two sites, and their success has varied. Many IEC activities have been carried out, but implementation is months behind schedule, materials have not been reproduced at the targeted focus sites, and information collected in baseline surveys has not been used to design appropriate interventions. The condom social marketing program is exceeding its monthly targets. However, 2 million of the 7 million additional condoms obtained by USAID from excess stocks in Pakistan could not be sold because they were discolored and unacceptable to users. This project funds only a portion of the social marketing program, and it is unclear how long other donors will continue supporting the program. In other areas, the competitive NGO grants program has authorized its first four projects, and plans for STD surveillance have been scaled back based on changes in WHO recommendations.  As for research, despite considerable efforts by the AIDSCAP project, the behavioral research program at the University of Addis Ababa has been stalled due to the termination of 40 faculty members and the mutual reluctance of the university and the MOH to work together in this field.  No project-funded research is underway. Materials for preventing HIV transmission in the health care setting have been distributed erratically, and no training has been provided in safety practices or disposal of wastes. Finally, USAID funds advanced to the MOH were commingled with WHO funds in the Department of AIDS Control account and were improperly managed when the account was transferred to the central MOH budget office. Lessons learned are as follows.  (1) Implementation arrangements for centrally funded projects may not be appropriate to specific country situations.  Plans to have cooperating agencies or contractors sub-grants to host government agencies should be cleared by controllers and regional legal advisors; financial management procedures concerning sub-recipients should be reviewed and approved by Mission controllers in advance; and informal liaison should be established between cooperating agency/contractor accountants and Mission controllers.  (2) If host country procurement is planned, procedures should be reviewed during Project Paper design and incorporated into the implementation plan.  (3) Whenever a sequence of steps is deemed necessary to achieve a goal, it is important to assess how critical each activity is to the next and whether it may be necessary to delay the start of the next activity.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","2/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Disease prevention and control|HIV/AIDS|Condoms|Commercial retail sale of contraceptives|Social marketing|IEC","Ethiopia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABK751.pdf","1,476 KB","008543 - USAID.

"Assesses the impact of a national intervention to promote exclusive breastfeeding in Honduras.  The intervention, which was implemented by the Academy for Educational Development as part of the Nutrition Communication Project, included health personnel training, dissemination of print materials, and the broadcast of radio messages.  The evaluation focused on Regions V and VII, two of the country's poorest. The intervention, primarily due to the strength of the radio component, increased the prevalence of exclusive breastfeeding in the first 6 months of life, largely by discouraging the use of water and other liquids.  This is considered an impressive accomplishment given the difficulties inherent in modifying infant feeding practices. All project components were implemented, though not with equal coverage and completeness.  The amount of print materials available in each region was not as high as had been planned, due in part to the decision to extend the intervention nationally. Quality and coverage of health worker training was lower than expected (75% of health workers were trained in Region V and only 32% in Region VII), possibly due to a failure to extend the model curriculum and training-of-trainers approach systematically below the area level in the latter region.  Health worker knowledge benefitted most from the poster and the flip chart and least from the reference guides. Radio messages, in particular the slogan ""breastmilk and nothing else in the first six months,"" reached nearly half of the targeted mothers, while the poster was seen by two-thirds.  Other print materials received only limited exposure, and interpersonal contacts between mothers and health workers on breastfeeding topics was infrequent.  Exposure to print materials was associated with knowledge increases among mothers related to not giving water to newborns (a major problem identified in the pre-survey), exclusive breastfeeding up to 6 months, and the introduction of solids at 6 months.  Increases in mothers' knowledge were strongly associated with increased practice of exclusive breastfeeding through the first 6 months and in particular, in the first and sixth months.","Spanish ed.: PN-ABW-711|Nutrition Communication Project document","Special Evaluation","Documents","DAN-5113-Z-00-7031-00","","2/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Breastfeeding|Infant nutrition|Health education|Health workers|IEC|Mothers|Mass media|Exclusive breastfeeding","Honduras","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNABU421.pdf","6,495 KB","000223 - Academy for Educational Development, Inc.

"Evaluates project to restore and preserve vital public services in El Salvador damaged or destroyed during El Salvador's civil war. Evaluation covers the period 8/89-3/95 and consists of a final evaluation of all project components except for certain water supply and sanitation (WS&S) activities still being implemented by PVOs/NGOs and communities. Aside from high-priority public services restoration activities (Component 1), the project got off to a slow start due to guerrilla activity and various logistic and management problems. Component 1 restored critical public services in accessible areas wherever they were interrupted by the war and helped to preserve the national economy and livelihood of those working in the industrial and commercial sectors. Continued availability of these services generated an economic climate that attracted foreign investment even before the Peace Accords. Components 2 and 5 (road reconstruction) rehabilitated over 1,200 km of rural roads.  While this was somewhat under target, it clearly had a significant impact in rural areas, especially in the extremely depressed ex-conflictive zones, where a third of the reconstruction took place. Roads previously impassable or closed are now open and buses are running.  Component 4 strengthened the institutional capability of the Directorate General of Roads (DGC) to manage a sizable program of road rehabilitation and maintenance in rural areas.  It also strengthened the management ability of the Machinery and Equipment Administration (AME), which is now effectively servicing the vehicles and heavy equipment of the Roads and Urbanization Directorates. WS&S activities implemented through the National Water and Wastewater Authority (ANDA) under Component 3 were hampered by a poor initial design, ANDA's lack of experience in rural areas, lack of cooperation from a Salvadoran water supply agency that was excluded from the project, poor USAID organization, and strained USAID-ANDA relations due to inappropriate actions by some USAID and one TA personnel, host country contracting problems, and USAID policy shifts.  Nonetheless, this component gave 100,000 rural residents initial or renewed access to an adequate supply of potable water, achieved important success in the community acceptance of composting latrines, and strengthened community participation (especially that of women) in WS&S planning and implementation.  There is also anecdotal evidence of improvements in child and family health.  However, the problems noted above and the notable shortfall in meeting quantitative targets led USAID to turn WS&S activities over to three U.S. PVOs/NGOs and the municipalities and to extend the component until 9/96, by which time an additional 171,400 beneficiaries are expected. The project's impact on employment generation has been significant, estimated at 18,300 person-years of direct employment, and 40,000 person-years of indirect employment.  The project also highlighted the need for change in public service agencies, especially those responsible for WS&S and road services in rural areas and municipalities. The following lessons were learned.  (1) The more complicated the implementation arrangements (e.g., as in the WS&S component), the higher the risk of implementation failure.  (2) Project Implementation Orders for services or commodities that are critical to initiating implementation should be issued immediately following the signing of a Project Agreement.  (3) Large and complex projects, especially those with serious implementation problems, require strong management.  (4) Training of special units to assist in project implementation can impede institutional improvement, as those trained seek better employment after the project ends.  (5) The case of ANDA in this project shows the possibility of USAID influencing the head of a host country agency to agree to a project which the agency itself cannot handle or is not truly interested in doing.  (6) A project to maintain basic infrastructure may be a critical need during a civil war in order to avoid economic collapse.  Also, having such a project in place at the end of a war may accelerate reconstruction.  (7) WS&S infrastructure construction projects in rural areas will not have the desired health impact or be sustainable unless there is organized community participation and meaningful health promotion activities preceding, during, and after the construction period.  Health education to encourage the proper use of new WS&S facilities is rarely effective unless monitored and supported by local groups.  (8) The possibility of unauthorized use, at least from USAID's standpoint, of project-funded vehicles commonly exists in USAID projects.  (9) Commodity end-use rules need to be re-examined and revised so that they are not an encumbrance to implementation.","Spanish ed.: PD-ABK-844","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","519-0320-C-00-5014-00","","3/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Public services|War relief|War recovery|Civil war|Economic infrastructure|Rural areas|Post conflict societies|Beneficiary count","El Salvador","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABK843.pdf","14,049 KB","002848 - Cambridge Consulting Corp.","","008540 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (1989-9/92) to strengthen agricultural cooperatives and commodity producers' associations in Costa Rica through improved administration and financial stability.  The project was implemented by Agricultural Cooperative Development International (ACDI). Although implementation was severely hampered for the first 15 months by a reduction in the level of technical effort, the lack of TA in coffee renovation credit, and delays in contracting local staff, ACDI provided much valuable assistance to Costa Rican cooperatives and surpassed project targets in all respects except for supervision and recuperation of funds disbursed for coffee renovation credit and financial stability of cooperatives. During the life of the project, ACDI worked with 22 of Costa Rica's 33 coffee cooperatives and with the Costa Rican Federation of Coffee Cooperatives (FEDECOOP) and either prepared or contributed significantly to the preparation of action documentation for 13 cooperatives. However, as of 4/91 only 8 of 24 cooperatives seeking loans had been recommended to the banks. The project's impact on the processing and marketing of non-traditional products was significant.  The COOPECHAYOTE cooperative, for example, is now handling more than 30% of the total production of chayotes for export thanks to a refrigeration plant, the development of a U.S. market, and the use of improved seeds.  ACDI also helped the Fruit Production Association of the Pacifico Central (ASOFRUPAC) renegotiate its export contract on more favorable terms, and helped ADAPEX, in the mini-vegetable sector, avoid the use of herbicides and fungicides banned in the United States. Other accomplishments included four observation trips to the United States and Mexico which provided valuable production and marketing information to 19 cooperative members; a series of topical and technical seminars and lectures for more than 200 others; and two very good (and published) papers on management training.  ACDI also helped FEDECOOP revise its Model Budget for a Coffee Producers' Cooperative. In general, ACDI chose clients on the basis of their likely impact on the nontraditional export sector.  A key factor in this decision was the willingness of cooperative management to adopt a more businesslike mentality.  ACDI's decision to work with ADAPEX was also based on potential social benefits to the very poor area which ADAPEX represented.  Besides influencing technical decisions, ACDI took on the onerous task of instilling a business-like mentality in its clients, although the impact of this effort can only be measured in the long run. In sum, ACDI is well thought of within USAID and Costa Rican institutions, and its assistance was consistent with the needs and individual requirements of the cooperatives and associations it assisted, which have expressed satisfaction with ACDI's work.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Cooperative development organizations|Institution building|Agricultural cooperatives|Agricultural management|Management development|Agricultural production credit|Technology transfer","Costa Rica","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABK895.pdf","109 KB","008533 - USAID.

"PACR of a grant (8/85-6/89) to Agricultural Cooperative Development International (ACDI) to provide cooperative development services to selected coffee and oil palm cooperatives in Costa Rica. The project was successful in providing support to the Costa Rican economy as well as services to cooperatives and their farmer members. The coffee component involved a $20 million USAID loan fund, the entire amount of which was placed with 7,111 small farmers belonging to the national coffee federation, FEDECOOP, which administered the loan fund and provided TA to farmers; on average, just under one ha of coffee was replanted per beneficiary farmer.  The project helped the farmers to use new growing methods which helped to prevent the spread of coffee rust disease, which had threatened the Costa Rican coffee industry. The project also made loans for diversification into new export products to help farmers avoid the problems of one-crop dependency, making 521 loans to finance 1,287 ha of new plantings of macadamia (72% of area planted), cacao, cardamon, avocado, and soursop.  Additionally, membership in FEDECOOP grew from 30,000 to over 44,000 farmers and FEDECOOP's sales increased to over $100 million annually, although 4 of the 33 local cooperatives comprising FEDECOOP went broke; no provision was made in the grant for helping local cooperatives. In the second component, Coopecalifornia, an oil palm cooperative, was organized among former workers from oil palm plantations of the Chiquita Brands company in the Quepos area. The cooperative purchased 1,700 ha of land from Chiquita, which provided a long-term, low-interest loan.  USAID loan funds were used for replanting supplies, roads, and machinery, while ACDI trained the former plantation workers to become farmers.  The cooperative took more than the expected 4-5 years to break even, but finally exceeded its loan repayment schedule by year 8, developing substantial financial reserves, which it is now using to buy adjoining land and build houses for its expanding membership base. Coopecalifornia is now one of the most successful worker cooperatives in Latin America.  Thanks to substantial new plantings of oil palm in the Coto/Golfito area by cooperatives which, though not funded by USAID, are copying Coopecalifornia's success, Costa Rica became self-sufficient in oil palm in 1990, and now exports on the world market.  The monopoly in oil palm enjoyed by Chiquita in 1984 has also been broken, with about 50% of national oil palm production now in the hands of Costa Rican farmers and their cooperatives. In retrospect, the design of the coffee credit activity did not anticipate two kinds of emergencies which unfolded in subsequent years: the need to modernize FEDECOOP's administration and marketing methods; and the collapse of the international coffee cartel.  As a result, FEDECOOP has suffered reversals and is now reorganizing as a much leaner organization.  It did not help that FEDECOOP played the role of banker and guarantor of the loan trust fund.  Nevertheless, the major problems faced by FEDECOOP were not caused by the project, and FEDECOOP would have been worse off without it.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","3/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural cooperatives|Coffee|Palm oil|Agricultural production credit","Costa Rica","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABK898.pdf","106 KB","008533 - USAID.

"Following 14 years of authoritarian rule and the restoration of democracy in 1986, the Government of the Philippines (GOP) began a series of political and administrative reforms.  The Local Development Assistance Program (LDAP), which was implemented from 9/90 to 3/95 (against an original PACD of 12/93), was designed to support these reforms and in the process contribute to decentralization of an overly concentrated administrative system and improvement in the quality of local governance. This evaluation, based on extensive interviews in Manila at the level of the local government units (LGUs), was designed to gauge the impact of LDAP.  LDAP combined policy studies and tranche monitoring with support for non-governmental organizations to enhance the quality and extent of civic participation in local governance.  The evaluation team concluded that the Philippine government undertook and largely completed a massive reform of the administrative system within a 3-year period. Further, the team concluded that LDAP was a major contributor to the success of these reforms. The program was well-designed and well-managed and the timing was excellent.  The provision of TA and monitoring helped to implement major reforms in a difficult environment.  LGUs now have much more autonomy and authority, and are using this authority, often in partnership with participating representatives of the civic society, to innovate and improve the quality of local governance.  The financial situation of LGUs also increased dramatically:  over the period 1991-95, GOP allotments of discretionary resources to LGUs rose from 11 billion pesos to 52 billion pesos.

"PACR of a project (3/82-12/94) to finance assistance to the Government of Pakistan (GOP) in developing and implementing priority development projects, as well as assistance to USAID/P in designing portfolio projects and preparing its development strategy.  An amendment authorized direct grants to a number of NGOs and PVOs. The project provided USAID/P with a flexible, cost-efficient, mechanism for financing design and implementation activities and technical support to other portfolio projects; USAID/P made very effective and appropriate use of the funds.  The mechanism permitted a relatively rapid start-up of an essentially new program and quick movement to a high level of obligations. Activities financed included:  59 project design-related activities, including the design of 27 huge and complex portfolio projects; about 60 and cross-sectoral studies; hiring of short- and long-term contract personnel to assist USAID staff in handling design, contracting, and procurement activities; about 46 implementation activities, including support to the Narcotics Awareness Program; and provision of computers and other office equipment, as well as local consultants, to various GOP departments. Due to the closure of the Mission, project resources were most recently used for close-out activities and bridge-funding. In addition, grants were provided to NGOs for community-based and institutional development activities such as the training institute for Karachi ""katchi abadies"" (low-income settlements), a working women's hostel in Lahore, construction of a judicial academy in Islamabad, purchase of a helicopter for use as an air ambulance in Karachi, and provision of computers and training for the Senate, National Assembly, and four provincial assemblies. It is expected that many of the NGO projects will provide sustainable benefits. The following lessons were learned.  (1) The requirement that USAID submit a request for concurrence to the GOP counterpart agency, the Economic Affairs Division (EAD), on each planned use of funds proved very time consuming.  The labyrinthine line of command common to GOP bureaucracies, coupled with outright lethargy at the EAD, meant that approvals normally took 3-4 months, and sometimes took longer than the duration of the planned activity.  (2) End use checks of commodities such as the office equipment provided to GOP entities should have been carried out soon after they were delivered and installed; the checks were conducted 3-4 years after delivery, by which time it was nearly impossible to accurately account for their disposition.  (3) Disbursement of the entire amount of a grant as an ""advance"" to a NGO grantee should be avoided; it is only by withholding part of the grant that USAID maintains any leverage. (4) Better coordination with the technical offices using project funds would have resulted in much better monitoring of the completion of planned activities.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","4/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Development research|Development projects|Technical assistance|Development program design|Development project design|Development program implementation|Development project implementation|Indigenous private voluntary organizations|Grants","Pakistan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABK963.pdf","2,636 KB","008588 - USAID.

"Evaluates assistance to the Francophone Regional Advisory Committee (FRAC), a loose network of family planning (FP) managers and policy makers in Francophone Africa and Haiti. Assistance to FRAC consisted of organizing and facilitating annual meetings to discuss FP management issues.  The evaluation is based on semi-structured interviews with FRAC participants. No time-frame is specified. FRAC has developed into a very important organization in FP management in Haiti and Francophone Africa, playing key roles as (1) a locus for a cohesive FP community in what had previously been a fragmented environment, and (2) a forum for exchange of experiences and lessons learned.  Interviewees were able to cite specific examples of positive impact from their FRAC participation, including improvements in the areas of acceptance of population and FP activities, integration of FP services, supervision and quality of services, decentralization, private sector support, and relations with the donor community. FRAC's experience shows that it is possible to establish an informal FP network in areas where the subject remains controversial.  However, FRAC is at a critical stage in its development; key issues include the need to:  search for alternative funding sources, and especially for support during the likely shift from USAID sponsorship; rethink the format of the annual meetings and other aspects of FRAC; maintain greater participant interaction between the annual meetings; and allow the program to quickly and easily incorporate ideas developed within the context of the FRAC, both during and between meetings. While all those interviewed stressed that the FRAC should continue, most supported significant changes.  Their suggestions related to (1) upgrading FRAC's institutional structure and raising its profile (including establishing formal institutional structures such as a permanent secretariat and governing board, forming closer linkages with the political processes in Francophone Africa and with the FP community in Anglophone Africa, and formalizing the requirements for FRAC membership and the membership selection process); (2) allowing more member country participation in the preparation of the annual meetings; (3) increasing follow-up support during the inter-meeting period; and (4) improving relations with agencies outside Francophone Africa, and with the donor community.","Task order no.

"PACR of a subproject (12/88-6/94) to improve food system management and policy in Bangladesh.  The subproject was known as the Bangladesh Food Policy Project (BFPP). BFPP was successful on several counts.  It supported policy changes in the food sector that have increased real income and nutrient intake, which in turn reduced the poverty of all net foodgrain buyers (rural poor, urban poor, and middle class) -- who altogether make up 85% of Bangladesh's 115 million people. Approximately $100 million in savings per year have already resulted from policy reforms enacted by the Bangladeshi government (BDG), to which the BFPP contributed significantly. The BDG's current policy of maintaining a lower security stock level, as recommended by BFPP, is likely to generate additional savings starting this year, which will allow the Ministry of Finance to allocate more resources for other development activities. The BDG has been promoting education for children of poor households through the Food for Education (FFE) program, as suggested by the BFPP. In total, 700,000 of Bangladesh's 1.48 million primary school students are covered by the FFE, which is planned to cover up to 1 million students in 1995.  This program has increased primary school enrollment and attendance for girls and boys by 28.1% and 14.3% respectively, and has reduced the drop out rate by 8%.  Improvement in child nutrition is also expected from FFE, but has not yet been evaluated.  Other targeted assistance programs recommended by BFPP (e.g., Cash for Work) are being considered by the BDG. In addition to the above: (1) the technical and analytic capacities of 6 local institutions were strengthened through local and overseas training, study tours, and by working with the contractor in collaborative research and rapid appraisal training; (2) the share of nontargeted food distribution channels in the annual Public Food Distribution System was reduced from 43% to 32%; (3) targets for public procurement and sales through open tendering were partially achieved; and (4) the BDG has created a fully equipped food situation room which provides market information daily to the public and private sectors and produces a monthly food situation report containing production, market, price, and stock information. Lessons learned are as follows.  (1) Solid policy-oriented research on program impacts can be an effective tool for stimulating policy reforms in Bangladesh, when policy results are presented in a timely and effective way.  (2) Project results show that the private sector can and will step in to fill the void when the BDG withdraws from activities easily performable by the private sector.  (3) Effective policy research takes time and must be built on a solid empirical base.  The final 2 years of effective dialogue, reporting, and impact were in part the result the first 3 years of food policy data collection.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","4/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Food security|Food supply|Food policy|Sector planning|Government departments|Institution building","Bangladesh","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABL026.pdf","444 KB","008511 - USAID.

"Evaluates project/program to improve family planning (FP) services in Ecuador.  Mid-term evaluation assesses (1) the progress of two NGOs -- the Asociacion de Pro-Bienestar de la Familia Ecuatoriana (APROFE) and the Centro Medico de Orientacion y Planificacion Familiar (CEMOPLAF) and (2) nonproject assistance (NPA) to promote population policy and service delivery reforms. Evaluation covers the period 1991-4/95. Both NGOs have responded fully to the project's objectives, as of 1994 providing FP services to nearly 28% of contraceptive users (and supplying IUDs to 50% of IUD users.)  Both are providing high quality care, through increased technical knowledge, improved interpersonal communication skills, and a new familiarity with counseling, and are making available a growing number of methods at conveniently located centers.  The range of their reproductive health services includes FP and obstetrical and gynecological care, e.g., prenatal care, ultrasound, colposcopy, and reproductive tract infection diagnosis and treatment (which should be given more attention given the endemic nature of these infections) and general health services.  Other planned outputs (strategic planning, cross-subsidization, and a means testing and exoneration system) are in place. The NGOs have strong IEC programs.  APROFE has a well-diversified program consisting of mass media, interpersonal communications programs, special projects for women and youth, and a well-developed research component.  CEMOPLAF manages a well-organized and ambitious program which includes mass media, print materials, and interpersonal education, targeting primarily rural populations.  The NGOs have received good-quality TA from Johns Hopkins University (JHU), although there is room for improvement, and radio programming may cease when funds from JHU's contract are exhausted. The two NGOs have sound accounting systems and both are on track in terms of financial sustainability and cost recovery. Expectations are that they will recover 42%-45% of direct and indirect clinical service costs in 1994, with non-FP services already subsidizing clinical and community-based FP delivery. However, cost recovery has not been achieved without a price: both organizations have experienced a decline in new and continuing FP users as greater emphasis has been placed on non-FP services.  This consequence may also be affecting FP delivery to poorer clients, although there is no information to determine the client profiles at either NGO.  The NGOs and USAID need to resolve the conflict between the two project objectives of (1) cost recovery toward financial sustainability; and (2) extending availability to underserved populations. The NPA component has resulted in some policy changes, although these have been slow and minimal due to:  Peru's the change to a more conservative government in 1992; lack of high-level support and consistent leadership; loss of USAID leverage when a $70 million health sector loan was approved one year after this NPA program began; lack of understanding as to how the NPA was to be implemented; bureaucratic inertia; inability of the Ministry of Finance to facilitate NPA implementation; and the passive role of USAID management once the political climate changed and problems were encountered.  It appears that there has been virtually no impact on or improvement in service delivery by public sector agencies. although there have been improvements in some inputs, such as training.","Project title: Population technical assistance (POPTECH)","Special Evaluation","Documents","CCP-3024-Q-00-3012-00","","4/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Family planning promotion programs|Indigenous private voluntary organizations|Nonproject assistance|Population policy|Policy reform|Private health care|Family planning education|Family planning services|IEC","Ecuador","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABL022.pdf","118 KB","008485 - Basic Health Management International (BHM)|001131 - The Futures Group International, Inc.

"PACR of a program (9/87-3/95) to encourage the adoption of agricultural policy and institutional reforms in Pakistan.  The program consisted of sector grants, a Commodity Import Program (CIP), and training and TA. The program succeeded in laying the groundwork needed for Pakistan to privatize its agricultural sector.  The Government of Pakistan (GOP) has succeeded in carrying out a number of major agricultural reforms, although more work needs to be done before the sector is fully privatized. Despite premature curtailing of the sector grant component by the Pressler Amendment, the component achieved 83% of its targets, including reductions in the subsidies for phosphatic and potassic fertilizers, reduction in state procurement of domestic wheat, and increased public sector recovery of wheat storage and handling costs.  The private sector is now allowed to import corn and to export basmati rice, cheese, and some milk.  A truth-in-labeling law was enacted, a bill on plant breeders' proprietary rights is under review, and a policy of no interest on small agricultural loans was replaced with a system of recovering at least administrative costs. The public sector CIP financed imports of 321,000 MTs of wheat, which provided direct balance of payments support of $59.2 million and budgetary support of Rs. 675 million from sale proceeds.  These funds were programmed to finance development activities in the agricultural, health, and education sectors. In addition, bulldozers were imported for Northwest Frontier Province, where they are rented to farmers, and bulk wheat handling equipment was imported and used in a pilot activity. Under the private sector CIP, $17.7 million worth of agribusiness equipment and commodities were imported. The training and TA component contributed significantly to strengthening human resources, public and private.  Ph.D., M.S., and postdoctoral training was provided mainly for university faculty, while short-term training focused on private agribusinesses. Substantial amounts of TA were provided in economic and policy analysis; the TA program included a very productive special studies program which has been instrumental in redirecting Pakistan's agricultural policies, as well as significant activities in the areas of storage technology, agricultural data collection, and agribusiness promotion. By focusing on sectoral and structural reforms that in many ways replicated the conditionalities of the IMF, the World Bank, and other bilateral donors, the program enhanced its prospects for long-term sustainability. The following lessons were learned.  (1) Missions implementing a policy reform agenda must have a high level of policy analysis capability available to them.  Persons responsible for analyses should not have implementation responsibilities, because the pressure of implementing often takes precedence over analysis. (2) USAID/P's leverage for compliance on policy benchmarks was limited because of the promised multi-year package of assistance. (3) Design flexibility in the CIP was helpful in financing emergency imports.  (4) The training component should have: required USAID staff to work closely with cooperating institutions in nominating candidates; made the selection process competitive for both public and private sectors; focused agribusiness training on fewer areas; included more in-country training; included private sector representatives in the selection process; emphasized institutional linkages; and, for academic training, had U.S. universities participate as placement facilitators.  (5) Regarding TA, USAID financing of operational costs should be phased out gradually (and host government funding phased in) rather than stopped abruptly at the end of a project; withdrawal of project funding should have been more gradual.  In addition, instituting a pilot-tested technology can be time-consuming, clearances from security conscious government agencies should be obtained at the design stage, and detailed industry studies and analyses of complex issues can help in policy dialogue with the government.  (6) Host government officials should be involved in major donor-assisted activities even when the projects relate to development of the private sector; a full-time resident expatriate supervisor should be on staff to monitor and guide implementation; and host government officials should be briefed fully on the benefits of project activities, especially while creating new institutions.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","4/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural policy|Nonproject assistance|Balance of payments|Grants|Commodity import programs","Pakistan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABL051.pdf","1,782 KB","008588 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (3/83-12/94) to upgrade the managerial and technical expertise of public and private sector Pakistani personnel in key development areas.  During Phase II, which began in 6/90, the project focused on the fields of health and education and on the private sector. The project, one of the largest human resources development programs ever undertaken by USAID, substantially enriched Pakistan's professional capabilities in both the public and private sectors, and provided Pakistanis a unique opportunity for U.S. and third country academic and technical training in agriculture, public health, education, energy, engineering and other technical fields. In the project's largest component, 6,479 persons received overseas degree (1,205) and non-degree (5,274) training under the Thomas Jefferson Scholarship Program.  Due to curtailment of activities stemming from the Gulf War and the Pressler Amendment, this represented a 40% shortfall from the 1988 target of 10,850. Under the program, the target of 10% female participants (17% from the private sector) was achieved, with 136 women earning higher degrees; the overwhelming majority of trainees voiced satisfaction with their training; and 94% of trainees have returned to Pakistan.  The project also:  (1) created a Center for Intensive English Language Training and an institutional TOEFL program aimed at screening potential USAID participants; (2) upgraded branches of two national public sector training institutions (the National Institute of Public Administration and the Pakistan Institute of Management) and constructed a campus for the Lahore University of Management Sciences; and (3) provided in-country management training to 2,072 vs. a target of 1,600. Lessons learned are as follows.  (1) The project became too diverse. When the emphasis changed from in-country management training and institutional strengthening to participant training, the systems in place were not adequate to accommodate the change. (2) The Academy for Educational Development (AED) contract was a management nightmare, mostly as a result of having been negotiated to emphasize a different set of tasks than the one the contractor was ultimately expected to perform.  When the project was designed, only 228 participant trainees were targeted; it was impossible to foresee that AED would be processing more than 6,000 participants from 22 projects.  (3) Requiring prospective participants to reach qualifying TOEFL levels prior to nomination would have lowered the pre-qualification attrition rate (which reached 36%) and resulted in more rapid implementation of training and fuller use of training opportunities.  (4) In a large participant training program such as this, a user-friendly database integrated into the daily work of program administrators is an essential tool for monitoring work progress and accurately reporting training achievements.  (5) A participant training program is labor-intensive. Adequate and wise staffing is important to achieve the most successful individual training experiences and to accomplish the most from the overall training program.  (6) To realize the goal of using participant training to build agents of change, the project implementing team has recommended:  making demonstrated commitment to change on the part of the sponsoring institution a condition for nominating participants; requiring management courses for participants in non-management fields and computer training for all participants; using special arrangements and quotas to offset bureaucratic obstacles to women's participation in international training; and supporting same-country participant networking during training as a way of strengthening national ties.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","4/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Education for development|Technical training|Management training|Public sector|Private sector|Participants|Institution building|Women in development|Language training|English language|Training centers|Participant preparation","Pakistan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABL052.pdf","1,585 KB","008588 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (9/88-9/93) to provide balance of payments support to the Government of Pakistan (GOP) as incentive for its establishment of a Special Development Fund (SDF) to provide direct grants to NGOs in the areas of human resource development, women in development, and community health. The GOP deposited Rs 520 million in the Trust for Voluntary Organizations (TVO) for direct grants to NGOs.  An independent Board of Directors was established, with ten members from the private sector with voting rights, and three ex-officio members from the government.  By 10/91, the TVO was functioning as a support organization for development-oriented NGOs; human resource development was expanded to include primary education, adult literacy, and technical training; and a fourth project focus, poverty alleviation, was added.  The TVO established stringent criteria for NGO funding.  As of 12/93, the number of accredited NGOs had grown to 68, and the number of TVO supported projects had risen to 39.  These projects received a combined funding of Rs 223 million, and had reached 297,841 beneficiaries through the establishment of 558 outlets in 58 districts in all the provinces.  In addition to its headquarters, the TVO set up three regional offices to cope with the demand for accreditation and other support. Lessons learned with positive impacts include the following.  (1) The TVO converted all funds received into an endowment, thereby ensuring perpetuity.  (2) The TVO may solicit and receive funds from other national and international sources since USAID does not have proprietary rights over it.  (3) The Government has no role in the operations of the TVO.  (4) To circumvent political pressure, Board members from the private sector are barred from holding political office.  Also, since and the Board acts as a collective entity, individuals do not have any authority.  (5) Confusion in the roles of the Board and the staff was avoided through bylaws that made a clear separation of duties.  (6) Because most NGOs would not quality for outright accreditation, the TVO created an intermediary category of accreditation.  (7) The TVO places high value on the quality of the staff of the NGOs, insisting on full-time project director and experienced staff. Lessons learned with negative impacts include the following.  (1) Since USAID had no proprietary rights over the TVO, it could not influence the Board's decision to grant government officials voting rights.  (2) Nominations to the Board require approval of the government, which has so far delayed in replacing three private sector members who departed in the last year.  (3) Too many NGOs think that credibility comes from having a well-known patron and too many are claiming to replicate the work of established NGOs, without building their own capacity. Similarly, accreditation does not imply that an NGO has the capability of implementing all projects effectively.  (4) The increasing role of NGOs in development does not absolve the government of its responsibility to provide essential services to society.  (5) Both at the grassroots level and at the TVO, there needs to be stronger emphasis on institution building.  (6) In the last year, the TVO has been criticized in the press on a number of occasions; it has been alleged that the TVO does not allocate its grants fairly, and that its CEO is overpaid.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","4/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Nonproject assistance|Balance of payments|Institution building|Indigenous private voluntary organizations|Development projects","Pakistan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABL053.pdf","710 KB","008588 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (7/88-6/94) to expand and institutionalize child survival programs in Pakistan. Despite unprecedented challenges -- delayed start-up, evacuation of the TA team due to the Gulf War, loss of two Chiefs of Party, frequent turnover in counterparts, and a 73% budget reduction and shortened life span due to the Pressler Amendment -- the project was remarkably successful. Under the planning and management component, the project established federal and provincial Child Survival Steering Committees, which played an instrumental role in providing consensus and coordination; initiated a Donor Consortium to develop additional funding sources after passage of the Pressler Amendment; developed a computerized project monitoring and administration system; and recommended improvements in the medical supply depot procurement system and in critical areas relating to financing (rural health delivery, private managed care insurance, autonomy for government hospitals, and quality assurance in hospitals). The training component realized its goal of improving child health care through development of an integrated child health services package for any child coming to first-level health facilities.  A training package was developed for medical officers and paramedics, and another package for supervisors of these two levels of personnel; training materials were translated into local languages.  Federal and provincial Continuing Education Cells were formed. Under the information management component, a comprehensive Health Management Information System was developed for first-level facilities, although due to lack of funds it was instituted in only 40% of facilities.  Training and consensus-building workshops and discussions were held, although it required funding from other donors to complete the training nationwide. Under the communications component, radio and TV messages were developed regarding diarrheal diseases, immunization, acute respiratory infection (ARI), and breastfeeding and nutrition; the messages blended health education with entertainment and targeted mothers with children under age 5.  The project also provided training in interpersonal communication and counseling skills to health workers. Research efforts were mostly conducted under the Applied Diarrheal Disease Research project and had two foci:  (1) 40 studies which helped to improve diarrheal disease, ARI, and nutrition programs; and (2) development of a research and policy network of over 90 child health professionals, in which scientists were trained in research proposal writing and given TA for their research as well as post-research training in biostatistics and data analysis.  The result has been to establish, in a short time, a cadre of trained younger scientists who will benefit Pakistan for years to come. The following lessons were learned.  (1) Consensus-building is lengthy and time-consuming, but well worth the effort, since it galvanizes the support that helps to guarantee ownership and hence sustainability.  (2) System changes in a complex bureaucracy require in-depth understanding of decision making in that bureaucracy; involving government officers in the project from the beginning helps them to understand the process as a whole (not just from the perspective of their unit) and helps to ensure that their particular needs are addressed.  This lesson was demonstrated in several project components. (3) In the communications component, exciting public-private ventures in radio and TV opened the way for future endeavors.  The complementarity of mass media and interpersonal communication were clearly illustrated. (4) The silver lining of the Pressler cloud was that it made donor coordination and attention to cost absolutely essential.  Several activities were implemented with the support of other donors and are being continued by other donors.  Sustainability is likely because both the Pakistan government and other donors have a deep feeling of ownership.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","3/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Child survival activities|Public health care|Primary health care|Institution building|Health care administration|Health care planning|Child health care|Consensus building","Pakistan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABL054.pdf","704 KB","008588 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (6/84-6/94) to expand and conserve the social and economic infrastructure in 11 Eastern Caribbean countries using labor-intensive methodologies. The project was successful in achieving its targets. Specifically, it financed 266 new or rehabilitated subprojects; generated 110,000 person-weeks of employment; developed maintenance plans for 5 countries and implemented them in 3; and aired various maintenance video and TV spots and radio spots in come countries. The project, which was very popular with politicians and decision makers as well as with parents and others in the community, was effective in improving environmental conditions at schools and health clinics, and in increasing the level of services.  The Caribbean Development Bank's (CDB's) enthusiasm for the project resulted in its funding a follow-up project which will provide $15 million to Guyana, Belize, and some Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS) Group III countries. The following lessons were learned.  (1) To ensure that the new or rehabilitated infrastructure will be maintained, maintenance financing, procedures, and fully trained personnel should be in place before implementation of infrastructure projects or at least very early in the program.  An evaluation carried out in 1991 found this was not the case. The CDB tried to remedy the situation but had little success.  (2) Take care not to be bulldozed by the implementing organization or by the attitude that the implementing managers know it all.  In the present case, efforts by engineers from the Caribbean Regional Development Office (RDO/C) to verify the quality of construction were often countered by CDB's assurances that no serious problems existed, which was not the case.  Only at a final ""lessons learned"" session did the CDB address the issues involved.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Social development|Economic development|Employment|Technical assistance|Economic infrastructure|Labor intensive technology|Maintenance|Project sustainability|Clinics|School buildings","Eastern Caribbean","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABL066.pdf","117 KB","007707 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (8/85-9/93) to enhance Honduras' capabilities to identify and address priority development problems within the context of the Jackson Plan (SPATS project).  The Jackson Plan, the output of a 1983 National Bipartisan Commission headed by Henry Kissinger, resulted in sharp increases in assistance to Honduras and other Central American countries. The project served its purpose well, providing a mechanism to handle the huge increase in funding that occurred in the 1980s, and enabling USAID and the GOH to maximize development impact from the use of those funds.  This is seen in the fact that a significant part of the Mission's program in 1995 continues to address problems identified and studied under the SPATS project. The project had two components:  policy studies and TA.  Under the first, several studies, assessments, and feasibility studies were carried out covering:  municipal law development; government auditing; environmental development; analysis of census statistics; program strategy formulation; zero-based budgeting; customs systems; rice processing agribusiness; and economic policy.  The studies component ended in 1988 because its targeted number of studies already had been reached, and because the Policy Analysis and Implementation Project (5220325) started that year, which in effect carried on with the studies. In 1991, $330,000 was shifted to the TA component, which provided medium- and long-term TA to key government and private institutions. The services provided played a key role in bridging gaps between identification of specific needs for external expertise and the project design process.  Experts assisted the Honduran Congress in developing laws that foster economic growth, financial development, and investment promotion, while experts from the U.S. Census Bureau assisted the GOH in analyzing statistics.  Technical experts were also recruited to assume key positions in the GOH and USAID to design and implement projects under the expanded USAID assistance program. Other regions of the world that are opening up to USAID or that are experiencing sharp increases in resource levels may want to consider the project as a model.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Socioeconomic development|Technical assistance|Economic growth|Economic studies|Strategic planning|Government policy|Policy making","Honduras","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABL067.pdf","105 KB","008555 - USAID.

"Evaluates the Niassa Province Water and Sanitation Project for the period 9/93-12/94.  The project has been implemented by Medical Care Development International and Agua Rural.  The objective of the two-year project is to construct 65 new hand-dug wells, rehabilitate 35 existing wells, promote latrine construction, and educate project beneficiaries in diarrhea prevention and well maintenance.  The project's central theme of sustainability is to be achieved by involving local people in the implementation of the project and strengthening Agua Rural.  This concept of self-help is new to the local people who are accustomed to emergency assistance programs that provide services without requesting a local contribution to the project.  The lack of sustainability of the emergency assistance programs is exemplified by a well project that took place in Cuamba between 1988 and 1990.  Of the 35 wells installed by that project, only five are still operating. In the Niassa project, communities are approached by MCDI/Agua Rural animadoras (village extension workers) who help to mobilize the village in preparation for well and latrine construction. The Agua Rural technicians and masons then assist the villagers with construction.  The villagers form water committees and contribute labor for well excavation and the collection of sand and rocks.  The animadoras are also responsible for training village water committee members and providing health education in the importance of safe water and latrines, water storage and use, and hygiene. Between May and December 1994, thirty (30) new wells have been constructed, one existing well was rehabilitated, and two spring catchment tanks were constructed.  Demonstration latrines were constructed in ten villages.  In all of the villages water committees were established and local people donated their labor to the project. The wells were constructed in accordance with Mozambican government (Pronar) standards for well construction.  The wells were dug to a depth of 2 meters below the static water table and the wells were lined with pre-formed concrete rings and stone masonry.  On each well an Afridev pump was installed.  All wells and spring catchments were located a sufficient distance from latrines or other potential sources of ground water contamination. The strength of the project is the strong team that has been formed by MCDI and Agua Rural/Cuamba.  Frequent staff meetings assure that both Agua Rural and MCDI are involved in project organization and decision making.  Thus far, the two major obstacles encountered by the project were the delay in getting the vehicles from customs and reluctance of some communities to provide in-kind contributions. The evaluators observed that there was a need to better define the pre- and post-construction health education program; to focus on the link between water, sanitation and diseases; and, to place more emphasis on a participatory training approach incorporating the results of the KAPB (Knowledge, Attitudes, Practices and Beliefs) study and better utilization of the health education materials available from PRONAR. The evaluation did note that the project had recently taken steps to improve the health education component through staffing changes that included the hiring of a Mozambican trainer as a counterpart to the new IEC supervisor.  The evaluation also noted that several of the recommendations contained herein are already planned for implementation.

"The Inner Kingston Development Project was initiated in July 1986 to revitalize the downtown core of Kingston, Jamaica, and provide economic growth and job generation.  The two principal implementing agencies are the Kingston Restoration Company Limited (KRC), a private nonprofit, public-purpose company, and the Urban Development Corporation (UDC), the primary developmental parastatal organization of the Government of Jamaica (GOJ). The KRC experienced some successes but had some shortcomings.  In terms of overall expenditures, less money was invested in income-generating activities and more in non-income producing activities than originally projected (40% versus 10%). Non-income generating projects have helped to establish the KRC's credibility and further its revitalization objectives.  The Urban Institute (the TA contractor) and A.I.D. staff were instrumental in facilitating the institutional development of the KRC. However, the KRC has not been able to generate enough income from its activities to support its operating expenses; income from fees and the sale and operation of properties has been less than projected. UDC's performance is disappointing in that some projects were not completed, including the Urban Bus Terminal and the West Kingston Markets project.  Additionally, most completed projects were finished substantially behind schedule and at a far higher cost than budgeted. However, generally speaking, the results from such a relatively small amount of USAID funds are impressive.  USAID has obtained good value for the funds it has provided.

"Evaluates project to foster U.S.-Asian partnerships that will improve Asia's environment through the transfer of environmental technology and management skills (US-AEP project).  Midterm evaluation covers the period 1992-94. US-AEP, one of the largest projects in USAID's portfolio, has been highly successful, with nearly 1,000 activities completed as of 10/94, some 81% of them under the Professional and Organizational Development component (training, fellowships, and business exchanges).  The project, which is becoming a well-known entity in Asia, currently directs the implementation of activities with some 16 public and private organizations. Recently, US-AEP introduced management adjustments which have increased its programmatic and cost-effectiveness. Specific achievements are as follows.  (1) US-AEP has increased U.S. private sector involvement in Asia; the National State Development Agencies (NASDA) Technology Fund Program has recorded over $300 million in U.S. environmental technology sales to Asia, and the AETNA Trade Lead System has resulted in nearly $9 million in U.S. environmental technology sales.  (2) Because of the wide variety of services it offers, the US-AEP project has become a useful adjunct to all of USAID's bilateral environmental strategies in Asia.  (3) All of US-AEP's implementing organizations -- the Asia Foundation, the World Environment Center, the U.S. Environmental Training Institute, NASDA, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and the Department of Commerce's U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service -- have received high marks from their Asian counterparts.  (4) US-AEP's strongest ""partnering"" accomplishment has been its ability to broker institutional linkages between U.S. and Asian entities, particularly those in the private sector. US-AEP is sufficiently novel to conflict with key elements of USAID procedure.  For example, USAID places emphasis on clear objectives and performance indicators, but US-AEP has not identified site-specific environmental objectives; this has caused tension between US-AEP and the Asia/Near East Bureau and raised doubts about whether or not the project is sufficiently focused.  In any case, there is a widespread view, shared by the evaluation team, that US-AEP's image and impact would benefit from strategic clarification; the project should narrow its scope, without limiting its operational flexibility and entrepreneurial character.  In addition, USAID must determine, given US-AEP's success, whether it should continue to be managed by USAID or by an interagency governance committee.","Delivery order no. 15","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-0085-Q-00-1142-00","","5/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Development cooperation|Joint ventures|Technology transfer|Environmental management|Joint development projects|Environmental protection|Private sector|Public sector|Environmental technologies|Investment promotion|Institutional linkages|Institution building|Partnerships","Asia|USA","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABL193.pdf","5,414 KB","003970 - Management Systems International, Inc.

"Evaluates component of the Swaziland Training and Institutional Development Project to establish a linkage between California State Polytech University/Pamona (CalPoly) and two Swazi training institutions -- the University of Swaziland's (UNISWA's) Faculty of Commerce and the Swaziland College of Technology (SCOT). Midterm evaluation covers the period 12/91-5/95. Although the linkage program has not been clearly and mutually articulated, progress has been made in several areas:  (1) the professional levels and skills of the UNISWA's Faculty of Commerce and the SCOT have been improved; (2) the competencies of UNISWA and SCOT students have been enhanced; (3) the accounting, business, management, and marketing curricula have been expanded; and (4) and UNISWA and SCOT have developed linkages with Swazi business and government communities. CalPoly has provided commodities such as computers, related hardware and software, textbooks, audiovisual equipment; and TA centering on computer training, curriculum development (including computerization of curriculum), introduction to new methods of teaching, and faculty substitution. Both UNISWA and SCOT have made efficient use of TA offered through the linkage.  UNISWA's Faculty of Commerce has established an Executive Advisory Council, consisting of private and public sector individuals who are working with the faculty to improve the quality and relevancy of the curricula.  In addition, UNISWA has utilized CalPoly's TA to shape its marketing curriculum.  SCOT has utilized CalPoly TA to structure its Level III Association of Accounting Technicians (AAT) certification curricula, develop a curriculum for micro- and small enterprises, and form a committee which markets SCOT to the Swazi business and government communities. For its part, CalPoly has used the linkage to internationalize its curriculum (and to thereby obtain accreditation for its business school), and to provide participating faculty opportunities for publishing and for analyzing their teaching methods. Several managerial, cross-cultural, public relations, and communications problems have limited further progress.  (1) Failure to define the mutuality of interest among linkage participants and the absence of an effective management and communication system from CalPoly has resulted in false and unrealized expectations on the part of UNISWA and SCOT, while the absence of a thorough and systematic needs assessment by linkage participants may have resulted in less than optimal use of linkage resources. (2) CalPoly has failed to provide monthly reporting of activities and expenditures as required, and spent in excess of current USAID/S obligations.  (3) The absence of Swazi participation in determining and controlling how grant monies are spent has led to dissatisfaction -- only partially justified -- on the part of UNISWA and SCOT, neither of whom, moreover, have fully utilized linkage assistance by adequately institutionalizing curricular methods and policies.","Contract number is listed incorrectly on the document as|AEP-5454-I-20-2049-00|Companion evaluation summary: PD-ABM-225|Project title: Implementing policy change (IPC)","Special Evaluation","Documents","AEP-5451-I-20-2049-00|AEP-5451-I-00-2049-00","","5/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Universities and colleges|Institutional linkages|Business schools|Institution building|Personnel development|Faculty|Technology transfer|Management training","Swaziland","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABL219.pdf","3,186 KB","003970 - Management Systems International, Inc.

"Evaluates seven income-generating activities in Ta'iz and Ibb provinces of Yemen:  Ibb Kindergarten, Ta'iz Computer Workshop, al-Azaiz Sewing Workshop, al-Turba Buffet, al-Mokha Sewing Workshop, al-Mokha Typing Workshop, and al-Qabaita Bakery. The project has made reasonable progress in enhancing the managerial, technical, and financial skills of the women running the enterprises. In particular, training sessions and study tours outside the country have increased awareness of business concepts and opportunities for generating income.  However, a majority of the women have found it difficult to implement their new knowledge; training sessions were provided before women were actually operating their enterprises, in many cases, the level of training was too high, and there was a lack of follow-up training.  In addition, the project was slow in providing commodities and was not equipped to technically assist the enterprises. Some of the problems were anticipated; others could have been prevented if the program had been less ambitious and more carefully designed. None of the proposals made for the enterprises demonstrated that the operations could be financially sustainable.  The project design did not consider that the majority of the female members of the women's centers (at which the enterprises are based) are government employees (either teachers or social affairs staff), that others work as volunteers, and that only a few (those working in the bakery) receive personal financial incentives.  In spite of their relative independence, the centers were all perceived as community service institutions (with stipulations that profits should return to the centers).  Running a profitable business in such a service oriented framework is not only difficult, but contradictory.  Therefore, a majority of the women perceived their business as owned by the center, or by the project (in the case of Ta'iz computer workshop/al-Azaiz sewing workshop) rather than as personal achievements.  Some were even convinced that any losses incurred would be covered by the project. In addition, some centers were only recently set up. In the given social and political context, businesses managed by individual women could have more advantages than community oriented businesses. Some women said they have developed self-confidence and esteem for their own and colleagues' capabilities.  Mobilizing the women for training sessions and tours is a constructive stimulus for gradual development of a group mechanism in Yemeni society. Only two of the seven businesses generate cash surplus.  Because they are still heavily subsidized they are currently not profitable.  Four enterprises out of the seven have good potential in terms of apparent demand, managerial set-up, and financial skills (the bakery, computer workshop, kindergarten, and al-Azaiz sewing). For the remaining period (March to May, 1995) the project should concentrate on the four potential profitable enterprises only, provide all technical means possible, and, by means of additional financial on-the-job training, strengthen the centers' management capability.  A full-time project manager should supervise the two program officers and closely monitor the field work.  The last trainer training session should include a general section on how to obtain donor funding.

"Final evaluation of agriculture sector grants provided to Albania, Romania, and Bulgaria over the period 1991-1994. The design of the grants, which consisted of reimbursements for U.S. imports or for import of critically needed agricultural commodities as well as related TA and local currency generations, was appropriate to the needs of the host countries, all of which were suffering huge balance of payments deficits throughout the period of the projects. Though only to a modest degree, the grants were effective in alleviating these deficits.  In Bulgaria, the assistance facilitated immediate and direct impact equal to the full $10 million of the grant.  In Albania and Romania, the relief was indirect and less than the cost of the commodities when based on values that reflect alternative sources of shipping.  Fertilizer in Albania and animal feed in Romania had almost immediate effects on production. Achievement of long-term development objectives varied.  The Albania project had the most sustainable impact:  the fertilizer import and distribution system is privatized, a national association of fertilizer dealers has been established and is having a positive influence on industry policies, and positive changes have resulted in the attitudes and practices of the banking sector in serving the credit needs of the dealer network. On the other hand, the project was unsuccessful in restructuring and privatizing systems for the production and supply of fertilizer, and for the production of urea.  This could affect the sustainability of a competitive network of dealers, since only a few have mastered the import process. The Romania project demonstrated, under free market conditions, the productivity advantages of using high-quality animal feed supplement; the project raised short-term production and created what may be a permanent demand for feed supplement among private poultry and swine producers.  However, the small association of private livestock producers established under the project may not be sustainable.  Studies on livestock market privatization and the environmentally sound management of animal waste were produced although they did not elicit responses from either the Romanian government or USAID. Only the Bulgaria project has had an impact on land privatization. Additionally, the project is the only one of the three to use local currency, which was the weakest part of the overall program; the availability of local currency (established by the sector grant) accelerated the land mapping and titling process by as much as 4 months, and helped the Bulgarian government to overcome serious difficulties caused by inappropriate equipment supplied by another donor.  Although the land restitution program is moving slowly, 52% of targeted land has been provisionally titled. Lessons learned are as follows.  (1) More effort should be spent on planning local currency utilization during program and project design. (2) Project objectives should be realistic in terms of policy environment, resource levels, and time frame.  In addition, the project design should ensure ownership of the objectives by all concerned actors; set realistic indicators of progress, impact, and sustainability; and make provisions for periodic follow-up.  (3) The objectives built into the grantees' terms of reference should be consistent with those in other program documentation.  (4) As demonstrated by the Albania and Romania experiences, use of the media can be an effective tool in starting a new activity.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","5/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Nonproject assistance|Agricultural development|Commodity import programs|Agricultural inputs|Privatization|Grants","Central and Eastern Europe|Albania|Bulgaria|Romania","","","006900 - Agricultural Development Consultants, Inc.","","008864 - USAID.

"PACR of an OPG (9/90-9/94) to the Anti-Drug Foundation of El Salvador (FUNDASALVA) to upgrade national drug and alcohol abuse/awareness programs and strengthen its own institutional capabilities. The project surpassed its objectives.  FUNDASALVA conducted training programs in 152 schools, 152 marginal communities, and 50 private businesses, many times the original targets.  FUNDASALVA also provided for a multiplier effect by training 104 sport trainers, 629 teachers, and 1,100 community leaders using a training of trainers model.  A mass media campaign lasting more than 2 years included 64 hours of TV spots and 251 hours of radio spots aimed at youth of all ages and socioeconomic levels, as well as 4,823 inches of print media. The program achieved broad coverage of events and was very successful in raising awareness of the drug problem and in establishing FUNDASALVA as a program for preventing substance abuse.  FUNDASALVA also created a documentation center that uses MICRO-ISIS, the database software most used in substance control centers throughout Latin America and the Caribbean, thereby facilitating interchanges between FUNDASALVA and other centers. Finally, FUNDASALVA has acquired the designs, materials, and staff skills needed to institutionalize drug prevention programs in both public and private agencies. Lessons learned include the following.  (1) Multipliers are important elements in reaching broad target groups with limited resources at the community level.  Sustainability of multiplier programs requires follow-up to reinforce lessons learned and provide continued motivation to volunteers.  (2) Sustainability needs to be a clearly stated objective from the beginning of a project in order to maximize the TA and institutional planning efforts needed.  In this case, Mission efforts and TA provided under the project have resulted in an institution which is able to control operating costs and obtain additional funding from other donors as USAID assistance ends.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","519-0377-A-00-0399-00","","3/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Drug abuse|Drug abuse education|Community based delivery","El Salvador","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABL254.pdf","276 KB","008540 - USAID.

"Evaluates project (1990-94) to establish enterprise funds -- nonprofit organizations to stimulate private sector development and provide technical and financial assistance to small and medium enterprises in Eastern and Central Europe.  Interim evaluation covers the period 1990-9/94. The investment performance of the funds is mixed.  The funds in Poland and Hungary have established effective investment programs, whereas those in the Czech Republic/Slovak Republic and Bulgaria have been far less effective.  Investment performance appears to be based on a combination of staff capabilities, strategic approaches, and the stage of economic transformation in each country.  Although capitalization of the funds is large by USAID standards, the funds are still small compared with the size of the markets they serve and hence have had, even when successful, only small impact in macroeconomic terms (to date, 3,035 companies have received almost $270 million in enterprise fund investments).  This impact could be improved if the funds shift their focus on providing venture capital (the market for which is much narrower than originally assumed) to provide loans to newly emerging small firms. Investment in privatizing companies and in joint ventures have been some of the best and some of the worst investments made by the funds.  A key success factor is management.  Results have generally not been positive when old management practices have been retained in privatized companies or when foreign joint venture partners have failed to deliver the activities expected, such as access to markets and technology. Overall, the small loan programs have been moderately profitable and the return on large investments has been negative, although the latter situation should improve over time as equity increases.  While the funds have provided helpful policy advice on an informal basis, they have no ability to influence host country policy. Most of the funds should be able to reduce the cost of their operations (only the Polish fund has maintained an expense structure in line with that of more conventional venture capital funds).  The single factor responsible for higher costs is the maintenance of executive office structures and investment offices in the United States. The speed with which the enterprise fund program was able to get started (and which made it the envy of other donors) has had some negative effects.  Little consideration was given to the long-term life cycle of enterprise funds.  In addition, the relationship between the enterprise funds and their principal investor, the U.S. government (USG), needs clarification.  Funds must have independence to carry out their programs, while the USG needs a better way to monitor its investment, which now exceeds $1 billion for the entire enterprise fund program. Lessons learned are as follows.  (1) The operational philosophy of enterprise funds as high performance venture capital funds has only limited applicability in formerly Communist countries of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union.  (2) Enterprise funds realize their greatest impact when they target a range of different sectors and investment approaches.  (3) Development impact and commercial viability are not contradictory objectives. (4) The most successful funds are those that have built a strong and capable investment staff around host country professionals and used an investment strategy that matches evolving market conditions.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","AEP-5451-I-12-2059-00","","4/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Investment|Venture capital|Private enterprises|Small scale enterprises|Medium scale enterprises|Economic development","Central and Eastern Europe|Poland|Hungary|Czech Republic|Slovakia|Bulgaria","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABL255.pdf","6,400 KB","006727 - Development Alternatives, Inc.

"Evaluates a project to improve the capacity of the Government of Niger (GON) to make informed economic policy choices and to monitor and quantify the impact of the policies selected. Midterm evaluation covers the period 8/90-1/95. The project did not begin until early 1993 due to a complete revision of the project design.  Rather than focusing on advanced graduate training abroad and model-building at home, the implementors decided to emphasize policy research and short-term training locally.  The new PACD is 6/96. Eight individuals have been sent abroad for M.S. training; of these, two have returned.  Six separate workshops, with 152 participants, took place in Niger in areas of statistics and macroeconomics, the informal sector, industrial strategy, and English. While much important research has taken place, it is spread out among many different areas and lacks focus.  The principal administrative problem is that the resident adviser cannot spend sufficient time supervising research, leading to delays and/or a decline in quality. In sum, performance in the areas of short-term training and research conform to revised project objectives, and the volume and quality of research studies and training have been reasonable given the human resources available and the short time the project has been effectively operating.  However, the project has had only a modest impact on analytic capacity and policy-making, due not only to the dispersion of effort and the absence of sufficient supervision but also to the absence of a program instrument.  The basic concept of the project is sound and there is a strong need for its services; the question is how to make the project more effective.  A number of recommendations are included.","Delivery order no. 17|Project title: Implementing policy change (IPC)","Special Evaluation","Documents","AEP-5451-I-00-2058-00","","1/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Economic policy|Participants|Technical training|Economics education|Economic research|Research productivity|Research management|Policy analysis|Institution building|Policy making|Workshops","Niger","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABL293.pdf","554 KB","004304 - Nathan Associates, Inc.","","008122 - USAID.

"Evaluates project (1989-1994) to increase employment, productivity, and competitiveness of private sector enterprises in Bangladesh. The project has funded five different programs:  (1) Project Implementation and Analysis Group (PIAG); (2) Small Industry Credit Insurance Scheme (SICIS); (3) International Executive Service Corps (IESC); (4) Business Advisory Services Center (BASC); and (5) Bangladesh United States Business Council (BUSBC). All the components except the BUSBC suffered from interruptions and unusually long bureaucratic delays.  Although the project was signed in 1989, not more than four assignments were completed under the IESC until 1992.  PIAG did not have a resident chief technical adviser until 1993. Some of these delays are due to domestic political turmoil and the election and installation of a new government as well as the 1991 cyclone and Gulf War.  The project encountered more bureaucratic problems with the Bangladesh government than other USAID projects implemented about the same time.  In one respect, the delays were fortuitous because they allowed implementation to coincide with a wave of reforms initiated by the newly elected government's New Industrial Policy Act. Despite delays, the project (particularly the PIAG and IESC components) has helped to promote the development of private sector industry and to increase local and foreign investment in the Bangladeshi private sector.  At the microeconomic level, it appears that TA from IESC volunteers and government policy reforms advocated by PIAG have contributed to $3 million in new investment and increased employment through 1,600 jobs that would not have otherwise occurred. The PIAG component has contributed to the policy reform debate through the production of eight major policy reports, several shorter papers, memoranda on policy issues, and the first issue of a quarterly review of policy reform issues, and the organization of three major policy issue workshops and a number of fora for key persons. The SICIS program has not been very effective.  No private sector bank has applied to the program, and those banks strong enough to qualify have not expressed much interest. It should be noted, however, that the financial sector system in Bangladesh is in the midst of a difficult reform and transition process.  Only about one-half of the local private sector banks are financially strong enough to qualify for the SICIS.  However, SICIS did motivate the government to offer a loan guarantee program of its own through nationalized commercial banks. As of December 1994, the IESC program has fielded 34 volunteer executives, who have provided more than 1,960 person days of TA to Bangladeshi private sector enterprises.  Most of these enterprises report strong satisfaction with assistance received and positive improvements in productivity as a result of implementing recommendations made by IESC volunteers. The BASC component has made only marginal contributions to small enterprises, although it has trained 787 people (including 151 women) in 243 organizations.  It has also carried out 11 consulting assignments, and sponsored 38 training events, including seminars, fora, and a catalog exhibition. The Bangladesh United States Business Council was not a very successful venture.  It was not able to cover its annual operating costs.  In 1990, it had between 26 and 33 dues-paying members.  The BUSBC produced some promotional publications, a short video, and brief investment opportunity studies that were provided to interested inquirers.  It organized two short investment missions to the United States. The shortfall in project accomplishments can be explained mainly by (1) lack of support from the new government and (2) USAID's inability to respond and adjust to the changes in the government's level of interest and support. Lessons learned are as follows.  (1) Implementation may have gone more smoothly if the project had been formally linked to the ISAC-2 agreement between the Bangladesh government and the World Bank.  (2) Industrial sector reform and assistance to small enterprises are two different problems, and little appears to have been gained by trying to tackle them both with a single project design.  (3) No project component is sustainable and none should be expected to become self-sustaining. The Mission's Project Review Committee is correct to assume that a newly created NGO such as BASC will not be able to achieve financial sustainability unless there is compelling evidence to the contrary.  In the future, the Mission should use project designs that avoid creating new entities and use already viable private sector organizations.","Project title: Implementing policy change (IPC)","Special Evaluation","Documents","AEP-5451-I-00-2058-00","","3/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Private sector|Small scale enterprises|Industrial development|Business support services","Bangladesh","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABL295.pdf","9,554 KB","004304 - Nathan Associates, Inc.","","008511 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of a project to improve the management of rangelands in mountainous areas of Lesotho through development of community grazing associations (GAs). The evaluation covers the period 6/91-4/95. The project's purpose and many expected outputs were not met due to factors beyond the project's control -- especially the 6/93 decision to close the USAID Mission in Lesotho and end the project by 9/95, the unfavorable political environment in which the project existed, and the weakening of the Division of Livestock Services due to termination of the Lesotho Agricultural Policy and Support Project (LAPSP). Nonetheless, the project's long-term advisors performed remarkably well, and while long-term training was canceled, over 300 person-months of short-term training in diverse topics were provided to Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) staff and GA and Range Management Area (RMA) members. The Government of Lesotho (GOL) will need to quickly revise, approve, and implement its natural resource management (NRM) policies so as not to jeopardize the future of the entire RMA/GA program. With the technical issues surrounding the RMA/GAs fairly well understood by RMA/GA leaders and members, organizational, managerial, and representational issues should now be given priority. The viability of the GAs has in particular been put at risk by the cancellation of the National Grazing Fee, which would have provided the GAs with a financial base, and by the challenge to the GAs' legal status in the courts. Additionally, while women benefited from some of the project's activities, more remains to be done to include them in NRM programs. The vast majority of rural Basotho have no economically viable investment opportunities other than livestock. On a technical level, the issue of overstocking of rangelands should be given priority. The following lessons were learned. (1) Project designs should be based on realistic assumptions as to what can be accomplished in a reasonable timeframe given national and local sociopolitical and administrative structures. In this regard, the Logical Framework Matrix should be effectively employed in both the project design and evaluation phases. (2) Long-term projects must be designed with sufficient flexibility to account for changes in the local political, economic, and social environment. (3) Missions with limited resources can incorporate NRM into development activities; USAID/L's experience provides valuable insights in this area. (4) Host government support, especially in the area of policy directives, is a prerequisite to developing the necessary long-term strategies to address NRM issues. (5) A favorable political climate is critical to the acceptance and performance of NRM projects. (6) Premature truncation of a project results in violation of the principles of sustainability, proper planning, and economic efficiency in project implementation.","Delivery order no. 7|Companion evaluation summary: PD-ABL-801","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","LAG-4200-I-00-3057-00","","4/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Natural resource management|Grazing land|Community participation|Environmental management|Range management","Lesotho","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABL299.pdf","3,740 KB","008926 - Cargill Technical Services, Inc.","","008409 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of a project to add population and family planning (FP) programs to CARE's assistance portfolio. Evaluation covers the period 5/91-6/95 against a PACD of 4/96. CARE has used project resources to develop an impressive Population Program and is the first major development agency to successfully integrate population and FP into its portfolio. Nearly triple the expected funds match has been raised.  The participatory process used by CARE should be of particular interest to many agencies.  A population policy statement has been approved, and the fledgling Population Unit created prior to the project is now fully functional, staffed by competent and dedicated people with a good balance of technical and geographical expertise. Originally, 16 field projects were planned for sub-Saharan Africa. However, following the USAID Office of Population's shift to a Big Country Strategy, CARE shifted its focus to fewer (10) but larger projects in more demographically significant countries, not just in Africa.  Eight projects are now functioning in Bangladesh, Dominican Republic, Nepal, Peru, Philippines, Togo, and Uganda, and another is about to be launched in Kenya; a project in Rwanda (once fully functional) is now suspended. Careful deployment of project-funded technical resources has enabled a number of other CARE Country Offices (Bolivia, Cambodia, Ethiopia, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Mali, India, Tanzania, West Bank-Gaza, and Zambia) to implement FP activities with non-project funding. Since the field projects are so new, it is difficult to evaluate the quality of the services they are providing.  Training appears to be strong, but IEC, logistics, monitoring, evaluation, and cost recovery need to be strengthened.  Also, the target for couple years of protection (CYP) has been achieved only in Bangladesh. CARE enjoys strong and positive relations with counterpart institutions, as well as with other population PVOs, and has attracted a range of donors.  However, the continued growth of CARE's population program will require additional technical expertise so that it can adequately support field offices.  Also, the demands of the field projects must be balanced with the demands of fundraising. The following lessons have been learned.  (1) Process is important. The manner in which something is done affects what gets done.  (2) The careful application of resources can result in significant increases in impact.  (3) Flexibility and responsiveness are especially valuable when implementing new programs.  (4) Matching fund requirements can have positive programmatic effects.  (5) Assume nothing; build in critical elements and do not count on ""things planned"" by others if crucial to your project's functioning.

"PACR of a project (4/85-7/94) to provide Food-for-Work (FFW) assistance in Bangladesh, with an orientation toward a development focus, rather than strictly as a relief activity. The project was implemented by CARE/Bangladesh. Originally intended for 5 years, the project was extended four times for an overall life of 9 years.  In all, the project:  (1) distributed almost 621 MTs of P.L. 480 wheat as direct in-kind wages directly benefiting 375,000 workers and their dependents annually; (2) generated 134.5 million of a targeted 240 million person-days of employment; (3) rehabilitated 96,882 km of rural roads and 9,910 small and large bridges/culverts (vs. respective targets of 86,400 and 10,553); (4) provided on-the-job training of small and medium-level construction contractors and architecture and engineering firms; and (5) provided training to 14,000 Government of Bangladesh (BDG) thana officials and union representatives in scheme preparation, implementation, monitoring, disaster management, and environmental orientation. The project also established a rigorous system to account for project resources and funded training of CARE staff in disaster preparedness and disaster response management. Despite these accomplishments, the project failed to fully realize its development potential.  Although project reviews demonstrated that properly sited and fully bridged rural roads can yield economic benefits to the rural poor, many FFW roads were poorly sited, poorly constructed, and lacked adequate or appropriate drainage structures, thereby creating water logging and disrupting fish migration patterns.  FFW earthen roads lacked a provision for maintenance, making them subject to seasonal monsoon rains.  These problems in part from the inability of the Relief Ministry, the implementing agency, to fully support the project's emphasis on development rather than relief.  But poor implementation by local officials was also to blame.  As a result of the latter, only 66% of the construction activities, which were initially funded by the BDG under a reimbursement scheme, were actually reimbursed by CARE. Problems included failure to comply with guidelines, work left incomplete, unauthorized expenditures, and unsatisfactory planning by thanas. The following lessons were learned.  (1) The project created environmental problems by constructing numerous roads on the Bangladesh deltaic flood plain where heavy monsoon rains cause frequent floods. Some farmers with land adjacent to the roads lost land and were  not compensated.  (2) It is difficult to produce durable earthen roads. Attaining the desired compaction is not cost-effective for large-scale rural road construction all over the country, but hand construction results in washouts during monsoons.  To address this problem, turfing and vegetation should be included in road rehabilitation.  (3) Wheat distribution yielded some relief, including temporary employment and nutritional and income benefit, to the rural poor.  However, even though the most vulnerable poor are women of child-bearing age, only 2% of workers in the earth moving activity were women. In addition, FFW work activities were conducted during the dry season, not during the pre-harvest months of July through October, when the need for food supplements is most acute.  (4) Maintenance and repair of infrastructure is a critical sustainability issue.  Under the Integrated Food for Development (IFFD) project, CARE plans to undertake action research pilots to find ways for local government to raise money to repair and maintain rural infrastructure.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","6/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Food for Work|Road construction|Bridge construction|Rural areas|Project sustainability|Beneficiary count","Bangladesh","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABL451.pdf","346 KB","008511 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of two cooperative agreements (1985-1995) with the National Academy of Sciences Committee on Population (NAS/CPOP) to support research on population issues of interest to the international community. The cooperative agreements (CAs) with NAS/CPOP have provided many dividends for USAID/POP.  Because of NAS/CPOP's prestige, its work has raised consciousness about population issues and has provided scientific legitimization for some key premises underlying USAID/POP activities in ways that no other CA could. Furthermore, USAID's support for NAS/POP is highly leveraged by contributions of other donors and because committee members volunteer their time.  Another of CPOP's unique strengths is its political neutrality. CPOP has implemented activities on topics of great interest to USAID and issued reports which are considered to be important scientific contributions to the population field.  These include large, interdisciplinary studies of population growth and economic development, family planning program effectiveness, the health consequences of contraceptive use and controlled fertility, contraceptive development, and population dynamics in sub-Saharan Africa.  A panel on reproductive health has just gotten underway.  NAS/CPOP's studies have had varying impacts on knowledge, depending primarily on the extent to they have been distributed to the public and the health policy and research communities.  ""Developing New Contraceptives"" has raised awareness of issues, most notably product liability, that had not previously been considered important.  ""Contraception and Reproduction"" improved the knowledge of the population community, and served as a springboard for many derivative products.  Every final report of the Demographic Health Surveys projects II and III includes a table of the percentage of women and births by risk group and corresponding neonatal, infant, and child mortality rates.  The report, ""Population Growth and Economic Development"" shows that the relationships between population growth and economic development are not as clear-cut as previously believed. ""Organizing for Effective Family Planning Programs"" is used as a reference by the Office of Population staff and was used to prepare the EVALUATION project. On the other hand, the CA has had some drawbacks.  The scientific rigor with which CPOP undertakes its studies means that it sometimes takes 18-36 months for results to be published, and that study conclusions are often not clear-cut and therefore not so useful for the study sponsor.  Because its members are volunteers, the Committee is more suited to the synthesis of existing research than to original research.  Data analysis may not make the best use of CPOP staff resources; other mechanisms, such as commissioning papers, consultancies, and subcontracts, could be used for this purpose. In addition, the smaller studies, especially expert meeting and workshop proceedings, are not as well-known as the larger ones, and there is little awareness of the availability of study reports despite the fact that they are official National Research Council (NRC) publications and have undergone standard review procedures.","Project title: Population technical assistance (POPTECH)","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","CCP-3024-C-00-3011-00","","6/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Population and demography|Information dissemination|Demographic research|Publications|Reports|Institutional aspects|Experts","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABL453.pdf","130 KB","008485 - Basic Health Management International (BHM)","","008234 - USAID.

"PACR of an OPG (5/89-12/94) to Save the Children Federation (SCF) and its Salvadoran affiliate Desarrollo Juvenil Comunitario (DCJ) to continue and expand its community-based integrated rural development (CBIRD) program in two new impact areas of La Union. Thanks in part to a sharper focus as recommended by the mid-term evaluation, the project proved quite successful, with TA and field activities reaching a total of 139 communities in 2 new and 4 follow-up impact areas with 15 types of subprojects in the program areas of health, education, sustainable agriculture, and potable water.  About 2,841 of a targeted 3,000 small farmers increased production and real income through TA in basic grain production, animal husbandry, soil conservation, and crop diversification.  A comprehensive primary health program reached 4,361 children (vs. a targeted 1,500) with interventions in oral rehydration therapy (ORT), family planning, breastfeeding, growth monitoring and vaccination, and environmental sanitation; key reasons for the success of this component were the efforts of the Center for Nutrition Education and Early Childhood Stimulation (CENET) and project training for traditional midwives.  About 4,520 vs. a targeted 3,440 additional children were given access to kindergarten and primary school in 142 schools in 83 communities, and 203 teachers were trained. Community development committees were formed in 104 rural communities; 39 of the committees have obtained legal status and developed long-term plans to continue working for their communities, and another 22 are in process of legalization.  The development of a self-confident and responsible attitude in these communities was perhaps the most lasting impact of SCF's work with them.  Other accomplishments included financial support for the El Carpintero-El Sauce potable water project, the first phase of which was completed in 5/94 and which will ultimately serve 15,000-20,000 people, and development of a system to monitor program impact on the basis of defined indicators.  Five case histories of project interventions are included in the report. Lessons learned include the following.  (1) Focus should be placed on doing a few things very well, rather than attempting a number of objectives which become difficult to monitor and evaluate.  (2) Impact indicators should be limited in number, easily understood, and perceived to be useful by the community. (3) Cooperation with other institutions helps to increase resources brought into communities (the potable water project being a case in point) and increases the likelihood of project sustainability, as does focusing on the process of community organization and leadership development rather than on physical projects.  (4) Highly technical projects will require specialized technical expertise:  apply the maxim ""do it right the first time!""","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","519-0364-G-00-9422-00","","3/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Integrated rural development|Child health care|Community development|Health|Education|Sustainable agriculture|Potable water","El Salvador","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABL456.pdf","2,775 KB","008540 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to increase fertility awareness and the use of natural family planning (NFP) methods and breastfeeding for child spacing in developing countries.  The project was implemented by Georgetown University's Institute for Reproductive Health (IRH) through its Breastfeeding/Maternal Child Health (BF/MCH) and Fertility Awareness/NFP (FA/NFP) Divisions.  Mid-term evaluation covers the period 9/91-6/95. Despite its small size and budget, the IRH has carried out an impressive amount of work with enthusiasm and competence.  Both BF/MCH and FA/NFP have conducted research, helped to effect policy change, introduced program changes and expansion, and provided training and information dissemination. BF/MCH has developed materials for policymakers, including the award-winning video and booklet ""Breastfeeding and Family Planning: Mutual Goals, Vital Decisions;"" brought about the rapid acceptance of the breastfeeding/lactational amenorrhea method of FP in several countries; participated in international policy fora; and supported policy work in many countries, including Kenya, the Philippines, and Zambia.  Research has focused on inclusion of the lactational amenorrhea method in FP service delivery programs and the introduction of complementary FP methods during breastfeeding.  The natural synergy that evolves from combining the breastfeeding/lactational amenorrheal method with maternal/child health, primary health care, FP, and nutritional programs clearly shows its contribution to public health. FA/NFP's activities have established a scientific base and a professionalism previously lacking in the field.  The Division has conducted research on the safety of NFP and on ways to make the method easier to use; developed IEC materials, including a multi-use slide presentation; and supported professional presentations and papers, including reports on biomedical and operations research and a management information system (MIS). FA/NFP is working on a simplified calendar method and a method for ovulation prediction which could lead to an inexpensive home test kit, and possibly reduce the number of days of abstinence required by the calendar method.  FA/NFP has developed an initiative which provides a long-needed fertility manual that, unique among sex education curricula, emphasizes individuals' awareness of their own fertility. Additionally, the FA/NFP has worked with the International Federation for Family Life Promotion (IFFLP) to develop a MIS with the promise of providing comparable information about NFP programs both within countries and worldwide.  To help overcome the skepticism and misunderstanding that NFP faces, the Division has updated its ""NFP:  A Good Option"" booklet, and developed a slide set entitled ""NFP: Expanding Options."" The evaluation concludes that the work of the two Divisions is not similar enough technically, in program goals, or in impact to benefit from being organizationally linked together.  Separate BF/MCH and FA/NFO contracts should be developed.  The FA/NFP Division has the credibility to work with cooperating agencies offering multi-method programs and enhance the quality of NFP services among these programs.  BF/MCH has succeeded in establishing lactational amenorrhea as an FP method, although acceptance of this method is still greater among the breastfeeding community than in the FP community.  Activities of the BF/MCH division should become aligned with other breastfeeding projects, but should have a distinct focus to assure integration into all appropriate population, health, and nutrition programs.  All USAID fp projects should include appropriate postpartum contraceptive management of the breastfeeding client as a standard of quality care.","Project title: Population technical assistance (POPTECH)","Special Evaluation","Documents","CCP-3024-C-00-3011-00","","6/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Family planning promotion programs|Behavioral methods (birth control)|Breastfeeding|Fertility|Prolonged lactation|Family planning research|Reproductive health","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABL465.pdf","168 KB","008485 - Basic Health Management International (BHM)","","008234 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of a project to promote private sector participation in economic reform in Uruguay.  No time-frame is specified. In general, the project achieved its objectives.  It was particularly successful in raising the Uruguayan business community's consciousness of the need to enhance company performance and reform economic policies to improve competitiveness.  In addition, there were changes made in production and management as a result of concepts acquired through the project, leading to increased sales, profits, and employment.  But the project's most enduring achievement was in the area of human resource development, through support for DESEM (the local Junior Achievement Program) which introduces high school students to business concepts and practices, and especially through faculty training at the Catholic University of Uruguay (UCUDAL).  The fact that UCUDAL now has a U.S.-trained cadre of business school professors with professional ties to U.S. colleagues provides Uruguay an educational base for preparing young people for careers in business. By contrast, the project's impact on legal, regulatory, and judicial (LRJ) reforms was minimal, although the new government continues to make significant efforts to improve the policy and LRJ climate for competitiveness.  The most positive result in this area was the grant to the Camara National de Comercio to produce a Blue Book which represents the private sector consensus on economic policy.  Preparation of the second Blue Book for the 1995 elections was accompanied by a more sophisticated and effective lobbying effort, although the private sector needs to be more aggressive and systematic in its efforts to influence public policy.  Also, the Centro de Estudios de la Realidad Economic y Social (CERES) was instrumental in producing a series of studies on leading economic reform issues such as labor law flexibility, internal debt forgiveness, and bankruptcy.  The findings of these studies are being considered by lawmakers. However, few linkages can be established between USAID interventions and specific LRJ reforms. Lessons learned are as follows.  (1) The decision to fund several small projects instead of one large intervention proved effective and enabled the project to reach a broader spectrum of the public and private sectors than would otherwise have been the case. Also, the decision to focus on improving the competitiveness of Uruguayan businesses proved a judicious and productive use of limited resources. (2) The fact that USAID/Uruguay gave grantees significant discretion, within clear general guidelines and specifically defined objectives, to shape their own programs, contributed to project success.  (3) Leaving behind a skilled human resource base represents the kind of permanence required for effective development.  (4) Success of the business development seminars hosted by Federacion Uruguaya de Centros Regionales de Experimentacion Agropecuaria (FUCREA) stemmed from its practice of working with organizations that stand the best chance of achieving success.  (5) In a related area, the provision of TA by the Union Creadores de Empresa (UCRE) was successful because of the intensity of the interventions, even though only 10 of 50 planned consultations were provided.  The lesson is that it is more effective to enhance a few companies well than to provide mediocre or limited assistance to many. (6) Without sound empirical analysis, it is difficult to make cogent arguments for specific policy positions.  (7) Results of the LRJ activity were meager for two reasons -- the allocation of relatively few resources to this activity and the lack of a private sector umbrella organization to interact with the government.  (8) Final, cumulative reports from grantees (not provided in this project) are an important tool in measuring impact and performance.  In a related area, the inability of the local contractor to design an adequate monitoring methodology indicates that the Mission, if unqualified for the task itself, should contract a U.S. expert to do the job.","Delivery order no. 20","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","PCE-0001-I-00-2051-00","","6/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Private sector|Business enterprises|Economic development|Economic reform|Market economy|Economic competition","Uruguay","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABL476.pdf","701 KB","000354 - Carana Corp.|001335 - Chemonics International Consulting Div.","","008621 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (8/86-3/92) to establish research networks for food grains in semiarid Africa.  The project was implemented by the Organization for African Unity (OAU), the International Institute for the Tropical Areas (IITA) and the International Crop Research Institute for the SemiArid Tropics (ICRISAT). The project has had a significant impact.  Agricultural research and production were strengthened through the development of the West Africa Sorghum Network, the East African Sorghum and Millet Network, the Maize Collaborative Research Network, and the Cowpea Collaborative Research Network, each of which were linked with IITA and ICRISAT. The Corn Network developed early maturing varieties (which made possible the expansion of corn production into dryer areas), as well as streak resistant variety SR 22; in addition, row planting was introduced.  The Cowpea Network developed low-input varieties and cultivars capable of wide adaptations and introduced tied-ridging to enable soil to retain a larger share of rainfall. The Sorghum/Millet Network introduced sorghum variety S35 into northern Cameroon and more recently into Chad, and identified sorghum varieties for industrial uses such as brewing.  The networks also developed new agricultural technologies, including an integrated Striga control package, as well as crop varieties with insect and drought tolerance. The project substantially built up institutional food grain research capacity in semiarid Africa.  Specifically, it played a major role in strengthening national agricultural research systems (NARS) by identifying production constraints for different crops, assigning research responsibilities to different NARS to overcome these constraints, funding the research, training scientists, and providing opportunities for networking. The project had a substantial economic impact in West Africa.  In Ghana, for example, the area in improved maize cultivars increased from 20% in 1982 to 55% in 1991.  The annual social benefits (i.e., lower food prices) from maize research ranged from $4.8 million to $84 million, for an estimated internal rate of return of 73%.  High social benefits -- ranging from $800,000 to $12.3 million over the period 1984-91 -- were also estimated for maintenance research on cowpeas in Mali and Burkina Faso. Overall, there is substantial evidence of diffusion of new cultivars and, to a lesser extent, of the improved agronomic techniques related to them. Diffusion of sorghum and millet was substantially less than that of new maize and cowpea varieties, possibly because breeding was overemphasized with sorghum and millet. The following lessons were learned.  (1) Through the development of networks, the project encouraged national researchers to work in multidisciplinary teams to solve agricultural production problems.  It promoted the exchange of scientific information, personnel, and new technology, and helped to dissolve linguistic barriers among anglophone, francophone, and lusophone countries.  (3) Project support enabled the NARS to improve their research outputs both qualitatively and quantitatively.  As a result, strong linkages were established between NARS scientists and farmers through extension workers, NGOs, and farmer organizations.  (4) Closer collaboration is needed between donors and project implementing organizations to ensure project continuity.  (5) Even after the conclusion of the project, the OAU maintained linkages with network activities currently being managed by IITA and ICRISAT, indicating that the OAU Coordination Link developed by the project continues to be important.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","7/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Regional development|National level|Institution building|Agricultural research|Networks|Institutional linkages|Research centers|Research collaboration|Varietal research|Plant breeding|Crop production|Agricultural technology|Sorghum|Millet|Maize|Cowpeas|Semiarid zone","Africa south of Sahara","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABL477.pdf","144 KB","000013 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to develop improved methods for evaluating the impact of family planning (FP) programs.  Mid-term evaluation covers the period 1991-94. The project has produced a body of work exceptional in both quality and quantity and has provided a more sound basis for evaluating FP program impact than was previously available. Accomplishments in the seven activity areas have been as follows. (1) An impressive volume of reference documents on evaluating FP programs and measuring program inputs, processes, outcomes, and impact has been produced.  These include an overall conceptual framework; a Handbook of Indicators for FP Program Evaluation; the EASEVAL Software and Manual for use in conducting demographic and health surveys; the Guide to Methods of FP Program Evaluation; the Typology of FP Programs; and Strategies for FP Program Evaluation. (2) Seven working groups have been formed in FP and one (with five subgroups) in reproductive health.  Exceptionally well organized, the groups (which brought together experts from a large number of organizations to develop a consensus on monitoring and evaluation indicators) have made valuable contributions to the Handbook of Indicators noted above. (3) The project has commissioned 24 studies, involving researchers from several renowned organizations, on important impact and methodological concerns, the vast majority addressing contraceptive delivery and uptake. Other studies have introduced methodologies from other fields into the area of FP, including Geographic Information Systems, and palmtop computer-based rapid assessments.  For acceptable reasons, no studies on the relation between FP and fertility have been undertaken. (4) The TA component has concentrated on six focal countries (Brazil, India, Nigeria, Morocco, Peru, and Tanzania), providing three main types of assistance:  planning evaluation designs in four focal countries and Ghana; providing special analysis for USAID missions or host-country institutions in two focal countries and Honduras and Kenya; and helping implement a population sector evaluation plan in four focal countries. All countries receiving assistance have given it high marks, and work in Morocco and Tanzania has provided good models of TA in evaluation. Project TA, which has greatly exceeded the planned level of effort, has dovetailed well with USAID's mandate to develop monitoring and evaluation systems (PRISM). (5) Training has included both U.S.-based and field-based workshops, which have been extremely well received.  U.S. training has covered methods for impact evaluation of FP programs, and EASEVAL software. Overseas workshops have included regional workshops in Guatemala and at the East-West Population Center, and two workshops in Morocco, the latter being the only training effort aimed at enhancing the institutional capacity of primary target audiences. (6) The dissemination component, a key project element, has published the reference documents and made available, through its Working Paper Series, minutes from meetings of working groups, papers from the impact and methodological studies, and selected documents on TA and training efforts. Unfortunately, funding for this component underestimated the need for dissemination, though this has not proven to be a major problem so far. (7) Both senior and junior fellows programs have been established. The senior program brought together two senior researchers, one from India and one from Nigeria, to help design evaluation tools.  The junior program has already brought two fellows, one from Nigeria and one from Uganda, and will bring two more from Morocco.  Both programs have proven useful.","Project title: Health technical services (HTS)","Special Evaluation","Documents","HRN-5974-C-00-3001-00|HRN-C-00-93-00001-00","","1/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Family planning|Development program evaluation|Evaluation methodology|Impact assessment","Morocco|Africa south of Sahara|Tanzania","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABL472.pdf","5,598 KB","003366 - TvT Associates","","008234 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (7/86-8/94) to strengthen the service delivery and management capability of Guatemalan cooperatives.  The project was implemented by the National Federation of Savings and Loan Cooperatives (FENACOAC) and the World Council of Credit Unions (WOCCU). By any measure, the project was a success.  It either met or exceeded each of its targets, leaving behind a network of financially viable and well-managed credit unions and agricultural cooperatives.  Four federations -- FENACOAC, the Coffee Federation of Alta Verapaz (FEDECOVERA), the Artisans Cooperative Federation (ARTEXCO), and the Federation of Agricultural Cooperatives (FEDECOAG) -- along with 34 primary cooperatives established policies and membership bases, and obtained the capital needed for long-term viability. A particular beneficiary of the project was the national credit union movement, represented by FENACOAC and its affiliates.  The Federation is now one of the strongest in Latin America.  Credit unions have eliminated their dependence on external capital, are mobilizing significant local savings, lending on the basis of ability to repay, controlling delinquency, and planning for the future.  Credit unions now provide a wide array of competitively priced financial services to rural communities.  Non-credit union organizations have obtained similar but less dramatic results; although smaller in total membership and slower to develop, they have adopted an entrepreneurial approach to member services, greatly improved their financial condition, and improved their ability to provide effective and competitively priced services to their members.  Business volume has increased and capital is growing. To ensure the sustainability of project efforts, more than $4 million in income generated from the original stabilization fund and the interest earned thereon has been allocated to FENACOAC (to fund 3 years of follow-on TA from WOCCU), to ARTEXCO (for the purchase of a commercial dye facility), and to the agricultural credit funds of FEDECOVERA, FEDECOAG, Renacimiento 59 Coffee Cooperative, and the Jalapa Coffee Cooperative Association. The project's success is attributed to:  (1) clearly defined objectives, policies, and operating principles; (2) the direct daily involvement of the A.I.D. project manager, which facilitated coordination with the Mission and compliance with project norms and procedures; (3) excellent project direction by a person with the interpersonal skills, discipline, and technical knowledge to make difficult decisions and work with a wide range of project staff; (4) the use of pilot programs to introduce new concepts aimed at winning acceptance of new techniques; (5) the establishment of monitoring and control systems that allowed project staff to rapidly respond to problems in implementing organizations; (6) consistent application of project norms to all organizations involved in the project, creating greater discipline among project beneficiaries; and (7) successful development of a fee-for-services mentality among project staff and implementing institutions to break prior dependence on free donor resources. The following lessons were learned.  (1) The original project design was too expansive for the funds and technical capacity that were available.  (2) Relationships with project beneficiaries and implementing organizations should be as direct as possible to avoid delays in implementation.  Originally, the project provided all assistance through cooperative federations, which created bureaucratic problems and delays.  (3) Before a project expansion is approved, future funding should be relatively secure. In this project, the inclusion of agricultural export organizations in 1990 resulted in the expenditure of much time and resources that could have been better spent on other activities, especially since these organizations were later excluded from the project due to budget cuts.  (4) Low salary levels in the cooperatives led to rotation of personnel and the training of many cooperative staff who have now left the cooperative system.  To avoid a waste of training opportunities, the project should have tried to address the issue of staff rotation.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","6/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Institution building|Cooperatives|Agricultural cooperatives|Project sustainability|Management development|Credit unions|Rural areas","Guatemala","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABL480.pdf","247 KB","008550 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (1988-12/93), the third in a decade-long agricultural development effort, to increase sustainable production by small and medium-sized farmers in the Guatemalan highlands. Results were mixed.  There are indications that the  project increased crop production and value for two-thirds of the farmers, and that it increased the use of soil conservation practices and pesticides. Also, there were some instances of increased capacity to deliver coordinated government services to farmers.  However, improvements in the Ministry of Agriculture's (MAGA's) management and decisionmaking capacities seems to have been limited.  In addition, farmers at upper watershed elevations have experienced shortages of water due to poor irrigation system design, escalating costs of electricity for pumping, and lack of knowledge of and money for maintenance.  In fact, about one-third of the farmers, citing irrigation installation and electricity costs as well as the failure to find markets for their crops, felt their situations had become worse for participating in the project. Specifically, the project constructed 275 small-scale irrigation systems; developed 150 ha of community forests and established integrated management programs in 10 watersheds; established 26 farmers' markets, opened channels for produce exports, and created a market information service; and created a public-private applied agricultural research fund in GEXPRONT which funded 14 research projects that benefited participating farmers and was more successful in the area of research than public agencies. The national agricultural bank (BANDESA) made credit available for irrigation, agricultural production, and marketing.  Other accomplishments included the formation of 88 forestry management groups (with women as full members in 33 of them), and a joint public/private sector integrated pesticide management program. However, although 70% farmers reported the use of gloves when applying pesticides, most farmers do not take enough precautions when using pesticides. The following lessons were learned.  (1) Agricultural development is a long-term venture, as this three-project program proves. However, funding and implementation gaps between the three projects caused the program to lose momentum at times.  (2) Since the first two projects had created a successful administrative template, there was no need to create a new bureaucracy for this project; in fact, the project administrative unit (PDA-UAP) became a politicized bureaucracy apart from MAGA that generated hard feelings concerning cashflow and delegation of responsibility.  (3) The project's size and geographical reach became too extensive; the first two projects were considered successful partially because they were geographically limited. (4) Correct planning and engineering are mandatory.  Frequent errors in irrigation system design constrained the project.  (5) Interagency coordination was relatively easy to accomplish at the field level, but seemed to break down at the intermediate administrative levels, generally due to political influences and a lack of clear definitions of functions and resource allocation. (6) Pesticide management can be improved by requiring research institutions to provide extension materials and by enforcing pesticide laws and statutes.  (7) Planning by objectives is a valid means of assuring cooperation between agencies. (8) Micro-farm enterprises involved in producing nontraditional export commodities require strong associations and cooperatives if they are to enter international markets.  (9) Local agricultural technicians need to be trained in marketing, credit procedures, and farmer group organization.  (10) Privatized agricultural TA appeared to be more successful than MAGA's, evidently because technicians depended on farm profits for their own incomes, compared with a competitive vacuum in the public sector; care must be taken to balance assistance to private and public sector extension agents to avoid brain drain from the public sector and keep jealousies to a minimum.  (11) USAID officials should closely review initial phases of a project, especially survey designs, to ensure that projects do not become politicized.  (12) The project was overevaluated and overmonitored.  It would have been better served by fewer but more scientifically based surveys geared to solving farmers' practical problems.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","6/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Farmers|Upland cropping|Small farms|Agricultural production|Privatization|Agricultural extension","Guatemala","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABL481.pdf","141 KB","008550 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of a project (1990-94) to establish a mechanism to increase trade and investment in the Philippines through promotional services and assistance, training and TA, and policy analysis and reform.  The private sector Philippine Exporters Foundation (PHILEXPORT) was the implementing agency. The project substantially met the output and purpose targets set by the revised logframe.  Specifically, it:  (1) helped develop local capabilities for managing donor-assisted trade and investment promotion (T&IP) projects; (2) facilitated, through its policy analysis and advocacy efforts, the development of PHILEXPORT as the advocate of exporters in the country; (3) engaged the Project Implementation Committee effectively and productively; and (4) effectively utilized market mechanisms in the delivery of T&IP services.  It also introduced the innovative concept of ""fee for service"" into its trade brokerage and computerized trade information service (CTIS) and the concepts of ""cost sharing"" and ""project reflow"" into its T&IP and training and TA components. There were some shortcomings, however.  (1) An initial assessment of the real needs of the project areas could have strengthened the sectoral priorities and roles of participating organizations. Such studies should be carried out prior to implementation as opposed to introducing changes in focus midway through implementation.  (2) Institution-building should have been an integral part of project implementation; for example, capacity-building programs for project proponents could have enhanced their participation and absorptive capacity.  (3) An effective monitoring and evaluation system such as was developed for the trade brokerage component could have been implemented for the training and TA component, and possibly also for the T&IP component. (4) The project was very selective in its outreach and communication efforts, which were addressed only to the project's focus groups/areas; outreach efforts were not very effective in Davao. The following are among the lessons learned.  (1) Physical integration of the project management and project grantee would have enhanced interaction and possibly the integration of the activities of both parties.  (2) The project had several substantial T&IP elements, including the innovative trade brokerage component and the CTIS. Implementing some of these as separate projects could have focused resources more efficiently and increased the success rate of these elements, though it would have caused bureaucratic complications for USAID.  (3) The choice of a private sector organization as the implementing entity freed the project from having to contend with the rules and regulations guiding the operations of government agencies. (4) The project tapped and networked with local resources for project implementation, contributing to the development of local expertise and competencies in T&IP project management.  (5) The Policy Research and Advocacy Facility (PRAF) gave PHILEXPORT adequate elbow room to undertake policy research and advocacy activities.  Project grantees are usually more enthusiastic when given the flexibility to undertake activities on their own.  (6) Close coordination among participating organizations (including government entities) was a critical factor in project implementation.  (7) Industry associations must cover increasing cost-share and remit decreasing project reflows, leading eventually to full cost-recovery or fee-for-service.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","2/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Private sector|International trade|Exports|Investment promotion|Market economy","Philippines","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABL482.pdf","3,364 KB","007320 - SGV & Co.","","008592 - USAID.

"Evaluates the impact of two participant training projects in Ecuador: the completed Andean Peace Scholarship Program (APSP) (1987-9/93), and the ongoing Ecuador Development Scholarship Program (EDSP), which began in 1991.  The evaluation is based in part on survey interviews with 54 APSP and 94 EDSP trainees and on focus group interviews with trainees grouped by field of study. The final evaluation of APSP showed that over 75% of trainees are currently working in their original place of employment, 85% are successfully using new skills and knowledge, and 93% are using project design course work for international development. Some participants moved into high visibility positions, increasing the extent to which they can share their knowledge (multiplier effect) and influence business and government policy. Additionally, program trainees:  (1) received good orientation and felt prepared for U.S. training, but also needed more information about U.S. academic life in general and their particular course of study; (2) found the training met their high academic level and was transferable to their own Ecuadoran sector, with the exception of the Spanish language program at the University of New Mexico, which was not sufficiently rigorous and did not improve trainees' English language skills; and (3) in some instances, could not complete their degrees because all had to return to Ecuador by the PACD. By participating actively in the Experience America program, trainees established contacts with U.S. counterparts and expanded their world view and ability to operate as change agents upon their return.  Results of the follow-on program were mixed.  On the positive side, the in-country contractor provided trainees with an excellent re-entry seminar and excellent short courses and seminars leading to the legal establishment of the Alumni Association as a non-profit organization; and returnees have written four books related to agriculture, health, environment, and education issues in Ecuador, which are used in schools and development projects across the country.  On the negative side, sources of information through which trainees can continue to build their skills and knowledge are limited in Ecuador; given USAID's substantial investment in training these outstanding professionals, it would be a mistake not to provide the relatively small outlays needed to provide access to technical publications and the Internet. Also on the debit side, the Alumni Association is not yet fully operational; membership is extremely heterogeneous and trainees are dispersed throughout the country. The mid-term evaluation of the EDSP program reveals that over 50% of the program participants are women (in excess of the 40% target), while the majority are disadvantaged (82%).  Short-term courses have been well-designed (except for those aimed at women's agricultural leaders and at natural resource managers) and have provided trainees with skills which they have used immediately upon return.  The innovative use of in-country counterpart organizations to recruit candidates, design training, and contribute to follow-on has proven effective and has helped develop the organizations institutionally, while expanding USAID's outreach into the community.  In addition, the majority of U.S. training institutions have used state-of-the art training programs geared to the needs of Ecuadoran students.  Trainees have been very satisfied with follow-on courses, although they have requested that the courses be scheduled more frequently. All in all, the program at its mid-point is on target for achieving its goals:  the average employment rate for returnees is 87%, and 91% of those employed are employed in their field of training.  Most trainees (93%) are applying new skills in the workplace, some 78% have increased their job responsibilities, over 90% believe they have increased their leadership capacity, and over 70% remain in touch with the United States through professional journals. Finally, the program has contributed to trainees' understanding of democratic institutions and economic growth. For example, the small farmers' association group ignited a spirit of small business development among trainees, and, together with a follow-on training program in marketing, resulted in increased production and sales for the farmers.  In a similar vein, the courses for community leaders (health supervisors, auxiliary nurses, natural resource managers, and Amazon community leaders) focused in-depth on community involvement as a foundation for democratic society.  It is recommended that other projects complement the training of grassroots and disadvantaged leaders funded under this project by training policymakers and operational managers in the same sectors.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","518-0091-C-00-1122-00","","4/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Participants|Scholarships|Education for development|Democracy|Leadership training|Disadvantaged groups|Grassroots development|Beneficiary count","Ecuador","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABL566.pdf","17,620 KB","012322 - Aguirre International|007696 - World Learning, Inc.","","000114 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of a project (1989-11/94) to increase contraceptive prevalence in Honduras, principally through assistance to the Honduran Family Planning Association (ASHONPLAFA), the Honduran affiliate of the International Planned Parenthood Federation. The project was largely successful.  Despite strong criticism from the Catholic Church, ASHONPLAFA provided family planning services at 1,963 rural and urban distribution points, and medical services at 6 ASHONPLAFA clinics and 7 private clinics in all geographic areas of the country.  Additionally, through a contract with one of Honduras' largest pharmaceutical distributors, it provided contraceptives to over 600 pharmacies and stores throughout the country.  In all, ASHONPLAFA achieved 82.5% of the project's couple years of protection (CYP) targets, with the Medical Clinical Program achieving 83.8% of target, the Community Services Program 81.3%, and the Social Marketing Program 78.2%.  Also, CYP in 1993 was 19% higher than it was in 1991. ASHONPLAFA devoted considerable effort to cost recovery and income generation:  it has steadily increased prices, significantly increased client volume and revenues, and improved the execution of its budget. The level of self-sufficiency is projected to be 27% in 1994, up from 21% in 1990.  Levels of self-sufficiency increased significantly in five of the six regional offices, though falling in Tegucigalpa, the largest office.  Continuing institutional needs include cost control, pricing strategies based on costs and a sliding fee scale, and generation of income in addition to program service charges. While some authority has been transferred from the central office to the regional offices, several problems still exist.  The financial accounting and other management information systems (MIS) were not in use in all regions, did not provide cost accounting information, and did not provide regional and mid-level staff members with data about the programs so that corrective measures could be taken.  Clinic underutilization is also a problem, and quality of medical attention requires additional attention. Lessons learned include the following.  (1) When a project has potentially conflicting objectives (expanding geographic coverage and cost-recovery), clear guidance must be given as to which objective should receive greater emphasis.  (2) Changing the structure and management policies of an institution is a long process that requires clear, agreed-upon steps as well as understanding and patience on the parts of the members of the organization and USAID.  (3) Donors and grantees should establish agreed-upon plans and objectives for shifting financial responsibility to the grantee.  (4) To measure impact, population-based data is necessary.  USAID should attempt to carry out demographic and health surveys in time frames which would support bilateral population projects.","Project title: Population technical assistance (POPTECH)","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","CCP-3024-Q-00-3012-00","","7/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Contraceptive prevalence|Family planning promotion programs|Family planning services","Honduras","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABL567.pdf","213 KB","008485 - Basic Health Management International (BHM)|001131 - The Futures Group International, Inc.

"Evaluates project to strengthen the management supervisory skills of the Directorate of Family Health (DSF) in Burkina Faso.  The project is being implemented by Management Sciences for Health (MSH).  Evaluation covers the period 1992-95. Despite constraints related to organizational changes, personnel turnover, lack of resources, weak bureaucratic structures, and confusion about the central level's role in project implementation, the project can be declared a success.  It has introduced a new philosophy of supervision free of previous notions of control and inspection, as well as new supervisory tools, which supervisors praise as a tangible set of instruments that have given them responsibility for program improvement and resulted in better staff relations. Through the multiplier effect, the project has expanded beyond the family planning and maternal and child health sector into other health activities and geographic areas in Burkina Faso.  As a result of the project's efforts, supervisors seem to be giving more attention to the quality of the services provided to clients than they did before the project.  There seem to be no cultural obstacles to the acceptance of new perspectives on supervision and the use of new supervisory tools. Those involved in the project are extremely happy with the TA provided, although there has been some criticism in regard to workshops.  Finally, the Government of Burkina Faso is committed to a population policy and National Family Planning Program, indicated in part by its intention to increase the contraceptive prevalence rate to 60% by 2005 and then to reduce fertility by 10% every 5 years, beginning in 1995.  The demand for family planning services in the country is strong. Two important lessons were learned from the project.  (1) There is a clear need for a local coordinator for this project.  The project's organizational framework made efficient communication between DSF and MSH difficult, especially in light of the management burdens caused by the project's extension in time and geographic area.  The presence of a local coordinator from the outset would have made this extension easier to manage.  In addition, compared to other projects administered by the DSF, this one is very small, and no one at the central level could spare the attention the project required.  (2) The issue of project extension should be better addressed during project design and during the first phase of implementation, particularly in regard to criteria to justify extension, how the strengths and weaknesses of the project's first phase might be used to improve its performance during the second, and how persons involved in the project's first phase can also be integrated into the second.","Task order no.

"Final evaluation of a project to strengthen the capacity of the Center for Applied Research on Population and Development (CERPOD) to promote the development of population policy in Sahel.  The evaluation covers the period 1988-6/95, against a PACD of 9/97. Although CERPOD is currently in the midst of transition and turmoil (due to a physical relocation and the restructuring of its parent organization, the Interstate Committee for the Fight Against Drought in the Sahel -- CILSS), its work continues with a high level of competence and commitment by an extraordinary staff.  Through a series of TA contracts, collaborations, and appendices, CERPOD has improved its internal management and provided extensive and varied services in the Sahel and beyond. With respect to internal management, CERPOD has adopted an accounting system that is a model for CILSS and is well-respected by USAID, introduced time cards, and improved accountability for and timing of the procurement of commodities; the indirect cost rate has been determined, the technology for doing so has been transferred to CERPOD staff, and the rate is being applied with good results to all new projects. Additionally, CERPOD has adopted strategic planning techniques, and adopted a new organizational structure.  Although CERPOD has been provided with evaluation skills training, the training has not yet been applied.  CERPOD has been introduced to desktop publishing which it has used to some extent. However, CERPOD still needs leadership skills training and management TA, the organization's researchers and administrators are overburdened, administrative procedures remain cumbersome, and cost accounting has only been partially implemented.  Also, there is a need for follow-up to plans for the development of an endowment fund, USAID Missions in Africa need to be made more aware of CERPOD, and the computerized modular bidding profile has not been developed.  CERPOD has not implemented its information policy, the number of publications produced by CERPOD has diminished in the last few years, and evaluation techniques are not in place. In terms of service provision, CERPOD has accomplished the following. (1) Most of the demographic/population-related research and analysis called for in the project paper has been completed to varying degrees, although there has been concern about allocating work to undertrained staff because fully trained staff are overburdened.  (2) Many training programs have been provided and well-received.  However, virtually all of trainees hold government positions, and many have subsequently shifted to new positions unrelated to training received.  (3) CERPOD provides TA in data collection and processing and analysis, and training in West Africa through conferences, seminars, workshops, and to individual government agencies.  While the technical work has been excellent, follow-up has been inadequate.  (4) Information dissemination to policy makers, planners, and other individuals has been CERPOD's weakest activity, with research studies and analytic papers going unpublished and undisseminated, and journals diminishing in frequency of publication over the last 5 years.  Visits to Burkina Faso, Niger, and Senegal revealed that while government officials and staff of agencies who knew CERPOD found its work useful, most were not aware of the range of CERPOD's services.  These Sahelian officials have a great deal of pride in CERPOD as a Sahelian organization and would like very much for it to become the executing agency for large donor projects.","French ed.: PD-ABR-779|Project title: Population technical assistance (POPTECH)","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","CCP-3024-C-00-3011-00","","6/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Institution building|Regional development|Management development|Demographic data collection|Demographic analysis|Population policy|Demographic research","Sahel","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABL594.pdf","184 KB","010110 - BHM International, Inc.|001131 - The Futures Group International, Inc.

"Final evaluation of a project component (1990-94) to develop a wholesale price marketing information system (MIS) within the Marketing Information Branch (MIB) of the Kenyan Ministry of Agriculture. That USAID was able to convince the Government of Kenya (GOK) to accept the concept of a MIS is a considerable achievement given that many GOK decisionmakers do not believe that price information belongs to the public.  Unfortunately, in accordance with the Mission's sector focus, the MIS developed under this project concentrated on the maize and bean market, which represents only a portion of the sector.  The creation of a MIS covering the entire sector would have contributed significantly to the program's overall goal and would have created a tool for measuring the impact of maize market liberalization when it occurred in 12/93.  In addition, because of a period of drought and a cutoff in donor funding due to the perceived reluctance of the GOK to more quickly implement political and economic reforms, most of the GOK shilling funds earmarked for the MIS were not available. While the anticipated improvement in the MIB's policy analysis capability did not take place (this was not part of MIB's remit, nor should it have been), the project did succeed in building the capacity of MIB headquarters to collect, edit, and prepare table presentations of price information, and for press and radio dissemination.  However, there were never sufficient funds available to MIB to fully achieve its price dissemination objectives; the channels of communication -- press, radio, and the Agricultural Information Center -- all operate on a commercial basis.  Nonetheless, the MIB did produce a Monthly Market Bulletin which was circulated and found ready acceptance among government and donors.  The project was unable to ensure implementation of a uniform price collection methodology because the design of a MIS operations manual for training District Marketing Officers and enumerators was delayed until it was too late to be of significance. The funds allocated to the MIB are so limited that it is unable to sustain the tasks of which it is capable, and which had begun to become appreciated by producers, traders, donors, and GOK authorities (the latter of whom, without exception, have expressed their support for the MIS).  Specifically, MIB needs assistance, including training, continuous upgrading of the database, and support for market price dissemination.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","LAG-4200-I-06-3057-00","","3/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural product marketing|Institution building|Management information systems|Government departments","Kenya","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABL597.pdf","4,271 KB","008926 - Cargill Technical Services, Inc.","","008565 - USAID.

"Evaluates a project to support democratic initiatives in Mozambique. Midterm evaluation covers the period 9/91-3/95. Progress in the project's four components is as follows.  Outputs of the election component, by far the project's most important, are nearly complete.  End-of-Project Status (EOPS) was achieved with the holding of the October 1994 multiparty elections, which saw a turnout of some 87% of registered voters.  However, midterm sustainability of the electoral process is in doubt. Progress has been far less in the other three components.  None of the outputs under the Judicial Sector Strengthening outputs, with the exception of the legal sector assessment, have been completed and are unlikely to be completed.  EOPS is unlikely to be completed before 12/31/96.  Outputs in both the Decentralization/Traditional Authority and the Civil Society components are less than 10% completed and are unlikely to be completed by the PACD; further, although EOPS are being achieved in these components, it is not as a result of project activities. In terms of the election component, the project has been a resounding success.  Multi-party elections have led to the installation of a democratically elected government, thereby effecting the transition from war to peace and establishing a foundation for a stable democratic society.  However, the historical power asymmetries which define much of the past 400 years are still in place, particularly in relation to civil society and local government.  The slow progress of the other three components is not considered particularly unusual within the larger framework of the Mission's Transition Program.  In fact, it is only with the elections safely behind that these other more developmental components have a realistic chance of being implemented; that elections -- particularly first-time elections --  always dominate the agenda in democratization projects, should be kept in mind in designing future such projects. Other lessons learned are as follows.  (1) First-time elections in countries emerging from war indicate a transition from war to peace much more than they do a transition from authoritarian to democratic rule. Hence, assistance provided in the domain of democracy and governance is unlikely to lead to the full achievement of objectives in these areas. (2) In a transition situation, there is likely to be a convergence of foreign policy and development assistance, leading to the achievement of both. As economic and political stabilization are achieved, the two will begin to diverge, as the longer-term and strategic nature of development assistance begins to conflict (at the implementation, not at the policy level), with the short-term and tactical needs of foreign policy.  (3) Decisions to use an intermediary to channel and manage development assistance on behalf of USAID to one or more implementing agents should be based primarily on programmatic needs, not on the administrative ease that this procedure may afford overstretched bureaucracies.  (4) Democratic development in general and democracy and governance programs in particular are risky undertakings and must be based on the assumption that failure is as likely an outcome as success.  In the case of Mozambique, the benefits are worth the inherent risks.","Delivery order no. 23|Project title: Implementing policy change (IPC)","Special Evaluation","Documents","AEP-5451-I-00-2049-00","","6/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Democratization|Political development|Government reform|Self government|Decentralization|Elections|Civil society|Judicial reform|Private voluntary organizations|Indigenous private voluntary organizations|War recovery","Mozambique","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABL598.pdf","5,132 KB","003970 - Management Systems International, Inc.

"Prepared as part of the close-out activities of the Financial and Private Enterprise (FAPE) Support Project in The Gambia, this study evaluates the impact of donor assistance on the country's economy since the inception of the Economic Recovery Program (ERP) in 1985. Individual sections treat:  (1) the reforms enacted under the ERP; (2) the economic environment in which the ERP was enacted, along with the sequencing and rightness of the reforms; (3) the nature, role, and implementation of USAID and other donor conditionalities, together with the respective roles played by the government and donors in designing and implementing the reforms; (4) the relation of the reforms to the political decisionmaking process; (5) the impact of donor assistance on Gambian development, along with the difficulty of sustaining the reforms in light of the suspension of donor assistance as a result of the 1994 military coup; and (6) the importance of including stakeholders in the design of any future assistance projects. The study concludes that donor assistance has played a very important role in the success of the Gambian ERP.  It has helped to stabilize the economy, shore up international reserves, restore some sense of pride in all Gambians, and bridge the investment-savings, foreign exchange, and technological gaps. Although the comprehensive complementary institutional reforms were not undertaken in tandem with the structural economic reforms, some progress has been made in training Gambians in overseas institutions and TA is helping to develop local capacity.  The inexperience of Gambian economists and technicians during negotiations has caused some problems with conditionalities and the capacity to implement so many reforms in so short a time; nonetheless, the experience gained has been valuable.  In the medium term, as the country begins to diversify its economy, foreign aid will become even more critical in institutional and capacity building.  Donor assistance will be crucial in improving the legal and regulatory framework, and the government will have to show greater determination in rooting out corruption.  To facilitate program implementation, the government should be encouraged to continue with the collaborative and interactive approach of preparing projects and should be allowed to play a more decisive role in the design of conditionalities and sequencing.  The recommendations and conclusions reached should form the basis of negotiations and donor support to the country.

"Evaluates cooperative agreement with Pathfinder International (PI) for a project to increase access to and the cost-effectiveness of family planning (FP) services and provide related capacity-building assistance in a set of key developing countries.  Midterm evaluation covers the period 9/92-3/95. PI has done very well in expanding the availability of FP services. Specifically, PI has: (1) supported 71 subprojects in 18 countries, 2/3 of which are service delivery projects; (2) transferred 65% of USAID funds to host-country institutions, mostly NGOs, while allocating just 30% for administrative overhead; (3) supported improvements in the quality of care through provider training and expansions in the method mix; and (4) developed strong administrative and financial systems for processing proposals, channeling and accounting for funds, and tracking program activities. PI is on track in meeting quantitative targets for Couple Years of Protection (CYPs).  When the Service Delivery Expansion Support Program (SDES) activities are included, PI has far exceeded most original targets.  In 27 months, PI has distributed 1.5 million of a targeted 4.3 CYPs, trained 12,278 of a targeted 30,000 individuals, and disseminated FP information to 3.3 million of a targeted 6.7 million persons.  New users reached through the project are estimated at 3.5 million. The quality of care is generally good in PI-supported subprojects. Providers are well-trained, and facilities are typically clean and properly maintained.  However, despite the availability of medical services expertise at PI headquarters, little TA has been provided to subprojects in the areas of quality medical care, method choice, client-provider interactions, and client satisfaction. It is difficult to assess PI's success in achieving the goals of improved sustainability, institutional strengthening, and cost-efficiency/effectiveness of developing country FP institutions. While PI reports supporting 19 institutions, countries differ greatly in their progress and PI's contributions are difficult to track.  New indicators are needed which relate to all of the goals of the cooperative agreement. There are also some management problems.  (1) Although the project's decentralized structure has streamlined decisionmaking and improved communications, it has not been balanced by sufficient oversight and support of the PI regional offices by PI headquarters.  (2) While PI has a comprehensive financial management system in place, the system's extensive documentation and reporting requirements place too much emphasis on financial management, detracting from program content.  (3) Better communications between PI and USAID are needed.  Some USAID staff are not well-informed about PI's activities. In sum, PI's performance has been good overall, though there are important weaknesses in urgent need of attention.  Some of these weaknesses are a result of PI's efforts to be responsive to USAID and/or reflect the difficulties inherent in working in a bureaucratic context. Despite these weaknesses, there is a clear and continuing need for a general, multipurpose FP service delivery project like the present cooperative agreement.","Project title: Population technical assistance (POPTECH)","Special Evaluation","Documents","CCP-3024-C-00-3011-00","","7/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Family planning|Family planning services|Institution building|Private voluntary organizations","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABL662.pdf","1,473 KB","008485 - Basic Health Management International (BHM)|001131 - The Futures Group International, Inc.

"Final evaluation of a project (1985-6/95) to provide long- and short-term training to public and private sector Bolivian personnel who occupy or might in the future occupy policy level and leadership positions. The project exceeded its targets; 633 vs. a targeted 443 persons were trained, of whom 69% were men and 31% (vs. a targeted 40%) women.  A total of 172 persons received short-term training, 63 long-term training, 60 democracy awareness training, and 338 local currency-funded in-country training.  Long-term training covered primarily business, economics, finance, and public administration (83%), and secondarily agriculture and environmental studies (10%) and social science (7%). Short-term training covered business, economics, finance, and administration (14%); physical science (38%); and social science (43%). In-country training in business administration was administered by the Instituto de Desarrollo Empresarial y de Administracion (IDEA). Trainees hold positions in regional, national, and local government as executives and technical specialists.  An impressively high percentage of trainees ranked project training as ""useful"" or ""very useful.""  In addition, 82% of long-term, 75% of short-term, and 77% of in-country trainees stated that they have been able to use training in their job.  Trainees are replicating their training in a number of formal settings, from workplaces to seminars, and in informal settings, including professional networks for economic and democratic reform. Five case studies of alumni and their contributions to Bolivia are included in the report. The following lessons were learned.  (1) Human resource development projects should not be a separate sectoral activity but a development tool which supports the efforts of the technical offices and are part of a Mission-wide training strategy.  (2) One of the difficulties in measuring training outcomes is that the PRISM system is a top-down system which focuses on strategic objectives and program outcome levels. Although very useful for focusing on results, the measurable indicators are often at the macro- rather than the activity level (where training impacts need to be measured).  It is recommended that USAID/B develop a Mission-wide strategy and implementation system for measuring the contributions of trainees and assessing their links to program outcomes. A central data base on trainees and their impacts would be an essential adjunct of any Mission-wide training strategy.  (3) A more equitable distribution by sex and by region should be promoted through new recruitment and selection strategies, quotas, and targets that have been updated according to Bolivia's most recent census.  (4) Follow-on training, which has been demonstrated by studies to enhance training effectiveness, should be included as an integral part of training design and implementation.  (5) USAID/B should increase the efficiency and effectiveness of overall training resources by promoting the multiplier effects, e.g., by organizing region-wide training groups.","Delivery order no. 16|Companion evaluation summary: PD-ABM-291|Project title: Human and educational resources network support|(HERNS)","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","FAO-0071-I-00-3070-00|FAO-I-00-93-00070-00","","6/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Education for development|Technical training|Management education|Leadership training|Participants","Bolivia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABL678.pdf","4,072 KB","012322 - Aguirre International","","008515 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of a project (8/92-8/95) to strengthen fledgling environmental NGOs to become self-sustaining advocates for natural resource management in El Salvador. Originally designed to work only with ""subgrant NGOs"" (those receiving institutional strengthening funds along with TA and training), the project was expanded to include ""collaborator NGOs"" who did not qualify for a subgrant, but asked to participate in the training process anyway.  Most of the latter have taken advantage of the opportunity, and some now have higher female representation on boards of directors, use logframes, and have improved project administration and planning skills. The requirement that subgrant NGOs produce strategic and annual planning documents in order to receive their subgrants has given NGOs valuable strategic and annual planning experience.  NGO administration has also been improved through the training of boards of directors in matters concerning board composition, relations with paid staff, and the running of meetings.  All NGOs have now separated board members from staff members and have increased the number of women on the boards.  The project also set up computerized accounting systems, and all NGOs are now capable of producing monthly financial reports.  They are also now able to produce logframes for project proposals, and have policies and procedures governing purchases, personnel, job descriptions, and NGO property. Due in part to personnel problems, efforts to improve NGO membership and fundraising were less effective.  Though each NGO now has plans in these two areas, they are weak and often incomplete.  The NGOs need to develop the ability to market themselves with potential donors and sponsors, and they need good public relations with donors, members, other NGOs, the press, and international NGOs. While securing funding grants is critical in the NGOs' role as implementing agencies, few contacts have been made with international funding sources.  The best sources of funds have been the Initiative for the Americas Fund (FIAES) and a similar Canadian-financed fund called FONAES; the Social Investment Fund (FIS) has also been a funding source for project NGOs.  As for the special activity grants, which were envisioned for projects that were in some way innovative, only 5 of the 30 planned have been awarded. The project has been a model for the participation of women, beginning with the NGO selection criteria that required that boards of directors be open to both sexes.  As a result, most boards now have women constituting a third of their boards, 3 out of 7 subgrant NGOs have women board presidents, and 3 out of 7 subgrant NGOs have women executive directors.  The project has supported participation in 91 training events with a total of 1,187 participants, 549 women and 638 men.  Women have also attended international events such as the agroforestry for women training sessions in Costa Rica. Lessons learned include the following.  (1) Operating grants for NGOs should routinely include an explicit plan for discontinuing assistance, including gradually reducing funds over time.  (2) Operations grants are not the only mechanism possible for institutional strengthening, and are very likely not the best. Organizational analysis and structural redesign, technical and management training, training in project design, and computerized accounting can contribute positively to an NGO without an accompanying subgrant.  (3) Fundraising is an important aspect for strengthening NGOs, and all sources need to be considered when looking at fundraising.  NGOs should not attempt to solve their recurrent cost problems through increased membership.","Delivery order no. 17","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","AEP-0085-I-00-3003-00","","9/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Indigenous private voluntary organizations|Institution building|Environmental management|Natural resource management|Membership","El Salvador","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABL679.pdf","2,343 KB","000356 - Checchi and Co.

"Evaluates matching grant to African Medical and Research Foundation (AMREF) for a project to strengthen the efficiency, quality, and accessibility of health service delivery in Kenya and Uganda.  Mid-term evaluation covers the period 10/92-11/94. AMREF is on track in terms of meeting grant goals and objectives. The NGO is well-respected in East Africa by government officials who see it as an ""African"" NGO, rather than northern; it enjoys easy access to high-level health policy levels of the Ugandan and Kenyan governments, who tend to look on AMREF personnel as an extension of their own staff. AMREF's Health Policy and Management Department has provided training, management and planning assistance, and systems development services which are highly regarded by Ministry of Health (MOH) officials and by recipient structures in the health delivery system.  AMREF's Distance Education Program, which is providing continuing education for thousands of health workers through self-contained correspondence courses, is also highly regarded.  In both cases, host governments and recipient health structures indicate a desire for more assistance from AMREF. The institutional impact of the project is difficult to assess, since AMREF's activities are tied to the complexities of implementing government policy, including decentralization, where it appears that each level within the health delivery system has overestimated the capacity of the next to carry out new responsibilities.  Because of the lack of standard measures of effectiveness in these areas, AMREF has tried to define effectiveness as meeting the goals it set out for itself at the beginning of the grant period.  But because the situation has changed and certain realities about decentralization have not been realized, not all of these measures are necessarily valid anymore. Current indicators used by AMREF reflect input measurement rather than impact; new indicators are needed. AMREF is behind schedule in obligating funds, partly due to a delay in receiving initial grant funds, lag time in negotiating and planning the Uganda program, and changes in policy and delays in implementing health care user fees in Kenya. In order for AMREF to continue to be effective, it should follow two courses of action:  (1) formally acknowledge that circumstances have changed since the beginning of the grant and initiate course corrections, including expanding AMREF's management training; and (2) revise the indicators of success and incorporate them into a new monitoring system.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","OTR-0158-C-00-0143-00","","2/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Public health care|Institution building|Government departments|Health care administration|Health policy|Medical education","East Africa|Kenya|Uganda","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABL670.pdf","1,157 KB","002892 - Automation Research Systems, Ltd.","","007746 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to enhance the efficiency of the securities market in the Philippines by improving the quality and transparency of investment information available to capital market participants through TA, training, policy analysis and reform, and commodities (e.g., computers and software).  The Philippine Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has implemented the public sector component, and the Financial Executives Institute of the Philippines (FINEX) the private sector component. TA has been provided by Arthur Anderson (AA). Mid-term evaluation covers the period 9/92-5/95. In terms of the public sector, the project is well-designed and is being implemented in a manner that should result in (1) a full disclosure system to replace or supplement the currently used merit regulation system; (2) market regulation systems that are managed by Self-Regulatory Organizations (SROs) such as the Philippines Stock Exchange (PSE) with SEC oversight responsibility; (3) effective SEC enforcement; and (4) a trading, clearing, settlement and depository system capable of satisfying global standards.  Further, the AA consultants are at work on providing the Philippine capital market with just such an integrated regulatory system.  If allowed to carry their recommendations forward as accepted by the SEC en banc (that is, using majority rule), the project should be successful. In terms of the private sector, work has progressed to provide: (1) a service company to operate an equity and debt market depository; (2) an organization to promote training, advocacy, and research and provide committee support services; and (3) a series of planned component completion activities which will provide fee revenues for sustainability of project outputs after the Project Assistance Completion Date (PACD). FINEX appears to have established a framework to complete the work, and an expanded well-managed project management office will promote sustainability.

"Mid-term self-evaluation of a project to expedite the reconstruction effort in Haiti by developing a Skills Bank from which Haitian employers can recruit qualified employees. Evaluation covers the period 2/95-6/95. The project has been implemented by HAFED (Haitian-Americans for Economic Development) and VITA (Volunteers in Technical Assistance). The project is making solid progress, although current usage and registration levels are lower than expected; the national political situation (i.e., election preparations) and limited awareness of the Skills Bank may be preventing more widespread usage. However, the Skills Bank seems poised to ""take off"", provided that information and communication systems are operating efficiently and that recruitment strategies are effectively identified and implemented.  Other limitations -- in particular, the lack of adequate local transportation -- can be corrected through a project amendment. The Skills Bank is meeting current demand for information on qualified personnel in a timely and professional manner.  HAFED staff are exemplary in their enthusiasm and dedication to the project, even if some personal sacrifice is involved (e.g., the use of non-reimbursable private means of transportation), and the organization is well-placed for cultivating high-level contacts with governmental officials and for providing informative tutorials on Skills Bank activities and access to both private and public sources.  Both HAFED and VITA have explored innovative means to increase registrations and user inquiries.  The project enjoys strong USAID support at all levels, including the Mission Director and the Office of the Administrator. There has been a great deal of evidence of the Haitian entrepreneurial work ethic, despite an uncertain and sometimes chaotic political process.  This ethic is likely to produce a groundswell of interest in and support for the Skills Bank once the election process is completed.  A.I.D. is aware of factors that might impede the project's progress, such as the lag-time before the project's ""take off.""  The project requires early and continual promotion, and there are some prospective employees (both in Haiti and the United States) who are reluctant to provide their names and addresses for fear that the information in the Skills Bank might be used to track them down. The project does suffer some weaknesses.  (1) Its ability to meet user demand may be because demand is low compared with that expected once the project has ""taken off.""  (2) The project needs to implement more concentrated promotional and educational activities, which currently are limited by inadequate local transportation.  (3) Both VITA in Haiti and HAFED in the United States use relatively complex computerized information systems to handle registrations.  The process of ensuring that these systems are compatible with each other (and simultaneously updated) has been slow.  Efficient information systems and two-way flow of information are the only ways that an increase in demand can be accommodated, since additional staff is not an option. (4) While local access to the Skills Bank at the HAFED office via telephone and fax appears to be adequate, immediate measures to increase that access should be implemented -- for example, through the addition of an answering machine to receive night and weekend calls and a ""black box"" to more efficiently route calls.  (5) HAFED is encouraged to include names and information of Haitian-Americans living in the United States even when potential employers indicate interest only in Haitians who live in Haiti; it has been assumed that interest would be low, since local employers are not likely to pay U.S.-level salaries, but there may be Haitian-Americans who would be interested in participating in Haiti's reconstruction despite relatively low remuneration. (6) It is not too early to start thinking about sustainability. The Ministry of Haitians Living Abroad has evinced a desire to eventually house the data base; if this happens the Skills Bank should include services in French, as well as in English.  (7) VITA's attempt to get authorization for a ground station connected to a satellite at the HAFED office to improve communication with VITA/USA (and the Internet) has been unsuccessful. (8) VITA has experienced delays in payment of its invoices.  The project is eligible for advance payment rather than the current reimbursement schedule or through transfer to VITA's existing letter of credit, should the project be extended.","Also entitled: Haiti Skills Bank : project mid-term evaluation --|June 14-21, 1995","Special Evaluation","Documents","521-0000-C-00-5015-00","","6/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Databases|Personnel|Occupational opportunities|Employment services","Haiti","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABL695.pdf","1,177 KB","001257 - Volunteers in Technical Assistance, Inc.

"Evaluates the Jose Maria Covelo Foundation (Covelo), a second-tier TA organization which has implemented a component of the Small Business II project in Honduras since 4/93.  Covelo provides TA to NGOs involved in strengthening small and micro enterprises. Due to the generally weak institutional capacities of Honduran NGOs and Covelo's own limited resources (including a technically weak staff, due to high turnover of trained personnel), Covelo is assisting only 5 NGOs instead of the 30 originally targeted. These are:  Foundation for International Community Assistance in Honduras (FINCA), World Relief of Honduras (WRH), Women Entrepreneurial Development Organization (ODEF), Institute for the Development of Honduras (IDH), and Honduran Brotherhood (HdeH) -- although HdeH's participation was suspended as of 12/94.  Covelo has a good track record as a TA provider to these NGOs, and its activities are valued by the NGOs and by other donors. The impact of Covelo's assistance has been less favorable than expected, however, because the NGOs have lacked commitment to make the required management changes. The five NGOs assisted by Covelo have used two different lending methodologies:  the village bank methodology (FINCA and WRH) and the individual lending methodology (ODEF, ID, and HdeH).  The former has had far greater outreach than the latter, reaching 8 times as many borrowers, albeit with much smaller loans (the average village lending loan relative to the individual lending loan is 1:9).  Experience with the village banking model has shown that:  (1) some banks (a limited number) can graduate to the formal financial sector or evolve into self-financing village banks; (2) village banks are relatively easy to establish in stable, cohesive communities and very difficult in transient urban areas; (3) the keys to successful village banks are leadership, cohesion, and financial management; (4) where illiteracy rates are high, as in Honduras, substantial training and extensive bank supervision are required in the early years; and (5) internal account management, though considered key to the village bank methodology, has resulted in many cases of financial malfeasance.  Collectively, the five NGOs have reached 15,147 active borrowers, which is estimated to be only 6% of the market. A credit fund was added to the project in 1993 to provide NGOs with the liquidity needed to expand their own outreach and to increase Covelo's own sustainability (assuming NGOs, once expanded, would return to Covelo for additional resources). However, this strategy has not worked because of the vast amount of resources currently being placed in Honduras by the different donors and institutions at much more competitive terms and conditions than Covelo's loans, which can be made for no more than $300 and which are thus of use only to those NGOs involved in village bank lending.","Project title: Growth and equity through microenterprise investment|(GEMINI)","Special Evaluation","Documents","DHR-5448-C-00-9080-00","","3/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Small scale enterprises|Microenterprises|Financial institutions|Business support services|Indigenous private voluntary organizations|Economic self sufficiency|Commercial credit|Technical assistance|Management operations|Loan administration","Honduras","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNABW696.pdf","3,479 KB","006727 - Development Alternatives, Inc.

"Final evaluation of the Family Planning Management Development (FPMD) project in Kenya, follow-on to the successful Family Planning Management Training (FPMT) project.  The project was implemented by Management Sciences for Health (MSH). Evaluation covers the period 1991-8/95. Although the lack of a country strategy or framework with objectives and indicators and the overlapping roles of the various cooperating agencies make it difficult to draw strong conclusions about project impact, much was accomplished. The project continued FPMT activities with one governmental and three large national NGOs, and forged new partnerships with three additional NGOs and another governmental agency, bringing the total number of FPMD partners in Kenya to eight.  TA was provided in the areas of management, strategy, and structure and systems. In the strategy area, FPMD assisted partners with strategic planning and with strategies for financial sustainability/cost recovery.  Under the structure rubric, assistance focused on organizational structure, personnel management, and board/staff relations.  Systems development activities concentrated on developing and/or revising systems for management information, finance, monitoring and evaluation, supervision, and logistics; these efforts were particularly significant at the National Council for Population and Development, the Government of Kenya's (GOK) population policy and coordinating body, and included developing a computer unit and a management information system and training staff in computer skills. In addition to management interventions, the project trained Kenyans in improved management skills, both in Kenya and overseas; produced publications which are widely used and highly valued; and assisted the GOK in developing a National Implementation Plan (NIP) for Family Planning, which aims to decentralize some administrative capacities to provinces and districts.  The NIP has the potential for the greatest impact on the national program; it has enhanced GOK awareness of the need to implement FP as a national program as well as to review its overall population policy and apply the principles used in the NIP process in other national development planning activities. Finally, project assistance to regional and local NGOs significantly improved management and enhanced capacities to deliver improved, high-quality FP services in underserved areas, although project impact on NGOs' contribution to the national FP program remains unclear. The following are lessons learned.  (1) This project is unique among FPMD projects in that its activities were coordinated and implemented through a local office staffed primarily by local people.  During the latter part of the project nearly two-thirds of the project's consultants were Kenyan.  (2) While management information and other systems developed with Kenyan partner organizations have been helpful, more assistance is needed by some in the area of using data for decisionmaking.  (3) Early attention should have been given to presenting and promoting the project's activities and mode of operation in partner countries. Also, more cross-fertilization between partner organizations within the country should be fostered.  (4) Based on the negative experience with the CAMEO evaluation initiative in Kenya, all future management development TA should be firmly based on the needs of the partner organizations, which should, moreover, be involved in planning and implementation of interventions.","Task order no.: A1700 EVPRG","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","DPE-3055-C-00-0051-00","","8/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Health care administration|Management development|Family planning promotion programs|National level|Institution building|Private voluntary organizations|Government departments|Development cooperation","Kenya","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABL774.pdf","1,325 KB","000750 - Management Sciences for Health (MSH)|000496 - Centre for Development and Population Activities (CEDPA)","","008234 - USAID.

"Technical assistance provided by the Family Planning Management Development Project (FPMD) of Management Sciences for Health (MSH) to the Centre for African Family Studies (CAFS) included personnel systems development, documentation and management training, internal computer capability, and institutional development.  It is necessary to look at FPMD assistance to CAFS within the context of the change through which CAFS is passing as a result of its separation from the International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF).  This period of change coincides with many uncertainties within CAFS, creating a crisis situation which has resulted in low morale among the staff. There are three dimensions to this crisis.  First, there has been no decision regarding the closing of CAFS' Lome office and the integration of the Francophone office with the main office in Nairobi.  Second, CAFS does not have a permanent director; the current director has had the position of Acting Director for two years.  These first two dimensions are discussed in Section III. A.  The third aspect of the crisis, addressed in Section III.B., is the need for CAFS to develop a new identity while working toward sustainability through marketing. The assistance of FPMD within this picture was generally considered by CAFS' staff members to be of high quality, with one notable exception:  FPMD assistance to CAFS is not integrated into a coherent program designed to assist CAFS in overcoming its current crisis.  CAFS staff members also expressed interest in developing a partnership with MSH and other collaborating agencies. The major lesson to be learned by MSH is that, although FPMD's technical assistance was useful to CAFS, MSH should not commit itself to perform a series of disparate activities for an agency in need of radical transformation.  There are also lessons to be learned for donors.  First, sustainability should be allowed to develop gradually, in order to allow organizations to develop. Second, when an organization is passing through a crisis, donors should hand over ""conductorship"" of the organization to the agency providing the technical assistance. Finally, donor agencies should focus more on results, rather than process.

"Evaluates project to improve the performance of the national family planning (FP) program in Bangladesh by (1) strengthening grassroots management capability through a Local Initiative Program (LIP) and (2) strengthening NGOs' FP services. Interim evaluation covers the period 1987-8/95. LIP's achievements have been impressive.  The program has covered about one-quarter of all thanas (local administrative units) in the country, and host government support is high.  The formation of local management teams, comprised of community leaders and program staff and providers, has strengthened local commitment and accountability to the national FP program.  The lowest level of FP workers -- Family Welfare Assistants (FWAs), all of whom are women -- have seen their role enhanced from household distributor to supervisor through the introduction of a cadre of female village volunteers who have taken over distribution tasks. The vast majority of the FWAs surveyed felt that their skills in planning, supervision, data analysis, and reporting had improved through training and participation in LIP.  LIP also appears to have had a life-changing impact on the status of the more than 25,000 women volunteers working with the program. The contraceptive prevalence rate in eight LIP areas averaged 64% compared with the national figure of 36%.  About 89% of women in LIP areas reported visiting with program workers within the previous 3 months compared with the national figure of 38%. Further, 15.7% and 64.9% of women with no children and those with one or two children, respectively, use contraception in LIP areas; comparable national figures are 9% and 36.1%.  Besides the exceptional advances in community participation fostered in LIP areas, all thanas are now required to make a contribution from local resources to support local FP activities. Policymakers are encouraging the national replication of LIP principles. Finally, the skills of the local subcontractor for LIP have been developed in several areas, such as monitoring and evaluation, use of data for decisionmaking, and serving as trainers in South-to-South exchanges. The Cooperative Agency (CA)/NGO project has had important impacts in three management areas.  For example, the management development assessment (MDA) methodology has enabled the CAs to better identify the technical support needed for sustainability; its flexibility is especially appreciated.  The Training Impact Evaluation (TIE) methodology has also proven helpful.  The project has also worked with the CAs to develop a high-quality management information system (MIS) for collecting Quality, Expansion, Sustainability (QES) data. Lessons learned from LIP are as follows.  (1) Developing local level FP management skills though training, TA, and small grants improves service delivery.  (2) Despite their low literacy levels, female volunteers can be effectively used to supplement outreach efforts of paid government staff at reduced costs and with notable effects on local FP performance.  (3) Demonstrated innovations at the local level, e.g., community contributions, can have a positive effect on the national program. It is too early to document lessons from the CA/NGO project.","Task order no.: EVPRG","Special Evaluation","Documents","DPE-3055-C-00-0051-00","","8/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Family planning promotion programs|Family planning services|Health care administration|Management development|National level|Local level","Bangladesh","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABL800.pdf","2,753 KB","000750 - Management Sciences for Health (MSH)|000496 - Centre for Development and Population Activities (CEDPA)","","008234 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to support democratic governance initiatives in Zambia.  Mid-term evaluation covers the period 1992-95. Although slow to hit full-stride, the project is now making major and critical contributions to the consolidation of democratic institutions and processes in Zambia.  Four of the five project components have made progress toward intended results, while the fifth has been suspended (correctly, in the evaluation team's judgment).  (1) Constitutional Reform.  The Constitutional Review Commission has completed a nationwide series of public hearings, and issued a draft constitution on June 16, 1995.  (2) Civic Education.  Despite slow institutional growth at its National Secretariat, the Foundation for Democratic Process (FODEP) has built a cadre of volunteer trainers to conduct a mass civic education campaign.  (3) The Media Independence component has begun to increase the professional skills of Zambian journalists and contributed to policy dialogue leading to media law reform. (4) Under the Policy Coordination component, the project has established a policy analysis and coordination unit in the Cabinet Office and introduced efficiencies into the conduct of cabinet affairs.  (5) In the wake of the National Assembly's failure to meet an agreed condition precedent, USAID/Z has withdrawn support from the Legislative Performance component. The project has been demand-driven from the outset, with Zambian partners initiating requests for assistance and actively participating in project design.  As a result, Zambians have generally taken ownership of individual project components, notably in the Cabinet Office and the Zambia Office of Mass Communications (ZAMCOM).  The Speaker of the National Assembly ultimately disassociated himself from the project's goals (though support remains among reformist members of parliament), and the ownership of the national civic education campaign remains blurred between FODEP and its contractors. A major design flaw was inadequate attention to institutional arrangements and practical mechanisms for implementation.  Other project weaknesses have included substantial delays in procurement of TA and commodities and occasional constraints placed on the strong performance of the Democracy and Governance Advisor by the need to play the dual role of policy advisor and Project Administrator.  In addition, the sheer range of project activities has stretched USAID/Z management capacities and posed challenges of project integration.  Despite these problems, the project has made USAID the lead donor in the democratic governance field in Zambia.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","623-0226-A-00-3024-00","","7/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Democratization|Civic education|Mass media|Laws and legislation|Constitutions|Public awareness|Print media|Political development|Journalism|Governance","Zambia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABL806.pdf","7,318 KB","000775 - Michigan State University","","008627 - USAID.

"Evaluates a program to provide balance of payments support to help the Government of the Philippines (GOP) to implement reforms to improve its competitiveness in world export markets.  Final evaluation covers the period 1991-8/95. By choosing export promotion and emphasizing foreign exchange liberalization, USAID/Manila has made an important contribution to the Ramos administration's reform program.  By concentrating on a few objectives united under the common theme of export competitiveness, the Mission has created a program that is clearly defined and, at least in concept, simple to implement and monitor.  Because the program has created new institutions as the tool for reaching its objectives, its results are likely to be permanent.  The creation of a market for foreign exchange that is responsive to supply and demand is shaping the behavior of the banks, the Central Bank, and exporters and importers. It has established a set of interests that reinforced the market's continued operation.  On a smaller scale, the new One-Stop Shop (OSS) refund center has made duty drawbacks and value-added tax refunds effective aids to exporting by shortening the length of time required for claims to be processed.  Previously, delays in payment had nullified the incentive value of the program. Although the reorganization of the foreign exchange market did have some negative consequences for export competitiveness in 1992-94 (as the peso rose in value in response to significant increases in the supply of foreign exchange), the policy achieved the ultimate goal to allow rapid growth of output and employment to occur without balance-of-payments problems.  Finally, the new market will produce a more realistic exchange rate and greater export competitiveness over time as the import needs that flow from economic growth temporarily draw down the accumulated supply of foreign exchange. The following lessons were learned.  (1) The creation of new institutions gave the policy reforms a support and momentum they would otherwise not have possessed.  The creation of the OSS, now part of the permanent government establishment to accelerate refunds, has accomplished much more than an executive order to existing bureaucracies to do the same thing.  On a larger scale, the new exchange market, operating in the framework of foreign exchange liberalization, has made trading more responsive to supply and demand and basically modified the behavior of traders, exporters, importers, investors, and especially the Central Bank. (2) Concentrating on a small number of objectives united under a single theme is more effective than a multiple-goal program, which implies a bureaucratic proliferation on the part of both recipient and donor.  In this case, the Philippine authorities and USAID/Manila have designated small groups that have been able to concentrate on real problems.  Finally, the single theme allows the results to be more easily evaluated.","Delivery order no. 18|Project title: Implementing policy change (IPC)","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","AEP-5451-I-00-2058-00","","8/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Nonproject assistance|Policy reform|Regulatory reform|Trade liberalization|Economic policy|Export promotion|Economic competition|Capital markets|Foreign exchange rates|Institution building|Supply|Demand|Balance of payments","Philippines","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABL808.pdf","7,224 KB","004304 - Nathan Associates, Inc.","","008592 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (7/86-1/94) to increase productive private sector investment in Bolivia's rural and semi-urban areas by decentralizing the investment financing system and through efforts in investment promotion and institution building. When it was found that only 2 of the targeted 5-10 market towns were actually benefitting from the project due to commercial bank reluctance to lend in these areas and to lack of adequate infrastructure, the project was expanded in 1989 to include major cities (La Paz, Cochabamba, and Santa Cruz), provided there were forward and backward linkages to rural areas. The investment finance mechanism, composed of financial credit units (FCUs), intermediate credit institutions (ICIs), and the Project Coordinating Unit (PCU), went through several phases; at one point, the Mission suspended project financing in order to develop a private financial institution, although it later dropped the idea at the urging of the FCUs and the Government of Bolivia.  As of 1/94, the project had provided $31 million to finance 503 projects, mostly of small and medium size. Nonetheless, the financing mechanism has been unequal to the demand; several viable projects approved by the FCUs were not financed. The project achieved financial sustainability based on fees charged by the PCU and the FCU.  All 8 FCUs had operating surpluses except Potosi and Oruro, two less developed regions which have insignificant support from the Departmental Development Corporations (DDCs) and which have been supported by the PCU. Regarding institution building, the capabilities of the PCU and the FCUs were improved, but not those of the ICIs.  The system managed to mobilize the resources available despite uncertainties and bureaucratic delays, but did not achieve its objective of being fully decentralized. The objective to develop the FCUs as investment promotion entities was only partially met.  Overall, despite the unwieldiness of the PCU/FCU/ICI system, the project succeeded in delivering loans in secondary areas where it would not have been possible before, and in stimulating private sector participation in the development process. Both socioeconomic and training objectives were attained.  The project generated $56 million in exports and created 37,558 direct and indirect new jobs, most of them in the small and medium-scale export sector.  In regard to training, various types of business training were provided to 816 male and 246 female participants, mostly Bolivian businesspeople.  The objective of creating a permanent institutional structure was also achieved: Fundacion para la Produccion (FUNDA-PRO) has been legally created as a development finance entity. In regard to management, many of the contractor's activities were behind schedule, due in large part to an excessive focus on definitions and process rather than on the provision of TA or on actions leading to increased investment. Lessons learned from the two interim evaluations are included.

"PACR of a project (9/90-12/93) to provide low-cost essential drugs to underserved populations in marginal urban and rural areas in Ecuador on a self-sustaining basis. The project was implemented by Asociacion Ecuatoriana de Industriales e Importadores de Productos Farmaceuticals/Fundacion PROMESA, which in turn signed agreements with local NGOs to establish botiquines (dispensaries) in low-income areas lacking access to a private pharmacy. PROMESA was responsible for training all botiquine administrators and NGO staff.  By the end of the project, 182 botiquines (vs. 60 targeted) had been established in 16 provinces.  The drugs, which were only dispensed if prescribed by the dispensary physician, were sold at an average price of 42% lower than the public commercial price. More than 80% of participating pharmaceutical laboratories offered a 30-day grace period for payment and the remaining labs provided credit for up to 60 days.  With the expansion of the grant in 9/92, increased emphasis was placed in education through art and communication activities; a guide for NGOs planning to use the education through art strategy was developed and disseminated. In January 1994, Fundacion Eugenio Espejo, a local NGO with extensive experience in this field, submitted a draft final evaluation of the project.  The evaluation, which found the results of the project to be mixed, begins by assuming that PROMESA always had a hidden agenda to expand the market share of the pharmaceutical industry; it also implies that the beneficiary NGOs are not necessarily acting in the best interest of the community, since the profit margin of the botiquines is substantial.  PROMESA has provided a rebuttal to the draft evaluation. To fully establish the successes and limitations of the project, yet another evaluation would be needed, something which is precluded by the Mission's financial and personnel limitations.  Nonetheless, whatever the shortcomings of the evaluation, field visits by the USAID Project Officer and interviews with beneficiary organizations clearly demonstrate the feasibility of a pharmaceutical distribution network which relies on the private sector to provide essential medications at a low cost to underserved populations.  Further, PROMESA, which has taken on the role of an ""umbrella"" NGO, has provided TA and support which have considerably strengthened the administrative and financial capacity of a large number of NGOs, which are running their organizations as micro-enterprises. The project required relatively little USAID input in terms of financial support and management effort.  Moreover, pharmaceutical industry interest has been strong, and a large number of NGOs have benefited significantly in terms of administrative and financial skills. Lessons learned include the following.  (1) This project demonstrates that there is no conflict between the private provision of goods and services and the goal of reaching targeted populations.  (2) Well-trained and motivated employees in pharmacies can change the medication habits of a community.  In a country where there is significant overmedication and self-medication, it is important not to provide medication without a prescription.  (3) Training NGOs in administrative and financial management has a definite payoff in terms of improving not only their operations, but also their ability to better negotiate terms with private providers.  Many of the NGOs have graduated from PROMESA and are negotiating discounted prices directly with the pharmaceutical companies.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","518-0093-G-00-0245-00","","4/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Pharmaceuticals|Dispensaries|Private sector|Indigenous private voluntary organizations|Pharmacies|Business associations","Ecuador","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABL831.pdf","99 KB","008538 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (ending in 3/94) to assist the Government of Guatemala (GOG) in modernizing its fiscal administration system. The project fulfilled almost all objectives and also completed numerous additional tasks.  Significant input was provided to the GOG's tax modernization program.  New laws for Guatemala's most important taxes (income tax and value added tax), along with implementing regulations, were designed and written by project staff.  Computerized systems in the Ministry of Finance (MOF) have been modernized and data management is now much improved. Control systems have been put in place to assist the MOF in managing tax related matters.  Training has occurred in almost all functions of the Internal Revenue and Customs Directorates. The Financial Analysis Unit has been established and its staff has been trained and equipped to assist the Minister in the formation and management of fiscal policy.  The tax modernization program of 1992 significantly improved the Guatemalan tax structure, making it simpler, easier to administer and comply with, fairer, and more investor friendly.  Tax reform was mostly directed to a structural reform, particularly to broadening the tax base and removing distortions in relative prices that affect economic choices.  Significant improvements were introduced in five areas:  (1) the removal of all tax incentives (except for export promotion), which should put more businesses on an equal footing; (2) the taxation of interest; (3) removal of ""cascading"", an important distortion in the value added tax, by the provision of refunds, of full and immediate credit for capital purchases, and of credit for all inputs; (4) equalization of export activities by extension of zero rating traditional exports; and (5) removal of a significant incentive to income tax evasion by elimination of the average-marginal rates. Despite these successes, the institutionalization of tax reforms was not achieved.  Reasons for this include a lack of GOG political commitment to tax reform and failure to complement a change in the tax structure with administrative reforms to alter personnel policies which encourage rapid turnover of the most qualified personnel, constantly update tax information databases, and enforce the new tax laws.  On monitoring results, the project suffered from a lack of clarity of end-of-project status and how to measure results. Lessons learned include the following.  (1) The modernization effort should have had a broader coverage of MOF divisions, since some divisions still operate in antiquated and counterproductive ways.  (2) Tools are not everything.  While the project enjoyed tremendous success in installing computerized information systems, the will to use the tools has not increased simultaneously.  (3) Day-to-day ministry work should not be the responsibility of project advisors.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","6/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Public administration|Fiscal policy|Taxation|Tax reforms|Tax incentives|Value added taxes|Income taxes","Guatemala","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABL832.pdf","164 KB","008550 - USAID.

"Close-out report on a project (7/84-7/94) to create technically and financially viable institutions for meeting vocational training needs in Honduras.  The Advisory Council for Human Resources Development (CADERH) was the implementing agency. The project was a success.  Under the first component, designed to provide entry-level and skills-upgrading training programs for low-income, unemployed and underemployed youth and adults, the project remodeled and equipped 16 vocational training centers sponsored by PVOs and municipalities, trained and provided ongoing TA to the centers' staff, and developed competency-based instruction (CBI) materials and trade certification exams for 31 trades.  The centers, which provide training to over 3,000 unemployed and underemployed youth and adults each year, are meeting the needs of some of the least privileged sectors of Honduran society and improving employment opportunities for lower income sectors (with a 90% job placement rate).  The CBI and trade certification systems serve as effective quality-control mechanisms for the centers. The second component provided industry-specific training, usually in-plant training for export-oriented firms.  Approximately 5,500 of a targeted 6,500 people received training under this component.  An additional 2,000 were trained by CADERH after USAID participation in this component was terminated, for an overall total in excess of target. Approximately 80% of the trainees were female, many of them single mothers who would otherwise have had difficulty obtaining employment. The third component also achieved its objectives, as more than 200,000 training modules and audiovisual units were produced and distributed by CADERH to training centers and sold to firms and individuals.  The component is now financially self-sustainable through the sale of services and products; it also markets CBI and audiovisual training materials to vocational training programs.  A major concern, however, is the degree to which CADERH will be able, over the long-term, to continue financing nonprofit development activities for the benefit of lower income sectors of society. Lessons learned are as follows.  (1) Long-term commitment, management consensus, and continuity on the part of both CADERH and USAID were key factors in the project's success.  (2) Achieving financial sustainability and meeting the needs of low-income sectors may not be compatible goals.  (3) The original intention of using CADERH as a ""training broker"" did not work because local training institutions were not accustomed to accepting either external controls over their curricula or the external evaluations of participants to ensure quality control.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Employment|Poor|Disadvantaged groups|Vocational training|Private sector|Youth|Women|Training centers|Institution building|Certification","Honduras","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABL839.pdf","214 KB","008555 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (10/91-2/95) to increase Central American non-traditional agricultural exports (NTAEs) (EXITOS project). The Exitos project, an extension of the Non-Traditional Agricultural Support Project (PROEXAG), continued that project's focus on facilitating and supporting produce ""deals"" (which combine production area, crop, product form, seasonality, and target market) by providing export entrepreneurs with ""know-how"" -- data, technology, and competitive intelligence, along with the skills needed to use these tools effectively in the pursuit of profitable opportunities. Major results of the project include the following.  (1) New country/crop combinations were established in every country of Central America, thereby diversifying the economy and providing increased job opportunities, better economic stability, more foreign exchange, and, tangentially, greater political stability. (2) The project encouraged the production of produce counter-seasonally to production in the United States, thereby complementing the supply of fresh produce and making more items available year around to the U.S. consumer.  (3) Each dollar of U.S. taxpayer money spent on PROEXAG and EXITOS had a return of $8.82 to the economies of Central America, and $13.08 to the economy of the United States.  (4) Over 10,000 farms received some sort of assistance from the projects, with over 8,000 of those farms being of one ha or less in size.  (5) Farms and businesses in Central America receiving project assistance employed over 80,000 individuals.  A preponderance of those jobs were in rural areas, and a majority went to women.  (6) Over 5,300 permanent jobs were created in the United States by the economic activity directly attributable to the projects.  No U.S. jobs were lost to Central America due to project activity. Lessons learned are largely the same as those from PROEXAG.  (1) Growth in the NTAE subsector depends above all on the establishment of viable NTAE-oriented businesses.  (2) NTAE businesses are high-risk ventures because they usually involve new crops that are subject to unpredictable weather and pest/disease problems and involve highly perishable crops, allow little margin for error and correction and usually require carrying key personnel through the off-season, tend to aim for short market windows that shift each season and disappear with time, and are prone to sudden and marked price changes.  (3) Each combination of crop, product form, and end-market is a different business.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","2/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Regional development|Agribusiness|Nontraditional exports|Export diversification|Export promotion|Agricultural product marketing|Business support services|Associations|Business enterprises","Central America|USA","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABL840.pdf","1,253 KB","002290 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (8/91-12/93) to diminish cholera morbidity and mortality by 80% in 430 rural communities in seven provinces in Ecuador: Los Rios, Imbabura, Chimborazo, Loja, Azuay, Carchi, and Esmeraldas. The project was implemented by CARE. The project consisted of three major components:  latrine construction, hygiene education, and a mass media campaign. Under the first component, CARE provided ventilated improved pits to communities with no gravity-flow water system, waterseals to communities with water systems, and raised, sealed pits to communities in the flood plain. CARE provided 40% of construction materials, the Ecuadorian Institute of Sanitary Works (IEOS) demonstrated construction and provided supervision, and communities dug pits, built latrines, and provided 60% of the construction materials. Under the second component, CARE taught community members to wash hands with soap after using the latrines, boil or chlorinate water before drinking it, cook and protect all food well, bury excreta, preferably in latrines, and use sugar-salt and rehydration salt solutions.  CARE also reinforced the practice of breastfeeding.  The third component, a mass media campaign, was essential to broadcast educational programs in all targeted provinces. During its extension period, the project built six water systems in four provinces:  Carchi (Mira), Imbabura (Cotacachi), Chimborazo (Riobamba), and Los Rios (Ventanas and Baba). The project exceeded all of its major targets:  40,170 (vs. 28,500) latrines were built and families trained, and 571 (vs. 400) Community Oral Rehydration Units (CORUs) were established. While no concrete evidence of impacts on mortality was found, it can be expected that changes will occur in the future, given improved hygiene behavior. In sum, activities carried out by CARE were very much a response to the cholera outbreak.  Evaluation findings as well as testimonials from community leaders and Ministry of Health officials point to the importance of CARE's contribution. Cholera has passed the epidemic stage in Ecuador and entered the endemic stage; CARE's activities have now been extended into other endemic areas under the Water and Sanitation for Health and Ecuadorian Development (WASHED) project. The following lessons were learned. (1) The cholera epidemic, which took Ecuador by surprise, was successfully handled by a number of institutions.  Critical to this success was the coordination among institutions, including CARE, which made the interventions of each much more effective.  (2) CARE's model of integrating construction with hygiene education is critical to the sustainability of sanitation construction programs.  The model is employed by other USAID projects and should be promoted among other donors, such as the World Bank and Inter-American Development Bank.  (3) While cholera has entered its endemic stage in Ecuador and emergency programs are no longer necessary, child survival and other health programs should continue to focus on reducing the underlying causes of cholera, which include poor water and sanitation services, high incidence of diarrheal disease, and poor access to adequate health services.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","518-0108-G-00-1109-00","","4/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Cholera|Epidemics|Endemic diseases|Disease prevention and control|Rural areas|Outdoor toilet facilities|Sanitation education|Health education|Hygiene|Water sanitation|Community participation","Ecuador","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABL841.pdf","254 KB","008538 - USAID.

"The United States-Asian Environmental Partnership (USAEP) is a $100 million environmental trade and technology transfer program designed to support a clean industrial revolution in the high-performing economies (HPEs) in East/Southeast Asia. Section II of this technical review of the USAEP program makes a case for its involvement in East/Southeast Asia and describes the development of HPEs in the region and their effect on its environment.  Section III discusses USAEP's dilemma in choosing, among the large number that exist in Asia, the environmental problems and countries on which to focus its efforts.  Section IV describes the Incentives-Based Industrial Strategy (IBIS) to encourage environmentally-safe industrial growth, and includes examples of the IBIS model.  Conclusions are drawn in Section V. Given its severely limited resources, it would behoove USAEP to address clearly defined problems in a few ""core"" countries; in this way, the Program could ensure a few important long-term environmental improvements.  Successes in ""core"" countries could be disseminated through regional networks. Specifically, USAEP should build on the best of its past contributions, focusing on a clean technology revolution in urban/industrial areas, utilizing the IBIS approach.  The strategy, which is not a short-term, quick payoff activity, will probably require a 10-year commitment on the part of USAEP and its Asian partners.  If it adopts the IBS strategy, USAEP will need to make major organizational changes, including a smaller central body with improved analysis and performance monitoring capacities, and program tracking, documenting, and assessing mechanisms; the devolution of authority to country or regionally based field offices; Asian involvement in program design; the integration into IBIS of program subcomponents such as Professional and Organizational Development (POD) and the ""tech reps"" system; and the use of best available U.S. and Asian leadership.","Delivery order no. 29|Project title: Environmental and natural resources policy and|training (EPAT)","Special Evaluation","Documents","DHR-5555-Q-00-1085-00","","6/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Industrial development|Economic development|Environmental protection|Technology transfer|Development strategies|Partnerships","Southeast Asia|East Asia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABL983.pdf","447 KB","007486 - Winrock International Environmental Alliance","","007833 - United States-Asia Environmental Partnership (US-AEP)|008355 - USAID.

"PACR of the Ecuador subproject (9/90-9/94) of the Andean Peace Scholarship Program (APSP), itself a component of the Caribbean and Latin American Scholarship Program (CLASP) to counter Soviet, Bloc, and Cuban training activity by increasing the number of U.S.-trained individuals from the socially and economically disadvantaged class of Latin American and Caribbean countries. The APSP/Ecuador project met or exceeded all of the quantitative requirements for the CLASP program.  A total of 413 Ecuadorians (3 more than the modified target) received APSP training, including 90 long-term participants and 323 short-term participants.  Of the long-term participants, 48 received Master's degrees, 22 participated in non-degree graduate study programs, and 20 were enrolled in undergraduate non-degree programs.  Of the overall total of 413 participants, 76% were disadvantaged and 44% were women (versus targets of 40% and 70%, respectively).  Every participant was a leader or a potential leader, and 14% attended programs at Historically Black Colleges and Universities (versus a target of 10%).  All of Ecuador's 21 provinces were represented in APSP selection.  An APSP Alumni Association was created for follow-on activities, but was discontinued after funding ceased. Trainees benefitted both professionally and personally, and applied the skills and knowledge acquired in training.  The program generally improved the participants' status in their jobs and communities, increased their leadership capacity, and supported their development as change agents. Numerous lessons learned and general recommendations are provided, including the following.  (1) Delays in recruiting participants can result in high start-up costs if the training contractor is fully staffed from the beginning.  (2) Many more people would have been trained if host or third country training had been permitted.  Local training would also have made the training more effective.  (3) Congressionally mandated targets for disadvantaged participants and women limited identification of target groups.  The likelihood of meeting such targets should be assessed; requiring counterparts to nominate women in a male-dominated field, for example, is an unsuccessful strategy. (4) Training impact is likely to be greater if trainees are targeted within identified subject areas.  It is also important to ensure a pool of quality candidates before repeating programs for the same target group, and to define the notion of critical mass.  (5) Whenever possible, both the institution and the participant should commit to repaying the cost of the scholarship if the degree program is not completed.  (6) The greater the homogeneity of participants' educational background and needs, the more successful the program.  (7) Institutionally focused recruitment was more effective than open recruitment through, for example, newspapers.  (8) Both long- and short-term candidates should be interviewed.  (9) The training institution should receive as much background information on the participant as possible.  (10) When recruiting at the grassroots level, it is important to verify a candidate's possession of basic identity documents.  (11) Minimal English proficiency standards must be established for long-term U.S. trainees.  (12) Predeparture orientation is more effective when given to groups rather than to individuals.  (13) It is preferable to finance a small number of degree programs than a large number of non-degree programs.  (14) It may be preferable to substitute continuing education workshops for a participant alumni association.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","3/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Education for development|Scholarships|Participants|Disadvantaged groups|Leadership training|Beneficiary count","Ecuador","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABL862.pdf","623 KB","008538 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of a component of a Child Survival Grant 5 (1989-95) to Save the Children Federation (SCF) to support PVOs involved in child survival projects by distributing lessons learned and materials to the field and by upgrading the SCF health management information system (MIS) and making it available to other PVOs. Over the course of the project, SCF produced and distributed to other PVOs a large number of working papers, publications, workshop reports, and manuals, thereby enabling the PVOs to benefit from SCF's considerable experience and expertise in population-based health programming.  Under the MIS subcomponent, SCF developed ProMIS, a computer software program to facilitate management and analysis of large volumes of population-based data.  ProMIS has already gone through several modifications, the most recent of which has made the software program both flexible and adaptable; SCF field programs that have utilized ProMIS have found it useful and affordable.  Other PVOs, both U.S. and third world, have expressed interest in ProMIS, but have yet to receive it, since a few modifications are still needed. The need for ProMIS makes it imperative that a means be found to ensure its wide use, especially by local PVOs involved in community-based integrated health programming.  Recommendations address these needs and the means for achieving them.","Contract number is listed incorrectly on the title page as|OR-0500-A-00-9149","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","OTR-0500-A-00-9149-00","","8/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Child survival activities|Information dissemination|Educational materials|Management information systems|Computer software|Private voluntary organizations|Technology transfer|Child health care","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABL871.pdf","1,082 KB","005553 - John Snow, Inc.

"Final evaluation of the Zambia subproject (8/89-8/95) of the regional Natural Resources Management (NRM) Project.  The purpose of the subproject was to support Zambia's Administrative Management Design for Game Management Areas (ADMADE) program, aimed at helping local communities to participate in and benefit from wildlife conservation efforts in the country's national parks. ADMADE, a wildlife-oriented form of community-based NRM (CBNRM), is a success in the making, having already achieved a degree of sustainability.  The philosophy it embodies is arguably the most significant hope for improving the well-being of Zambia's rural areas by devolving to local populations the proprietary rights to rural resources.  The regular and village scouts are the heroes of the program, carrying out their wildlife management activities under great hardships.  Recent efforts have focused on (1) improving governance through devolution and administration through transparency; (2) capturing the strength of the private sector through partnerships with the public sector and with local communities; (3) establishing a policy and legal framework that supports equitable distribution of benefits; and (4) institutional restructuring to efficiently enhance linkages between conservation and development. At the policy level, support for the hunting industry may not only yield financial benefits to Zambia, but may also be one of the country's major sources of foreign exchange and government budgetary resources; new revenues will give local people economic alternatives to the consumptive use of wildlife.  Additionally, the concept of CBNRM is understood by most people ""on the ground"", especially by those most affected.  A dynamic tension exists between alternative uses of land and resources which, if kept in the open and managed well, can lead to better decisions on the use of these resources. Many of the management issues which were reported to be so troubling 14 months ago, including the operation of the Wildlife Conservation Revolving Fund, are on the mend.  Improvements have also been made in such areas as computerizing license fees, systems for monitoring animals, and increasing the number of trained scouts. The Nyamaluma Research and Training Center has been transformed under ADMADE and has established itself as the principal mechanism for translating NPWS' commitment to wildlife co-management into concrete, field-level programs.  The Center has broadened its curriculum and added staff to improve its training to a wider cross-section of communities in Game Management Areas (GMAs).  Additionally, the Center's ongoing research and monitoring of wildlife conservation activities provides a key to quantifying program progress. Less positively, however, the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) lacks the institutional, technical, and research management capacity needed to administer ADMADE effectively, and the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), while providing a useful financial and secretariat support mechanism for the project, has not provided the overall technical leadership it requires (though it is unclear whether USAID expected WWF to exercise such leadership). WWF has also failed to complete two of the four components of its present cooperative agreement (new wildlife legislation and development of a GMA information base). Various recommendations are made, and several scenarios for continued USAID involvement are offered.  The recommended option is a one-year extension leading into a follow-on project.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","8/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Natural resource management|Natural resource conservation|Wildlife resources|Protected wildlife areas|Rural populations|Institutional aspects|Management aspects|Decentralization|Local groups|Community participation|Private organizations","Zambia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABL872.pdf","7,707 KB","008627 - USAID.

"Evaluates the Local Government Unit (LGU) Performance Program (LPP), a component of the Integrated Family Planning (FP) and Maternal Health Program in the Philippines.  The LPP provided performance-based grants and TA to LGUs based on their achievement of yearly benchmarks in decentralized provision of FP services.  Evaluation covers the period 1993-95. In the area of program start-up, LPP assisted the Department of Health (DOH) in selecting and training LGUs and their staff.  A total of 30 LGUs participated in LPP during 1994-1995, with 400 local, national, and regional personnel benefiting from 12 workshops in LPP requirements, technical and management aspects of the program, FP policies and strategies, etc.  In addition, several guides for LGU managers were produced and disseminated. LGU management development activities have included:  guidance in and subsidies for the conduct of local planning meetings; more than 180 TA and monitoring visits to LGUs; establishment after consultation with all concerned parties of start-up and capacity-building performance benchmarks for years 1-3 of the program; establishment of planning standards, review guidelines, and a review committee, along with a system for monitoring benchmarks and LGU performance; and assistance to the DOH in documenting achievement of benchmarks, resulting in the disbursement of the equivalent of some $3 million in performance grants in 1995. Efforts in building management capacity at the national level have included establishment of a high-level LPP Advisory Committee to consider policy and program decisions; studies on the roles and responsibilities of the regional offices and the DOH program management structure; and provision of policy guidance on a variety of issues ranging from the promotion of natural family planning to the definition of terms such as Married Women of Reproductive Age. Lessons learned are detailed in three categories:  factors that make local governments successful implementors; performance-based disbursement; and sustainability.  Lessons regarding success factors are as follows:  (1) The commitment of the local chief executive (governor, mayor) and of senior health/population staff is an important, though difficult to measure, ingredient of success.  (2) The LPP coordinator can be equally effective regardless of whether he/she is from the Population, Health, or the Program Planning and Development Office.  (3) Broad participation at the LGU level is necessary for decentralized management to work.  (4) A process-oriented approach to building LGU management capacity works better than task- or program-oriented assistance.  (5) Clear national-level guidance on policies and standards is essential for effective program implementation.  The role of national services is to develop this information and monitor its application in the field.  (6) Close monitoring and intensive TA are required at the start, and yield results.  (7) Provinces must have clear and collaborative relationships with municipalities. Lessons regarding performance-based disbursement:  (1) Not all LGUs have equal capacity; hence, creating common performance indicators can be difficult.  (2) Plans based on budget allocations set in advance promote accountability.  (3) Performance grants need to reward good performance.  (4) Successful implementation of plans and achievement of benchmarks depends on prompt receipt of funds.  (5) Management by benchmark does not replace all other management decision making needs. (6) Benchmarks can provide management objectives that work.  (7) LGUs that do not perform must be held accountable. Lessons on sustainability.  (1) Regional offices must adopt greater responsibility for LPP implementation and management. (2) LPP must be perceived as owned by the Philippines, not as donor-driven.  (3) The DOH should harmonize approaches for donor assistance to LGUs in the areas of FP, child survival, and population.  (4) The Commission on Population (POPCOM) and regional/local population offices need to be further integrated into LPP processes.  (5) Implementation must go forward at a pace that permits adequate monitoring of DOH and benchmark compliance. (6) DOH services must assume greater responsibility for TA, plan review, and monitoring of program/plan implementation at the LGU level.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","DPE-3055-Q-00-0052-00","","9/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Nonproject assistance|Family planning services|Domestic government programs|Local level|Decentralization|Health care administration|Conditionality|Regional level","Philippines","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABL878.pdf","408 KB","000750 - Management Sciences for Health (MSH)","","008234 - USAID.

"Interventions to promote microenterprises take many forms -- financial intermediation through credit and savings, social institutions such as village banking and solidarity groups, market intermediation through policy reform and subsector programs, and enterprise-level efforts such as management training and technology transfer.  This report presents a preliminary framework for assessing the impacts of such microenterprise interventions; the framework differs from conventional approaches in that it uses the household as a starting-point of analysis and for linking microenterprises to the broader economic environment.  Thus, chapter 2 describes the characteristics of microenterprises and their role in promoting household security and economic growth, while chapter 3 conceptualizes the relationship among microenterprises, households, individuals, and communities and describes two key concepts for understanding economic decisionmaking:  risk and assets.  Chapter 4 presents a preliminary framework for analyzing how the various forms of microenterprise interventions contribute to change at the household, enterprise, individual, and community levels.  Chapter 5 identifies indicators for measuring change at each level.  After a discussion in chapter 6 of methodological considerations, chapter 7 proposes recommendations for USAID (a series of impact assessments to document the development impact of assistance to microenterprises, operations research to develop valid, reliable, and feasible measures of impact), as well as priority areas for future study.","Project title: Program performance information for strategic|anagement (PRISM)","Special Evaluation","Documents","PDC-0085-C-00-1141-00","","3/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Microenterprises|Development projects|Impact assessment|Economic impact|Evaluation methodology|Methodology development|Economic growth|Households","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNABS523.pdf","3,065 KB","003970 - Management Systems International, Inc.

"In May 1994, the Philippine Department of Health (DOH) launched an innovative program among nationally retained hospitals entitled ""Hospitals as Centers of Wellness"" (HCWP).  Through this program, DOH hospitals began to assume a major role in disease prevention and health promotion, working hand in hand with their public health counterparts, and moving beyond their traditional cure-oriented focus.  This monograph describes HCWP, its implementation, and recommendations for its development. Designed on the basis of results of a baseline survey and pilot testing, HCWP aims at disease prevention and health promotion through a primary health care approach, with emphasis on education and technology transfer, healthy lifestyles, and social equity.  The program, through its comprehensive approach, transforms hospitals into ""Centers of Wellness,"" characterized by the ""six Cs"":  comprehensive health care, competent, caring and compassionate, culture-friendly, community-oriented, and clean and green.  In the view of the author, determination of the true economic costs and benefits of disease prevention and health promotion in hospitals can greatly affect the efficacy and well-roundedness of health financing schemes propounded by the DOH, particularly the national Health Insurance Program recently enacted into law.

"PACR of a program (8/91-3/95) to promote an agricultural diversification strategy to reduce the Dominican economy's dependence on banana exports. Each of the five planned outputs were accomplished:  a comprehensive agricultural diversification strategy was developed and is still being implemented by the Dominican government and its private sector partners; there is now one national level joint public/private sector steering committee for diversification projects and a series of less formal working groups focused on specific crops or projects; the government passed a decree allowing non-banana producers access to banana marketing infrastructure, and also closed down and sold off or leased non-essential banana industry facilities to private processors and/or producers; the government passed a decree allowing private sector access to government packing facilities; and an in-house evaluation of the diversification program was completed and some important recommendations for the local currency funded activities are being implemented by the Dominican government. As a result, the program has created a climate more favorable to agricultural diversification and export promotion and has greatly expanded the capacity of both public and private sectors for analyzing, planning, and implementing policy reforms and activities in support of crop diversification and export promotion.  Moreover, the Dominican government developed and continues to implement with local currency its own, complementary activities, including programs to support new and rehabilitated planting, postharvest marketing activities, livestock development, and farm to market roads. Lessons learned are similar to those learned under similar programs and projects undertaken under the Caribbean Basin Initiative.  (1) Where government policies and regulations are impediments to crop diversification and investment/export promotion, the best strategy is to remove such barriers and to promote private sector investment.  (2) This program's approach attacks the problem(s) from several directions and provides more than one type of resource (i.e., both U.S. and local currency) to support program objectives.  (3) Well-designed programs are easier to manage and require less staff and other resources to make them work than do old style development assistance projects. (4) Under this program, one could clearly see all of the linkages among various program activities and resources.  Conditions precedent were met, signifying that the government had removed barriers to private sector led investment, resulting in disbursment to the GOCD of U.S. dollars which in turn were bought by the private sector to import needed equipment and supplies from the United States; this in turn generated local currency which was used to support crop diversification and export promotion activities by and for small farmers and private industry.  (5) Well-designed and managed non-federal audits are one of the most useful tools available to project officers and Mission management.  The lack of such audits early in the life of the program resulted in compliance problems and delays in disbursements and overall program activities that should not have occurred.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Export promotion|Agricultural diversification|Bananas|Nonproject assistance|Private sector|Agribusiness|Agricultural markets","Dominica","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABL898.pdf","304 KB","007707 - USAID.

"Six USAID biodiversity conservation projects implemented between 1980 and 1992 and aimed at promoting in situ conservation of forest and marine resources in their natural habitats are reviewed. In Costa Rica, Jamaica, and Sri Lanka, USAID supported creating and managing new official parks and protected areas. In Madagascar, Nepal, and Thailand, USAID provided grants to NGOs working with communities around existing protected areas. Program performance was as follows. (1) USAID has contributed directly to the inventory of protected habitats in countries where creation of protected areas has been an objective. Still, many officially protected areas are threatened by degradation and fragmentation. (2) The six projects demonstrate that investments are needed not only in facilities and infrastructure (e.g., staff lodging, communications equipment, trails, interpretive facilities), but also in human and institutional capacity to prepare management plans, restore degraded habitats, and inventory and monitor wildlife populations. (3) The projects show that awareness of the value of biodiversity conservation can be quickly raised, but changes in practices require sustained and long-term efforts at introducing new livelihood activities for rural dwellers. Also, NGOs chosen to run integrated conservation and development programs often require time and resources to build skills in rural development, organization, and technical agriculture. (4) USAID's early biodiversity conservation efforts demonstrate that economic and financial incentives will be critical to sustainability of biological diversity. Common candidates for reform are national economic policies (such as timber export subsidies) that foster destructive resource extraction practices. Experiments with environmental trusts and visitor fee systems have proven promising. Four strategic approaches to the conservation of biodiversity emerged from the review. (1) Create officially designated protected areas by setting aside terrestrial and marine habitats, securing public title to and control over protected areas, and planning protected-area systems. (2) Improve protection and management of habitat resources by developing management plans, improving operations where habitats serve as parks, monitoring ecological conditions, assisting in natural regeneration of degraded habitats, and generating revenues to finance conservation-area management and operations. (3) Integrate community development and biodiversity conservation activities in areas surrounding protected habitats by increasing local awareness, organizing bordering communities to promote environmental awareness, and introducing new livelihood activities as alternatives to encroaching on protected habitats. (4) Reform national policies that affect biodiversity conservation by improving public and policymaker understanding of the value of biological resources, introducing economic and financial incentives or legal reforms that encourage protection of natural habitats and their biological resources, and orchestrating partnerships between government and nongovernmental conservation groups.","Summary highlights: Stemming the loss of biological diversity : an assessment of USAID support for protected-areas management (PN-ABS-532)","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","8/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Natural resource conservation|Biological diversity|Ecosystems|In situ conservation|Protected environmental areas|Protected wildlife areas","Costa Rica|Jamaica|Sri Lanka|Madagascar|Nepal|Thailand","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNABS518.pdf","98 KB","008058 - USAID.

"Evaluates Business Development Services (BDS) programs implemented in Argentina and Uruguay by the International Executive Service Corps (IESC) and aimed at establishing joint ventures between host country and U.S. businesses.  Final evaluation covers the period 4/93-4/95.  Direct bilateral assistance to both countries will be terminated by the end of FY 1995. Overall, the programs failed to reach their objectives.  Both programs were funded both by USAID/W and by their respective mission, and major differences of opinion between the USAID managers of these funding sources as to project approach and deployment of human resources resulted in substantial conflicts regarding program structure, management, and staffing, and had a material effect on the progress of the projects.  No joint ventures were completed and there were little, if any, positive results. A number of lessons were learned.  (1) BDS programs should not be undertaken unless there is at least one experienced full-time person in-country who is accountable to IESC.  (2) If different parts of USAID provide funding for different parts of the BDS program, the USAID executives must reach agreement on how best to allocate resources in order to optimize program performance.  (3) Since sector selection is the first step in the BDS process, IESC should never relegate this activity to a Chamber of Commerce (as it did in Uruguay), USAID, or anyone else; IESC should play the leadership role.  (4) Given the complex and continuously iterative nature of joint venture formation, BDS projects should be programmed for not less than 3-5 years.  (5) Because of their lack of familiarity with external markets, most small and medium companies in both developing countries and advanced developing countries (ADCs) are poorly equipped to visualize the range of possibilities that could be generated through collaboration with a U.S. company; the Volunteer Executive is the key to solving this problem.  (6) A standard schedule of graduated fees, plus a ""success fee"", should be adopted for all ADC programs.  (7) IESC should rethink its concept of presenting one company at a time to host-country prospective partners.  (8) BDS programs must have objectives that are clear, understood, and accepted by all players.  (9) IESC should continue to be flexible regarding its in-country arrangements, modifying its ""Chamber of Commerce"" model whenever this seems most appropriate to the particular country involved.  (10) The BDS program should avoid raising unreasonable expectations of results among clients and donors alike.  (11) IESC should develop and budget for significantly increased communications with its host country clients.  (12) Lawful exports to the United States should not automatically be ruled out as a target market for BDS-generated joint ventures.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","4/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Business enterprises|Joint ventures|Business formation|Development project management|USAID|Development project implementation|Private voluntary organizations|Business support services","Argentina|Uruguay","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABL942.pdf","7,267 KB","001335 - Chemonics International Consulting Div.","","008621 - USAID.

"Interim evaluation of a project component to strengthen financial markets in Sri Lanka.  Evaluation covers the period 5/92-10/95. The project has already completed a number of its objectives, and is on its way to realizing those that remain.  The TA and training it has provided to emerging financial institutions have strengthened their technical and operational capabilities and have resulted in the introduction of a number of new instruments into the market.  The activities supported by the project are likely to be continued and further developed by the institutional structures that have been put in place. One of the project's most successful aspects has been enhancement of the Post Trade Automation System at the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE). USAID assistance has enabled the CSE to increase the efficiency and the integrity of clearing and settlement systems and to cope with the substantially increased volumes of trading experienced during the early part of 1994. In the course of developing a market for Quoted Debt Securities, the project has secured a policy consulting role at the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) and has provided the CBSL with considerable technical and training assistance, including preparation of policy papers to modify the CBSL's secondary window and repurchase operations (CBSL is expected to implement the principal proposals in 8/95).  The project also assisted the CBSL in a program to focus on the merits of diversifying the portfolio of Sri Lanka's national pension fund, the Employees' Provident Fund. With regard to Industry Training and Certification of Securities Markets Professionals, the project has conducted 34 seminar programs for over 850 participants, sponsored 14 study tours to foreign stock exchanges and regulatory institutions, and initiated the Chartered Financial Analysts (CFA) Program, which has enable 69 candidates to sit for the CFA Levels I-III examinations in June 1995. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of Sri Lanka and the CSE have pursued regulation and self-regulation activities.  The primary condition precedent for the project, a cess (user tax) levied on share transactions in the secondary market, has provided a funding source to help ensure the SEC's sustainability.  TA has been provided in several areas, including the consolidation of rules and regulations related to security markets.  The project now needs to focus on strengthening the SEC's and CSE's surveillance function. Financial reporting standards have shown rapid development over the past 2 years. Lanka (ICASL) has developed a technical and research unit, which examines accounting and auditing standards, and which has helped the ICASL to develop standards in preparation for the demands likely to be imposed on it by the Accounting Standards Monitoring Board. The following are lessons learned.  (1) USAID's support for capital markets development is fully consistent with its mandate to promote broad-based sustainable economic growth.  (2) Effective regulatory institutions are critical to the success of emerging capital markets. (3) The introduction of the Central Depository System (CDS), which has led to scripless trading, has had a significant impact on Sri Lanka's capital market.  (4) Emerging markets in developing countries compete among themselves and then on a regional basis rather than globally.  (5) The development of an efficient government debt securities market is essential to developing a private debt securities market.  (6) Privatization and capital markets development programs are synergistic in Sri Lanka.  (7) Demand-driven, cost-shared assistance to emerging financial institutions is an effective TA mechanism.  (8) A comprehensive financial training program, such as the CFA program, can be implemented long distance and be successful locally if closely managed and professionally implemented.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","10/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Capital markets|Financial institutions|Privatization|Institution building|Certification","Sri Lanka","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABL943.pdf","2,241 KB","007595 - KPMG Peat Marwick","","008606 - USAID.

"Evaluates efforts under Phase II of the Canal Cities Water and Sewerage Project to strengthen the capacities of the Suez Canal Authority (SCA) and governorate wastewater departments (WWDs) to provide operation and maintenance (O&M) of the physical facilities installed under the project.  The evaluation covers the period 6/91-9/95. Due to the length of time needed to change reactive management systems to pro-active ones, few tasks have been completed. Nonetheless, all tasks have made significant progress and have been enthusiastically endorsed by project clients.  These include the establishment of a Steering Committee, which has fostered cooperation between the WWDs/governorates and facilitated the negotiation of city contracts for O&M of the wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) by the SCA.  The project has also ensured governorate/city ownership of the WWTPs and prepared a ""tariff model"" which uses the cost-of-service approach and can be used to identify and prioritize cost-saving actions.  In 4/95, the SCA established separate Water Accounting units to be the focus of major revenue enhancement interventions in metering/billing/collection, financial planning, and tariff setting. The project has improved cost-effectiveness by developing hydraulic models for the water systems and by implementing a successful water conservation education program; promoted operational improvements by inducing interest in developing cross-connection control, lead elimination, and source protection programs at the SCA; organized all stores, developing inventory control systems that incorporate materials management capability; and successfully completed (and continues to implement) training-of-trainers programs in O&M. In 9/94, recognizing the difficulty of implementing the project through 7 distinct management units rather than through centralized management as originally planned, USAID modified the project to emphasize completion of the model WWD and SCA unit in Suez for replication in Ismailia and Port Said.  USAID should strongly consider a project extension to effect this replication, particularly since SCA, which is generally acknowledged as the best-managed and -funded authority in Egypt's water/wastewater sector, has, after several years working with the project contractor, embraced project-developed technologies.  Completing the full package of the interventions agreed to by SCA and the contractor would be the most effective way to demonstrate these efficiency tools to the rest of Egypt.  A general lesson to be drawn from this is that even under ideal circumstances institutional development projects focusing on an entire sector and serving significant municipalities should be long enough to allow not only the development and practice of new systems, but also follow-up activities, under contractor supervision, aimed at ensuring the optimal use of the powerful new systems.","Delivery order no. 13","Special Evaluation","Documents","AEP-0085-I-00-2060-00","","9/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Water supply structures|Wastewater|Water supply structure maintenance|Capital projects|Institution building|Public administration|Government departments|Municipal level|Canals","Egypt","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABL944.pdf","741 KB","005886 - Datex, Inc.","","008539 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of a project to develop new and improved contraceptive methods for use in developing countries (CONRAD project). The project is implemented by Eastern Virginia Medical School. Evaluation covers the period 1986-9/95 against an extended PACD of 5/97. Originally designed to bring promising, near-term leads from the basic research sector into clinical trials, CONRAD's mandate was expanded within the first few years to include research on heterosexual HIV/AIDS transmission, epidemiological and behavioral factors affecting transmission, and development of methods to reduce transmission of HIV/sexually transmitted diseases (STDs).  Responding to the recommendations of the 1989 mid-term evaluation, there has been a substantial increase in funding for extramural projects, intramural basic research has been scaled back, and priority has been shifted to proposals offering near-term leads.  The project's effectiveness has been enhanced by its relatively small size and by the high quality and commitment of its staff, and effective systems are in place for coordinating activities with those of other USAID cooperating agencies as well as with other U.S., international, and developing country institutions. CONRAD will soon have brought three new barrier methods to the contraceptive market.  It has also produced promising leads in methods for lactating women, a new vaginal film product (BZK), and some promise for male methods.  An important achievement has been the intramural development of tests for spermicidal agents and support of the Southern Research Institute (SRI) for virucidal screening.  The recently funded TOPCAD (Topical Prevention of Conception and Disease) project should bring improved coordination to the screening program and add screening for anti-gonococcal and chlamydial activity. The addition of HIV/AIDS research has complemented the contraceptive research program.  CONRAD's successful development of a simian model of heterosexual transmission, as well as its contributions to understanding of the physiology of HIV infection in the human genital tract, provide important avenues for better evaluating the impact of contraceptive methods on disease transmission. Several areas for improvement are noted.  It is strongly recommended that CONRAD establish a small strategic planning or policy unit to ensure development of long-term plans, oversight of Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) appointments, and annual program review; such a unit is critical to CONRAD's institutional visibility.  It is also recommended that:  (1) better and clearer mechanisms be established to ensure responsiveness to developing country needs; (2) the USAID mandate for rapid product development be relaxed in order to increase opportunities for exploration of long-term leads; and (3) the HIV/AIDS portfolio be streamlined and more clearly focused. Expecting the program to increase its already considerable contributions to the field of fertility regulation and reproductive health, the evaluation team strongly recommends that the CONRAD program be extended for another 10 years and that this continuation not be competed.

"Final external evaluation of a program to promote maternal child health/family planning (MCH/FP) services and to reduce the spread of HIV/AIDS in Ghana.  The evaluation covers the period 1990-9/95 against a PACD of 3/96. The program has been successful.  It has exceeded its goal by decreasing the total fertility rate from 6.4 in 1988 to 6.1 by 1995, and should, by the PACD, reach its goal of increasing the use of modern contraceptive methods by 15%.  In addition, the Ministries of Health (MOH) and of Finance and Economic Planning (MFEP) are increasingly claiming ownership of the MCH/FP program, and to a lesser extent, the HIV/AID program; MOH budgeting and planning skills and confidence have grown stronger; quality assurance has become a concern of service providers and policy makers. Specific achievements include the following.  (1) Although delays in the release of nonproject assistance (NPA) funds hindered implementation, all conditions precedent set as terms for tranche releases were met, resulting in a number of policy reforms, including establishment of the National Population Council (NPC), preparation of a comprehensive set of action plans for policy implementation, and reclassification of contraceptive products to be legally offered by a wider array of distributors.  (2) The MOH's Health Education Unit (HEU) coordinated an outstanding public-private sector family planning and HIV/AIDS information campaign, although airing of media messages was thwarted to an extent by a vocal minority who felt the ads might encourage promiscuity -- a problem which might have been avoided if the mass media campaign had been legitimized by the public sector. (3) More than 7,100 private and public sector trainers, communicators, and service providers were trained.  (4) The MOH used NPA funds and program-provided contraceptives to substantially increase FP coverage, and to improve supervision, management information, outreach, and service integration.  (5) The social marketing component underwent organizational change, the long-term impacts of which are yet uncertain. The dramatic increases in couple years of protection achieved under the project have occurred more in the MOH component than in the social marketing component, where levels have remained relatively constant, probably due to the emphasis on short-term methods. (6) HIV/AIDS activities are being integrated into the MOH's core programs and there seems to be a significant improvement in specific knowledge about HIV/AIDS and condom use.  IEC related to HIV/AIDS prevention has been integrated into MOH programs, the social marketing program, and 18 NGOs. Additionally, the Ministries of Information, Education, Mobilization, and Social welfare, as well as the Ghana Armed Forces, were involved in IEC initiatives.  (7) The Accra branch of the Public Health Research Laboratory has been completed, equipped, and staffed.  The building and equipping of four other laboratories should be completed by the PACD.","Companion evaluation summary: PD-ABM-684|Project title: Population technical assistance (POPTECH)","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","CCP-3024-Q-00-3012-00","","9/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Family planning promotion programs|Maternal child health care|Disease prevention and control|HIV/AIDS|Nonproject assistance|Family planning services|Contraceptive distribution","Ghana","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABL947.pdf","1,573 KB","008485 - Basic Health Management International (BHM)|001131 - The Futures Group International, Inc.

"Mid-term evaluation (7/91-10/95) of a project to strengthen the capacity of Jamaica's National Family Planning Board (NFPB) to sustain its family planning (FP) promotion program following USAID's phase-out. The project is well-designed, with many ambitious subprojects aimed at creating change in specific areas.  Much progress has been made in some areas, while others need continued attention. The project has increased the contraceptive prevalence rate (CPR) from 55% in 1989 to 62% in 1993; conducted an impressive array of outstanding policy research and analysis, on which most FP programming has been based; and initiated Women's Center projects, which have elicited an enthusiastic response from the adolescent community and their parents in the limited areas where the projects are operating. The NFPB has successfully implemented, island-wide, the Top-Up Contraceptive Logistics Delivery System, which has improved recordkeeping, is popular with clinic staff, and has all but eliminated stock-outs. In addition, the project has completed the design and implementation of the major part of the Contraceptive Tracking System (CTS), which is utilized by the NFPB warehouse staff.  The USAID phase-out (NFPB phase-in) for contraceptive procurement is proceeding on schedule, and contraceptives have been entered as a line item in the Government of Jamaica (GOJ) budget.  In 11/92, the NFPB met the USAID conditions precedent to divest the Commercial Distribution of Contraceptives Program.  This opened the door to assistance from the Social Marketing for Change (SOMARC) Project's assistance in starting the Personal Choice Social Marketing Program, which has undertaken a wide range of successful activities including training, extensive mass media campaigns, and public relations.  In 11/94, the conditions precedent were met for the funding of the Family Life Education Program (FLE); the subproject proposal has been finalized and is awaiting official authorization.  Two new computers have been acquired and installed, the Service Statistics Software has been installed and is operational, and a management information system (MIS) training workshop was held 10/93. However, the project faces some constraints.  (1) In order for the NFPB to lobby successfully for the GOJ's continued financial and material support, it needs more time to develop advocacy skills. However, the Options for Population Policy Project (OPTIONS II) buy-in ends 9/95.  (2) The hiring of a logistics manager, which has been recommended repeatedly for years, has not been done, although the position has been advertised. Constraints are related to position and salary approval from the Ministry of Public Service and reluctance of some NFPB staff to relinquish some of their responsibilities.  (3) The NFPB is not able to conduct forecasting and procurement procedures independently; further TA must focus on technology transfer rather than service provision.  (4) Three separate logistics systems are running concurrently:  the main NFPB system, one for Depo-Provera, and one for condoms purchased for the Epidemiology Unit of the Ministry of Health (MOH).  This complicates the forecasting and procurement of commodities. (5) The functions that would have been served by subcommittees of the Board of Directors (financial oversight, medical expertise to consider ideal method mix and means to shift toward it, and direct attention to sustainability issues) are not being performed because those subcommittees have not been appointed.  Further, the Minister of Health has not yet appointed a full board of directors who would appoint the subcommittees.

"Evaluates project to improve access to and use of family planning and maternal and child health (FP/MCH) services in Bangladesh. Interim evaluation covers the period 8/87-8/95. The project, one of the largest of its kind in the world, has significantly supported the Bangladesh National FP Program, especially by strengthening the private sector, and clearly demonstrates the power of USAID's intellectual and technical leadership in this arena. Overall, objectives have been achieved or exceeded.  The total fertility rate (TFR) decreased from 5.8 in 1986 to 3.4 in 1993/94 versus a goal of moving from 4.6 in 1991 to 3.8 in 1997. The infant mortality rate (IMR) declined from 117 to 87 per 1,000 between the early 1980s and the early 1990s versus a goal of moving from 118 in 1991 to 107 in 1997, while the contraceptive prevalence rate (CPR) increased from 25.3% in 1986 to 44.6% in 1993/94 versus a goal of moving from 40% in 1991 to 50% in 1997. The CPR for modern methods essentially doubled between 1986 and 1993/94, from 18.4% to 36.2%.  The number of contraceptive users was estimated at 10.1 million in 1994; the goal is to move from 7.8 million in 1991 to 12.1 million in 1997.  Another goal is to increase the immunization of urban women and children from 25% in 1988 to 85% in 1997.  In 1994, the number of urban women immunized with two doses of tetanus toxoid (TT) was 82%. Urban immunization rates for children aged 12-23 months in the same year were 93% for BCG, 83% for DPT, 76% for measles, and 75% for full immunization.  Additionally, the under-five mortality rate declined from 180 to 133 between the early 1980s and the early 1990s.  While it is unknown whether the maternal mortality rate has changed, it is clear that the number of maternity-related deaths has been much lower due to the fertility decline:  if the TFR were still over 7, about 200,000 women who are alive today would have died from a maternity-related cause. The Local Initiatives Program has successfully improved local capacity to manage FP services, and has fostered community ownership of and responsibility for FP/MCH services.  Supply management has been improved through the training of over 11,000 workers in logistics management, although institutionalization of this ability within the FP Directorate (DFP) has been slow; efficiency also needs improvement.  The urban Expanded Program of Immunization (EPI) has successfully integrated multiple sources to set up fixed and outreach EPI centers, although the projected doubling of the urban population in the next 10 years makes urban health systems a urgent priority.  The component to improve satellite clinics was never implemented. The Social Marketing Company, the largest of its kind anywhere, made impressive progress between 1984 and 1994; it has already achieved end-of-project goals with respect to couple years of protection and condom and oral rehydration solution sales and is on track in training regional medical practitioners, though behind in training pharmacists and school children. NGOs have been key innovators in advancing the national program and influencing national policy, and the network of 115 NGOs providing FP/MCH services at 322 sites served 1.7 million users in 1994. NGOs have been particularly instrumental in expanding access to services for underserved groups and in expanding coverage both at existing sites and geographically. Key achievements of the support component have included provision of $7.1 million worth of contraceptives since 1987, and support for construction of 210 storerooms; a number of significant research and evaluation studies; and an impressive IEC program. The project's complexity and variety of local and international development partners make management very labor-intensive.  A follow-on project, which is recommended, should adopt a far simpler management structure and allow for more flexibility in allocating resources and a streamlined decision making process.","Companion evaluation summary: PD-ABM-521|Project title: Population technical assistance (POPTECH)","Special Evaluation","Documents","CCP-3024-Q-00-3012-00|CCP-3024-C-00-3011-00","","9/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Family planning promotion programs|Family planning services|Maternal child health care|Child survival activities|Beneficiary count","Bangladesh","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABL949.pdf","140 KB","008485 - Basic Health Management International (BHM)|001131 - The Futures Group International, Inc.

"Final evaluation of a project to   strengthen the institutional capacity of Partners of the Americas (POA) to promote development in Latin America and the Caribbean by strengthening its partnership organizations and promoting the development of indigenous volunteer organizations.  Evaluation covers the period 5/91-7/95 against a 12/95 PACD. The design of this project, likely the result of POA's evolution from core funding to a cooperative agreement, is overly ambitious and tries to glue together too many disparate interventions in the name of partnership development.  The resulting project is a clutter of training, TA, travel, and program grants that are not sustainable and lack clear focus. Thus, while POA has met most of its targets (despite an overall 11% budget cut), it is difficult to show that the project purpose was accomplished. Further, POA has only partially met certain objectives.  For example, there has been improvement in reporting but not in self-financing. POA's staff have been consolidated and respond effectively in support of the partnerships, but the regional centers were not strengthened. Instead, in a consolidating and cost-cutting effort, two of the three regional offices were closed.  It appears that appropriate and manageable program priorities were not established and this lack of focus has been a limitation to partnership and organizational development. The cooperative agreement was handicapped by a lack of creative leadership both within POA and at USAID.  Training opportunities lacked innovative approaches, workshops sacrificed in-depth technical content for breadth of topics, and follow-up and impact evaluation systems were only partially implemented at POA headquarters and not at all in the field. Despite these difficulties, there are highlights. POA partnership representatives have been instrumental in providing continuity to partnerships and supporting them as they undertake new programs and meet POA Standards of Excellence. Face-to-face interactions at training workshops have proved enriching for both the northern and southern partners.  Volunteer travel has been another invaluable training arena for both sides of the partnerships, creating programs that build on the strengths of one partner adapted to the reality of the other. POA has been successful at raising other USAID funds to cover some program activities, particularly democratic initiatives and agriculture. In-kind contributions also play an important role in Partners, and the cooperative agreement has generated a four to one in-kind contribution of roughly $13 million.   However, the termination of core grant funding at this time moment would result in an overall 10% budget cut for POA, which has not developed alternative funding sources for partnership development activities.  It is therefore recommended that USAID provide bridge funding for the next few years to allow POA to replace CA funding with a fee for service strategy in order to reach a certain modicum of self-financing.","Delivery order no. 14","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","AEP-0085-I-00-2060-00","","10/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Private voluntary organizations|Indigenous private voluntary organizations|Development cooperation|Networks|Institutional linkages|Institution building|Economic self sufficiency|Strategic planning","Latin America|Caribbean","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABL953.pdf","3,122 KB","005886 - Datex, Inc.","","009348 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of a project (9/92-6/95) to strengthen two model regenerative agricultural resource centers (RARCs) established by the Rodale Institute (RI) -- one in Senegal (S-RARC) in 1987, the other in Guatemala (G-RARC) in 1992.  The RARC model integrates applied/adaptive research and demonstration, networking and communications, and education and training -- all conducted by national staff within the Centers -- to promote regenerative agriculture. Both RARCs fully achieved some outputs, as well as others that were not anticipated.  RARC personnel have received highly effective training in two realms:  budgeting and accounting procedures; and logframing and workplanning.  Much more remains to be done in management information system (MIS) training and monitoring and evaluation (M&E) training, however. It is impossible to determine to what extent RARC activities have met their overall purpose of increasing the use of regenerative agriculture. The RARCs have indeed enhanced their capacity to collect, analyze, and interpret various kinds of data, to monitor and evaluate impacts, and to systematically report on their findings, but they have yet to make a concerted effort to monitor and assess the adoption and diffusion of the technologies they are extending.  In addition, while the RARCs have carried out massive training, outreach, and extension efforts (in the process involving many other NGOs and governmental organizations as well as producers) lack of functioning MIS and M&E systems makes it impossible to assess these efforts. Both RARCs are to be congratulated for forming effective formal and informal partnerships with research, extension, and environment-and-development entities, both public and private. Such linkages can only augment and extend RARC influence and impacts. The sustainability and replicability of the RARC model depends on the RARCs' ability to secure funding from a variety of sources. To attract more donor attention, the RARCs will have to pay more attention to women in development issues (efficiency and equity arguments aside, this is a practical necessity in today's environment-and-development climate) and to demonstrate that they can monitor and evaluate their own activities. Lessons learned from the project are (1) the importance of flexibility in replicating the RARC model (a flexibility RI is demonstrating in establish a new RARC in Russia), and (2) the need for each RARC to review and if necessary revise its mission statement in a effort to define its niche among development agencies.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","OTR-0158-C-00-0143-00","","6/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Research centers|Agricultural research|Agricultural extension|Sustainable agriculture|Institution building","Guatemala|Senegal","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABL955.pdf","2,696 KB","002892 - Automation Research Systems, Ltd.","","007746 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to increase the capacity of Dominican PVOs and NGOs to deliver services and other resources to the poor in USAID/DR's strategic objective areas.  Mid-term evaluation covers the period 9/89-5/95. The project is roughly 50% complete, and on track in terms of resource allocation.  Of the 35 planned subproject grants, 18 have been awarded in such areas as job training, health, potable water and sanitation, and income and employment generating opportunities to reduce poverty.  Of the 400,000 planned beneficiaries, 200,000 have been reached; and 20 of the 30 planned NGOs have received help in project preparation and implementation and financial, and administrative issues. The project supports the majority of USAID/DR strategic objectives, and all subprojects reach the very poor, with five designed exclusively for women. A system for subgrant development design, technical analysis, and financial management is in place, and some training and TA have been provided to PVOs. Rigorous and fair (albeit time-consuming) criteria, surveys, and procedures have been set up for selecting and awarding subproject grants.  The whole process has had a salutary effect on participating NGOs' capability to design subprojects and prepare grant applications.  All three institutional units (Project Management Unit, ENTRENA, Banco de Desarrollo Dominicano) function well within the context of their specific and limited contracts, and coordination among the three is good. Some of the assumptions in the very general original logical framework are not accurate.  NGOs did not have the management capabilities assumed, do not have sufficient resources to provide counterpart contributions, and the larger and more established NGOs are not willing to assist smaller ones with project preparation and administration. Incorrect assumptions have had a minor effect on the project, and have not necessitated design modifications.  Another potential problem is that national NGOs do not appreciate what they perceive as harsh new USAID/DR guidelines which include not financing vehicle acquisitions and the requirement that NGOs find 50% counterpart financing elsewhere.  In addition, progress towards achieving sustainability is spotty; many NGOs use inefficient and ineffective service delivery systems, and there is a significant possibility that the majority of the service delivery systems will weaken or even disappear after the PACD.  As a result, some community participants feel that the communities themselves must be strengthened so they can carry out activities once the project is terminated.","Spanish ed.: PD-ABM-019|Companion evaluation summary: PD-ABM-939","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","9/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Indigenous private voluntary organizations|Institution building|Development projects|Women|Democracy|Management aspects|Project sustainability","Dominican Republic","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABM018.pdf","176 KB","003970 - Management Systems International, Inc.

"Final evaluation of a program (1989-3/95) to improve public sector child survival services in the Philippines. Program implementation was effective, well-coordinated, and highly accountable.  All benchmarks were met, resulting in tangible policy reforms, including:  (1) increased prioritization of child survival; (2) identification of underserved areas and effective, decentralized health planning from the bottom up; (3) implementation of a well-chosen core package of maternal/child health interventions, including Control of Acute Respiratory Infection (CARI), which was new to the Philippines, and family planning, which was revived after a period of stagnant implementation; (4) a comprehensive IEC strategy utilizing various media to increase consumer demand and promote improved health behaviors; and (5) strengthening of supervision through integrated, criteria-based supervisory systems and health information systems. Significant measurable gains in child survival service delivery occurred, particularly with respect to immunization, ORT, and CARI. These gains appear to have greatly decreased child mortality; the years 1988-94 evinced a consistent and credible pattern of decreased infant/child deaths from pneumonia, diarrhea, and immunizable diseases. The greatest impact appears to have been in decreased ARI deaths, most likely due to the combined effect of the new CARI initiative, improved measles immunization coverage, Vitamin A capsule distribution, and other nutritional interventions.  The reduction in ARI deaths was in the 25%-50% range, resulting in over 10,000 infant/child deaths averted per year. The Department of Health leveraged other donor assistance and Government of Philippine (GOP) resources in implementing the program, and the recurrent costs of improved service delivery have been effectively absorbed by the GOP.  Substantive work on health care financing, begun under the program, continues. During the program, a major event occurred with far-reaching effects on the entire health system -- the devolution of authority for health services from the DOH to Local Government Units (LGUs), which was fully implemented in 1993 after program disbursements and benchmarks were completed.  Hence, program sustainability will depend on the success of the devolution process.  Unfortunately, the response of the DOH as an institution has been less than adequate -- both conceptually and operationally.  Moreover, technical/functional linkages between the DOH and devolved health personnel were inadvertently severed along with the loss of administrative line authority. Consequently, rather than a reconfigured health system, there is a shattered and fragmented one; rather than new relationships between the DOH and devolved health personnel, there is an absence of relationship.  Technical supervision, monitoring, and support to the rural health units and barangay health stations have been substantially weakened, and hospital services are increasingly isolated from preventive and primary services. Lessons learned are as follows.  (1) A performance-based disbursement mode, rather than project assistance, can be a highly effective means of achieving health sector goals in settings such as the Philippines, where there is broad donor-host government consensus on needed reforms, a sincere commitment to implementing these reforms, and a highly capable and trained implementing agency.  (2) Implementation of a few well-chosen health policy reforms can contribute to reductions in mortality in as little as 5 years.  (3) Decentralization of health services, particularly when carried beyond the administrative confines of a ministry or department of health, requires major conceptual, operational, and structural readjustments on the part of that institution.  (4) Changes in lines of administrative control may destroy essential technical linkages unless a conscious effort is made to redefine them in a new context.  (5) Service-delivery indicators need to be selected with care, and investments made at the outset to obtain accurate baseline measures and ensure that baseline and endline measurements are comparable and reliable.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","3/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Child health care|Child survival activities|Nonproject assistance|Health policy|Policy reform|Beneficiary count","Philippines","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABM027.pdf","2,889 KB","","","008592 - USAID.

"Mid-term evaluation of activities implemented in Russia under a project to improve environmental management in the New Independent States.  The project is being implemented by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  Evaluation covers the period 5/93-9/95. For political and foreign policy reasons, the project was designed hurriedly, resulting in management problems and confusion about the roles of USAID and EPA. EPA was initially reluctant to accept USAID's leadership role.  Internally, both agencies could have organized themselves better, with USAID delegating authority sooner to its field mission and EPA consolidating project tasks in fewer offices under direction of its Office of International Activities.  Further, EPA should assign a project coordinator to Moscow as early as possible to facilitate communications with USAID and within EPA itself. Despite these problems, the project has initiated a number of worthwhile activities, which have begun to yield positive results, including preparations for air monitoring systems in Volgograd; establishment of a training institute in Ekaterinburg with the help of a U.S. PVO; public awareness activities via a local NGO in Nizhnii Tagil; central government approval of a priority environmental program and budget, also in Nizhnii Tagil; legal research in Volgograd to assist in drafting improved environmental laws and policies; and excellent training programs in the United States and Russia, some funded under this project and some through other USAID funding. Less successful activities include those in the Moscow water district, where delays occurred as budgets were slowly worked out and numerous EPA experts or contractors made several seemingly unproductive visits to Russia.  The diagnostic approach and reportedly non-collaborative style of some activities in Nizhnii Tagil and the Moscow region frustrated Russian counterparts, who felt that they were not given credit for their expertise and were impatient with delays in gaining usable U.S. recommendations and access to U.S. technology.  In focusing on technical issues, subprojects in the Moscow area and Nizhnii Tagil largely ignored economic factors. In addition, commodities did not always arrive when needed, there has been minimal linking of components of this project internally and with other complementary activities in Russia, and only limited progress has been made in developing new private sector opportunities and potential joint ventures between Russian and U.S. enterprises. So far there is limited evidence of sustainability and replicability of EPA subprojects, nor is there a strategy for institution-building. This should be taken into consideration during future funding decisions.","Russian ed.: PD-ABM-651","Special Evaluation","Documents","AEP-5451-I-24-2049-00","","9/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Environmental management|Development project design|Development project management|Government departments","Russia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABM029.pdf","365 KB","003970 - Management Systems International, Inc.

"Evaluates cooperative development program with Israel's Ministry for Foreign Affairs (MASHAV) to promote agricultural development in the Central Asian Republics (CAR) and Georgia.  The evaluation covers the period 1992-1995. Project objectives are being met through a combined program of training and TA.  The program is meeting MASHAV and host country development goals, as well as some USAID goals related to privatization, and is providing a useful opportunity for Israeli embassies to carry out a successful development program, thus enhancing their stature. Training provided in Israel is well-received and helps to inform participants of development progress made in recent years. Participants interviewed were pleased with the courses but suggested that they include more training in economics, management, marketing, and entrepreneurship.  Some on-the-job training was suggested for some participants.  The program is reaching the desired audience of trainees and effective course follow-up is in place. Two demonstration farms are on schedule, two are behind schedule but making progress, one has made little progress to date, and one has not been initiated.  Operations with a quick economic return, such as mini-dairies, have been readily accepted. Computers are being effectively used on at least two herds to maintain dairy records. Operations where the expert works with the local counterpart have performed best.  Regarding ""Buy America"" requirements, the procurement process has held up project timetables in at least two cases, either because equipment from the United States was slow to arrive or because waivers were difficult to obtain.  In addition, the U.S. equipment was less adaptable and more difficult to service and maintain than Israeli equipment. Project personnel have worked with other groups, including U.S. PVOs to share information.  These cooperative efforts have produced valuable documents for privatizing farms and for policymakers. Lessons learned include the following.  (1) Special care is needed in selecting demonstration sites in order to meet project work goals and to facilitate and streamline the work of long-term experts.  (2) Central Asia and Georgia present difficult conditions (theft, lack of funding by host, motivation), which are often more complicated than those experienced in some other developing countries.

"Final evaluation of a project (4/86-9/95) to create at Egerton University (EU) an agricultural education institution of excellence serving the needs of Kenya and other African countries and to establish an institutional relationship between EU and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC).  EU implemented the project without any full-time advisors, but with assistance from UIUC through a host country contract. Project implementation was complicated by the sudden upgrading of Egerton to a fully independent university, covering majors in addition to agriculture, and an increase in enrollment from 1,600 to over 6,000 in a 4-year time period.  Major conclusions are as follows.  (1) EU has established, reviewed, and revised (in a reasonably frequent manner) its academic curriculum.  EU faculty deserve high praise for setting up a full university with limited notice.  (2) Training of faculty and staff contributed to the development of EU as a center of excellence in agricultural sciences.  The project more than met its targets regarding graduate training of faculty.  (3) A long-term relationship between EU and UIUC has been established.  (4) Evidence regarding the demand for EU graduates is incomplete.  While those who find employment show a strong appreciation for the training provided by EU, in the current economic slowdown some degree holders are having trouble finding jobs.  It is imperative that an agriculture personnel needs assessment be carried out to determine the market demand by discipline for both undergraduate and postgraduate training.  (5) EU has expanded its research capacity through establishment of the Integrated Biotechnology Research Laboratory (IBRL).  (6) Its Agricultural Resource Center continues to host continuing education programs.  Regional in-service training in crop management research and training is in place.  (7) EU has made considerable progress in developing itself along the lines of the land grant model but still has to expand its efforts in research and extension to meet the goal of 25% of faculty time spent in some combination of these activities.  (8) Despite the widely accepted 1992 report detailing new financial management systems, actual development of these systems, particularly in the areas of computer and accounting systems, has not kept pace with EU's expansion.  This is due, in part, to insufficient resources, a need for external assistance, a possible loss of momentum with a change in senior staff, and the need for a more phased approach given the scale of changes needed.  (9) Because of the long-term relationship between USAID and EU and because of the value of EU's teaching, research, and extension, continued USAID support for the University is important. It is recommended that:  more commitment be given to EU's goal of agricultural appointments with 75% teaching and 25% research and/or extension; USAID give particular attention to the IBRL and to EU's ability to develop extension education packages for use by the Ministry of Agriculture; efforts be made to expand and modernize library resources and install E-mail in all research offices; and the strengthening of financial management be made both a priority and a precondition for future direct assistance to EU. The following are lessons learned.  (1) Two universities making a formal commitment to work towards the goal of establishing a long-term relationship is a valuable institutional building technique.  (2) Basic project management tasks emphasizing priority-setting should be applied formally, regardless of how successfully the implementation is progressing.  (3) This model of project implementation with no full-time chief of party could be replicated elsewhere under similar conditions: discrete and occasional project interventions; and a long relationship with a strong and improving beneficiary organization.","Delivery order no. 27|Project title: Implementing policy change (IPC)","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","AEP-5451-I-00-2049-00","","12/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Institution building|Institutional linkages|Agricultural colleges|Agricultural education","Kenya","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABM075.pdf","165 KB","003970 - Management Systems International, Inc.

"PACR of a project (6/89-9/95) to prevent and control the spread of AIDS in the Eastern Caribbean through surveillance, information, education, and intervention strategies.  The project was implemented by the Caribbean Epidemiology Centre (CAREC). The project has made significant progress in preventing and controlling the further spread of AIDS in the Eastern Caribbean. It has helped to establish national and regional HIV/AIDS/STD surveillance data collection systems, and helped participating Ministries of Health to develop a capability for tracking HIV/AIDS/STDs.  These efforts have contributed to the development of educational programs and multi-media public campaigns, which have increased the population's awareness of HIV/AIDS/STDs and the risk they pose to society.  Unfortunately, there remains a good deal of misunderstanding about the disease, and in fact the majority of people living with HIV/AIDS are being ostracized by their communities.  The project has also provided National AIDS Program staff in each participating country with training in planning, program development, and evaluation and costing methodologies, and it has significantly strengthened CAREC as a regional leader in HIV/AIDS/STD research. The following lessons were learned.  (1) The project design set CAREC up for failure by not giving it the authority needed to direct the numerous agencies contracted to support its efforts. (2) The project tried to accomplish too much in too short a time with too little expertise, and as a result, had to rely on outside agencies to accomplish its objectives.  (3) Close monitoring of the project's activities and progress and the use of what little leverage was available allowed RDO/C to refocus CAREC's project activities and to make the most of the project's final year.  (4) The stronger emphasis on behavioral interventions recommended for phase II did not materialize; more effective follow-up was required in assuring that technical resources of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control would be available to CAREC when requested.  (5) Although sufficient TA was provided under the project in the form of regional training, more follow-up at the community level would helped to consolidate gains in individual countries.  (6) Donor cooperation in the evaluation of similar or complementary project activities can lead to more effective results and insights than a single agency working alone.  (7) The role of technical consultants is not to make decisions for host-country personnel but to facilitate a process by which host-country personnel can make decisions for themselves.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","10/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","HIV/AIDS|Disease prevention and control|Sexually transmitted diseases|Epidemiology|Health education|IEC|Public awareness|Mass media|Personnel development|Development project design|Technical training|Donor coordination","Eastern Caribbean","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABM079.pdf","279 KB","001757 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (1989-9/94) to improve the capability of the Jamaican public and private sectors to develop and implement drug abuse prevention programs aimed at high-risk target groups, primarily youths between 12-25 years of age.  The project was implemented by the National Council on Drug Abuse (NCDA). The project was unsuccessful for several reasons.  (1) Instead of targeting high-risk groups, NCDA launched a national program by parish, which paid no attention to the needs of high-risk groups. (2) The goals of the grant agreement appear to have been overly ambitious; NCDA lacked the organizational structure to cope with the infusion of approximately 25 new staff and the demands of creating a new project organization within a short time period. (3) Some of the planned training was either not provided or was inadequate, including management training of NCDA staff and training of community, drug treatment, and rehabilitation workers in counseling and community prevention strategies.  In addition, training records were incomplete, and training impacts were not assessed.  (4) A financial review in 1992 identified a serious lack of internal controls at the NCDA and its subgrantee, Jamaica Western Partners (JWP). As a result of this financial review, the findings of the 9/92 evaluation, and the fact that counterpart funding figures provided by NCDA were unreliable, USAID stopped making advances to NCDA and JWP; therefore, counterpart contributions also ceased. In 9/93, Hi-Tech International (an 8A firm), and Westover were contracted to administer the remaining funds, and the project made some minor accomplishments; the very small funding levels provided were not sufficient to achieve success in such complex areas as drug abuse prevention and control. Hi-Tech and Westover provided support to two community-based organizations:  the Kingston Restoration Co. Teen Center, which provided a drug-free recreational and educational environment for teens; and FORCE -- Mount Zion Community, which facilitated community development of drug abuse prevention programs. The following lessons were learned.  (1) Conceptual issues should be clarified during project design to ensure that all parties are working under similar assumptions.  (2) Project design should reflect the institutional capabilities of the implementing agencies, and if they are inadequate, appropriate TA should be provided.  (3) When a country's research capacity is insufficient, TA to improve research should be provided at the project's outset.  Training in evaluation research may also be required to institutionalize capacity in this area.  (4) Short-term training has far exceeded the LOP estimated output. However, if the project design includes locally provided training in subject areas in which a local area lacks expertise, the project should improve local capacities through, for example, the provision of peer counseling techniques to a cadre of trainers prior to the implementation of local training.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","10/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Drug abuse education|Drug abuse|Beneficiary targeting|Youth","Jamaica","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABM089.pdf","138 KB","008563 - USAID.

"Evaluates grant to the American Institute for Free Labor Development (AIFLD) to strengthen democratic trade unions in Haiti.  Interim evaluation covers the period 1991-8/95. AIFLD was one of the few USAID grantees which was active in Haiti after the 1991 coup, a time when it was especially important to provide guidance and financial support to a fragile trade union movement. AIFLD's support is one of the reasons that unions survived, are now unified, and in general progressed during the years of the de facto government.  The movement is still weak, however, especially since the majority of urban members lost their jobs during the political and economic upheavals of the last several years.  With the virtual disappearance of the formal economy, few collective bargaining agreements are in force or are expected to be.  Unfortunately only limited progress was made in bringing women into the labor movement, although women make up a large portion of the assembly sector. Institution building has been an important contribution.  The AIFLD Country Director helped Haitian trade unions to create a network to survive the de facto government and plan programs to try and keep in contact with their membership.  Assistance was also provided to the Tripartite Commission to help union leaders have nonconfrontational exchanges with the government and the private sector. Director provides advice to unions whose members work (or used to) in son-to-be privatized companies.  However, basic management TA has not yet been provided to unions.  Since the return of President Aristide, AIFLD's principal major efforts have been in training labor leaders in preparation for the upcoming elections. AIFLD has sponsored three seminars attended by a total of 100 union leaders. AIFLD's management is deficient.  Its systems for planning, reporting, accounting, and monitoring and evaluation are inadequate, making accomplishments hard to document.  USAID/H did not immediately inform AIFLD or others of these deficiencies, due to the disruptions caused by the embargo and two staff evacuations.  Given these circumstances, it is highly likely that USAID's money could have been spent more effectively.  The evaluation recommends that AIFLD be required to put proper management systems in place and recommend a short-, medium-, and long-term strategy for this.  If AIFLD substantially improves the management and documentation of its program, and clearly defines a cohesive program for labor unions in Haiti, its continued support to labor is recommended.","Delivery order no. 14|Project title: Implementing policy change (IPC)","Special Evaluation","Documents","AEP-5451-I-00-2050-00","","8/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Trade unions|Internal conflict|Labor unions","Haiti","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABM090.pdf","1,723 KB","003761 - Thunder and Associates, Inc.","","008554 - USAID.

"Evaluates a cooperative agreement (CA) with the Program for Appropriate Technology in Health (PATH) to provide humanitarian health assistance to Ukraine in areas of diphtheria epidemic, juvenile diabetes, and hepatitis B infection.  Mid-term evaluation covers the period 6/94-6/95. PATH, whose roles and responsibilities have evolved and expanded well beyond what was defined in the CA, has met or exceeded most program targets.  Despite delays in implementation for reasons mostly outside of PATH's control, program impact is already discernable beyond what was anticipated. Although the diphtheria epidemic continues, the program has:  (1) safely delivered more than 11 million doses of Td toxoid, making USAID the largest single donor to the diphtheria control program; (2) collaborated with other donors in defining a new diphtheria control strategy calling for mass immunization of all adults aged 15-49; (3) introduced new approaches and technologies for maintaining the national cold chain; (4) encouraged the Ministry of Health (MOH) to revise existing policies and clinical practices related to diphtheria diagnosis and treatment; (5) helped demonstrate the techniques and value of serological studies and immunization coverage surveys; and (6) promoted the importance of information sharing within the MOH and between the MOH and donors, as well as the value of IEC campaigns in promoting useful public health practices. The diabetes component of the program has developed a reliable registry containing the names of diabetic children throughout Ukraine; developed and implemented a reliable delivery system and appropriate methods to monitor insulin distribution; and initiated training and information programs to improve clinical and home-based monitoring and management of diabetes in children. Insulin deliveries are now underway. The bloodborne infection control component was delayed, but an extension of the CA will allow the recently defined objectives to be realized.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","CCN-0001-A-00-4048-00","","8/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Humanitarian assistance|Health care|Child health care|Disease treatment|Diphtheria|Hepatitis|Donor coordination","Ukraine","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABM105.pdf","659 KB","007888 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (8/88-9/95) to assist in developing a regional electric utility association to provide training and to meet other common service needs of 10 targeted Eastern Caribbean utilities. Overall, project targets were greatly exceeded.  The Caribbean Electric Utility Services Corporation (CARILEC) was created and, due to its excellent performance and marketing strategy, attracted 23 utility companies and 11 other members, against a target of only 7 participating utilities.  CARILEC also formed 9 business relationships with Caribbean, Canadian, and U.S. organizations with which it has common interests. The original proposal to train staff in common services in the United States was canceled in favor of local training.  CARILEC's training was, and continues to be, a resounding success and has been widely acclaimed for raising the standards of service in the utilities.  In less than 5 years, CARILEC initiated a program acceptable to its members and carried out 203 training courses resulting in 17,350 trainee days and over 3,150 trained persons. Training topics included management, administration, business, engineering, technical and craft. Due to the success of training, CARILEC added a joint services program which is progressing satisfactorily.  Over 32 activities have already been completed or are ongoing.  Examples include the Joint Services Catalogue, the Hurricane Action Plan, the Materials Procurement Plan, and Joint Insurance.  In June, 1995 CARILEC achieved self-sustainability after redrafting its business documents to reflect its independence from USAID. Lessons learned include the following.  (1) Let the recipient of assistance decide what it really wants.  USAID's role should be that of a facilitator helping the recipient to clearly define the problem.  (2) Use audits and evaluations as management tools. Use of these tools early in this project pushed CARILEC towards profitability and therefore survival in the marketplace.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","10/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Regional development|Electric utilities|Institution building|Service industries|Technical training","Eastern Caribbean","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABM116.pdf","87 KB","001757 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (1991-9/95) to assist Chad's Ministry of Public Health (MOPH) in establishing a maternal child health/family planning (MCH/FP) unit and to initiate a pilot MCH/FP service delivery program in selected prefectures. Due to the unexpected closing of the Mission in 1994 and the reduction of the PACD by 2 years, the project was reduced to two components:  (1) support for the Moyen Chari Prefecture, which received the majority of project funding; and (2) assistance at the national level.  The project partially achieved its goals, although its impact has to be measured more by process indicators than by effects on morbidity and mortality. In the Moyen Chari Prefecture, the project focused on three areas. First, the project aimed to improve service delivery by training public and private health personnel, through the use of pretested modules, which initially included trainer training (and covered district medical chiefs in all six districts), and subsequently health worker training. However, a lack of post-training field supervision prevented the assessment of use of newly learned skills (although health worker motivation has increased), and too many modules were implemented in a short amount of time at the end of the project, partly due to the early closure of the project.  Second, in the area of institution building, the project created Moyen Chari's first formal health planning division, and, in Sarh and Moissala, provided computers and computer training (as part of decentralization efforts of the national health information system there) and budget training for senior staff.  Third, in Sarh, while awaiting the delayed arrival of project-funded pharmaceuticals (12/94), the project trained a pharmacist in drug pricing and inventory, refurbished the prefecture's drugstore, launched a cost recovery program in two dispensaries using drugs supplied by ITS (unidentified acronym), and established community health associations, although the legal framework providing them with decision making autonomy was lacking. At the national level, the project continued previously initiated support for a long-term family health and population advisor to the MOPH and for contraceptive procurement, but primarily focused on upgrading the health information system (HIS) of the MOPH's Bureau of Statistics, Planning, and Studies (BSPE), which was upgraded to the Division of Health System Information (DSIS) in 8/91).  The DSIS published a yearbook summarizing the country's health data by prefecture, implemented the decentralization decree, and trained DSIS staff in the preparation of summaries at the local level.  The HIS now houses information on maternal health and family planning, the management and follow-up of hospital patients, and cost recovery.  An inventory of human and physical resources in each prefecture was issued.  The MOPH is not in a position to support the DSIS (e.g., to maintain the two vehicles needed to train prefectural staff), although UNICEF has agreed to continue the advisor's contract for a year after project closure. Lessons learned are as follows.  (1) Given the shifting of senior MOPH personnel, it is advisable to establish an Oversight Committee of senior staff to make policy decisions to assess the impact of existing regulations.  (2) Selection and refurbishing of housing should be done by the contractor (who holds the advantage of physical proximity to the project site), not by USAID.  (3) In French-speaking Africa, the insistence on drugs of U.S. source/origin may actually be dangerous; poorly trained, semi-literate health workers may have trouble following the English instructions on the use of the drugs.  (4) The inclusion of senior MOPH personnel in project activities contributes to project sustainability; the senior host country counterpart holds the connections needed to ensure the adoption of the project by the host country government.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Child survival activities|Maternal child health care|Health delivery|Management information systems|National level|Local level","Chad","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABM117.pdf","326 KB","008528 - USAID.

"Mid-term evaluation of a grant to Save the Children Federation for a project to reduce infant and child mortality rates in two Administrative Divisions in Cameroon's Far North Province -- Mayo Danay and Mayo Kani -- by establishing co-managed, co-financed community health centers. Evaluation covers the period 10/93-9/95. Except for immunization coverage for children 0-11 months of age (which has already met the project target), project objectives were less than halfway attained at the time of the evaluation. Establishment and training of health committees and women's groups are well underway, but these community groups have not yet had a tangible impact on mothers' knowledge, attitudes, and practices related to child survival.  Turnover of key personnel has had deleterious effects and has helped to put the project approximately 8 months behind schedule. Findings regarding project interventions are as follows.  (1) The immunization coverage rate for women of reproductive age is below the objective set by the project as well as that of the Ministry of Health (MOH).  Mothers still lack accurate knowledge of immunization schedules, have some difficulty attending vaccination sessions, and have concerns about the quality of services.  (2) Control of diarrheal diseases has focuses on treatment rather than prevention; issues of personal hygiene, sanitation, clean drinking water sources, latrine construction and community clean-up days are not being sufficiently addressed. (3) While there have been some improvements in mothers' child feeding practices and an increase in the percentage of children with a growth monitoring chart, there are not yet tangible changes in the level of mothers' knowledge about nutrition (including the importance of Vitamin A) nor improvements in their ability to interpret a growth monitoring chart. As for community participation, most health and management committees are to varying degrees informing and mobilizing their communities around child survival activities.  However, in some cases committees no longer meet due to lack of incentives.  Also, committee members nor health center nurses fully understand the committees' role; dialogue and decision making are typically limited to counting the revenues generated by the health center and preparing the next order for medicines and supplies from the central pharmacy.  In monthly meetings that generally last less than an hour, members rarely discuss how to improve quality of services. More than 95% of health and management committee members are male. Although nearly 40 organized women's groups in the two departments have demonstrated their interest in promoting child survival activities, these groups, which truly represent the project's primary target groups (mothers and children), have no contact with the committees, do not benefit from the training and leadership opportunities regularly provided to the committees, and have not been integrated into the health centers' community education and outreach programs.  These men's and women's committees have evolved in separate and unequal systems, the former supported by the MOH, the latter by the Ministries of Agriculture and Community Development and of Women's and Social Affairs.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","FAO-0500-A-00-2034-00","","10/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Child survival activities|Maternal child health care|Community health care|Health committees","Cameroon","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABM125.pdf","1,813 KB","001407 - Save the Children (U.S.)","","007746 - USAID.

"Mid-term evaluation of a project to support child survival activities in the Chillipa area in Mangochi District in Malawi. The project is being implemented by Save the Children. Evaluation covers the period 10/93-9/96. While in some areas data are not available to directly assess progress towards objectives, it is clear that the project has already met its objectives for immunization of children and women of childbearing age, treatment of diarrhea in children, and literacy, and that it is very likely to meet its end-of-project objectives. Knowledge levels of health surveillance assistants (HSAs) and village health promoters (VHPs) are generally good, and communities appreciate the knowledge they have gained and the increased access to immunization and growth monitoring services. The roster system, which lists all children under five and women of childbearing age under the responsibility of each VHP, is a key element and ensures equity in coverage because it focuses on who is and who is not receiving services. One of the major lessons learned so far has been the need to adjust interactions with the community to the new attitude in Malawi, which has manifested itself in difficulties in motivating VHPs and getting communities to take responsibility for their motivation. Recommendations are to:  (1) improve use of the roster and use of data for decision making; (2) find ways to involve men in child survival activities; (3) strengthen communication and alternative health education techniques of VHPs and HSAs; (4) not accept shortages of supplies as inevitable at any level; (5) implement temporary and long-term solutions to motivate VHPs, and incorporate lessons learned in preparing community responsibility in future projects; (6) clarify the role of and provide training to the village health committees; (7) improve communications with health center staff and develop a transportation policy; (8) provide orientation"" to the SCF approach to all health center staff and training in management of community-based programs; (9) work now with the district to ensure sustainability of child survival activities; (10) strengthen the links between health and literacy by adding additional health messages in literacy classes and clarifying health and empowerment outcomes hoped for from literacy; (11) evaluate the reasons for the high literacy class drop-out rates; and (12) in future programming, expand to another area about the size of Chillipa.

"In 1989, USAID's Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) initiated a Disaster Training Program for the Latin America and Caribbean (LAC) region.  A compound disaster on June 6, 1994, comprising earthquake, landslides, and mudflows in Cauca/Huila in southwestern Colombia and affecting some 28,000 people provided the specific context for this evaluation of the impact of the OFDA/LAC training program. Overall conclusions are as follows.  (1) Colombian trainees have changed their normal mode of behavior as well as their disaster mode as a direct result of the training, demonstrating increased competence and professionalism.  (2) Several Colombian organizations have adopted and internally funded all or part of the OFDA/LAC curriculum.  However, this adoption is not uniform across the relevant organizations (the Colombian military, for example, has not adopted the curriculum at all), and the sustainability of commitments remains questionable.  (3) Colombian national response to the 1994 disaster was relatively self-sufficient and required only minor, highly specialized U.S. government relief assistance, especially when compared with U.S. assistance for the Nevado del Ruiz/Armero disaster of 1985.  This increasing self-reliance was confirmed when Colombia made no effort to seek U.S. assistance for an earthquake that struck west of the city of Pereira on February 8, 1995. Lessons learned regarding the evaluation process are as follows. (1) Rapid evaluations (i.e., within a few weeks) are the best way to capture reliable data on the impacts of the OFDA/LAC training program, especially on the linkages between training and the actual disaster response.  (2) While a random sample of previous trainees would have been methodologically ideal for evaluation purposes, the use of a focus group proved adequate in light of financial limitations and confidentiality and security requirements.  (3) A more easily accessible and user-friendly database at OFDA/LAC in Costa Rica would have been useful for collecting data on past trainees.  (4) Collaboration between the U.S. evaluator and a host country colleague facilitated the evaluation and added depth and sensitivity to its findings.  (5) In the mid to long term, evaluation of the OFDA/LAC disaster training program, especially data collection and preliminary analysis, can largely be turned over to host country individuals. (6) There is significant interest in an evaluation such as the present one, which has been requested in both Spanish and Portuguese translation.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","AFR-1520-C-00-1128-00","","7/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Disaster management|Disaster response|Technical training|Institutional aspects|Indigenization|Evaluation|Project sustainability","Colombia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNABX119.pdf","1,156 KB","008485 - Basic Health Management International (BHM)","","007747 - USAID.

"The Environmental Project for Central America (PACA), a 5-year (1990-95) project supported by CARE and The Nature Conservancy under the RENARMA program aimed at developing partnerships among national and international NGOs and donors to link conservation and development objectives at field, policy, and regional levels. PACA supported four programmatic components:  wildlands management; buffer zone management/environmental education/institutional strengthening; environmental monitoring and conservation information; and environmental policy and strategic planning.  Partner organizations implementing these components carried out activities in:  the Belize Maya Mountain Marine Transect; Costa Rica's Tempisque Conservation Area; Guatemala's Sierra de las Minas Biosphere Reserve and Cerro San Gil; and Honduras' Cusuco National Park and Merendon Watershed. This report summarizes a concluding workshop held in 8/95 to assess PACA's impact and document lessons learned. Participants concluded that PACA had a substantial impact at a variety of levels.  It contributed significantly to the base of data available on environmental, social, and institutional issues in the region, providing high quality, scientifically sound information critical to community residents, project managers, and decision makers at all levels.  It has been instrumental in strengthening local organizations through the improvement of administrative, managerial, and technical skills.  Teachers, extensionists, natural resource managers, local beneficiaries, and the general public have improved also knowledge and skills through training, TA, and educational activities offered by PACA. PACA has also significantly improved public participation in policy dialogue and reformulation in the region.  The project's use of the policy analysis techniques offered in ""The Green Book"" has encouraged and motivated individuals and organizations from both the public and private sectors to work together to analyze policy impacts and constraints throughout the region.  Finally, PACA has contributed significantly to changes in the use and management of the natural resource base and to the maintenance and recuperation of the region's biophysical resources. This report details some of the many lessons learned and offers recommendations for future conservation and development projects in the region.

"PACR of a project (2/86-2/95) to increase the ability of local entrepreneurs in the Eastern Caribbean to establish new or strengthen their existing micro, small, and medium-scale enterprises. The project served as a major source of financial and technical assistance for the National Development Foundations (NDFs) and for Women in Development (WID) Ltd. and contributed significantly to their institutional development.  Although the objective of financial sustainability for the NDFs was not attained, the foundations showed operational self-sufficiency levels of from 47% to 97.5%.  WID Ltd., unfortunately, became ineligible for further USAID support after a 1992 audit. All in all, the project assisted with the start-up/expansion of more than 5,400 microbusinesses, delivered TA to more than 779 small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and trained some 4,000 SME employees in technical and managerial skills.  A 1987 evaluation found that the project's integrated approach of providing credit and TA made a significant impact in developing viable microenterprises. A later (1989) evaluation found that the Caribbean Association of Industry and Commerce (CAIC), the implementing institution, had become a leaner, better integrated, more cost-effective organization for delivering development services, and that its delivery of services to SMEs and its assistance to institutions supporting micro-businesses enhanced its reputation as a private sector representational institution and broadened its public support.  Unfortunately, the withdrawal of USAID support saw the reversion of CAIC to strictly a membership services institution. The project had a significant impact on the expansion of the private sector in the region.  The small and micro business sub-sectors are now solidly established as part of the private sector, and entrepreneurial spirit is in evidence across the region.  The 1989 evaluation found that project-supported microenterprises were enjoying substantial increases in production and profits and that TA to small and medium size businesses had resulted in increased output and employment.  Some 13,220 jobs (37% of them held by women) were created or sustained over the life of the project. The project also had a favorable impact on the emergence of institutional brokers of TA as well as a cadre of consultants able to provide quality services to SME firms. Lessons learned include the following.  (1) In implementing a multi-component project that seeks to introduce new facilities or programs, activities should be sequenced rather than begun all at once. (2) Where a project is aiming to produce social interactions, the flow of resources should never be pre-conditioned on the achievement of that objective.  (3) Firm-level programs should be carefully matched with their intended beneficiaries.  (4) The need for TA should be carefully assessed to ensure that clients get the type of assistance they require.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","2/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Private enterprises|Business enterprises|Medium scale enterprises|Small scale enterprises|Microenterprises|Business support services|Management training","Eastern Caribbean","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABM218.pdf","226 KB","001757 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (7/86-9/95) to improve the delivery of management education, training, research, and consulting services to the private sector in the Eastern Caribbean, where there is a shortage of skilled upper and middle managers.  The project was implemented by the Department of Management Studies (DOMS) of the University of the West Indies, Cave Hill (UWI/CH), and by the Center for Management Development (CMD), a self-financed UWI/CH affiliate. According to the 8/93 mid-term evaluation, the project's delayed start-up was due to management problems, including the multi-nationality of the CMD.  In response, the project restructured and revised job descriptions at the CMD and appointed an overall Project Coordinator for UWI.  USAID, however, found the CMD restructuring unsatisfactory and withdrew support for CMD's operating costs in 12/93, authorizing use of the Pilot Project Participant Fees account for this purpose.  On the positive side, the new UWI director accelerated project implementation. The CMD, established in 1991 with a small core staff led by an Executive Director, launched the Executive MBA (EMBA) program in 1992 (for which a total of 148 students have registered) and will launch the Graduate Diploma in the Human Resource Management Program in 2/96.  CMD also: conducted two case writing workshops and two training of trainers workshops; designed over 100 Caribbean cases; published two text books and edited several seminar presentations; conducted a range of Executive Development Programs; administered a Certification Course in Business Administration for the St. Lucia Government; and launched an extensive 6-month reclassification certificate program for 40 public servants in St. Lucia. In addition, several seminars/symposia and workshops were held, and 7 satellite training sites in the Eastern Caribbean were established. Institution-building efforts directed at the DOMS achieved some measure of success, especially after the mid-term evaluation. Two DOMS members earned Masters of Business Administration (MBA) Degrees, at Florida International and Boston University respectively, and all DOMS members took advantage of local or U.S. short-term training.  In addition, the DOMS acquired a modern audiovisual, library, and computing equipment and supplies; computers for its computer laboratory and offices; and a CD-ROM library facility.  Finally, the Department was provided with teaching manuals and with TA in faculty performance appraisal. The project will have its greatest impact in four areas.  (1) The EMBA program is attracting both public and private sector students from Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS) countries, Barbados, and, more recently, Jamaica and Trinidad. EMBA students and graduates are already making an impact in terms of new ideas in business and public administration, and the potential for widespread impact throughout the region is vast. The Government of St. Lucia in particular has sponsored a large number of its employees for the program.  (2) The satellite training centers, though they were established late in the project, provide the potential for extending the training programs to the smaller OECS countries, augmenting CMD offerings, and increasing the potential intake into the EMBA program.  (3) A functioning, well-managed, and self-financing CMD capable of meeting the need for non-EMBA training in the region is now a reality.  (4) UWI's failure to nominate 6 candidates from the DOMS for long-term training was a disappointment not wholly compensated for by the short-term training provided under the project. The following lessons were learned.  (1) Perseverance has its rewards. Despite the myriad problems USAID had with the grantee not meeting project conditions and covenants, not adhering to the implementation plan and project outputs, and in overall management, it became apparent in the project's final 6 months and with the appointment of a new CEO that overall project objectives will be achieved.  (2) Avoid too many project agreement conditions and covenants.  The grant agreement appears to have been over-conditioned and -covenanted due to failure to achieve consensus with the grantee beforehand; perhaps the rush to obligate funds led to this. What resulted was a series of unrealistic deadlines which USAID continually had to extend and which were fulfilled, if at all, in form rather than in substance.  It is better to delay project obligation until things are truly agreed upon with ""the customer.""  (3) Although the project design was considered adequate, for some reason the project did not gel until an overall project director was appointed, at which point a difference could be felt in the grantee's responsiveness to USAID.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","9/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Management training|Personnel development|Private sector|Universities and colleges|Training centers","Eastern Caribbean","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABM219.pdf","177 KB","001757 - USAID.

"Evaluates matching grant to Project HOPE to integrate maternal/child health care (MCH) into pilot village health banks (VHBs) in Ecuador and Honduras.  Mid-term evaluation covers the period 9/92-5/95. Progress has been made, despite the difficulty of bringing a credit-led mechanism into a health-focused program environment.  A total of 54 VHBs have been established:  30 in Honduras, 24 in Ecuador. HOPE's ""credit-plus"" VHB model represents a major expansion of the traditional village banking concept in that it offers poor women not only microenterprise loans, but health education and nonformal business education as well.  However, neither HOPE nor the technical consultant it hired to develop this innovation fully appreciated the programming required to integrate health and banking technologies in a sustainable way. In the first half of the project, HOPE has focused primarily on developing the credit, savings, and financial systems necessary for sound village banking practices.  A good foundation has been laid in developing a policy and procedural framework for VHB financial management.  Most women seem to be using the added income from their loans to support their households, though some are investing in their businesses, which are expanding with real growth.  However, not all guidelines and policies have been enforced with the same rigor, either within or between countries.  The Honduras program has facilitated sound growth with prudent levels of savings and capital absorption in most VHBs, whereas in Ecuador risky lending practices and poor monitoring by some promoters have put VHBs in a vulnerable position, though serious effort has been made to correct these weaknesses. Linkage of village banking with child survival has been awkward to realize, different in each country, and prone to miscommunication both at HOPE Center and in the field. Nevertheless, field experience, from Ecuador in particular, suggests that this integration is a viable strategy for achieving health impacts.  Recently, HOPE recruited a health education specialist in child survival; her assignment in developing VHB health education represents an important transition in HOPE's efforts to integrate health and bank technologies. The nonformal business training component has not been developed or realistically implemented.  This component is very weak and urgently needs TA. In regard to sustainability, portfolio management, and therefore income reporting, is taking place primarily in the field.  A comprehensive Financial Management Information Center has been established, consisting of extensive financial reports in the key areas of portfolio analysis, impact, and sustainability, but there is still no analysis of the income and portfolio system; the accounting system is weak in meeting management information needs.  Key issues affecting sustainability are cost recovery (at the end of February, Ecuador had achieved a sustainability rate of 22.02%, Honduras, of 34.83%), cost-cutting, and program development costs (the funds budgeted for TA to develop a VHB methodology were inadequate).","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","5/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Child survival activities|Integrated health care|Commercial credit|Microenterprises|Women in development|Private voluntary organizations|Banks|Villages|Community based delivery","Ecuador|Honduras","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABM229.pdf","3,530 KB","","","007746 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of a project (7/87-7/95) to promote sustainable development in Nepal's environmentally threatened Rapti Zone. Thanks to the project, a high-growth strategy is now feasible in Rapti.  Especially since the mid-term review, the project emphasized the commercialization of hill agriculture in intensive, geographically defined development pockets -- a strategy which has been supported by income generation through community forestry, soil conservation programs, and the development of local self-government though farmer user groups and other village and district institutions.  The project played an important role in forming user groups and helping them to focus on a few, achievable priorities.  The project is a prototype for sustained development not only in Rapti, but throughout Nepal. The project supported district and local efforts to manage resources for local needs, organizing democratic user groups, building local capacity to construct and maintain hill agricultural roads, and providing a model for involving national line agencies in building roads to major pockets of cash crop production.  There is now an extraordinary opportunity to build on that experience in the context of a massive government expansion of resources for village-level programs, though care must be taken to prevent mismanagement and waste of funds. Environmental enhancement was another success, especially the handing over of forests to user groups and the plan developed for soil conservation and management.  So far, 10% of the forest suitable for community forestry has been turned over in Rapti Zone -- 42% in Salyan district -- compared with 2% nationwide.  Although the same critical level was not achieved in soil conservation, a comprehensive prototype for action was created.  The project also played an important role in integrating livestock and the fodder production. The project dramatically increased income, equity, women's participation, sustainability, and favorable social effects in all the demonstration pockets; since these successes have been achieved largely through farmers' own resources, only modest public resources will be needed to expand them.  A typical low-elevation farmer experienced a 20 increase in income by shifting half of his/her irrigated wheat to intensive vegetable/vegetable seed production; some farmers who shifting all wheatland to vegetables experienced a 50% increase.  The income of apple farmers is rising two- and three-fold; those at the highest elevations have seen incomes jump will beyond those at lower elevations. Women are active members of user groups and are becoming increasingly assertive, especially in vegetable and fruit production.  Nutrition education for women in the context of fruit and vegetable commercialization would be of great social benefit, given the vitamin A deficiency in Nepal. The social impact of the dramatic reduction in male migration to India cannot be overstated.  Over 3 years, income from work in India has declined by 40%, while cash income from cash crops, livestock, and off-farm work in Nepal has increased by about 40%.  Expenditures for housing and education have increased, as has incentive to invest inland and water. Forestry and other user groups have opened bank accounts with money collected from the sale of forest-based and other products; these funds are being used to improve village infrastructure and finance lower-interest loans for modernizing farm operations.  The project also offered something to isolated farmers.  Seed production generates cash income in isolated areas (some 5 days' walk from the nearest road), and the livestock programs have introduced improved breeds that are greatly increasing the productivity of animals for home consumption. Given the success of its intensive priority pocket strategy, the project has an unusual opportunity to address second-generation problems. Line agencies need assistance in achieving the administrative changes required to apply the strategy throughout Rapti.  Also, a means (probably outside the line agencies) is needed for introducing pockets of success, with their strong technical and marketing competence, throughout Nepal.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","367-0000-O-00-2202-00","","2/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Sustainable agriculture|Rural development|Agricultural production|Hill soils|Commercial farming|Farm income|Democratization","Nepal","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABM231.pdf","8,755 KB","008916 - John Mellor Associates, Inc.|009173 - Institute for Integrated Development Studies","","008583 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of a project (9/89-4/95) to promote child survival in developing countries by using modern communication technology to achieve appropriate and sustainable health behavior by parents and caretakers (Healthcom II). The contractor achieved and in some cases surpassed all contract objectives (some of which were reduced due to lack of funding) and, overall, received high praise for its efforts.  Short-term TA activities were conducted in over 20 countries (none required) in addition to long-term work in 9 countries (as required).  An important 5-step communication methodology -- Assess, Plan, Pretest, Deliver, and Monitor-- was developed and used in 13 different child survival and health areas.  Applied research included 10 evaluations of Healthcom I, several intercountry comparisons of particular behavioral issues, and research on applying, adapting, and institutionalizing communication methods and on promoting the sustainability of behavior changes. In terms of dissemination, the project completed more than 15 issue reports; published 20 major scientific articles; held 10 seminars, 43 country-level workshops, and 6 training sessions; and published several manuals and books, including ""Notes from the Field:  Communication for Child Survival""; ""Communication for Health and Behavioral Change:  A Developing Country Perspective"", ""A Tool Box for Building Health Communication Capacity"", ""A Learner's Kit for Focus Group Research"", and ""A Behavioral Video and Guide"". Key shortfalls were in the areas of institutionalization and evaluation.  The issue of institutionalization, for example, was never clearly and summarily assessed, nor was there any analysis of why Healthcom interventions had an impact in some countries and not in others.  Further, the evaluations of Healthcom programs seemed selective, with undue emphasis on positive findings.  Also, most evaluations and reports failed to document the number of people reached by Healthcom interventions. Finally, while cost-effectiveness analysis was included in the contract, little was done in this area -- a major gap in the evaluation process. Despite these problems, health communication for behavior change is now accepted as a critical component of any public health intervention, including (an unexpected project spin-off) AIDS control programs.  This is the legacy of almost 20 years of USAID effort in this area, an effort of which Healthcom II was a part. Lessons were learned in several areas.  (1) Health workers perform better when they feel appreciated by the community; are given culturally appropriate, interactive, and pretested tools, with target audiences; and helped in overcoming their reluctance to engage mothers in two-way communication.  (2) As programs become more decentralized (as in Senegal), it is essential to improve management ability as well as the skills of local workers.  (3) The SOMAVITA project in Indonesia showed the importance of using channels such as village administrators and Fatayat volunteers in reaching otherwise ""hard-to-reach"" groups. (4) Preventive behaviors, since they lack immediate results, are more difficult to affect than treatment behaviors.  Interpersonal communication, especially the use of community volunteers, is recommended.  (5) A mix of communication strategies (mass media, direct mail, and face-to-face interaction) is needed to contact all segments of society.  However, while face-to-face interventions are often more effective than mass media such as radio, their overall impact is less because they reach fewer people.  It is also important that communication programs address health workers and not just mothers; program effectiveness can be severely limited if health workers give out messages contrary to those of the program. Applied research findings with particular relevance to future programs include the following.  (1) Health communications increase immunization coverage, oral rehydration therapy (ORT) use, the percentage of women breastfeeding within 6 hours after birth, and Vitamin A capsule distribution.  (2) Health communication is more effective when combined with changes in health worker activities.  (3) Health communication can increase not only the demand for services, but also the timely use of services (e.g., immunizations).  (4) Interventions such as promoting immunizations are easier to affect with health communication techniques than interventions requiring more difficult tasks, such as home mixing of oral rehydration solutions.  (5) In order to sustain behavior change, some level of communication must be sustained.","Project title: Health technical services (HTS)","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","HRN-5974-C-00-3001-00|HRN-C-00-93-00001-00","","6/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Child survival activities|Health education|Human behavior|Communications technology|Communication media","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABM232.pdf","2,509 KB","003366 - TvT Associates|000981 - Pragma Corp.","","008291 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of a project (8/88-6/95) to develop more open, efficient, and transparent financial markets in Indonesia. The project has effectively contributed to the development of local financial markets in the ways envisioned. Regarding capital markets, the project helped to develop new regulatory and operational infrastructure that increased market confidence and efficiency.  The Capital Market Executive Board (BAPEPAM) is today a self-standing regulatory agency, separate from the stock exchange and clearing corporation.  An extensive body of rules and regulations have been adopted, BAPEPAM's ability to draft and implement rules and work with market institutions has improved considerably, a new Capital Markets Law has been drafted which will strengthen BAPEPAM's enforcement capabilities, and corporate disclosure and public information are more extensive and of higher quality.  Since project start-up in 1990, the stock exchange has blossomed. In the money markets, the project helped to: develop a new credit rating agency and new commercial paper regulations; introduce a new system for auctioning money market securities; strengthen Bank Indonesia's (BI) institutional capabilities; forge relations with central bankers both in the ASEAN region and globally; and design a new electronic funds transfer system. In privatization, the project helped to design privatization policies, identify Initial Public Offerings (IPO) candidates and intermediaries, assist in transaction-specific matters, and build capabilities within the Ministry of Finance Directorate of State-Owned Enterprises. In sum, financial market infrastructure, regulation, and management have improved measurably in the past few years, and achieved a new stage of development in the past two.  This has contributed to the continued inflow of new market borrowers and investors, the growing ability of Indonesian firms to access offshore capital markets, and the introduction of some of the world's most sophisticated foreign investment houses to the Indonesian market. The project cannot take credit for all of this work, however; financial sector development had momentum from other sources as well. It must also be recognized that several project objectives have not been met.  In capital markets, primary and secondary bond market activity is still limited; an active domestic investor base has not been developed; and retail investment is virtually nonexistent.  In the money markets, interest rates are still somewhat controlled by the central bank, limiting secondary market trading of central bank certificates. Only two firms have been privatized.  In most of these cases, the project could not have altered developments or could have done so only by diverting resources from activities that may have been more critical to financial market development in the longer run. The project has had indirect effects on poverty alleviation.  The capital markets provide capital for economic expansion that might not be available otherwise, or only at greater cost.  New, smaller (though not yet small), and more labor-intensive firms are using the capital markets today. Improved corporate disclosure has made companies more aware of the need to manage resources more effectively to achieve profits and return on investment and equity.  BI continues to improve at monetary management, creating a stable environment that supports financial transactions and economic growth. Several lessons were learned about project design. (1) Long-term TA helps to focus advisors' activities and build institutional knowledge and relationships; long-term advisors must be allowed flexibility.  (2) More is not always better. Project papers frequently set out quantitative measures of success, but higher numbers do not always mean ""more"" development.  Indeed, in some cases, pushing to more outputs can have adverse effects, e.g., if an advisor, pressed to produce a large number of regulations, drafts regulations himself/herself instead of training counterparts to draft; or more regulations are produced than the local regulatory agency can implement intelligently; or more brokers are incorporated than can be supported by financial market transactions. (3) The need to build relationships and consensus among several parties often lengthens the development process; this must be recognized and accepted.  (4) Project design should focus on a few major issues and the general activities that address them rather than on the details of how things are to get done.  (5) Realistic budgets should be assessed before a project is begun; negotiations and adjustments during a project cause uncertainty that can stall project activities. The following lessons were learned about project implementation.  (1) The utility of host country contracts should be questioned.  In Indonesia, where host institutions often already possess contracting ability, the use of a host country contract may simply overlay the bureaucratic processes of USAID onto the host institution.  (2) When it becomes clear that major components of a project must be dropped, there should be formal ways of reviewing the reasons for change and the consequences for the remainder of the project.  (3) Major expenditure shifts within a project should be documented.

"Evaluates Trade and Investment Program (TIP) in Ghana to increase private sector nontraditional exports (NTEs) through project and nonproject assistance.  Mid-term evaluation covers the period 9/92-8/95. Achievements have been notable.  A number of TA models were tested and have allowed TIP to reach a broad spectrum of existing and potential exporters with well-tailored interventions in a remarkably short period. These interventions have created a number of pilot activities, some of which appear ready for rapid growth and expansion; it is expected that these pioneering firms will set examples for others to follow. Additionally, TIPS has strengthened linkages to the global market for timely market and price information, improved market facilities and product handling capability, and increased foreign buyers' knowledge of Ghanaian NTE products. TIP contractors and grantees have helped firms to increase product availability, improve quality and productivity, and improve sourcing of materials, equipment, and services.  TIP has also been instrumental in establishing four new trade and professional private sector entities that provide advocacy, management and technical training, market information, and marketing services. TIP activities have had a positive impact on the local economy in terms of employment and increased income; this conclusion runs counter to the perception that a small number of advantaged firms have monopolized TIP assistance.  Considerable progress has also been achieved in broadening the dialogue between the public and private sectors.  A well- defined action plan to improve the policy framework governing NTEs and reduce regulatory and administrative transaction costs has been implemented.  Enactment of the Export and Import law has improved NTE regulations well beyond the original TIP design. TIP has generally been less successful in alleviating commercial financial constraints on emerging export firms.  Such constraints should not be overstated, however (particularly in relation to the many other infrastructural and technological constraints), given the fact that many NTE companies are expanding export sales -- some at rates of 50% to 100%. Given the number of institutions involved in TIP and the range of its activities, it is remarkable that the program has progressed without major difficulties.

"Evaluates grant to the International Eye Foundation (IEF) for a child survival/vitamin A program in Guatemala.  Mid-term evaluation covers the period 10/93-7/95. More than 50% of project objectives have been reached in the following components:  Expanded Program of Immunization (EPI) (children aged 12-24 months receive a complete scheme except for DPT), nutrition (children over 5 months receive vitamin A-rich foods), vitamin A (children aged 6-71 months receive vitamin A supplements every 6 months and postpartum mothers receive vitamin A within 30 days), acute lower respiratory infections (mothers can identify the warning signs and make an appropriate referral, eye care (eye campaigns held), and income generation activities. Mothers, volunteers, and leaders are aware of and support project activities, find that the activities help them improve both their children's health and their own, and recommend that volunteers be trained as health promoters.  Ministry of Health (MOH) workers and local medical staff agree that the project is well-known and respected, and indicate a willingness to train volunteers as health promoters.  A network of NGOs has been strengthened due to close communication and cooperation with project activities. Educational activities have employed a variety of media, including cooking demonstrations and radio spots. The following components need to be strengthened or re-examined: EPI (TTV for women of child-bearing age), control of diarrheal disease (use of oral rehydration therapy and solution [ORS and ORT] and antibiotics), nutrition (food during episodes of diarrhea), and gardens (planting of family gardens).  There is also a need to reduce the number of educational messages (the result of the excessive number of project interventions), ensure that the messages are not contradictory, and remedy the lack of educational materials usable at the community level. Finally, there is a need to strengthen institutional and financial sustainability -- institutional sustainability through formal agreements between the MOH and local communities and through better and more frequent contacts with the MOH, the Catholic Church and other local churches, and NGOs; and financial sustainability by diversifying income sources for the project and by seeking funding to further establish IEF's role as an expert in community education and research.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","FAO-0500-A-00-3020-00","","11/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Child survival activities|Maternal child health care","Guatemala","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABM234.pdf","1,101 KB","000627 - International Eye Foundation (IEF)","","007746 - USAID.

"Evaluates program to promote the conservation of neotropical migratory bird species (NMBs) and their habitats in Latin America and the Caribbean.  Mid-term evaluation covers the period 1991-8/95. Through its funding of 23 projects involving partnerships between international and local NGOs in 6 countries, the program has had a significant effect on the conservation of NMBs on their wintering grounds, supporting important research, raising public awareness, and building capacity and infrastructure.  Projects have included research in proposed and existing protected areas, buffer zones, and agricultural landscapes (including important but little known geographic areas and ecosystems), as well the monitoring of bird populations across habitat gradients.  Some projects have provided substantial training in biological field techniques.  Several are aimed at establishing the technical, educational, and organizational infrastructure for long-term NMB studies.  Several projects focus on relatively small NGOs and provide them with training in proposal writing and program management. Every project reviewed by the evaluators included a significant NMB conservation component that existed only because of the program.  The program has also increased local understanding of the biologic and economic value of NMBs.  For example, in several locations, local personnel are employed as field assistants for data collection on NMBs, and many of these assistants are using their newly acquired knowledge to work as tourist guides. There have been a number of administrative and managerial problems, none of which are significant enough to prevent the program from achieving its objectives.  These problems can be remedied through improved communication, better definition of participants' roles and responsibilities, greater clarification of the program's strategy, and some modifications in administrative procedures. Overall, the program represents one of the most significant and important contributions to NMB conservation efforts currently being undertaken in the Latin America and Caribbean region.  It is an important project, and worthy of the efforts necessary to continue it.","Cover title: Biodiversity support program [BSP] : neotropical|migratory bird conservation program evaluation","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","9/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Tropical zone|Birds|Biological diversity|Endangered species|Natural resource conservation","Latin America|Caribbean","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABM238.pdf","2,865 KB","","","000114 - USAID.

"Evaluates a project component to create an export fund to ensure the continuation of export development programs currently being funded through the Costa Rican Coalition for Development Initiatives (CINDE). Performance evaluation covers the period 10/90-5/95. Implementation of the export fund has digressed substantially from the project design because of the undercapitalization of the fund, which is only $20.9 million rather than the minimum $70 million envisioned in the project design.  Nonetheless, except for the constraints introduced by this shortage of resources, the Export Development Foundation (FUNDEX), the fund administrator, has strictly adhered to the terms and conditions of the export fund agreement.  FUNDEX has also developed its capability to carry out the financial management of the fund by establishing sound systems and procedures to ensure accurate financial reporting and reliable internal control. The most difficult problem in project implementation is the tense working relationship between FUNDEX and the CINDE, the major recipient of grants provided under the fund (in 1994, for example, CINDE received 62% of the C 215 million in approved grant funds).  This problem will not be solved unless the administrations of both FUNDEX and CINDE take further steps to develop mutual trust and goodwill.  Other problems -- such as those related to program management and program monitoring methodologies and systems -- should not be difficult to solve from a technical viewpoint. On the basis of CINDE's experience, an annual increase in measurable exports of $5-$7 million for each $1 million in program expenditures on the overall mix of various types of export development programs should be a reasonable target for the export fund.  Although many projects financed by FUNDEX have no measurable impact on exports, they nonetheless foster export development by providing useful services to the export sector. Some of these services help to strengthen the competitiveness of Costa Rican products, whereas others are helpful for identifying potential market opportunities or structuring market penetration strategies. The continued functioning of CINDE is a necessary condition for the viability of the export fund as originally designed, because CINDE is the only private organization specializing in export development that has a successful track record.  Hence, the policy to maintain the value of the export fund's capital in real terms should be modified to ensure that a minimum amount of funding exists for providing CINDE's integrated and mutually reinforcing export development services.  The fund itself should be extended another 4 years after the current PACD of 12/96. Finally, the Fundacion Costa-Rica-United States of America (CRUSA) project appears to be the best mechanism to assume the role of USAID vis-a-vis the Export Fund after USAID's departure from Costa Rica.","Technical service order no. 023","Special Evaluation","Documents","LAC-0797-C-00-2046-00","","11/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Export promotion|Capital assistance|Grants|Financial management|Financial institutions","Costa Rica","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABM239.pdf","5,718 KB","004304 - Nathan Associates, Inc.|007732 - AG International Consulting Corp.","","008533 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (1985-89) to improve regional and national systems for administering justice in Central America, primarily criminal justice systems.  The project was implemented by the Latin American Institute for the Prevention of Crime and Treatment of the Offender (ILANUD). Achievements in the project's various components are as follows. The training component included short training sessions on criminal law topics for judges and prosecutors, specialized training for court officials on a wide range of topics, and study tours to the United States, Europe, and other Latin American countries.  The advisory services component helped develop justice sector assessments throughout the region, as well as criminal justice statistics, permanent collection mechanisms for the reporting of legislation and jurisprudence, bibliographic materials, and a central database at ILANUD; additionally, country-specific assistance was provided to a host of national institutions in developing annual country plans and in designing instructional and training materials development component included the development of several new divisions (project, administrative, and advisory services, research, and training), an extension facility, a documentation center, and the contracting of long-term TA from Florida International University to assist in project design and evaluation. The project also funded programming and planning assistance by ILANUD to other regional institutions such as the Inter-American Institute of Human Rights, and various special series such as contracting local personnel to coordinate administration of justice activities on behalf of USAID missions, and support for the design of bilateral projects. Quantitative outputs included 172 seminars, 61 short courses/seminars, the funding of 76 University of Costa Rica scholarships, 224 TA missions, 93 publications, the development of 129 training materials, the establishment of 7 law libraries, and the completion of various justice sector assessments. In its final 2 years, the project sought to increase ILANUD's capacity to survive beyond the life of the project.  The Eleventh Amendment set strict preconditions to the disbursement of final funds -- that ILANUD begin an international search for a new director, consolidate the Advisory Board and Executive Committee, establish new bylaws (including the Board's policy review role), develop an action plan to institutionalize a permanent Board of Directors, and prepare a development strategy.  When ILANUD's Director General was unresponsive to these requirements, an Interim Director began working on them, eventually giving way to a new Director General.  While much remains to be done, ILANUD has continued to make progress in the 12 months since then in the areas of modernization, institutional development, and future sustainability (including a dramatic diversification of funding support), resulting in a Mission acknowledgement of its compliance with the terms of the Eleventh Amendment. Recently, ILANUD was given a mandate by the Presidents of Central America to prepare a regional plan of action and assist in its implementation.  While ILANUD is not the regional center many had hoped it would become, it remains a viable institution capable of carrying out a regional program of providing TA for the region's justice sectors. Perhaps the greatest lesson learned from the project is that unrealistic expectations tend to create unrealistic goals which, in turn, cloud a balanced measurement of project results.  While the project did not make regional justice sectors perfect, as its critics argue, it does seems to have made immeasurable progress in bringing the issue of justice sector reform to the forefront of U.S. foreign aid programs and to have created the conditions required for the development of most regional bilateral USAID rule of law projects currently being implemented in Bolivia, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Panama, and Peru.  Today, Rule of Law projects form an integral part of USAID's Democracy portfolio and continue to draw upon the successes and lessons learned from this project for their development.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Judiciary|Institution building|Criminal law|Legal systems","Central America","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABM255.pdf","226 KB","002290 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of a project (8/91-12/95) to create the Swazi Business Growth Trust (SBGT) as a mechanism for stimulating the development of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in Swaziland. The project has been a success.  SBGT itself became the primary lender when the original plan to provide credit through commercial banks proved inappropriate.  Major outputs include over 2,700 participants in some type of SBGT training and over 1,300 loans issued to 505 individual first-time borrowers (at least two-thirds of whom have received repeat loans).  Most clients are women in retail or service trades. Although SBGT is a nonprofit entity, it gave birth to two for-profit subsidiaries:  the Growth Trust Corporation Limited, (GTC) which implements the credit program, and the Growth Trust Commercial Corporation Limited, which operates SBGT's franchising and commercial activities.  Another innovation is GTC's use of a ""smart card"" for monitoring loans. While Class A (small business) lending has provided the greatest outputs, SBGT has evolved to include a Class B lending program for larger, more traditional loans (this program is experiencing delinquency problems); an affordable home financing and construction assistance scheme; agricultural credit; financing and business support for the small-scale transportation sector; a fully integrated small business training and advisory capacity; and franchising services. Training is a major SBGT service and distinguishes its package of financial services from that offered by banks and other institutions. Training of Class A clients has been more comprehensive and effective than that for Class B clients.  Loan processing procedures for Class A clients have also been more effective than those for Class B. The success of this project can be attributed in part to SBGT's business-like nature and private sector-oriented board, even as it performs a developmental function.  SBGT has played a proactive role in searching for business opportunities for SMEs, with government support. SBGT's financial sustainability is promising.  A combination of concessional loans and grants (principally Swazi) of about E 15.0 million have been either placed in the Trust or committed during the past 6 months as SBGT moves from being a U.S.-administered institution to being a Swazi business development institution. Lessons learned include the following.  (1) Successful projects are run by good managers who have vision, commitment, and ability to adapt changing conditions or emerging realities.  Flexibility of design abets this process.  (2) Financial practices which appear to Westerners as intuitive, right, and universal may in fact be culture-specific.  More effort than is generally assumed may be needed to educate the general public, political and business leaders, and potential and actual borrowers about credit.  (3) Combining a cooperative agreement and an institutional contract to establish a new institution worked well.  (4) Creating a sustainable, local institution with a developmental focus is a multi-faceted task requiring much experimentation. (5) Given the necessary resources, creative energy, and community support, it is possible to develop a small business service enterprise from inception to a near sustainable level in a relatively short time.  (6) For SME entrepreneurs, education is just as important as credit. (7) The project used an action memo, rather than the arduous process of a project amendment, to change its implementation approach after it is realized that commercial banks were not appropriate lenders.  The action memo accomplished the task rather quickly.","Delivery Order #28|Project title: Implementing policy change (IPC)","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","AEP-5451-I-00-2049-00","","11/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Small scale enterprises|Medium scale enterprises|Commercial credit|Business support services|Financial institutions|Institution building|Entrepreneurs","Swaziland","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABM270.pdf","170 KB","003970 - Management Systems International, Inc.

"PACR of a project (3/89-3/95) to strengthen national agricultural research and extension services in the seven member countries of the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS). Major accomplishments include the following.  The project:  (1) developed and disseminated technologies for improved production of eddoe, ginger, plantain, pineapple, yam, onion, hot pepper, papaya, dasheen, and passion fruit (limited work was done on breadfruit and sapodilla); (2) addressed more than 100 technological constraints in such areas as varieties, planting density, fertilizer, irrigation, postharvest handling, pest and disease management, weed control, and horticultural practices such as pruning, mulching, flower initiation, trellising, and land preparation; (3) conducted more than 450 validations/demonstrations of alternative technologies and production systems; (4) developed a ""task force"" approach as a mechanism for commercializing commodities in OECS states; (5) delivered training via demonstrations, lectures, field days, seminars, etc. to farmers, extension officers, and marketing agents, totaling 4,654 people; (6) supported regional workshops for 389 persons; (7) established or strengthened linkages between CARDI (Caribbean Agricultural Research Development Institute, the implementing agency) and ministries of agriculture, universities, and other agricultural R&D organizations; (8) produced 117 publications (reports, factsheets, manuals, farmers' guides, conference papers, etc.); and (9) conducted 58 institutional strengthening activities for CARDI. Assessments showed that the adoption rate among the 1,918 farmers exposed to new technology was 47%; among these farmers, it was estimated that 53% of the technologies to which they were exposed were being put to use.  Average cost of production per kg of the crops assessed fell 35%-75%, and productivity of onion and ginger cropping increased.  The system of transferring technologies has been institutionalized in CARDI, the University of the West Indies, and the national agricultural extension services.                    Lessons learned include the following.  (1) Technology generation and transfer must consider end-user requirements for profitability, marketing constraints, and government support policies.  (2) Front line extension officers need continuing training and support in economic and business- related technical and analytical skills in order to provide practical services to farmers.  (3) The joint focus planning and task force approach should be further documented in training manuals and transferred to national extension systems.  (4) Farmers need help in organizing production to take advantage of growing agro-tourist and export markets.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","11/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural research|Agricultural technology|Institution building|Agricultural extension|Technology transfer|Technology adoption","Eastern Caribbean","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABM271.pdf","82 KB","007707 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of a project to develop a national energy demand management (EDM) program in Morocco, with emphasis on the private sector.  Evaluation covers the period 5/89-6/95 against a PACD of 9/95. The project moved from an initial emphasis on services to individual firms within several sectors to exploring more generalizable energy and natural resource conservation measures.  In so doing, it has developed a base from which to undertake actions that are replicable and of policy interest. The changes in the project since 1988 reflect increased awareness that the expanding Moroccan private sector responds to economic incentives. The project has supported the private sector by using energy audits to sensitize businesses to the financial returns to energy demand management/clean technology and pollution prevention (EDM/CTPP) activities and by training Moroccan engineering consultants to carry out EDM/CTPP activities.  The project has had a variety of positive impacts: sensitization of businesspeople and public officials to the benefits of EDM; reductions in costs because of project-sponsored audits, feasibility studies, boiler tune-ups, and electrical system analyses; technicians trained; pollution reductions (directly by reducing factory emissions and indirectly by reducing use of fossil fuels).  In fact, electrical systems analyses have generated savings ten times their cost. Interviews with plant managers and production engineers indicate that most of the EDM/CTPP knowledge in Morocco seems traceable to the project.  On the whole, interventions at the plant level have been perceived as effective and cost-saving; audits and hands-on training have also been highly appreciated. Addition of the clean technology component in 1993 made explicit the connection between energy audits and pollution prevention.  One of the project's more successful intervention was at a paper factory in Tangier, where visible pollution problem was solved at the same time that energy consumption was reduced.  The intervention had the interesting side effect of reducing Morocco's normally high concern with business secrecy to the point where the project was able to use the plant as a demonstration site, organizing visits of businesspeople and (even more remarkably) government officials. Nonetheless, the market is not yet driving businesses to include EDM/CTPP technologies and techniques in their cost-control strategies. Commercial demand for Moroccan engineering consultants trained in EDM/CTPP techniques is lagging, and, except for the cement industry and hotels (where energy costs are high), energy conservation is not perceived as a good investment.  EDM/CTPP engineering consultants will have to incorporate their skills into broader-scope engineering consulting firms.  Creation of industry cells, which can promote EDM/TCPP technologies and services, may be a good way to institutionalize sustainability.  A cement industry cell supported by the project will probably carry on under its own momentum. Lessons learned are as follows.  (1) Innovative approaches for implementation through private sector entities can be effective in Morocco.  (2) In hindsight, it would have been useful to specify from the outset whether the twin goals of saving foreign exchange and increasing productivity by improving efficiency of energy use were short- or medium-term goals.  The distinction affects the weight to be assigned to factory interventions as opposed to promotional activities. While audits had an immediate impact on energy consumption in the short term, their coverage is necessarily limited (although they may have been of considerable importance as a promotional tool).  The consciousness-raising achieved by the project may have a greater impact in the medium term.  (3) Less intensive and hence less expensive audits might have been preferable to the detailed audits carried out.  Managers might be willing to risk 10,000-20,000 Dh for an audit, but are reluctant to go above that ceiling without careful consideration. Keeping down the unsubsidized cost of project interventions for which the private sector is supposed to pay is a theme that should be incorporated into any follow-on project.","French ed.: PD-ABM-273|Delivery order no. 16","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","AEP-0085-I-00-3003-00","","6/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Information dissemination|Private sector|Pollution|Industrial facilities|Public awareness|Private enterprises|Investment|Costs|Technical training|Energy policy|Project sustainability|Feasibility studies|Return on investments|Boilers|Economic analysis|Electricity|Attitude change|Energy audits|Natural resource conservation","Morocco","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABM272.pdf","2,830 KB","000356 - Checchi and Co.

"Final evaluation of the Reverse Farmer-to-Farmer training activity, a program to bring agricultural leaders trained in the NIS under the Farmer to Farmer (FTF) project to the United States for follow-on training.  The evaluation covers the period from the program's inception in 8/94 through 8/95 (against a PACD of 9/95). The project, which will have trained 94 participants by 9/95, has been a success:  training was of high quality and cost-effective, and has good potential for high impact.  In contrast with most training programs, there is virtually no learning curve in this program, as trainers, trainees, and their organizations are already known to one another.  As an example of the training quality, participants in an agricultural credit training program were able to site in on an actual meeting of a loan committee at a Denver bank and witness the analysis of a borrower's creditworthiness; they spent the rest of the day with the borrower.  The trainees now have experience with processes that previously did not exist in their economies.  Similarly, a group of NIS insurance executives were given proprietary documents by a U.S. insurance firm, explicitly outlining how to evaluate risks for various types of policies.  This type of knowledge-sharing is not available in academic courses or in regular FTF programs.  Another indicator of quality is that the training institutions put their most senior officials at the disposal of the program, partially to repay their guests' hospitality, partially to enhance prospects for doing business together in the future. The training was cost-effective:  approximately $10,600 a month per individual vs. about $14,000 for most USAID short-term programs.  In part, these savings occurred because the trainers were provided free by U.S. entities eager to build relationships with NIS agricultural entities.  Minimal need for orientation also helped to cut costs. Finally, the program has a good potential for high impact.  Some 50% of the 29 trainees evaluated were senior officials in their firms -- an uncommonly high percentage for a USAID training program -- thus virtually assuring that the participants will try to implement changes. Several participants plan to hold seminars to disseminate what they have learned.  One senior manager was so taken with apple processing equipment at a plant in Ohio that he purchased similar equipment for his own plant.  Another, seeing a seed planter that had been modified to plant several rows at one time bought the machine for use at his farm back home.  Additionally, the close relations forged between NIS insurance executives and their U.S. colleagues have laid the groundwork for a potential joint venture. Future programs should make more use of videotapes to permit better dissemination of experiences once participants return home.  It is recommended that the project be extended for at least another year.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","FAO-0705-G-00-4055-00","","9/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Pilot projects|Participants|Management training|Top level managers|Agribusiness|Beneficiary count","New Independent States|USA","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABM290.pdf","461 KB","000238 - Agricultural Cooperative Development International (ACDI)","","007746 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of the Macedonia component (12/93-12/95) of a project to provide emergency medical supplies to eastern and central Europe.  The component was implemented by Project HOPE and focused on repairing or replacing key medical equipment in Macedonia's hospitals. The Macedonia component was well designed and relevant to Macedonia's immediate needs.  Unfortunately, Project HOPE field staff were forced by circumstances to set up a system and implement the bulk of equipment repair actions by themselves, without significant participation from Macedonian counterparts. Nonetheless, HOPE engineers and technicians restored to service a significant amount of essential medical equipment. In fact, 90% of the highest priority, repairable clinical equipment in the Ministry of Health (MOH) hospitals outside of Skopje, the capital city, was dealt with.  Additionally, HOPE was able to establish credibility with local hospital directors, and enlist the support of two of the best who agreed to use their facilities and staff to operate regional service centers (Bitola and Kumanovo). Training objectives went largely unmet, at least in the first year of operations, due to the paucity of technicians and engineers in the target hospitals and the unavailability of counterparts and a partner institution.  Also, HOPE staff were otherwise occupied with the actual diagnosis, calibration, and repairs of equipment; the training that did occur was primarily informal and on-the-job. Implementation was impeded by circumstances beyond HOPE's control, including the dropping out of a key potential counterpart and a range of challenges, mainly personnel issues, having to do with HOPE's administration of the project.  Although HOPE headquarters' staff took responsible corrective action in all cases, valuable implementation time was lost and program execution suffered from staff discontinuity. Lack of direct access to counterparts meant that HOPE had to rely on the good offices of USAID/Skopje to communicate with Ministry personnel at top levels.  This may have been partly the cause of delays in the signing of an agreement between USAID and the MOH for support of the two regional service centers. Anecdotal evidence indicates that the project significantly improved the capacity of hospitals to serve patient needs. Further, the basic building blocks for an institutionally sound and perhaps sustainable effort in the form of two regional service centers is close to being achieved as the first phase of the project closes out; it is important that outside support to the regional service centers continue. It is recommended that USAID extend the project 6 months to allow HOPE to implement the two service centers; diagnose and repair remaining repairable equipment; install spare parts in dismantled equipment; and develop a competency-based training plan for hospital personnel and technicians.  Also, in future projects HOPE should screen and orient field personnel more thoroughly and insist upon direct working relationships with key Ministry personnel to the highest level. Several lessons have been learned.  (1) Identifying and working with local counterparts is critical to the success and sustainability of any program whose major focus is the transfer of knowledge and technical skills.  (2) Training should be implemented in tandem with TA. at the national as well as at the local level with respect to the scope and sequence of project activities should not be underestimated.  (4) Establishing clear lines of communication within an organization is critical to understanding work responsibilities.  Administrative and logistical issues can best be resolved when the persons most affected are involved in problem-solving.

"This evaluation of donor efforts to strengthen the Filipino legislature examines the essential features of the country's legislative processes, the role of the national legislature in democratic reform, the contributions of USAID and other donors to legislative strengthening, and implications for legislative programming throughout the region.  The study's authors are cautiously optimistic.  Filipino administrative systems are well-established; legislative debate is recorded and published fairly quickly; plenary sessions and committees are open and operate under widely accepted rules of order, and, while they need to strengthen their lobbying skills, advocacy groups are already adept at forming coalitions, publishing newsletters, and running press conferences.  A sociopolitical role for NGOs was formalized in the 1987 Constitution and widely accepted in society.  The press, by regional standards, is open and free, balanced, and effective. There are also grounds for pessimism, however.  Although presidential power has declined from the days of Marcos, the legislature is still subordinate to the President, whose selection of sectoral representatives to the House has been slow; additionally, electoral reform has stalled and patrimonial and dynastic biases remain.  The report concludes that the Philippines requires at least three types of donor programming for institutional strengthening:  standard institutional support, support for legislative partners, and pursuit of crucial legislation.  Lessons learned for legislative strengthening elsewhere in the region are offered:  the significance of context (other countries may require more basic assistance, such as computer installation and skills training for legislative transcribers, than the Philippines required); the need for donors to remain flexible in terms of programming and analysis; and the importance of sharing information on successes between groups and countries.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","1/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Legal reform|Government reform|Democracy|Legislature|Development assistance|Development project design","Philippines","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNABS535.pdf","197 KB","008058 - USAID.

"Evaluates impact of a project to further national reconciliation in El Salvador by establishing the Center for Strategic Studies to Strengthen Salvadoran Democracy (Centro DEMOS) to provide democratic leadership training and promote dialogue among the country's conflicting factions.  The evaluation covers the period 10/93-12/95.  The project has been implemented through a cooperative agreement with the Institute for Central American Studies (ICAS). Centro Demos has conducted two courses (1/94-6/94 and 11/94-6/95) which have brought together 120 leaders from key sectors to learn to listen to one another, respect each other's views, and increase their tolerance of persons and ideas opposed to their own, without attempting to have the participants arrive at consensus on what was discussed.  The courses were based on topics selected by the institutions represented within five ""factors of power"": military, economic, political, social, and geographic. The curriculum includes conferences and panel discussions with speakers representing the different viewpoints, seminar-workshops, study tours, and informal ""supper-sessions."" The courses have resulted in positive changes in the level of tolerance among participants, but the degree of impact within the institutions they represent is unclear, and the impact on the reconciliation process even less so.  The project design did not include specific objectives or clear performance indicators. Also, the formal internal monitoring system required by the cooperative agreement has not been established.  Hence, there is no systematized data base to measure progress or assess results. Due to the political environment which existed when the courses began, plus the need to protect participants' confidentiality, information on the courses has not been disseminated. It seems, however, that the time for doing so has arrived. ICAS has also helped to establish FUNDEMOS, a foundation broadly representative of Salvadoran society, to serve as the permanent home of Centro DEMOS.  FUNDEMOS was constituted in 11/94, although legal recognition is still pending.  While no fundraising strategy has been developed, over 100,000 colones have been donated so far by individuals and local enterprises. Responsibility for project activities is to be transferred from ICAS to FUNDEMOS. Lessons learned are as follows.  (1) Participation of all interested parties in an evaluation process enriches the product, lowers the ""static"" within the system under study, and establishes a platform for the future. (2) To measure progress and results in conflict management projects, it is particularly important at the design stage to define ""success,"" identify clear indicators, and create the internal systems for continuous and participatory monitoring.  (3) To ensure greater efficiency from all available resources, human as well as financial, it is necessary for an organization to have a plan which is strategic, clear, and transparent, and which all interested parties help to design and keep up to date.  (4) Structuring an organization with two executive directors, separate departments, and different ""team"" labels leads to confusion as to who is in charge, and can interfere with the team spirit that should permeate the entire organization, particularly in departments that feel in the ""minor league.""  (5) NGOs should create the systems needed to take maximum advantage of all the voluntary labor, support, and expert advice that may be offered.  (6) In NGOs, a vision of self-sufficiency should be ever present, with solid plans to move continually toward that goal.  It is also in NGOs' interest to avoid dependency on a single donor.  (7) Creating a new entity as governing body in the middle of a project and trying to transfer authority and responsibility from the original sponsor to this entity creates frustration on all sides and leaves the program's executing unit in a confused situation.  (8) To increase the effectiveness of a participatory evaluation process, the participants should study what has been learned and convert this knowledge into a plan of action for the future.  (9) The type of document required from a participatory evaluation process should be decided by, and serve the purposes of, all interested parties, and not simply satisfy the procedural requirements of the sponsoring entity.  (10) A lack of flexibility imposed by administrative contractual procedures contradicts the very concept of participation and prejudices all parties involved in the process.","Delivery Order No. 25|Spanish version available in electronic format: PD-ABM-334|Informal series title: Rebuilding societies emerging from conflict","Special Evaluation","Documents","AEP-0085-I-00-3001-00|519-0411-A-00-3206-00","","12/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Social development|Political development|Political participation|Democratization|Indigenous private voluntary organizations|Leadership training|Political objectives|Foundations|Courses|Institution building|Societies in transition","El Salvador","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABM333.pdf","135 KB","003970 - Management Systems International, Inc.

"Evaluates project to provide training and TA to expand women's role in providing and managing family planning (FP) services (ACCESS project).  Interim evaluation covers the period 1991-12/95.  The project is implemented by the Centre for Development and Population Activities (CEDPA). ACCESS has met or exceeded all but one objective listed in the project amendment:  the objective of training 75-100 ACCESS alumnae as a Consultant Corps was not achieved due to problems in the design. However, plans have been developed to train an additional 40-50 alumnae over the next 18 months, and in Nigeria, ACCESS trained over 50 master trainers to serve as trainers for other country subprojects.  In addition, CEDPA/ACCESS has made noteworthy progress in management and financial systems, monitoring and evaluation, quality of care, integration of reproductive health systems, and institutional and financial sustainability.  All USAID Missions contacted during the evaluation commended ACCESS for excellence, flexibility, and responsiveness. ACCESS has trained 2,773 women in 7 countries as community-based distribution (CBD) workers; there is abundant evidence that the training has served to empower the women to improve their economic status, knowledge, skills, and role in the family.  At the managerial level, ACCESS has trained 82 women as CBD supervisors, 76 in subproject management, and 54 in administrative areas. ACCESS has provided quality, timely TA to its subprojects.  In Kenya, for example, TA along with staff training substantially improved the performance of the Kabiro Kawangware Community Health Project, which had been supported by other donors for many years with little success.  This subproject, about 80% completed, has now achieved 355% of targeted new acceptors. ACCESS has established effective and often innovative strategies for delivering quality FP services to disadvantaged groups in hard to reach geographic areas and challenging environments.  In 1995, ACCESS had 19 subprojects underway in India, Nepal, Kenya, Nigeria, and one beginning in Tanzania.  ACCESS has developed several promising service delivery models.  Two of its models -- one which adds FP to an ongoing urban social services program, another adding FP to a dairy cooperatives program -- are being successfully replicated in Uttar Pradesh, India, under Project 3860527.  However, ACCESS has not yet systematically examined continuation rates, an important indicator of quality of care, and only recently began to collect drop out data. ACCESS's knowledge of service delivery issues at the local level, coupled with its expanding alumnae base of trained, articulate leaders, gives it a unique comparative advantage in the area of FP advocacy.  In considering which types of advocacy groups to support, USAID should consider recent research findings that policy reform is more likely to occur when local groups understand the issues, feel they have a stake in the process, and are mobilized to undertake advocacy on their own. Policy reform at the national level is greatly facilitated by support at the local level. ACCESS works with its partners to encourage financial sustainability by developing management systems, preparing long-range strategies for sustainability, and diversifying funding (cost recovery, social marketing, fee for service, multiple donors, community contributions). Of eight service delivery subprojects (excluding Nigeria), six have multiple options for funding diversification, two have revolving drug funds, four charge a fee for service or a registration fee, and two participate in social marketing of condoms.  The Association for Health and Population Activities Project in Mali, which has now graduated, has had income generation activities for several years and now charges to provide training to other NGOs. All projects which generate funds have developed suitable accounting systems.  At the same time, however, only two current subprojects have assessed the full costs of service delivery. This area of sustainability will require ACCESS's greatest attention. ACCESS has honored its commitment to partners even when subproject funding was cut due to changing USAID policy and priorities, in all cases leveraging alternative funding to enable partners to continue activities; of 12 projects, only the Turkish Municipal project has closed due to changes in political support. ACCESS has developed several models for partnerships with other organizations to support sustainable development.  The traditional approach involves ACCESS channeling CEDPA resources to NGOs while simultaneously training women in the organization in leadership and management.  In response to criticism that this model yields minimal effects at state, provincial, and regional levels, ACCESS has developed several other models, e.g., working with consortia of NGOs, working with training centers, and working through other organizations' infrastructures (these include the Red Cross in Nepal, trading and religious associations in Nigeria, and dairy cooperatives in India).","Project title: Population technical assistance (POPTECH)","Special Evaluation","Documents","CCP-3024-Q-00-3012-00","","12/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Family planning promotion programs|Women in development|Family planning services|Community based delivery|Health care administration|Paramedical education|Management training|Access to services|Beneficiary count|Quality of care","Nepal|Nigeria|India","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABM342.pdf","243 KB","008485 - Basic Health Management International (BHM)|001131 - The Futures Group International, Inc.

"In 1989, when USAID/W reversed its earlier decision to close the Mission in Guinea-Bissau, USAID/GB began evolving a new assistance strategy which provides a model for other small USAID Missions.  This strategy, which links improved governance and participation directly to private sector development and economic growth, was consolidated in the Trade and Investment Promotion Support (TIPS) project (1992), which is virtually coterminous with the Mission's program.  Evidence to date suggests that the new approach is having a beneficial effect on increased private sector activities in critical growth sub-sectors. This report describes the major phases of this strategy development and the lessons learned from it. The unique design of TIPS arose from the nature of the governance constraints the project needed to address, which required that the contractor have a range of skills generally not available from a single firm.  As a result, the contractor is a five-member consortium in which no single member has competencies across the full project design and its four technical components.  Despite possible problems in this structure, TIPS has had remarkable success, critical to which was the contractor's ability to get off to a very rapid start because (a) the Mission had been implementing a coherent program since early 1991 and had procured equipment and space prior to the contractor's arrival; (b) the contractor was able to send its core team to Bissau twice before formal start-up; (c) the consortium provided excellent long-term and short-term experts; (d) USAID's public and private sector customers and partners accepted the premise of the TIPS project; and (e) the project design and the contract were model documents. Instead of organizations and institutions, TIPS emphasizes governance, procedures, policy reforms, the appropriate legal and institutional infrastructure, including democratic governance, fair and impartial adjudication of trade and investment (T+I) conflicts, civil society, and participation.  It is the program outputs that TIPS makes sustainable and what Guinean public and private institutions are replicating. There are four series of lessons learned from this history of USAID/GB over two decades, especially since 1991. Structure of a Small Mission's Model Program.  (1) Narrow the program focus to a single strategic objective.  (2) Concentrate program funds in a single project so that the program and project are largely interchangeable.  (3) It is possible (up to a point) to design and implement a program without bilateral funds.  (4) Managing a program rather than a project requires that the entire assistance portfolio be deployed as components of a single, focused strategic objective.  (5) Program sustainability refers to impacts and results, not projects, inputs, or institutions. (6) Operational constraints, though important, should not unilaterally and uncritically shape program decisions.  (7) Effective policy dialogue need not focus solely on particular policy issues.  USAID/GB had considerable success in explaining and promoting frameworks for identifying policy issues and the means to address them. Handling Controversial Projects and Programs.  (1) A new Mission with responsibility for shaping a controversial Project Identification Document (PID) into an acceptable Project Paper (PP) should seek USAID/W's early reactions to fresh ideas and variations in the PID.  In trying to save time by moving directly to the PP, the Mission ultimately lost time.  (2) A Mission that is in the vanguard of Agency thinking should shape the debate with Washington by identifying weaknesses in the prevailing wisdom and how the proposed alternative compensates for them. Lessons on Procurement.  A. Performance-Based Contracts.  (1) Such contracts, which focus exclusively on performance at the strategic objective level, are inappropriate for complex programs that incorporate program outcomes and project sub-outcomes as necessary and sufficient for achieving strategic objective impacts and for which processes (especially governance-related processes) are critical.  (2) Graphic displays of contractor responsibilities helps the contractor to focus on them.  B. Master Contracts.  (1) A project design which includes separate but related technical components enables the contractor to adjust to changing local conditions by shifting resources among the components.  (2) Master contracts may not be the most suitable implementation mechanism for a project with several technically specialized components, especially if the prime contractor has little experience in major portions of the contract.  (3) Master contracts should include specific wording on the project coordinator's function vis-a-vis the different members of a consortium of contractors.  (4) A Mission needs to understand what and why contractor interests differ from those of the Mission.  (5) Require the contractor to report on goal-level indicators, as well as on the project purpose and outputs. When combined with specific indicators of contractor success/failure, this requirement will keep the contractor constantly aware of what the project is about; it also contributes to a critical re-examination of project design and contractor performance. Both USAID/GB and the contractor become learning organizations. This is especially important for governance programs. Designing for Governance.  (1) Governance can be a successful approach to increasing private sector economic activities.  It should not, however, be operationalized, as in the objectives and outputs of the four technical components in the TIPS contract and the four program outcomes in the Mission's program.  These objectives and outputs identify the results of removing governance constraints to private sector activities in specific economic subsectors.  (2) Projects to assist a country's reform program will differ according to (a) who (international financial institutions or the host government) defines the program agenda and (b) how broad-based the agenda is.  The Government of Guinea-Bissau took on both economic and political reforms but had few structures and procedures for managing the reform process. A strategy focused solely on individual reforms (e.g., rice policy) may have little effect without attention to systemic problems. (3) Many obstacles to policy reform are more political than technical, requiring USAID expertise in political and governance analysis.  (4) Successful governance reform efforts need not involve ministers on a continuing basis.  There is proven merit in involving the ""best, brightest, and boldest"" in problem-identification, research, development, and implementation tasks that give the counterparts ownership of the initiatives.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","9/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Development strategies|Development programs|Strategic planning|USAID|Small|Private sector|Economic development|Nonproject assistance|Government","Guinea-Bissau","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNABX606.pdf","150 KB","008552 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of a project (9/93-12/95) to prevent the institutionalization of children at risk of abandonment and facilitate family placement of abandoned and institutionalized children in Judet Arges, Romania.  The project was implemented by World Association for Children and Parents (WACAP), working through Pentru Fiecare Copil o Familie (PFCF), a Romanian entity created to ensure sustainability. In line with the recommendation of the mid-term evaluation, Resita in Judet Caras-Severin replaced Judet Arges as the project site because it indicated a high degree of collaboration between child care institutions and local government and as well as strong community support.  Also, project objectives were redefined to include enhanced collaboration among child welfare institutions and between these institutions and local government. Under the project, five people were given intensive social work training, were affiliated with the Government of Romania's (GOR) child placement framework, and continue to receive supervision.  These Social Assistants (SAs) work to identify and counsel mothers at risk of abandoning their children, facilitate obtaining of birth certificates within the prescribed 15 days after birth, and place abandoned and institutionalized children with extended or adoptive families. Their efforts have had a significant impact on the child placement system in Judet Caras-Severin:  86% of mothers have decided to keep their children, and in the remaining cases the SAs have been able to obtain the mother's cooperation in securing a birth certificate and declaring the child abandoned, which allows implementation of a permanent plan for the child's future. Community-based care is becoming the preferred strategy for institutionalized and abandoned children, and stakeholders are being identified and invited to participate in social services to children.  A cadre of competent volunteers is being trained to support and extend this effort.  Regularly scheduled case-review conferences take place at the Commission for the Protection of Minors and involve representatives of all relevant agencies, the SAs, and concerned families. In sum, PFCF has succeeded in taking the first step in establishing a Permanency Planning program in Judet Caras-Severin.  Much has been accomplished in terms of establishing credibility with local GOR personnel and community leaders. Additional support is required for leadership development, improved governance, public education, and system-wide reinforcement.  Additional and alternative financial resources need to be developed to gain independence from GOR and maintain credibility.  The program has been resourceful in building links, collaborating with, and sharing resources with other PVOs. Lessons learned include the following.  (1) Needs assessments, local input, site-selection criteria, and stakeholder involvement are critical factors in project success. (2) Training should be reinforced with guided practical application.  Understanding the Romanian cultural and historical context and Romanian adaption of training material is critical to the impact of training programs.  (3) Projects that model alternative systems delivery and/or behaviors reinforce their practical application.  (4) Economic reform in Romania is lagging behind NGO development, making Board development and diversification of funding difficult.  (5) Lack of social services is perhaps the greatest barrier to children leaving institutions and a contributing factor to children entering them. (6) Systematic and intensive internal training and supervision, in addition to external modular social work training, leads to the formation of a sustainable team of social work practitioners, recognized and welcomed by the stakeholders in the community. (7) There is risk to donor credibility and to NGO development when a project is abandoned before it develops adequate means to become sustainable.  (8) Resources can be maximized and the outcomes multiplied when donors link grant recipients to one another.  (9) Community interest and involvement based on expressed needs are essential.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","11/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Child welfare services|Child care|Adoption services|Orphans","Romania","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABM379.pdf","851 KB","008744 - World Association for Children and Parents","","008596 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to increase productivity and export earnings among small farmer-owned businesses (FOBs) in Honduras.  Mid-term evaluation covers the period 6/92-11/95. Despite severe initial delays, the project is having a positive impact on production, employment, foreign exchange, and value-added processing.  However, most participating service-oriented FOBs will not register much impact on these indicators during the project's duration, except for processing.  At best, PACD indicator values will reach $5 million for foreign exchange and $5 million for value-added.  The EOPS indicators are too ambitious and should be modified to reflect the project's implementation capability and limits. FINACOOP's administrative restructuring program is being managed under the guidelines set out in the Project Agreement, but could be improved in two important areas.  First, because FINACOOP has never established clear objectives for the development of participating groups, it is not clear when they can graduate from the restructuring program.  Second, more attention must be given to management education. Additionally, the project's training program lacks the appropriate agribusiness perspective.  Training should focus on financial management for upper-level FINACOOP managers and entrepreneurial skills for those implementing FINACOOP's grassroots strategy with participating groups and their members.  There should be equal access for men and women to both kinds of training. Several types of tangible FOB service improvements are being provided, such as better quality, availability, and accurate weights of inputs at the retail level, stabilization of inputs price levels through volume purchases, a transparent process to establish produce market value, and higher market prices.  Further benefits can accrue to members if the FOBs can offer value-added processing and export marketing, but these activities are more complex and require much higher levels of capitalization and membership commitment to ensure success. The total number of FOB members in FINACOOP's program is about 4,400, but FOBs have broader influence than these numbers suggest.  FOBs are active with input services in townships with 56,627 farms and marketing services in townships with 55,775 farming units.  FINACOOP expects the program to reach 40 or more FOBs by the project's end. Lessons learned include the following.  (1) Progress benchmarks and indicators should be related to factors that can be affected by project implementors and be as independent as possible from exogenous variables. (2) A no-nonsense, disciplined approach to rural development based on the principle of self-help with clear implementation responsibilities and supported by an effective, timely information system for monitoring, is indispensable for success.  (3) A highly detailed project design which defines implementation procedures with great precision can itself become a hindrance to effective implementation if the circumstances under which a project is carried out change substantially.  (4) A human resource development program contributes to project success when it is initiated early enough to allow new skills and attitudes to be applied during the project.  New management at FINACOOP initiated an ambitious training program midway into the project, but its impact will be severely hampered because of delays.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","522-0383-C-00-5296-00","","11/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Agribusiness|Agricultural enterprises|Small farms|Agricultural cooperatives|Agricultural inputs|Agricultural product marketing","Honduras","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABM385.pdf","1,871 KB","006900 - Agricultural Development Consultants, Inc.","","008555 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (9/92-6/95) to capitalize an endowment to support the provision of family planning services by the Family Life Association of Swaziland (FLAS). The project was a success.  It provided the local currency amount of E5,329,610 ($1.681 million) to capitalize a FLAS endowment which has created an independent income stream for FLAS operations, generating E1,423,111 between June 1993 and June 1994, for an effective interest rate of 12.24%.  Of this amount, E562,690 has been reinvested as part of the endowment capital and the remainder used to recruit new nursing staff and support existing staff. The main lesson learned is that endowments are a very useful tool for enabling NGOs to focus fundraising on programmatic activities rather than regular operating costs.  The project involved minimum USAID inputs and will have results that outlast the Agency's presence in Swaziland.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","12/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Family planning services|Indigenous private voluntary organizations|Capital assistance|Endowments","Swaziland","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABM418.pdf","48 KB","008609 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (8/85-6/95) to increase the supply of U.S.-trained leaders and policy makers in Bolivia. This was a successful project, which reached leaders and potential leaders, trained a significant number of women, and satisfied a felt need for qualified professionals in the private and public sectors.  The three components (long-, short-term, and in-country training) had tremendous success and reached populations from throughout Bolivia, although the majority of participants were from the larger departments. Quantitative targets were exceeded.  A total of 63 long-term participants, including 15 women, were trained.  Short-term participants totaled 172, including 50 women.  The project's Democracy Awareness component, terminated after only 2 years due to the start-up of the Andean Peace Scholarship Program, provided short-term U.S. training to 60 socioeconomically disadvantaged individuals.  The in-country component, funded with local currency, was implemented via an agreement with IDEA, a local institution with programs geared to management training; 338 participants were trained, including 104 women,  Fields in which participants were trained included business, economics, finance, agribusiness, banking, women in development and leadership, public administration, the environment, health, demography, and project design and evaluation. Training resulted in qualitative achievements. Most, if not all, Master's participants have worked themselves into decision-making positions in the public and private sectors. Positions held include President of the Central Bank, Secretary of Finance, Director General Accounting Office, Director National Institute for Statistics, Minister of Finance.  In addition, participants are serving as bank executives, government advisors, CEOs, directors of important projects in the public sector, and consultants to international organizations. The following lessons were learned.  (1) The project did not set any limitations as to the income and social status of applicants, but sought individuals with potential.  Many who applied for scholarships were required to make a partial financial contribution, but the majority were not so required. With few exceptions, future programs should seek participant contribution towards the cost of training.  (2) Targets to train women should be determined based on real populations of women. (3) Outputs and impact expected must be clearly stated.  Persons trained is not an adequate impact indicator.  (4) Agreements among employers, trainees, and funders prior to training must be realistic, enforceable, and must promote productive utilization of the skills acquired by the trainee.  Agreements should not be used merely as legalistic instruments.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","12/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Education for development|Participants|Leadership training|Disadvantaged groups|Women in development","Bolivia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABM419.pdf","106 KB","008515 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of a child survival project (10/92-9/95) implemented by Save the Children Federation (SCF) in Nepal's Nuwakot District, northwest of Kathmandu. The project started in 10/92, in a new area for SCF, without major difficulties; the site was chosen because of concern about ""girl trafficking,"" which was reported to be a major economic activity.  The project's strategy was to empower communities to demand better health services from the government. Its major activity was literacy classes for women, leading to group formation and income generating efforts. Health education was introduced indirectly, through nonformal education (NFE). Government health services were supplemented by project mobile maternal/child health (MCH) clinics, and immunization catch-up rounds. The project has demonstrated the strength of literacy as an intervention.  Although most targets were not reached, progress was remarkable, with 10 of 16 indicators showing substantial positive change. Particularly notable were the numbers of new literates and women's groups. There was indirect evidence of nascent empowerment, but no evidence of change in provision of government health services. The major effect of the project, perhaps underappreciated by the staff, is the wide communication network produced by NFE and the resulting group formation; this network is responsive to SCF-influenced NFE facilitators, supervisors, and class participants. The major concern is that impacts have been the lowest among the Tamang, the area's predominant ethnic group; the Tamang are among the most economically disadvantaged in Nepal, and are the presumed focus of the trafficking activity.  Project staff need to make a more serious attempt to understand the Tamang and their relative lack of involvement in NFE.  Also, staff might consider living more closely with the community. Other lessons and conclusions from the project include the following. (1) Training local NFE facilitators is practical and sustainable. (2) One cannot assume that proximity to Kathmandu is an indicator of receptivity to modern ideas and values.  (3) NFE may not work as a strategy for influencing government health services.  Strong, motivated individuals in the government health system should be the focal point of trying to improve services.  (4) Behaviors and patterns associated with girl trafficking are difficult to assess; project interventions were not closely linked with the practice and thus had little impact on it.  (5) Jobs empower women in the eyes of the community, at least among Hindu caste groups.  (6) Prenatal care may not be acceptable to many people in the area, the birthing kit does not make economic sense to many people, and there is not a significant demand for traditional birth attendants, at least among the Tamang.  (7) IEC materials are not effective behavioral change agents, especially among nonliterate populations. (8) Geographic economics may be a major factor in sexually transmitted disease epidemiology in the region.  (9) Female community health volunteers (FCHVs) are a poorly understood work force in the project area; staff need to spend more time working with FCHVs to help them realize their potential.  (10) Most importantly, formative qualitative study should guide program development.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","FAO-0500-A-00-2034-00","","12/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Child survival activities|Nonformal education|Literacy instruction|Health education|Ethnic groups|Cultural environment|Private voluntary organizations|Women in development|Group communication|Information networking","Nepal","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABM420.pdf","764 KB","001407 - Save the Children (U.S.)|007749 - Save the Children/Nepal","","007746 - USAID.

"Evaluates Health Support II project in Honduras, to support primary health care (PHC) and sanitation services, with emphasis on child survival.  Second mid-term evaluation covers the period 5/88-5/95. The project has been extremely successful.  The closely working relationship between the Ministry of Health (MOH) and USAID has led to substantial administrative reforms. Although there are areas in which the project will not achieve its goals, water system and latrine construction goals have been met or exceeded, the diarrheal disease control program continues to be a great success, water quality laboratories have been completed, and the National Autonomous Water and Sewer Authority has decentralized its services and computerized its warehousing system, which is a model for Central America.  New facilities have been constructed in the regions and health center repair goals have been exceeded.  The Expanded Program of Immunization (EPI) is one of Latin America's stars, having reached ambitious coverage goals of more than 90%.  Honduras has been officially declared polio free and is close to eliminating measles.  The proportion of women seeking prenatal visits and the number of visits have climbed.  Family planning commodities are available in clinics with doctors.  The Organizational and Functional Development of the Service Production Unit (DOFUPS), an administrative system developed by the health sector projects, has been implemented nationwide, and decentralization is a reality in the MOH. Cost recovery is in place in over 70% of facilities.  The MOH has maintained a productive Division of Education, and short-term training goals have been exceeded. The successful programs are completely institutionalized.  The use of oral rehydration solution is so widespread that a commercial market has been created.  Health care has become an essential element of national politics. Though the U.S. share of donor support has shrunk, many programs will continue even if funding is withdrawn. Some programs have not reached their goals.  The reproductive risk strategy is only now being implemented at the local level, and not without problems.  High-risk pregnant women are not being identified or given special care, and the referral system does not appear to be working.  The community-based acute respiratory infection (ARI) treatment program is only now being initiated on a pilot basis.  It is unlikely that these areas will develop quickly without continued project support.  The POSAIN (Process for Organizing and Systematizing Child Health Care) system of integrated care for children, including nutrition, is also in the experimental stage.  Child malnutrition appears to be increasing, suggesting that mortality goals achieved may not be sustainable. Although many elements of DOFUPS have been implemented, weaknesses can be noted.  A health/management information system (H/MIS) that would take advantage of local planning to meet supply, training, and supervision requirements is needed.  Supervision has become problematic due to increases in per diem rates with no attendant increases in the budget, and the lack of functioning vehicles.  Community participation in health centers is also weak, and service integration at the community level is not yet a reality.  Long-term training goals have not been met, although the new M.P.H. program at the National Autonomous University of Honduras is a promising example of local solutions. Many of these problems must be addressed at the implementation level. Some programs lack proven or feasible technologies or adequate local models to emulate.  A model health information system for MOH, for example, does not exist.  The recommended project extension should address the underdeveloped areas by tackling implementation issues at the level of the health area, health centers, and the community, completing the path started with Health Sector I.  By developing sentinel demonstration sites -- linked through regions to the central level -- interventions such as the H/MIS, the reproductive risk strategy, and community-level ARI care, can be effectively implemented, evaluated, and modified. Lessons learned are as follows.  (1) The most successful components are those in which there has been the most congruence in U.S. and Honduran government policy, professional and community attitudes, and popular support.  The success of these components has permitted dialogue to take place in areas of less congruence, serving both nations' interests.  (2) The Health Sector projects' long duration -- from 1980 on -- has permitted close working relationships to be established and long-term goals to be set and achieved.  There has been an amazing continuity in goals for PHC, child survival, and administrative reform. (3) Further, this long relationship has produced an environment in which key players in the MOH and USAID have persisted.  Even when elections disrupted the MOH, key personnel were able to transfer to USAID-funded projects and maintain linkages, sharing their experience and waiting to return with the next change of government.  Projects need to give considerable thought to career issues when working in the health sector.","French ed.: PD-ABM-422|Delivery order no. 4","Special Evaluation","Documents","HRN-5974-Q-00-3002-00","","5/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Primary health care|Public health care|Sanitation|Child survival activities|Project sustainability","Honduras","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABM421.pdf","5,158 KB","003366 - TvT Associates|000981 - Pragma Corp.","","008555 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to help Zimbabwe meet its needs for trained technical, professional, and managerial personnel (ZIMMAN II project). Interim evaluation covers the period 1986-4/95. The project addresses a critical constraint to the development of Zimbabwe's changing economy, bringing resources to bear in an area in which the United States enjoys a comparative advantage.  The relatively slow pace of II's expenditures during the project's initial 4 years stems from constraints imposed by U.S. policy toward Zimbabwe at that time, and the availability of funding from ZIMMAN I, which ran concurrently with ZIMMAN II during those years.  With ZIMMAN II's shift in emphasis to the private sector in 1990, there was also a shift from high-cost U.S. training to low-cost in-country training, as well as continued delays in implementation due to changing USAID objectives, which reflected the new market orientation of Zimbabwe's economy.  In order to realize sustainable results from the project's efforts in identifying target groups and meaningful training courses, the project should be extended 3 years to 9/98. The prime contractor has proven responsive to USAID/Zimbabwe's direction.  However, the activities planned through FY 1995 are overly ambitious and will not allow the project to concentrate on the task of leaving a viable institutional training base.  Talented individuals are available locally for conducting courses, and trainees have demonstrated they can put their training good use, if the economic environment and capital accessibility allow. Changes in the economy and in the roles of the public and private sectors make it possible and desirable to increase public sector involvement in and awareness of ZIMMAN II activities.  Also, since the selection of training areas since 1990 largely precluded sectors in which women participate, a concerted effort to train women will have to be made. The average cost per participant in all (including U.S.) training activities ($2,300) only slightly exceeds that of a similar participant training project, HRDA ($1,900); however, the highly subsidized in-country training costs per participant ($1,114) average 3-4 times the cost of sending people to the best available programs in the country. Lessons learned are as follows.  (1) The economic environment in Zimbabwe has undergone immense changes since ZIMMAN II was amended in 1990 to support the private sector; at that time the economy was still fairly closed; the issues facing small and medium enterprises (SMEs) now are no longer determined by a single economy, but by business and trade patterns within southern Africa and changes in GATT and Lome II.  (2) Forces of nature are a major determinant of Zimbabwe's policies affecting SMEs.  For example, the drought of 1992 kept large mills primarily occupied with movement of imported grain; now, however, large mills are again purchasing maize at the village level, causing a number of the smaller grain millers who had sprung up to revert from production to service milling only.  (3) Few if any of the local training institutions involved with ZIMMAN II demonstrate a willingness or knack for marketing their competencies in Zimbabwe, much less in neighboring countries. Unless they are shown how and motivated to do so, South Africa could become the primary supplier of training in Zimbabwe and elsewhere in southern Africa.  (4) The records maintained by most SMEs participating in ZIMMAN II training do not provide any basis for quantifiable evaluation of this training.

"PACR of a project (9/91-12/95) to create the Swazi Business Growth Trust (SBGT) as a mechanism for stimulating the development of productive small businesses in Swaziland. The project far exceeded most planned outputs.  In 1995, when a follow-on project became unlikely due to the planned closure of the Swaziland Mission, USAID provided a $5 million endowment for SBGT.  The endowed funds are invested in the U.S.; it is expected that SBGT will receive quarterly endowment income in perpetuity. The PACR highlights the following lessons.  (1) It was expected that the Board of Trustees would be responsible for fundraising and endowments to ensure the SBGT's sustainability. This proved difficult for several reasons -- board members are full-time professionals, no board member was a professional fundraiser, and it is in any case difficult to raise funds for a new institution with no track record. Instead, the Board should be used where its specific talents lie (auditing, finance, legal advice, etc.) and contribute to the fundraising efforts initiated by management.  (2) Efforts to attract permanent management to replace U.S. contractors were delayed until the SBGT's sustainability, which had been in doubt, was made likely by the USAID endowment.  (3) As a result of the endowment, what could have been a ""white elephant"" became an example of USAID's flexibility and commitment to obtain results through a nontraditional assistance mechanism.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","12/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Institution building|Small scale enterprises|Business support services|Project sustainability|Fundraising|Endowments","Swaziland","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABM431.pdf","82 KB","008609 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to co-finance development projects undertaken by U.S. and local PVOs in Nicaragua.  Mid-term evaluation covers the period 1991-7/95. To date, 16 PVO subprojects have been authorized. Except in the area of natural resource management, these subprojects are proceeding on schedule and are having a direct impact on beneficiaries; USAID is urged to continue incorporating a PVO approach as part of its assistance strategy.  At the same time, the project's success is being constrained by a number of factors, including lack of medicines and supplies for child survival programs, excessive attention to subproject design, inadequate coordination with other donors, and the long processing time needed for subproject approval.  Also, the system for reviewing local PVO subprojects under the Title III program is working poorly, and should be turned over to the Government of Nicaragua's P.L. 480 Secretariat.  There is also a need to extend the PACD in order to allow PVOs to extend implementation time beyond 3 years, and to integrate PVO efforts with USAID projects in health, rural development, private enterprise, and democratization.  Project success might also be furthered by use of a PVO umbrella mechanism. PVOs' capacity-building activities with local communities have generally proven effective, but the project as a whole has not paid sufficient attention to strengthening the Nicaraguan PVO community at the national level.  Also, efforts of the Project Management Unit (PMU) to build PVO capacity have been effective in the area of financial administration, but until recently have been weak in other technical areas, specifically natural resource management. Systems for monitoring subproject activities are adequate (except for natural resource management), but PVOs' attempts to effect material changes through the Detailed Implementation Plans (DIPs) rather than through amendments to the original agreement are becoming a problem. Finally, although there are a few cases in which a PVO could handle a larger grant, increasing funding for current activities would place undue administrative burdens on the PMU and the Mission.","Companion Evaluation Summary: PD-ABN-156","Special Evaluation","Documents","524-0313-C-00-5058-00","","7/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Private voluntary organizations|Indigenous private voluntary organizations|Development projects","Nicaragua","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABM440.pdf","3,421 KB","009054 - DevTech Systems, Inc.","","008584 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (5/89-3/95)to investigate the complex relationships between Maize Rayado Fino virus (MRFV), its insect vector, and tolerant and susceptible cultivars of maize. The project was implemented by the University of Costa Rica (UCR). The project accomplished its main targets and, in some cases, surpassed expected goals.  Notably, the project identified the coat protein gene, as well as maize germplasm lines exhibiting tolerance/resistance to the virus; it also examined the geographic distribution of MRFV and strain diversity (information valuable to determining factors which influence the epidemiology of the disease). The nucleotide sequence of the geographically diverse isolates is useful in order to design better constructions for engineering MRFV-resistant maize.  In addition, the project improved the infrastructure of the UCR by building a modern greenhouse, and purchasing a freezer, cold chamber, water bath, and orbital shaker.  Several graduate students received their MSc. degrees while being trained and supported from this grant. The following lessons were learned.  (1) The project has allowed the introduction of new technology into UCR's biology research department by training UCR scientists in a U.S. laboratory.  Planning and performing experiments by both Costa Rican and U.S. laboratories working as a team has yielded many interesting and useful results.  Many molecular techniques that are essential to a plant pathologist, such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR), nuclear hybridization, cDNA cloning, and nucleic acid sequencing, have been acquired by the UCR scientists through this collaboration, which will enhance their ability to diagnose plant diseases rapidly and reliably and to creatively develop means for disease control.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Disease research|Agricultural research|Crop disease control|Disease vectors|Maize|Cultivars|Disease resistance|Varietal research|Universities and colleges","Costa Rica","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABM442.pdf","160 KB","008046 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of a project (8/93-10/95), implemented by the Asian-American Free Labor Institute (AAFLI), to strengthen the capacity of Sri Lankan unions to serve young workers. Though shortened from 3 to 2 years, the project met most beneficiary targets and evaluation indicators and generally achieved its purpose. It succeeded because it was based on existing union activities and responded to changes in context between its design in 1990 and implementation in 1993. Under the vocational training activity at the Congress Training Institute (CTI), 120 disadvantaged youth (vs. a target of 200) were provided with training.  The job placement program was not implemented, due to change in management, inadequate staff, and poor boarding facilities. AAFLI realized the need to deviate from the objectives and give direct and indirect TA to develop CTI institutionally and to reconstitute the Congress Labour Organization, which had managed CTI earlier.  AAFLI will continue to provide TA after project completion. The multi-union worker education program proved useful.  Two U.S. consultants trained 35 trainers (26 men and 9 women) from 6 unions, in excess of target.  Trainers from 5 of the unions conducted 136 seminars attended by 5,479 individuals (35% of them women), also exceeding target. The unions that developed an institutional approach (involving careful selection of trainers and participants, use of detailed curricula and participatory approaches, and program monitoring and evaluation) were more effective.  This component also produced training materials in Sinhala and Tamil, which proved useful for the trainers, though difficult for participants, most of them local union leaders. The project did not develop a ""pilot"" center for union-supported, village-level youth organizations, as planned, but instead established four youth centers (at Koggala, Deniyaya, Badulla, and Maskeliya) which emphasized activities based on participants' needs.  These activities included recreational activities, seminars, training of pre-school teachers, and skills development/income generation activities (e.g., for plantation women).  No in-service training or staff development was provided, and program planning and recordkeeping were inadequate.  The sustainability of some of the centers is in doubt. The revolving loan fund activity, in which union committee screened loans to be awarded by AAFLI, did not achieve its goal.  Of the 158 loans disbursed, only 40% were given to the intended beneficiaries -- unemployed youth, a group which the unions considered too high-risk. However, those who did benefit from the project were also in need of loans.  (If the objective is to give loans to unemployed youth, these should be carefully selected and referred to credit institutions, with the unions functioning as guarantors.)  In any case, the loan maximum established at project inception (Rs. 13,000) proved to be too low to create self-employment and enable borrowers to rise above the poverty level. Finally, the counseling center, established at Seeduwa, was felt to fulfill a relevant need, although it reached only 470 of 2,000 targeted women.  (Males were originally included in the target group, but were later excluded.)  Income generating/skills development activities were popular, but counseling services, medical clinics, and English classes were poorly attended.  However, the sharing of experiences at inter-zonal fellowship meetings and the advisory services given as a follow-up could be considered as a form of counseling.  Also, the meetings, the newspaper, and the employment of a client at the center were used to empower the target population and increase their sense of ownership of the center.  The center was not self-sustaining in the short term, but AAFLI and the unions have discussed alternatives. In terms of gender, the project as a whole benefited 2,655 females (43% of total) vs. a target of 3,310 (56% of total).  The project was thus implicitly aware of gender issues, but was not designed to address them.  A similar situation obtains at the union level, where a basic gender awareness coexists with a lack of gender-specific policies and strategies.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","383-0101-G-SS-3435-00","","1/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Institution building|Labor unions|Youth|Disadvantaged groups|Social services","Sri Lanka","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABM443.pdf","2,186 KB","001546 - Asian-American Free Labor Institute","","008606 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to support microenterprises and small producers in Peru (MSP project).  Mid-term evaluation covers the period 9/94-9/95. The MSP is a good project, very adequate to the objectives it was designed to fulfill.  Within a short time it has organized a team of high-level, highly motivated professionals who are providing services that are in demand, and it enjoys a positive image within the community. In general, the agricultural TA component is the strongest, largely because it has been functioning over a longer period of time in predecessor projects.  The technical services being offered (demonstration plots, nurseries, and trial plots) are of notable quality, and smallholders are implementing technical recommendations. However, many small producers cannot obtain the credit they need to implement the recommendations because they cannot meet bank requirements for collateral such as land titles; many smallholder farmers and small producers have not yet received their titles due to recent government policy. Also, participating grassroots organizations and NGOs need strengthening for sustainability, particularly in the area of financial analysis and cost control, production planning, and marketing strategies, and in developing management information systems. The Credit Access Program (CAP), in which strong financial intermediary NGOs serve as credit retailers, has proven responsive to the unique needs and constraints of microentrepreneurs and small producers in Peru, being adaptable both to the various sectors and products supported by the MSP and the various financial service providers and intermediaries in Peru (e.g. cajas rurales/municipales, NGOS, commercial banks, etc.).  However, CAP has suffered from implementation delays caused by weakness in the project's overall organizational structure, lack of coordination between CAP and the technical program, the absence of clearly defined roles related to CAP implementation, and inadequate staffing, particularly in the areas of TA and the institutional strengthening of CAP's implementation partners. Nonetheless, CAP holds great potential for cost-effectiveness and long-term sustainability and is responsive to USAID/Peru's Strategic Objective #2/Increased Incomes and Employment of the Poor.  To realize this potential, however, CAP will have to be (1) market-driven (by identifying market opportunities, designing appropriate market strategies, and establishing commercial and linkages between MSP clients and domestic and international buyers), and (2) capable of leveraging credit resources sufficient to cover client needs for both production and commercialization.  Achieving the latter will be especially challenging to rural financial intermediaries, which may need more institutional strengthening than originally contemplated if they are to facilitate sustainable credit access for MSP clients. Overall conclusions are as follows.  (1) MSP services are being implemented without policy, cost, subsidy, or sustainability strategies; cost analysis controls and a cost-effectiveness strategy are particularly lacking.  If sustainability is not achieved, clients may turn to other offerors.  (2) USAID and the Ministry of Economy and Finance are requiring the project's information systems to overemphasize process information, which could negatively affect the project's results orientation. However, because the project is still in a development phase, it may not be ready to work strictly on a result-oriented basis. (3) The project's Executive Advisor Committee (EAC) is not yet operative.  While this may have not have affected project implementation to date, operationalizing the EAC could reduce some of the project's structural weaknesses in regard to follow-up and sustainability. Operationalization of the EAC could also help to update the organizational chart, clarify roles, and coordinate implementation.","Related Spanish document: PD-ABR-050|Project title: Growth and equity through microenterprise investment|(GEMINI)","Special Evaluation","Documents","DHR-5448-Q-82-9081-00|DHR-5448-Q-00-9081-00","","9/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Microenterprises|Agricultural enterprises|Business support services|Small farms|Commercial credit|Private voluntary organizations|Financial institutions|Institution building|Agricultural production credit","Peru","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABM456.pdf","7,350 KB","006727 - Development Alternatives, Inc.

"PACR of a project (10/88-12/94) to establish the Special Development Fund (SDF) to help fund small-scale community development projects in Costa Rica. The project surpassed targets in most cases, approving 1,032 sub-grants for an equal number of community projects, mainly to support the construction of classrooms, health posts, school lunchrooms, water systems, rural bridges, and to support income-generating activities. Seven subprojects could not be finished before the PACD.  With one exception, the communities were not at fault for the delay, which was mainly due to the failure of the national water institute to provide its support on time.  However, three of these projects were finished by the communities a few months later. All recipient communities contributed materials needed to implement the projects, including land, labor, wood, fuel, design costs, tile floors, chain link fences, and construction tools.  These contributions were always equal to the donation received from the SDF and, in at least 75% of the cases, were worth more than amount received. The main lesson learned is that the overall success of the subprojects depended on the community's level of organization and management capability.  Other lessons learned were as follows.  (1) The poorer, the smaller, and the more remote the beneficiary community, the greater was the project's impact, since these communities did not have access to other sources of support.  (2) It was desirable and necessary for the subprojects to be coordinated with other public and private institutions, but the latter were not directly responsible for their implementation and maintenance.  The communities were at all times in charge of developing and managing the subprojects; this was one of the main reasons for the project's success.  (3) The close partnership between the Mission's office in charge of the SDF and the Peace Corps and in particular the work done by the volunteers involved in the project were key elements to its integrity and success.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Development projects|Community development|Community self help","Costa Rica","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABM462.pdf","89 KB","008533 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (6/89-6/95) to assist the National Shelter Upgrading Agency (ANHI) in implementing a Housing Guaranty (HG) program for low-income families in Morocco. The project was a success, but much remains to be done to solve the problems of Morocco's low-income housing sector. Despite its modest financing level, the project greatly benefited the HG program and ANHI as an institution.  Access to short-term TA, computers, training, and funding for studies and seminars helped ANHI build its internal capacity and to work through issues of importance to itself and the sector. ANHI was successful in terms of producing serviced lots for housing, upgrading unserviced neighborhoods, and producing and selling lots for cross-subsidy purposes.  Over the 6 years of the project, ANHI grew rapidly, both in staff and activities, and is now producing over 12,000 serviced lots per year (at times nearly 15,000 lots), after an initial period of a few hundred to 5,000. ANHI is now called on by sister agencies in the region to share its expertise as the lead residential land development agency in Morocco.  The selection of ANHI by the United Nations Center for Human Settlements as recipient of the 1995 World Habitat Award for human settlements projects for a site developed under the auspices of HG-003, and with assistance through this project, is one more indication of success, which led USAID to approve a follow-on HG at four times the dollar value of this HG. With project help, ANHI increased the private sector's role in low-income housing provision.  ANHI fully contracts all its works to the private sector and uses a variety of innovative means to increase the private sector's role at all stages of low-cost housing development. Nonetheless, the private sector's overall involvement in the low-cost housing sector remains limited.  ANHI has kept down the cost of its low-income housing lots and has worked consistently to reduce costs overall.  Further, the Government of Morocco (GOM) made policy changes during the life of the project which are helpful to ANHI, e.g., relaxation of certain rules usually imposed on parastatal operations, some concessions on zoning standards in ANHI-developed neighborhoods; these are due, in part, to the grant-financed studies and short-term TA. Nonetheless, the constraints to land development in Morocco, which include the limited role of the private sector, are substantial and complex, and the project did not solve them. They will continue to be matters for dialogue, by USAID, the World Bank, and other donors and lenders. The following lessons were learned.  (1) The project design would have been stronger had it paid more attention to ANHI's long-term financial sustainability, although in 1989 such a focus might not have been an acceptable topic for GOM decisionmakers, who maintained tight controls over ANHI as a parastatal agency.  (2) The project differed from most bilateral projects in that it was managed by USAID rather than by an institutional contractor.  The reliance on short-term interventions and multiple Mission-managed contracts allowed flexibility and hands-on experience for Mission housing and urban development professionals (who took a direct role in many project activities and in policy dialogue), but was a management burden for the Mission; the follow-on project will require a central institutional contract, although the its structure will be similar to the current project.  (3) Program/project design was ambitious, and the policy agenda was beyond the management capacity of ANHI and USAID. However, it is always easy to criticize selection of policy dialogue topics in retrospect (a lesson learned from USAID's policy-based cash transfer programs). If designers in this case erred, it was perhaps in appearing too confident that the various GOM agencies would agree on changes recommended by outside experts (and that such changes could be effected without major legal changes).  Those policy issues which are deemed still important are to be pursued in the follow-on program/project, which will have a larger budget and a more modest policy agenda than this project. (4) The HG program was different from earlier HG programs in Morocco, which reimbursed the Ministry of Housing for construction of core housing units for the poor.  The project, which was similar in nature to TA packages attached to cash transfer programs in many countries, did not stand on its own, but supported the HG program.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","11/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Housing investment guaranty|Private sector|Urban areas|Institution building|Low cost housing|Parastatals|Housing finance","Morocco","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABM460.pdf","1,190 KB","008579 - USAID.

"Final external evaluation of a project (10/90-9/95) to strengthen teaching and research capabilities at Sokoine University of Agriculture (SUA) in Morogoro, Tanzania, through linkages with Tuskegee University. The project was conducted as part of the regional Human Resources Development for Africa (HRDA) project. The project began slowly and should have been monitored more closely by the Mission.  Serious progress did not occur until 1993, when new SUA personnel took over, informed the Faculty of Agriculture of the project, and held seminars to explain project functions and responsibilities. Unfortunately, the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine was informed too late to allow them to participate productively, and serious time constraints forced the shortening of research projects and lowered the number of proposals submitted.  Nonetheless, Tuskegee did positively affect SUA's teaching and outreach programs, by helping to develop a new applied problem-oriented curriculum and improve student practica, developing approaches for problem solving (e.g., applied research training, gender sensitization), and disseminating innovations (e.g., outreach programs, computer seminars).  Extension workers and smallholders also benefited from training programs and applied research in such areas as ox-weeders, carts, and dairy goat production.  In addition, six SUA personnel received advanced U.S. training. The project's results, though limited, will be sustainable if funds are available for additional and duplicate research and technology transfer.  USAID/T should continue its support of this project.","Delivery order no. 4","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","AOT-0463-Q-00-3216-00","","12/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Institution building|Agricultural colleges|Agricultural education|Agricultural research","Tanzania","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABM463.pdf","1,237 KB","006007 - AMEX International, Inc.|001341 - Creative Associates International, Inc.

"Evaluates project to strengthen primary health care (PHC) services in Mozambique.  Mid-term evaluation covers the period 1991-9/95. In general, the inputs are suitable and appropriate for the outputs. The time programmed for the project is too short, and the level of inputs may not suffice to accomplish the outputs by the PACD.  It is recommended that the PACD be extended at least 2 years, and the financial and TA inputs be supplemented as necessary. The project is precisely what the Ministry of Health (MOH) needs to accomplish a significant part of its goal of improving the productivity of health services through better management.  The project strategy is to develop the capacity of the MOH through training and TA. Training takes time. The Essential Drugs Program (EDP) has responded to a significant need by distributing essential medicines to primary care centers.  It is functioning with varying degrees of success in different provinces and districts.  Staff training in logistics management, including supervision, has begun but needs strengthening at all levels.  The logistics management and information systems are weak.  The kit distribution system is somewhat inflexible, and is not responsive to health facilities with increased client load.  The procedures for getting additional kits to meet growing demand are not well known to staff at health centers and posts. There are still shortages and stockouts of EDP kits in some places.  Only one of three EDP supervisors has been hired. There is demand for family planning, but the health system is not prepared to respond.  Contraceptive prevalence is extremely low, with higher rates in urban areas and lower rates in rural areas.  Where health center and health post staff have received some family planning training, contraceptive prevalence is higher.  Little IEC or staff training have been done to date. Two policy studies have been completed by short-term TA and MOH personnel.  One deals with the delivery of PHC services through the private sector, the other with MOH budget allocations for prevention and PHC. The studies have provoked discussion and debate within the MOH which have led to policy decisions.  A third study will be conducted in the near future and will focus on family planning, contraceptive, and reproductive health policies. There have been significant gains in strengthening a decentralized institutional capacity within the MOH.  Planning and management capacities have noticeably improved in Niassa and Gaza, though not in Zambezia. An introductory management workshop was given in Gaza, Zambezia, and Niassa.  A second workshop, on supervision, was given in the first two provinces, and is planned for Niassa in the near future.  A 10-month intensive health systems management course is being partially financed by the project in Maputo.  There are 22 participants, including three each from Gaza and Zambezia.  A number of other training activities have been supported by the technical advisors. Systematic IEC activities have begun. Several staff members of the MOH Health Education Office (RES) have received initial training, though there is not yet a consistent counterpart for the long-term advisor. The advisor helped plan and supervise the collection of data for a KAP study of factors related to STDs/AIDS in the three project provinces.  The data are currently being processed and analyzed. An initial assessment on decentralization was performed by short-term TA.  The assessment report has already been discussed by MOH officials and further meetings are planned to help develop guidelines for decentralization.  One hindrance has been frequent postponements required by the MOH due to conflicts with other obligations.  A leadership workshop for MOH and provincial directors is being organized for the near future. The project has contributed significantly to virtually all aspects of the health strategic objective (SO) of the USAID/M Country Strategic Plan. The plan's overall goal is to enhance human productivity in Mozambique.  A subgoal, improved health for women and children, was established as an important contributor to the goal.  SO 3.0, increased use of essential maternal child health/family planning services, has three program and six subprogram outcomes (PO and SPO, respectively). The six components of this project are contributing to the fulfillment of all three of the POs, and to the six SPOs.

"PACR of a project (ending 9/95) to provide scholarships for U.S. training to potential Costa Rican leaders, especially those from socially and economically disadvantaged groups. This well-designed project was a success, training 2,023 individuals -- vs. a target of 1,800 -- in fields consistent with Costa Rica's development priorities, most notably in education, community development, public administration, and the agricultural and environmental sciences.  All trainees have returned to Costa Rica and are employing their skills productively and with an extraordinary multiplier effect. Trainees also developed a new vision of themselves and the world and grew in self-confidence and sense of responsibility. Establishment of selection criteria and of a selection committee composed of representatives from the Mission's technical divisions, training experts, returned participants, and members of the Training Office were key factors in the success of the long-term academic training component.  In addition, the use of intermediary institutions for the short-term technical training component, ensured the broad participation of the socio-economically disadvantaged in the overall training program.","Attachment: XD-ABM-482-A","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Education for development|Participants|Disadvantaged groups|Technical training|Undergraduate education","Costa Rica","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABM482.pdf","119 KB","008533 - USAID.

"PACR of a cooperative agreement (ending 12/94) with Fundacion Nacional de Clubes 4-S Clubs (FUNAC) to help implement USAID/Costa Rica's high school program under the Central American Peace Scholarship (CAPS) Project.  FUNAC implemented the training in cooperation with the U.S. National 4-H Council. Under the program, which was unique to the Costa Rican CAPS effort, FUNAC selected promising high school students, particularly those from rural areas, to receive (1) an orientation to U.S. life and culture, including 6-10 weeks of intensive English-language and cross-cultural training; (2) homestays of 9 months or more with U.S. families, attending school, participating in community activities, and working on projects with 4-H clubs; and (3) upon return, a week at the FUNAC training site for reentry and evaluation activities. The program was highly successful.  A total of 780 students participated.  Upon their return, these students have participated actively in their communities, and their status as leaders and role models indicates that the training has had a tremendous multiplier effect.  The training also opened new academic and career doors for the students -- knowledge of English helped with the latter -- and improved their self-image and sense of responsibility. The screening and selection process facilitated project success.","Attached to PD-ABM-482","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","515-0242-A-00-8548-00","","","","Four-H Clubs|Education for development|Participants|Youth|Indigenous private voluntary organizations|Agricultural training","","","","008533 - USAID.

"Assesses the impact of the energy conservation component of USAID's Energy Sector Assistance project in Jamaica (1981-85). The subproject, which trained energy auditors, carried out energy audits, and made energy conservation investments in both the public and private sectors, resulted in significant energy savings -- an estimated 13% in electricity usage.  The payback was rapid for public sector hotels and factories, which more than recouped investments through energy savings in less than a year. Nonetheless, impact could have been much greater.  The government's cheap energy pricing policy retarded energy conservation (electricity prices were well below costs until the early 1990's), as did its reluctance to offer tax, duty, or credit incentives to encourage conservation.  Incentive to conserve energy was also reduced by the dramatic decline in oil prices in 1986.  Ten years later, with petroleum prices still very low, there is only a marginal economic incentive to conserve energy, especially for industries in which energy costs are a small portion of operating costs. The project might have had a greater impact on energy consumption and achieved significant environmental benefits at the national level if it had targeted the largest companies in the most energy-intensive industries (a dozen Jamaican firms consume 75% of the country's energy). Instead, the project targeted a large number of small firms and businesses.  There is only scattered evidence of sustained or expanded energy conservation activities in the public and private sectors.  There are only a few energy auditors in Jamaica today, and only a few firms market energy conservation equipment.  There was little market demand from private businesses after 1986. Lessons learned include the following.  (1) Absent an energy crisis, only private firms that are relatively energy-intensive will make major investments in energy conservation.  (2) Successful energy conservation programs require supportive economic policies and appropriate environmental regulations.  (3) A relatively short payback period, a firm's long-term financial viability, and a positive investment climate are critical to making major investments in energy conservation.  (4) Energy conservation programs are likely to perform better in a competitive economic environment in which the business culture rewards firms that reduce production costs.  (5) Beneficiary commitment is critical to a sense of ownership and program sustainability. (6) Government is most effective when its role in energy conservation is limited to establishing an appropriate policy framework and providing education and information.  (7) The environmental benefits of energy conservation are realized in two ways: when less fossil fuels are used to generate energy or when the same amount generates more energy.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","12/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Energy conservation|Environmental technologies|Industry","Jamaica","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNABS536.pdf","263 KB","008058 - USAID.

"Evaluates the P.L.480 Title III program to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the Government of Mozambique's (GRM) food safety net security program through commercial food aid tied to policy conditions. Evaluation covers the period 4/1/91-5/95. The Title III program provided needed maize to people in Mozambique at a time when food production levels were insufficient to meet food security requirements.  By keeping food prices low in the marketplace, the program provided an income transfer to low-income people; this was the real food safety net. The program also contributed significantly to increased competition in the food market, resulting in greater market efficiency.  Except for the import parity price (IPP), all policy indicators have been met in substance.  Progress has been made in reaching the IPP for maize.  Since 1991, changes have occurred in Mozambique that now make achievement of food self-reliance possible. However, the program was not without shortcomings. These included serious quality problems with the maize (although an upgrading of standards has solved this problem), and the fact that the consignees' financial discipline and accountability is much better than that of the Government (GRM).  The delivery schedule for Title III arrivals is a pivotal problem; clustered deliveries can cause oversupplied markets, difficulty for receivers, wastage, and instability in the market, and can ultimately discourage local production.  Improved information on Title III deliveries can help to alleviate some negative side effects of clustered deliveries.  In addition, the GRM has not been as helpful as it should be in providing information to potential consignees.  The consignee selection process managed by the Ministry of Commerce for the GRM is now neither as transparent nor as effective as it has been and should be.  The Ministry has moved away from the established pre-qualification system that had been in place. The basic overall recommendation is that USAID begin planning for a well-managed draw-down of the Title III program over the next 5-6 years. Management of this draw-down is critical.  Too rapid a reduction could lead to food shortages and resultant economic and political instability. Too large a Title III program, on the other hand, could hinder expansion of local food production and eventual achievement of food self-reliance. At the policy level, USAID, in coordination with other donors, should press the GRM to continue moving toward IPP of commercial food aid.  Two new policy areas for the Title III program are suggested:  (1) revision of the financial relationship among the consignees, the GRM, and the special account; and (2) incorporation of the DANIDA-funded program of management and technical assistance to the port into the overall privatization scheme.

"Evaluates Private Sector Support Program (PSSP)/Project (PSS/TA), aimed at supporting private agriculture in Mozambique.  Interim evaluation covers the period 1991-5/95. The PSSP has successfully completed its initial Policy Agenda, implementing significant and fundamental changes in the agricultural and petroleum sectors.  Although formal policy dialogue was sidelined in 1992 by the drought and then again by the transition period, policy advances have continued. Progress in the Policy Agenda's six areas have been as follows.  (1) Despite some backsliding, price liberalization has progressed to cover nearly all agricultural products and has had a significant impact on production and on market availability of farm products.  (2) Divestiture of state farms, previously an enormous financial drain, has been largely accomplished. However, equitable resolution of conflicting land claims engendered by divestiture and of overlapping claims to other land by family farmers, commercial interests, and speculators will be crucial -- not only to the development of agriculture but to political tranquility for the nation.  (3) The Commodity Import Program (CIP) provided significant quantities of tractors, other farm equipment, and small trucks, thereby helping to reestablish farm production and improve the movement of people and products to and from market centers.  The CIP also improved the supply of agricultural inputs.  Policy dialogue promoted sector efficiency by privatizing parastatal agricultural input supply and service conglomerates. (4) The significant foreign exchange rate distortions of the past have been eliminated and private sector access to foreign exchange has improved.  In the long run, availability of foreign exchange will depend on increasing export earnings, particularly from agriculture.  (5) A functional free market trade in food grain and other foodstuffs has developed to replace the rationing system, which has become less able to satisfy food requirements in Maputo and Beira.  Private sector wholesale and retail trade in food grains, beans, and other nonperishables have been reestablished, largely superseding AGRICOM, the Government purchasing agent.  Retail trade has also been liberalized and expanded, as small itinerant traders supply consumer goods to rural areas and scour the countryside for farm products to retail in an increasing number of open-air markets. Domestic purchases of white maize and other products by PVOs is helping to reestablish the rural market structure. Marketing of export crops such as cashews and cotton, crucial to raising small farmers' incomes, has improved considerably in recent years with the privatization of marketing boards.  Marketing channels have now been reestablished in most of the country, but barriers remain to new firms eager to export crops such as cashews and cotton.  Removal of remaining restrictions on crop exports and of barriers to new crop exporting firms is crucial.  (6) There is compelling evidence of a direct impact of the PSSP in the substantial policy reforms that have occurred in petroleum importation, pricing, and marketing. The PSS/TA project, implemented by Cornell, Michigan State, and the University of Wisconsin Land Tenure Center provided information and analysis on which to base food security, price and marketing, and land tenure policies within the framework of a market economy.  The pilot market information service is widely recognized and needs expansion. Land issues have been brought to the forefront and much of the shape of the policy debate on land issues has been framed.  On-the-job training, along with U.S. degree and nondegree courses, has prepared a small number of young Mozambican professionals to deal with these issues. The CIP has proven adequate to the program's needs and flexible in responding to a changing economic climate.  At crucial moments, the CIP financed petroleum imports without which the economy, including agriculture, would have ground to a halt. Recent increased interest of U.S. manufacturers in the southern African market means that nearly all CIP-financed commodities are of U.S. origin.  The Government has also adopted a more rational pricing policy toward foreign exchange, as long advocated by the United States and other donors.  The CIP has been forced to take on some functions normally provided by commercial banks due to continuing weakness of the banking system and its failure to mobilize necessary financial resources.  The CIP has also contributed to the Government of Mozambique's (GRM's) budget through generation of local currency amounting to approximately 1% of GRM total revenues over the program's life. Food aid also contributed to the program's policy agenda, as well as the country's food security.

"Mid-term self-evaluation, conducted by the project manager and grantee personnel, of a grant to Salesian Missions to provide social services and skills training at Lhanguene Orphanage and Training Center in Mozambique.  Evaluation covers a period through 5/95. Given the difficult economic conditions in Mozambique, progress has been satisfactory.  Remodeling and renovation work for the first half of the project will be completed by 7/31/95, which is within the time frame established in the contract with the builder. Although the first group of orphans have not yet taken up residence in the orphanage, all are attending primary school and receiving some oversight by the Salesians responsible for administering the orphanage and community center. Twenty-five of the forty orphans have lunch at the orphanage after completing their morning classes before returning to the families now looking after them.  The orphans are expected to begin boarding at the orphanage by 9/30/95.  The process of enrolling the second group of 40 will begin in October. The most serious problem to date has been the refusal of customs authorities to release the equipment and furnishings ordered from South Africa without first receiving payment of the import duties.  Under an earlier agreement between the Salesian community in Mozambique and Government of Mozambique (GOM) authorities, the Ministry of Social Services is responsible for payment of these duties.  The Salesian Delegate to Mozambique is trying to resolve this problem through official Ministry channels.  Although the Salesians could easily solve this problem by paying the duties themselves, this would establish an unfortunate precedent with regard to the exemption previously granted, which the GOM has a legal responsibility to honor.  The Salesians are not likely to recover any funds they pay for duties.  If the problem is not resolved within the next 60 days, other options should be considered.  For example, the Director of the orphanage could purchase locally the bare essentials needed to permit the orphans to move into the orphanage until a permanent solution is negotiated. The Salesians continue to offer a variety of educational programs to the local community, although on a limited scale pending completion of repairs and remodeling. These include typing instruction, literacy instruction, and formal sixth grade courses, the last two of which are being offered in the primary school located adjacent to the orphanage which the Salesian community has agreed to administer at the request of the Ministry of Education. In the first half of the year, USAID/M's Controller's Office recommended a number of improvements to strengthen the administration of funds provided to support the orphanage.  The team endorses the thrust of the Controller's report and believes that the implementation of many of the recommendations will strengthen project management. The construction of a new workshop building discussed in the project proposal as a later phase in restoration and development of the orphanage complex is nearing completion and is expected to be in operation during the last year of the project.  The workshop, which will enable the Salesians to offer a greater variety of skills training programs, represents a very substantial contribution to the project's long-term goals and a real dividend on the USAID's investment.

"Final evaluation of project (5/94-10/95) implemented by CARE to provide emergency water facilities in Machaze, Mozambique. The project met its targets, but its impact is not easy to determine. A total of 51 new boreholes were constructed and 4 existing boreholes were rehabilitated, vs. an overall target of 50.  Of the 55 boreholes, 27 were equipped with a functioning pump, including 25 hand pumps, at the time of the evaluation.  Nonfunctioning pumps included 3 AFRIDEVs and 7 VOLANTAs. Repair and installation of VOLANTA pumps has been seriously delayed due to the need to order new unions from Europe; alternatives should be sought. At 53 water points, a collection to cover maintenance and repair was established; the average amount of collected money is MTS 509,804.00, which should be sufficient to cover repair and maintenance of an AFRIDEV pump for 1 year, though not enough to ensure sustainability of a VOLANTA pump, which is not a Village Level Operation and Maintenance (VLOM) pump.  Training is needed to ensure proper management of the maintenance and repair fund, since a poorly functioning cost recovery system could prevent community acceptance of such systems in the future. Six of ten targeted mechanics received on-the-job training in installation and repair of AFRIDEV and VOLANTA pumps, but this training is not considered sufficient, particularly in regard to the VOLANTA pumps. There needs to be a clear structure at the district and administrative post level to coordinate the mechanics' activities. Forty-three groups of water point caretakers totaling 251 caretakers (21% of them women) are responsible for the 53 water points that are managed by the communities.  These caretakers received training in hand pump operation, basic maintenance and repairs of hand pumps, and water use practices. However, only the caretakers trained in 1994 (responsible for 11 water points with AFRIDEV pumps) have sufficient experience to repair and maintain their pumps.  Caretakers trained in 1995 have not yet had experience in repairing breakdowns independently; also, it is unlikely that they will be able to perform maintenance and major repairs on VOLANTA pumps.  They have proved able, however, to maintain hygienic conditions around the water points and to educate water users with respect to safe collection and transport of water.  Some 35% of water users (especially women) attended at least one talk in sanitary education by animators trained and equipped by the project. The impact of the project with respect to the pump use in northern Machaze is difficult to quantify because the available data show widely divergent population numbers in the area.  It seems that the project resulted in a decrease in the ratio of users in northern Machaze to 1,778-3,317 beneficiaries per water point (30 water points) at the time of the evaluation. After the installation and repair of pumps on the remaining boreholes, pump use will drop to 1,046-1,951 beneficiaries per water point. However, in the southern part of the Machaze district the situation is still dramatic.  At the time of the evaluation, pump use was 9,866-21,328 beneficiaries per water point (2 water points, but may decrease to 1,973-4,256 after the installation and repairs of pumps on the remaining boreholes in this area (resulting in 10 water points). For this reason, special attention should be given to this area in future activities. The criterion to have a reliable water source within 7 km for 90% of the beneficiaries was established when the population was concentrated in the central towns of localities and administrative posts.  After the elections of October 1994, the population scattered over the area. Considering this new situation, the project mobilized the population to open roads, generally parallel to existing mined roads, to the new inhabited areas.  As a result, 94 km of roads have been opened, specifically for borehole drilling.  Despite these attempts, an estimated 16% of the population of northern Machaze will continue to live more than 7 km from a water point after the installation and repair of pumps on the remaining boreholes in this area.  In southern Machaze a larger percentage of the population will not have a reliable water source within a 7 km distance.

"Evaluates project to strengthen small and medium-scale enterprises (SMEs) in Morocco through organizational and administrative reform, access to credit, and business advisory services.  Mid-term evaluation covers the period 10/92-11/95. After 3 years of activity there are some successes, but they are more qualitative than quantitative.  The reform component has achieved some concrete results and initiated promising grant activities, yet there has been no Government of Morocco (GOM) response to the project's reports recommending reform, and there is no assurance that it will respond, despite the private sector's interest in reforms.  The grants to 13 SME associations seemed to have helped unite the SME community around issues of shared interest, but the full impact of these grants is difficult to assess.  The computerization of the Registre Central du Commerce is a groundbreaking accomplishment.  Despite the mixed record to date, implementation of this component is being vigorously pursued and it is expected that results will be more fully realized within the next several months. In the business advisory component, the Centre de l'Enterprise due Maroc (CEM) has struggled to establish itself and determine where its focus should be and how it should be structured, but CEM has been able to meet few of its numerical goals; nor is it likely to achieve financial self-sustainability. CEM's problems seem to stem from (1) a deeply flawed project design that ignored cultural considerations and imposed unrealistic objectives which required/encouraged an elaborate physical infrastructure and a budget and staff inappropriate for the task assigned; (2) use of a cooperative agreement (CA) as the procurement instrument which denied USAID the necessary control over CEM's operations; (3) the limited experience of Ecole Superiere de Gestion (ESG), the CA recipient, with the SME sector despite its claim to posses such experience; and (4) a lack of understanding by USAID and ESG of how an entity such as CEM should have been structured, and what results it could be expected to produce.  The CA should be terminated as quickly as possible. The proposed credit facility was never established, for reasons beyond USAID's control.  Its loss has been much lamented, although in light of CEM's difficulties, the decision not to fund the facility may have been inadvertently fortunate. A pilot program, Credit Wassila (CW), has been introduced but made no credit awards to date.  CW's design is questionable in that CEM -- with a vested interest in having its clients obtain credit -- was designated to be the decision maker with Banque Centrale Populaire expected to provide virtually automatic approval of those candidates CEM proposed for credit.  In the absence of CEM or a similar USAID program for business support services, the component should be discontinued. The following lessons were learned.  (1) USAID should have obtained the GOM's firm support for all the project's objectives, and sensitized all parties with whom it worked as to the potential far-reaching impact of successful organizational and administrative reform.  (2) Avoid allocating funds only because they will be returned to Washington if they are not used. (3) Avoid entering sectors in which so little is known.  There were not sufficient grounds for committing to a $25 million effort with SMEs.  One effective way to avoid entering areas where there is unsatisfactory information is to move the project forward in stages.  For example, at least three small CEM centers could have been started in different cities with the funds that were committed to one large center.  (4) Avoid projects that involve risk if one is not prepared to take a risk.  (5) Avoid using CAs for projects over which USAID wishes to exercise reasonable control.  (6) Avoid unrealistic projects.  It was estimated that 20-50 people would visit CEM each day, with an equal number of other contacts.  During a 3 years, only 5,000 contacts were made, vs. a target of 22,000-52,000.  (7) Be willing to cut losses early in a project, if warranted.  (8) Avoid inconsistencies between and within contracts and other procurement instruments.  For example, the CA has numerous contradictions regarding its goals and what was to be accomplished within a given time period.  (9) Avoid the term ""self-sustaining"" when the real goal is for an activity to become ""self-perpetuating"".","","Special Evaluation","Documents","PCE-0001-I-00-3023-00","","12/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Small scale enterprises|Commercial credit|Business support services|Institution building|Medium scale enterprises|Economic administration|Government reform","Morocco","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABM529.pdf","5,347 KB","007546 - Eccles Associates","","008579 - USAID.

"Assesses the impact of USAID's economic development program in The Gambia, which was terminated by USAID following the 7/22/94 military coup d'etat.  The program included:  the Financial Sector Restructuring (FSR) program (6350233); the Financial and Private Enterprise Development (FAPE) program (6350232); the Agriculture and Natural Resources (ANR) program (6350235); the Human Resources Development for Africa (HRDA) project (698046335); and the P.L. 480 Title II Program. Much of USAID's assistance has been both successful and effective. In particular, USAID collaborated closely with the World Bank in negotiating policy conditionality and providing TA, while its rich history of identifying new technologies continues to provided a strong technical basis for NGO programs in the country.  Impact indicators taken in 6/94 show that the reforms supported by the program were having a significant impact, particularly in the formal private sector. Inflation was under control, agricultural production per capita increased slightly, average real wages continued to increase, and the banking sector showed continued progress.  By 12/94, however, less than 6 months after the coup, employment levels had dropped by 25% in the formal economy, especially in the trade and tourism sectors, and real wages were up, but because the employees who were laid off first were the lowest paid.  However, indicators also suggest that the Gambian economy can pull out of its recession with the proper mix of stable macroeconomic policies and donor support. The most positive lesson of the coup d'etat is that policy reform is a long-term, continuous process; although many expatriate advisors were withdrawn from the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank after the coup, institutional support for reform remained strong.  In fact, the two agencies were able to protect essential reforms and keep the lid on the budget (the value of the Dalasi did not plummet, as some expected, primarily because of action by the Central Bank).  Officials were also able to resist pressures from the ruling council to adjust the foreign exchange rate.  That the reforms do seem to be eroding is probably due to continuing pressure from the military rather than weakness in the reforms themselves. Public education is a critical part of policy reform.  Although proposed changes in business law were publicized and discussed, most negotiations took place in secret, behind closed doors, when frequent public discussions would have helped to consolidate support.  In addition, public debate could have educated those young people who supported the coup as to how much real economic progress had been made since the 1980's. Some Gambians argue that, ironically, the benefits of economic reform are now helping to perpetuate military rule; that, had the coup occurred in 1984, when economic conditions were very bad, the economy would have very quickly ground to a halt -- and popular support for military leaders along with it. While this is no argument against reform, it does undercut the military government's criticism of the former regime's acceptance of  donor-imposed' reforms. The major lesson taught by FSR is this: Privatization and debt recovery are both economic AND political actions with the potential to contribute to significant political upheaval.  FSR's effort to privatize the Gambia and Commercial Development Bank and recover debts owed to it was far more difficult and complex than was originally realized. Unfortunately, USAID did not respond to the complexity by showing its willingness to be flexible and to address constraints that had not been identified earlier -- including lack of an independent judiciary, an inefficient court system, weak enforcement mechanisms, and insufficient public support. Several lessons can be learned from FAPE.  (1) Tax reform should begin with administrative improvements and then proceed to policy.  (2) For human capacity building, recurrent short-term TA may be better than long-term TA (over reliance on expatriates was resented by U.S.-trained Gambian professionals, who were not given opportunities to grow in their responsibilities).  (3) The salary and incentive structure for civil servants was inadequate.  (4) Use the private sector (not government) to promote the private sector.  (5) One-time, short-term TA was ineffective in strengthening Gambian businesses.  (6) FAPE overemphasized trade with the United States rather the traditional European markets.  (7) Education is key.  The greatest constraint on The Gambia's economic growth remains low human capacity. Lessons from ANR: (1) Policy formulation and decentralization must go hand in hand.  (2) Program budgeting requires a long time to institutionalize.  (3) Although The Gambia's environmental information system is a model for Africa, USAID's investment in it of over $1 million could be lost, because some level of TA is needed to sustain it. (4) ANR assumed that the availability of grant money would magically increase NGOs' capacity to work in the sector, but in fact, NGOs did not necessarily want to expand their operations just because there was money available (this was just one of several obstacles to the plan for implementing local-level ANR control).  (5) ANR's emphasis on environmental education, on the other hand, succeeded in providing a basis for community-based natural resource management. Finally a lesson from HRDA:  gender equity in training is very hard to achieve -- due to mostly to the incredibly high illiteracy rate of The Gambia's women.  The Mission tried to compensate by emphasizing in-country business training for women, but was never fully satisfied with its attempts.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","5/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Structural adjustment|Policy reform|Revolutions|Economic reform|Nonproject assistance|Level of education|Political aspects","Gambia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABM530.pdf","1,640 KB","008545 - USAID.

"Final external evaluation of a project (8/86-12/95) to improve the efficiency and quality of primary education in Honduras. The Ministry of Education (MOE) and the project have made tremendous efforts to establish in Honduran classrooms a learner-centered, self-directed process in which children assume increasing responsibility for the school, the school community, and the learning process itself. However, the project is vulnerable to derailment when other donors such as the World Bank and Germany replace USAID's inputs.  The MOE needs continuity in both purpose and funding to sustain its momentum towards major changes in the way teaching and learning takes place in Honduran schools.  Unless the new donors build on this project, there will be a costly discontinuity.  USAID is funding a coordinating position to assist in the transition from one donor to another. The project achieved 8 of the 9 objectively verifiable indicators of national impact envisioned in the revised logframe of 1992.  Especially successful were the reduction in the numbers of primary school dropouts and the increased numbers of fourth and sixth grade primary school graduates (the level of education associated with achieving basic literacy and numeracy).  For example, 1994 primary school graduates equaled 70% of the 13-year-old population, which is one of the highest rates in Central America, as compared to about 50% in 1985.  Some 75% of the objectives of each project component were met or surpassed, and another 14% were substantially met. Especially successful were the textbook development, printing, and distribution component and the school construction component. These two components account for 55% of the project budget, excluding the MOE's contributions for construction. Targets not met were related, for the most part, to automation; the management information system (MIS) and the testing and evaluation components were especially affected by this.  Transfer of computer technology to project staff was undermined by the long delay in obtaining computers, the limited level of computer literacy in the job pool, the high turnover of staff due to political changes in the government, and the higher salaries offered in the private sector for trained computer technicians. The project's analytic requirements were greatly overshadowed by production demands.  Consequently, while production schedules were met (e.g., key objectives were identified, tests were fabricated, texts were published), there tended to be a lack of technical analysis which would have sharpened the focus and utility of project efforts.  Analytical technology was not transferred, and an opportunity was missed to move from the relative obsolescence of much information that the MOE traditionally collects to a more discriminating, systematic identification of useful information and a higher level of information analysis. An ongoing mechanism for quality control was not institutionalized. For example, quality control mechanisms tended to be discrete, perhaps one-time, events in the sequence of developing tests or texts.  They were not built into the project as strong evaluation feedback loops for curriculum development, teacher training, test development, evaluation, or MIS initiatives. EDUCATODOS--an alternative system for delivering basic education to out-of-school youth and young adults, funded by this project, LearnTech (9365818), and the BEST project (5220388)--is off to a good start. Factors that may inhibit sustaining EDUCATODOS' initial momentum include: problems with promoter selection and lack of transportation; expansion that outstrips logistical support; ineffective lessons for some target groups; delayed inputs from NGO and municipal partners; and administrative, financial, and logistical complexities. The following lessons were learned.  (1) Due to bureaucratic red tape and other obstacles, the project developed a functional pattern of contracting out for technical and administrative services, although it did not succeed in establishing a mechanism for obtaining critical equipment in a timely fashion.  (2) In countries with a high staff turnover due to political, social, and economic conditions, continuous training is needed, and institution-building goals may need to be reframed in terms of enhancing the skills of a national pool of education specialists.  (3) Key to the project's success have been its 10-year time frame and the dedication of its staff.  (4) To sustain momentum toward major changes in teaching and learning, inputs need to be: continuous; timely; continuously improving in quality as a results of feedback from teachers and children (via surveys and achievement tests); and part of an integrated plan which is fully aligned with the MOE's vision of primary education.

"Evaluates the impact of training provided businesses by the Botswana Confederation of Commerce Industry and Manpower (BOCCIM) under the Botswana Private Enterprise Development project.  The evaluation is based on feedback from 171 course participants and 32 companies. BOCCIM has provide a range of business training, covering, inter alia, management, marketing, supervision, personnel management, financial management, planning, and entrepreneurism.  The courses have had a significant impact on the majority of participants, with 95% of respondents reporting that they gained knowledge from BOCCIM training and 80% reporting they were able to apply their knowledge to their work. BOCCIM training has also enhanced the efficiency and effectiveness of the organizations from which trainees came and to which they returned, with 88% of companies reporting increased efficiency and 84% reporting increased effectiveness at work as a result of training.  On the other hand, a significant majority of company representatives stated categorically that it was not possible to say whether training courses had any impact on profitability. The study did not find that trainees' gender significantly affected training outcomes; educational level, however, positively affected knowledge gained, knowledge transferred, and post-training effectiveness.  Smaller businesses (25 or fewer employees) reported easier knowledge transfer and greater efficiency than did larger (100 or more employees). There was also a positive correlation between business type (manufacturing) and effectiveness. Clearly, where training is reinforced in the workplace there is more impact on knowledge transfer, efficiency, and effectiveness.  It appears that where reinforcement occurs, the interest shown by management and co-workers optimizes the impact of training.","Project title: Botswana private enterprise development (BPED)","Special Evaluation","Documents","623-0253-C-00-2014-00","","9/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Private enterprises|Business enterprises|Management training|Business associations","Botswana","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNABY182.pdf","2,294 KB","007893 - Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu International","","008516 - USAID.

"PACR of a grant (6/92-9/95) to Caja Costarricense de Seguro Social (CCSS -- Costa Rica's social security agency) to improve public sector reproductive health (RH) services in Costa Rica, consolidate them under CCSS's direction, and make them self-sustaining. The project met most of its objectives.  RH services have been institutionalized within the public sector's preventive health framework, and outpatient services have been regularly provided (although restructuring of the health sector and decentralization of service delivery complicated operational and supervisory aspects, services continued uninterrupted).  The new CCSS management has focused on community-level multi-disciplinary RH teams, but services are still also provided at workplaces. Results from a 1994 survey of medical and administrative barriers to quality service delivery were used to improve administrative mechanisms, logistics, supplies, and training. Project training focused on medical schools, and on improving cervical cancer detection, counseling, and gender considerations.  The 1994 survey indicated that the majority of family planning services in rural areas are provided by doctors in their social services practice, so there is increased interest in improving medical schools.  Technical teaching guides that were evaluated by USAID/W clinical training projects were given high marks. Moreover, CCSS is now procuring (with domestic resources) all the oral contraceptives, condoms, IUDs, and injectables needed by the public sector. Other activities included operations research, analyses of data from contraceptive prevalence surveys carried out under the predecessor project, and continued use of media and printed information, education, and communication (IEC) materials from the last project. Costa Rica's strong public sector RH program may not be easily replicable.  Demand is greater in the public, pre-paid CCSS sector and the MOH than in the significantly higher cost private market.  Private subsidized services are essentially limited to a nonprofit hospital that cross-subsidizes services; no major NGO is involved in clinical services, which is a very different situation from most Latin American countries.  The project strengthened this environment of state-supported services, while at the same time supporting successful implementation by CCSS of different administrative models for outpatient services. Over the course of the project, the stigma of an implied imposition of policies by external entities has been overcome; and leaders from all walks of life accept the philosophy and activities of the RH program, including sex education at early ages.  However, it should be noted that women's educational levels, rural residence, and socioeconomic status are still major indicators of differences in fertility, with educational levels the leading variable.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","9/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Family planning services|Public health care|Health care administration|Project sustainability|Reproductive health","Costa Rica","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABM597.pdf","141 KB","008533 - USAID.

"PACR of a grant (6/92-9/95) provided to PROFAMILIA under the Reproductive Health Sector Consolidation Project to implement a contraceptive social marketing program in Costa Rica. PROFAMILIA has effectively and efficiently increased contraceptive availability, thereby facilitating voluntary family planning.  Further, through innovative marketing techniques that bring condoms into the public eye without offending cultural sensitivities, it has offered low-cost, convenient alternatives to public sector family planning services.  By holding a firm share of the market, and keeping prices as low as feasible, PROFAMILIA is carrying out its mission, and is likely to continue in the same manner, as its governing board and management are committed to the program. The grant brought PROFAMILIA to financial self-sufficiency, enabling it to make commercial linkages with contraceptive and health product suppliers, increasing the availability of these products at a lower cost than was previously the case.  PROFAMILIA's market share is estimated at 33% and number of users at 48,000.  Competition from PROFAMILIA has caused the price of some other condom brands to drop, and the average cost per couple-year of protection dropped from $12.75 in 1988 to $5.37 in 1995. PROFAMILIA's contraceptive product line includes a lubricated condom and one with the spermicide Nonoxynol -9, for sale through widely varied and unorthodox points of purchase (single packs are for sale from vending machines).  Low-dose orals, NORPLANT, and the Copper T-380A IUD are all now registered for commercial sale. PROFAMILIA has effectively used the income it generates to increase its product line and ensure the availability of low-cost contraceptives through commercial channels.  PROFAMILIA is also marketing a condom product for gays, a pap exam kit, rubber gloves, infant training cups, and medical instruments.  It dominates the market for latex gloves. Sale of these products allows a cross-subsidy for low-priced condoms. The following lessons were learned.  (1) Hiring an effective manager was the most important factor.  Second in importance was allowing that manager to innovate and break ground in untried terrain.  (2) The level of education in Costa Rica, the inroads of mass communications, and the advent of AIDS/HIV prevention needs propelled the family planning program into a search for additional sources of goods and services, and the contraceptive social marketing program began to fill that niche. (3) The double purpose of providing low-cost contraceptives, and making the program self-sufficient required creativity, flexibility, and a lot of accountability, which may not be the case in most of the countries where USAID works.

"PACR of a project (9/92-9/95) to encourage multilateral cooperation in supporting administration of justice (AOJ) activities and other democracy-building activities in Central America. In a cooperative effort involving USAID/Costa Rica, the Costa Rican Ministry of Justice, and the Latin American Institute for the Prevention of Crime and Treatment of the Offender (ILANUD), more than 30 justice improvement project profiles were developed and presented to regional donors.  Of these, USAID/CR funded four, and many others were funded by other donors and are being implemented throughout Central America. The four USAID subprojects were conceived as pilot activities to improve training, coordination, and planning in Central American justice institutions.  Three were implemented by ILANUD:  (1) a National Commissions subproject supported the creation and strengthening of national justice sector planning and coordination bodies; (2) a program to train local judges and develop training modules and materials for judicial schools; and (3) a program to develop a computerized databank on the administration of justice.  The fourth subproject, implemented by the Costa Rican Judicial School, developed training of trainer courses on regional topics to strengthen existing national judicial schools and training programs. The subprojects expanded and contracted in response to funding availability and level of local USAID Mission interest.  Thus, the National Commissions subproject was reformulated to limit its work to developing new statistical planning systems in Honduras, Costa Rica, and Nicaragua, while the local judges training subproject was limited to Honduras, Nicaragua, and Guatemala.  On the other hand, the Regional Program of Support to National Judicial Schools held local fora in every Central American country, developed training materials, and held three regional training sessions.  The databank subproject developed an Administration of Justice Information System (SIAJ), which has been offered via the Internet to numerous justice sector institutions. Each of the four USAID subprojects left a replicable methodology, numerous didactic materials, and permanent statistical and information systems which will continue to serve the Central American justice sector.  However, given the decreasing U.S. and other donor interest in pursuing a multilateral approach to supporting justice institutions, the success of the subprojects must be measured at the local rather than the regional level. The project was extremely complex and never fully understood by either the donor community or the institutions it was designed to serve. Implementation proved difficult to the hundreds of subprojects developed for the various donors. Consequently, the USAID subprojects were constantly faced with questions concerning the viability of the regional initiative. Nonetheless, ILANUD worked with USAID/CR to make sure that the subprojects provided a useful complement to local Missions' bilateral initiatives.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","9/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Regional development|Administration of law|Pilot projects|Development cooperation|Computer networks|Partnerships|Internet","Central America","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABM599.pdf","137 KB","002290 - USAID.

"Evaluates the information, education, and communication (IEC) component of the Niassa Rural Water and Sanitation Project implemented by Medical Care Development International (MCDI) in Cuamba, Niassa Province, Mozambique. Interim evaluation covers the period 10/93-12/95. The IEC component has improved people's knowledge about potable water, and the eight project-trained extension workers/animators have increased beneficiaries' awareness of the benefits and responsibilities of having pumped water in their communities.  In addition, the project supported the Lichinga offices of the Maputo-based NGO known as Casa Velha, which has been provided funding by the project to create many effective and innovative IEC materials. To address concerns raised during the 12/94 mid-term evaluation, the project enhanced its efforts to (1) develop IEC materials that are based on the findings from knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) surveys and that emphasize the relationship between behavioral change and disease control; and (2) provide continued on-the-job training to animators on using the new materials as well as in monitoring and support functions. However, the potential impact of these corrective measures has been constrained by (1) the fact that little time was available for training the animators, who were responsible for both training beneficiaries and organizing their labor contributions to water point construction; (2) the fact that about a third of the wells constructed under the project were completed only during the last few months of 1995; (3) delays in receiving the basic materials from which IEC materials were produced. General recommendations are as follows.  (1) The component's promising preliminary results should be enhanced by continued testing and improvement of materials.  (2) Training of animators should emphasize their understanding of the IEC materials and their correct use of the materials in educating beneficiaries.  (3) Care must be taken to ensure continued coordination of IEC activities with the technical component of the project.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","656-0217-G-SS-3011-00","","12/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Rural areas|Water supply|Water sanitation|IEC|Health education","Mozambique","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABM604.pdf","5,164 KB","005108 - Medical Care Development International (MCDI)","","008580 - USAID.

"Mid-term evaluation of activities implemented in Russia under a project to improve environmental management in the New Independent States.  The project is being implemented by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  Evaluation covers the period 5/93-9/95. For political and foreign policy reasons, the project was designed hurriedly, resulting in management problems and specifically confusion about the roles of USAID and EPA.  EPA was initially reluctant to accept USAID's leadership role. Internally, both agencies could have organized themselves better, with USAID delegating authority sooner to its field mission and EPA consolidating project tasks in fewer offices under the direction of its Office of International Activities.  Further, EPA should assign a project coordinator to Moscow as early as possible to facilitate communications with USAID and within EPA itself. Despite these problems, the project has initiated a number of worthwhile activities, which have begun to yield positive results, including preparations for air monitoring systems in Volgograd; establishment of a training institute in Ekaterinburg with the help of a U.S. PVO; public awareness activities via a local NGO in Nizhnii Tagil; central government approval of a priority environmental program and budget, also in Nizhnii Tagil; legal research in Volgograd to assist in drafting improved environmental laws and policies; and excellent training programs in the United States and Russia, some funded under this project and some through other USAID funding. Less successful activities include those in the Moscow water district, where delays occurred as budgets were slowly worked out and numerous EPA experts or contractors made several seemingly unproductive visits to Russia.  The diagnostic approach and reportedly non-collaborative style of some activities in Nizhnii Tagil and the Moscow region frustrated Russian counterparts, who felt that they were not given credit for their expertise and were impatient with delays in gaining usable U.S. recommendations and access to U.S. technology.  In focusing on technical issues, subprojects in the Moscow area and Nizhnii Tagil largely ignored economic factors.  In addition, commodities did not always arrive when needed, there has been minimal linking of components of this project internally and with other complementary activities in Russia, and only limited progress has been made developing new private sector opportunities and potential joint ventures between Russian and U.S. enterprises. So far there is limited evidence of sustainability and replicability of EPA subprojects, nor is there a strategy for institution-building. This should be taken into consideration during future funding decisions.","English ed.: PD-ABM-029","Special Evaluation","Documents","AEP-5451-I-24-2049-00","","9/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Environmental management|Development project design|Development project management|Government departments","Russia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABM651.pdf","2,099 KB","003970 - Management Systems International, Inc.

"PACR of a project (8/86-11/94) to conduct tropical root and tuber crop research in Cameroon aimed at developing (1) locally acceptable cocoyam varieties resistant to root rot disease, and (2) technically and economically feasible seedstock multiplication systems for yam, cassava, and cocoyam (ROTREP project).  The University of Maryland Eastern Shore implemented the project with assistance from Alabama A&M University and Florida A&M University. ROTREP is succeeding in fulfilling its objectives. Although a cocoyam variety resistant to root rot disease was not developed by the 11/94 PACD, production of cassava and cocoyams (the main root and tuber crops) increased, in part, because of the release of improved cultivars (at least 15 clones of root and tuber crops were released to growers) and because of recommended cultural techniques.  Standard cultural practices for growing root and tuber crops were transferred to farmers in the form of technical bulletins, mini-kit packages, and field-level demonstrations.  The total value of root and tuber crops increased, estimated at 856% annually for potatoes and 360% for cocoyams.  Adoption of new material generally increased farmers' sales by 31% for cassava and 43% for sweet potatoes. Total consumption has increased by almost 6% for cassava and 37% for sweet potatoes.  The development of feasible seedstock multiplication systems for cassava, cocoyams, and yams is almost complete. In terms of institutional development, the training of Cameroonian researchers will lead to Cameroon's root and tuber research program being managed predominantly by Cameroonians. ROTREP trained a large cadre of researchers (7 at the graduate level, 12 via short-term, third-country training, and more than 100 via in-country training), and developed the J.P. Johnson Biotechnology Laboratory, a center of excellence which can be used to develop new technologies, and roots, tubers, and other crops.  Long-term linkages have been established with many research institutions (e.g., IITA, CIP, as well as the three project universities). The following lessons were learned.  (1) Sustainable development in Cameroon and other African countries will require increased use of profitable and sustainable technologies to help farmers, processors, marketing agents, and policy makers address on- and off-farm constraints and to accelerate transformation. (2) The flow of technology to and within Africa to meet future needs will require an enabling environment in terms of research and policy institutions, financially sustainable funding mechanisms, and human resource capacity.  (3) Successful institutional development is a long-term endeavor which requires a comprehensive approach, high-level commitment by all parties, flexibility, patience, and willingness and ability to adjust to changing conditions.  This project reflected many, but not all of these attributes.  USAID's investment has created a large cadre of trained researchers who have returned to weak institutions in which they are unable to fully realize their potentials.  The project may have not been integrated within the Institution for Agronomic Research (IRA) to the extent desirable.  As a result, many of the management improvements have not been fully institutionalized.  In addition, the decision to cover nearly all of the IRA's operational costs after the Government of Cameroon (GRC) greatly reduced its budgetary contribution was inappropriate; conditionality should have been negotiated with the GRC to ensure long-term institutional reform and financial viability.  The project also failed adequately to address broader institutional issues such as priority setting, downsizing, diversification of funding, and resource accountability.  USAID missed a unique opportunity to use both the project, as well as the National Cereals Research and Extension Project, to achieve these ends.  (4) The project demonstrated the benefit of networking and linkages; ""intelligent borrowing"" helped reduce plant breeding periods and corresponding costs.  (5) Recognizing the important role that both the IRA and the University of Dschang could play in regional development, USAID collaborated closely with the GRC and other donors in creating ""research and educational centers of excellence.""  Unfortunately, the comprehensive approach required for long-range institutional development and sustainability did not take this regional role adequately into account.  The institutional crisis currently facing Cameroon's agricultural sector, including both the IRA and the University of Dschang, unless addressed soon, could have serious implications for neighboring countries.  (6) Donor coordination for the most part focused on subsector issues (agricultural research, environment) and failed to address broader sectoral and macroeconomic issues (although the World Bank has been meeting with other donors to design an agricultural sector structural adjustment program).","Project title: Tropical root and tuber research project (ROTREP)","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural research|Varietal research|Crop yield|Research centers|Institution building|Research organizations|Crop disease control|Disease resistance|Root vegetables|Agricultural education|Cassava|Yams|Root rot|Seed production","Cameroon","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABM672.pdf","47 KB","008524 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (9/90-9/95) to increase promotion of family planning (FP) in the South Pacific by upgrading the institutional capacity of the South Pacific Alliance for Family Health (SPAFH). SPAFH, now a well-recognized regional NGO, has improved its institutional capacity to implement FP activities in Pacific Island countries and has made some progress towards long-term sustainability. It has identified challenges for the future, which include clear definition of its mission and goals. SPAFH has learned the complexity of the region's FP needs and has demonstrated its potential for addressing them.  Having progressively shifted its emphasis from regional to in-country activities, SPAFH has stressed the involvement of community and focus groups in FP and the need to implement FP in a cultural context, develop indigenous capacities, and involve NGOs, country governments, and the private sector in FP programs. The following lessons were learned.  (1) Due to funding constraints, a resident advisor position was not included in the cooperative agreement.  As a result, USAID/Suva was burdened with excessive management demands, and Pathfinder, the project grantee, was unable to provide frequent program management support because of the high cost of traveling to Tonga.  This situation was exacerbated when USAID/Suva closed in 6/94.  (2) The project had to depart from its planned benchmarks as they clearly represented a straitjacket on SPAFH's ability to evolve as an independent NGO and develop its technical capabilities. This need was eloquently captured by the mid-term evaluation, but unfortunately, not adhered to by all involved. In early 1993, strategic planning and a program management framework were introduced to SPAFH, which however was only slowly able to incorporate these concepts.  As a result, these efforts were too little too late.  (3) Although SPAFH has done reasonably well with the resources, mandate, and technical expertise at its disposal, more could have been done if some of the lessons articulated in this PACR had been applied.  Given STAPH's mandate to assist ten countries dispersed over an area several times the size of the United States, the project's funding, particularly funding for country programs, was inadequate.  This is the major reasons that SPAFH's impact at the country level is impossible to measure.  Moreover, it was difficult to rationally allocate funds among ten countries with so many needs, and changing in-country circumstances, such as staff turnover, also affected activities. Nevertheless, SPAFH managed to implement a comparatively large number of activities.  (4) The development of Australia's Project EXCEL -- which includes components funded by USAID's FP Services Expansion and Technical Support (SEATS) and Social Marketing for Change (SOMARC) projects) has been a welcome boost to SPAFH's credibility and potential for long-term survival (although initially EXCEL disrupted project implementation by demands on SPAFH personnel).  The two have proved complementary, for SPAFH concentrates primarily on FP awareness, EXCEL on service provision, social marketing of contraceptives, and KAP surveys. (5) Location of SPAFH in Tonga was a serious mistake.  While this may have been valid at first (the founder and the Board Chairman were Tongan), over time it became apparent that the decision made no sense.  Proposals to relocate to Fiji have been repeatedly and inexplicably turned down by the board of directors.  (6) SPAFH never considered a scheme to charge small management fees to implement FP activities.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","12/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Indigenous private voluntary organizations|Institution building|Family planning promotion programs|Project sustainability","Oceania","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABM680.pdf","1,270 KB","008592 - USAID.

"Evaluates the impact of USAID's African Graduate Fellowship (AFGRAD) project (3/63-9/96), which provides Africans from the public and private sectors with U.S. scholarships in key development fields.  The evaluation is based on field visits and questionnaire responses from 617 of the almost 3,000 AFGRAD scholarship recipients from 45 countries. Despite major resource constraints all over Africa, AFGRAD alumni are making a difference in key public and private institutions -- introducing new techniques and skills, training others, introducing changes and innovations in their jobs, and contributing to the growth and development of their organizations and institutions. Over 90% of alumni have completed their training objectives and more than 80% have resumed their professional careers in Africa.  Training has been largely targeted at the graduate level (masters and doctoral degrees), with smaller numbers of undergraduate and postgraduate awards. Fields of study have varied, but include major concentrations in education, agriculture and animal science, engineering, economics and business administration, and health.  All areas are vital to African capacity building.  The great majority of AFGRAD alumni were sponsored by educational and governmental institutions, with smaller numbers from private business and other nongovernmental entities. Change and development have been the hallmark of AFGRAD alumni.  A majority have made multiple job changes since their training, mostly as a result of promotions, although most continue to work in the field in which they specialized under AFGRAD.  Their upward professional mobility is a major contributing factor to capacity building in their home countries. The majority of alumni continue to contribute to the education sector, particularly higher education.  The number of alumni in the government sector has declined over the years, but the number working in the private and nongovernmental sectors has increased dramatically.  This represents an Africa-wide trend away from public sector employment.  AFGRAD alumni are increasingly carrying out more policy making and management duties. Most alumni felt that AFGRAD had a very positive effect on their career and professional development.  AFGRAD training has been associated with increased self-confidence and self-reliance, a broadened outlook, and more flexibility, as well as improved problem solving skills, better organizational and management skills, and greater team work.  Most alumni received a raise within a year after their return from training, yet many do not feel adequately compensated for their increased qualifications, due largely to a lack of resources in their organizations.   Recognition of AFGRAD training, particularly in the government and education sectors, was a problem in some francophone countries, where U.S. degrees are not accorded the same status as French degrees. AFGRAD alumni include prime ministers, ambassadors, representatives to international organizations, government ministers, university registrars and department heads, teachers, and researchers.  Many alumni hold executive positions in professional and civic organizations, and many have demonstrated leadership as owners or directors of successful private enterprises.  The impact of this ""leader promotion"" function is crucial to the overall success of AFGRAD. Training relevance has been high.  Alumni are actively applying their knowledge and skills on the job.  Skills highlighted as most valuable include research and analytical skills, management and planning skills, and specific technical skills.  However, limited resources prevent the alumni from fully applying their new expertise.  These declines in institutional infrastructure and resources are a major factor in Africa today. AFGRAD's greatest impact on institutional development is found in the education sector.  Alumni have helped to change the way that students are taught throughout Africa, even though they may not be the majority at any single institution.  For example, alumni in different countries have introduced U.S. financial analysis techniques and computer technology in support of structural adjustment programs. AFGRAD alumni contribute to sustainability.  The spread effect from alumni working in the education sector is clearly one of AFGRAD's greatest contributions:  alumni are revising university teaching systems, developing curricula and new courses, and advising and guiding students every day; tens of thousands of students are benefiting. Alumni are also actively engaged in research and publication and maintain active networks in their professional fields through membership in professional associations and community-based organizations.  This contributes to the spread of innovation on the continent.  Many alumni also maintain ties with fellow alumni or with others trained in the United States.  This contact serves to reinforce the knowledge and skills they acquired and promotes dialogue on important research and education issues. The number of women sponsored by AFGRAD has grown significantly over time.  Women constitute 25% of the alumni population for Phase III. While women, who face greater career impediments in Africa than men, reported less satisfaction with their salary levels and career advancement than men, the differences were less than expected given the constraints on women's access to education at lower levels in the education system.  Women's professional growth and promotion into leadership roles is expected to increase over time.

"Evaluates the Action Program for the Environment (APE), aimed at helping Uganda's public and private sectors to more effectively and sustainably manage the natural resource base in selected areas. Mid-term evaluation covers the period 8/91-5/95. Overall, APE has had extremely positive results.  In the policy and institutional development component, the National Environmental Action Plan (NEAP), developed with the participation of a wide base of stakeholders, is finished, and the Environmental Bill has been passed. APE is supporting the transition from NEAP to the National Environment Management Act (NEMA).  Decentralization of environmental management has begun, and the results in Kasese District are extremely encouraging and can serve as a model for other work.  However, there are still many problems to be resolved before elected officials, civil servants, and local communities are genuinely able and committed to collaborative planning and decision making.  APE has provided support to the three agencies currently managing protected areas -- Uganda National Parks (UNP), the Games Department (GD), and the Forest Department (FD), with UNP the main beneficiary. Material support (vehicles, fuel, costs of boundary demarcations, construction, and some operating expenses) has been especially appreciated, as USAID is one of the few donors that provides it. A major need is to ensure the effective merger, as proposed by the Government of Uganda (GOU), of UNP and GD into the Uganda Wildlife Authority (UWA). In the rehabilitation and resource conservation component, none of the U.S. PVOs applying to head the Grants Management Unit (GMU) met USAID criteria, leading USAID to assume the task before turning it over to the institutional contractor in 1993, by which time many funds had been committed and many precedents set for project preferences and selection.  The GMU is doing an excellent job within this framework.  To date, however, no funding has been disbursed to a project actually approved by the GMU, mainly due to USAID's failure, until 2/95, to establish a formal review process.  Additionally, no local NGOs have been funded, due to lack of local currency funding and USAID's stringent registration requirements.  Nonetheless, APE has funded a large number of activities, mainly related to the conservation of protected areas and the development of the areas associated with those protected areas. There are both pros and cons to the fact that grant funding was largely predetermined from the beginning of the project.  The advantage is that USAID was able to channel funds to projects and institutions with proven track records and had a high probability of success.  On the negative side, the approach set precedents for the type of activity that USAID preferred to fund.  Finally, most project activities do not emphasize individual income generation, especially in reference to marketing of farm produce, the value added by simple technologies, or the development of off-farm small enterprise activities.  Projects rely mostly on tourism, revenue sharing, and multiple use for income generation.

"Mid-term evaluation of two private-sector, export-oriented projects in Morocco, both of which began in 7/92 and were evaluated in mid-1995: Accessing International Markets (AIM) and Morocco Agribusiness Promotion (MAP). The two projects have contributed significantly to increasing exports and diversifying markets and products.  MAP has helped to generate $13.5 million in exports and AIM, $25.1 million (of which $12.9 million stem from agreements reached under its predecessor projects); most of these exports are either new products or go to new markets.  Some 3,000 new jobs have been generated, as all of the assisted export commodities are labor-intensive, using a high proportion of unskilled and semiskilled laborers, about 80% of whom are women. MAP's performance has been excellent.  Its lead contractor, Development Alternatives, Inc. (DAI), is providing thoroughly professional, innovative, and responsive implementation.  A number of the planned inputs and outputs are proving unnecessary or unworkable, but fortunately the performance-based structure of DAI's contract (as well as USAID management's flexibility) has allowed MAP to alter its activities in response to promising opportunities.  Areas where performance indicators should be adjusted include use of the Promotion and Investment Fund, assistance to privatization, training, and targets for joint ventures.  Less positively however, the PASA with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to assist the Ministry of Agriculture is well behind schedule, and the Program Support to Agribusiness component led by the University of Minnesota and Hassan II University is only beginning. In the AIM project, which is implemented by the International Executive Service Corps (IESC), the Business Development Services program, which links field personnel with retired executives, provides an effective and cost-effective resource for brokering new export agreements.  The Volunteer Executive program is largely on schedule; most assignments improve the competitiveness of the Moroccan firms that employ mostly women and below-median-income people; however, the short duration of assignments leads to a high percentage of failures' and increased costs.  The Moroccan-U.S. tourism pilot program suffered from both design and implementation flaws and has been largely terminated.  Also, IESC has failed to provide consistent leadership in the important position of project director, leading to problems in reporting and accounting and lost opportunities for coordinating AIM activities.  However, the key professional and technical staff of AIM are impressive in their commitment to their work and their detailed knowledge of and networks with the Moroccan private sector. The two projects cooperate with and complement one another.  MAP takes a broad subsector view, identifying access points for leveraged assistance in the production-marketing chain, and working with regulatory, financial, and producer organizations and research, training, and extension institutions as well as with individual firms. AIM is largely a business-to-business operation, responding to the needs of individual firms. Neither similarity of objectives nor duplication of clients have posed a serious problem.  It has been agreed that only MAP works in the fresh and frozen subsector, and only AIM in the fish sector. Lessons learned are as follows.  (1) MAP has a longer term, more integrated, and dynamic strategy than AIM and thus is overall a better performing project.  (2) AIM and MAP significantly influence income and employment and directly affect women and below-median-income people by focusing on agricultural export products in which Morocco has a comparative advantage. This is done most effectively without screens or set-asides for smaller firms, since the largest impact on employment of poorer people comes from assistance to larger firms.  (3) Agribusiness projects can be seriously affected by environmental factors. Shortages of water and fish affect both projects, yet neither were considered during project design.  Of particular note is a possible ground water level crisis, especially in the Souss valley and the Marrakech plain. (4) Assistance to Moroccan agribusiness has increased the importation of U.S. goods by Morocco.  (5) IESC needs to make an effort to demonstrate the impacts of its Volunteer Executive program, which is after all the backbone of its worldwide program","Delivery order no. 03","Special Evaluation","Documents","LAG-4200-I-00-3058-01|LAG-4200-I-00-3058-00","","10/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Agribusiness|Agricultural markets|Business enterprises|Business support services|Export promotion|Agricultural product marketing","Morocco","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABM449.pdf","5,974 KB","000673 - International Science and Technology Institute, Inc.

"Final evaluation of the Children and War (C&W) Program (1988-95), implemented by Save the Children Federation (SCF) and aimed at documenting, tracing, and reunifying (DTR) unaccompanied, war-affected children in Mozambique. The program's impact was remarkable; C&W registered more than 16,798 unaccompanied children, identified more than 17,804, and reunited with their parents/relatives or places in substitute families more than 9,679 children.  A major factor in C&W's success was its empowerment of local people to carry out DTR in their communities through short-term training courses and the establishment of community networks.  The community-based approach also promoted the negotiation of reunification with both children and families, sometimes involving local authorities, traditional healers, and others, and it ensured awareness of the importance of social and cultural practices (religious and traditional rituals) in the reunification process. The program made a significant effort to establish a follow-up system for reunified children and those placed in substitute families.  C&W staff and members of community networks visited households regularly, offering ""reunification kits"" containing basic products (e.g., rice, sugar, soap), ensuring access to school and supplying basic school materials, organizing recreational activities, and even developing productive income for youngsters (especially former boy soldiers). C&W managed to develop the DTR program with minimal expatriate personnel, who trained and advised nationals.  Its access to airplanes, helicopters, 4x4 vehicles, and modern office equipment proved extremely important, making reunification possible in times of war and in the most remote areas of the country. Working relationships with other institutions involved in DTR were established, and although coordination and information sharing were sometimes minimal, the program was able to implement DTR in RENAMO base camps throughout the country.  The program also created a data base on unaccompanied children in the areas where it worked. The program teaches important lessons about community involvement and the need for follow-up assistance in DTR programs. The community networks, while fundamental to the program, have had their own difficulties and problems.  There was a large member drop-out; some think there should have been some kind of reward for participating. Another issue arose with one community network whose members all belonged to a specific church; many children were compelled to join this church.  In another community, a volunteer collected money and then disappeared.  In sum, the composition of the networks and the particular motivations of the members can sometimes provide guidance to network development activities. Even more attention to follow-up is needed.  It is vital to identify clearly what kind of assistance is needed and what kind C&W can supply; to recognize needs created by the extreme poverty in the country; to establish mechanisms to enable community networks to channel specific types of assistance; and at the same time to take care that follow-up assistance does not perpetuate dependency. Finally, the C&W program teaches the need for (1) improved coordination with the Mozambican government and other agencies; and (2) continued attention to the anthropological and psychological factors related to the reunification and socialization of war-affected children.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","656-0217-G-SS-3016-00","","10/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Child welfare services|War victims|Community participation|Children","Mozambique","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABM747.pdf","1,705 KB","001407 - Save the Children (U.S.)","","008580 - USAID.

"PACR of a project (7/90-9/95) to promote commercially sustainable uses of marine resources in selected Pacific Island countries (PIMAR project).  PIMAR supported six bilateral subprojects -- in the Cook Islands, Kiribati, Fiji, Papua New Guinea (PNG), Tonga, and Tuvalu -- and one regional impact subproject. PIMAR contributed to achievement of the main goal of USAID/South Pacific's Regional Development Strategy Statement (RDSS) and Management Action Plan by increasing economic opportunities from the development of south Pacific marine resources.  Given the wide variety of PIMAR's activities, the many start-up problems faced by the individual subprojects, and the difficulties during the project's last 2 years (budget reductions, and the closure of the USAID/SP Regional Development Office, followed by PIMAR's premature closure), the extent to which PIMAR succeeded is remarkable. PIMAR's innovative mechanisms for delivering development assistance and its new approaches resulted in the establishment of a viable commercial bottomfish fishery in Tuvalu, small-scale tuna longlining fisheries in Tonga and PNG, and research-based marine resources management plans for the Tarawa lagoon in  Kiribati, and for inshore (the Tonga bottomfish management plan) and offshore resources.  PIMAR also strengthened private sector fishing associations -- the Fishing Industry Association in PNG, and Deepsea Fishermen Association in Fiji -- and ensured the involvement of the private sector in the fishing industries. Despite these achievements, sustainability is dubious.  Nearly all the PIMAR subprojects needed sustained funding and TA, at least for a couple of years after the PACD, to enable them to develop adequate infrastructure and logistic support, and to establish training institutions and fishing organizations.  Elimination of the regional subproject increased the sustainability problem since information about project activities was not widely distributed.  Another barrier to sustainability was the elimination of the planned evaluations, which could have helped in identifying appropriate activities to promote sustainability. The following lessons were learned.  (1) As PIMAR was one of the first projects designed to meet the goals of the new RDSS and Management Action Plan, there should have been more time allotted for project design and discussion of the draft project paper.  (2) More time should have been allowed for start-up.  It took a year or more for most of the subprojects to get started, and for TA teams to reach to subproject sites.  (3) Avoid closing subprojects prematurely, at the expense of the technical aspects, and allow more time for proper closeouts.  For a project like this, an authorization of 6-7 seven years and an operational life of 5 years would seem reasonable.  (4) Because the regional subproject was terminated prematurely, USAID missed the opportunity to introduce the technologies that had been successfully tested and proven under the subprojects.  As a result, the project's results will probably not be replicated in the region.  (5) The elimination of the planned evaluations illustrates the error of allowing administrative requirements (e.g., the decision to close the Mission) to be satisfied at the expense of achieving a project's objectives.  (6) PIMAR's design required host countries to obtain their own vessels, resulting in delays; time, money, and frustration would have been saved had PIMAR provided funds for contractors to charter vessels and hire commercial crews.  (7) Since a contractor's Chief of Party often cannot keep government agencies fully informed as to progress and problems, a counterpart co-manager should be designated to fulfill this function.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","879-0020-S-00-2070-00","","9/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Marine resources|Regional development|Marine fisheries|Private sector|Fishing industry","Oceania|Cook Islands|Kiribati|Fiji|Papua New Guinea|Tonga|Tuvalu","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABM791.pdf","1,740 KB","009389 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to help decentralize the delivery of maternal health/child survival (MH/CS) services in Nicaragua. Mid-term evaluation covers the period 3/93-12/95. Project performance has been mixed, with some components achieving all expected outcomes, while others have been delayed or had problems with the quality of products developed.  In addition, project management has had some serious difficulties -- difficulties which have at times overshadowed real progress. In the accelerated start component, designed to provide analytical underpinning for the project, almost all studies have been completed and found acceptable.  These include: a survey of ongoing and proposed donor activities; a cost containment and cost recovery assessment report; a preliminary analysis of the financial administration system for Ministry of Health (MINSA) services; an assessment of the MINSA's compliance with the financial conditions of its P.L. 480 Title III Agreement; an assessment of commodity needs; a study of tracking systems for commodities; and a financial management systems report.  However, the human resources assessment has not been completed, and USAID/N has decided that further revisions would not be productive. The largest amount of disagreement on project emphasis has been in the MH/CS component.  Major accomplishments in this component include: (1) community surveys in the four (now five) targeted Local Integrated Health Care Systems (SILAISs) to determine the nature and extent of health problems; (2) development of a permanent registry for children to facilitate delivery of services in the integrated model; (3) a survey of 57 oral rehydration units in the SILAISs to assess location as well as supplies and equipment available; and (4) a study of current acute respiratory infection (ARI) treatments, which led to changes in the clinics involved in the study.  Other achievements have included surveys of care quality for pregnant women, an analysis of maternal mortality data, a workshop on family planning (FP), growth chart revisions, a nutrition study in Boaco to identify age where nutritional problems start, the introduction of DepoProvera in Jinotega, training in FP counseling in all the SILAISs, a review of MINSA's model for integrating MH/CS services in the SILAISs, and an analysis of the health problems in Ciudad Sandino.  Despite these achievements, controversy remains over the direction of the component and the strategic role of immunizations. Though immunization is generally accepted as an entry point to MH/CS care, questions remain regarding how much immunization should be going on and who (the project or the lead PAHO agency) should be doing it. Further, workplans lack specificity needed to focus interventions in each SILAIS clearly on MH/CS priorities.   restructuring the component to advance work in ARI, diarrheal diseases, and maternal health seems indicated. In the training and IEC (information, education, and communication) subcomponent, significant progress has been made in training key groups, although the lack of a human resource assessment impedes the development of a targeted training plan. The out-of-country training strategy appears to follow a demand driven approach tied to needs of the SILAISs. Care should be taken to ensure that requests continue to stay close to project priorities.  Also, since IEC itself has not yet begun, USAID and MINSA should re-assess its utility for this project given that major World Bank funding is being provided for IEC. Performance on the commodities and logistics subcomponent has been of high quality.  Stockouts are a problem, though less so in project-supported SILAISs.  There is a high rate of FP product stockouts, and the high price of U.S.-sourced commodities is a concern. Also, a survey of warehouse conditions may be needed. The alternative sources of finance component has made limited progress; only two of four planned studies completed, one of which was submitted late and in draft form. Since financing MH/CS services is apparently a high government priority, all planned studies should be completed as soon as reasonably possible.  Should project resources be limited, financing from other donors should be found. Progress towards the objectives of the management, finance, and decentralization component has been systematic and sustained.  The products delivered meet MINSA's needs. As for project management by Management Sciences for Health (MSH), some deficiencies may be due to the assignment of too many tasks to the Chief of Party.  Reporting for the MH/CS component could be improved, and in some cases, notably immunization policy and the acceptability of key studies and certain workplans, communications can be dramatically improved. Also, there is need for increased donor coordination.","Delivery order no. 27|Companion Evaluation Summary: PD-ABN-155","Special Evaluation","Documents","AEP-0085-I-00-3001-00","","12/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Health care administration|Decentralization|Public health care|Maternal child health care|Child survival activities","Nicaragua","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABM837.pdf","165 KB","003970 - Management Systems International, Inc.

"Evaluates program to promote non-traditional agricultural exports (NTAEs) in El Salvador.  The program comprises four projects implemented by three organizations using widely different approaches:  (1) Agribusiness Development (5190327), implemented by DIVAGRO, the agricultural diversification unit of the Salvadoran Foundation for Economic and Social Development (FUSADES); (2) Rural Enterprise Development II (5190382), implemented by Technoserve; (3) NTAE Production and Marketing (5190392), implemented by the Cooperative League of the United States (CLUSA); and (4) a subcomponent of the National Reconstruction Project Support for Transition to Peace in El Salvador (5190394), implemented by CLUSA and the Asociacion de Productores y Empresarios Salvadorenos (PROESA).  The evaluation serves as the final evaluation for the DIVAGRO (1987-6/95) and Technoserve (1990-4/95) projects, and as a mid-term for the two CLUSA projects (begun 6/91 and 5/94) respectively.  The individual evaluations are attached. Overall conclusions are as follows.  (1) CLUSA's highly focused approach of providing intensive support to NTAE production and export had the greatest impact on the value and volume of product exported, employment generated, and benefit to the rural community.  (2) DIVAGRO's approach was to provide a combination of credit, production technology transfer, and market assistance to private investors; there was limited follow-up activity and minimal ""hand holding.""  The project, designed to encourage agricultural investment, was carried out in a difficult investment climate, which, coupled with mediocre implementation performance, resulted in considerably less impact than was expected. (3) Technoserve's approach focused on strengthening cooperatives and helping them become better-managed businesses, not on NTAEs; its impact on NTA production and exports was therefore rather limited. Furthermore, it was not possible to measure impact, given Technoserve's method of tracking progress. (4) The private investment projects assisted by DIVAGRO are more sustainable than the NTAE export programs promoted with cooperatives and producer associations by CLUSA and Technoserve; 36 of the 50 DIVAGRO-assisted investment projects have survived and are considered sustainable. (5) Several CLUSA-assisted export programs are sustainable because supporting institutions are in place and marketing linkages have been created.  The sustainable programs include:  watermelons, honeydew melons, organic exports, sesame exports, and vegetable production for local processing and later export.  An estimated six NTAE cooperatives could continue exporting fresh NTAE products without outside support. (6) Further growth of NTAEs is not sustainable because it requires that mechanisms be in place to help new producers and exporters, and promote innovative development of new products and new markets.  (7) The institutional development of cooperatives assisted by CLUSA and Technoserve has been severely affected by the frequent changes in cooperative boards of directors and managers.  Unless this situation changes, CLUSA's work will never end.  (8) CLUSA's efforts have opened competition in NTAEs, which has brought both stability and ethical business arrangements to the NTAE arena and effectively eliminated the earlier situation where local exporters manipulated both growers and foreign importers.  (9) The three implementing organizations collaborated very little with each other, primarily due to differences in ideology, personality, and ""turf.""  Opportunities to leverage individual efforts for a greater overall impact were lost. USAID should continue to support NTAE development in El Salvador. it continues to be a valid developmental strategy and merits ongoing support.  The evaluation team strongly disagrees with the blanket, sweeping indictment expressed in the final evaluation of the FIDEX portfolio, which maintained that El Salvador is unsuited to be a producer and exporter of NTA products.  USAID should try to increase its impact on NTAEs, preferably by using producers/exporters as a nucleus from which to promote outgrower arrangements with small/medium farmers and cooperatives. The following lessons were learned.  (1) There is no substitute for having the right project in the right place at the right time with the right implementor.  If the Agribusiness Development Project were launched in today's improved environment, even with the same implementor, the impact would likely be much greater.  (2) Project goals, objectives, performance indicators, and performance measurement should be consistent.  For example, the performance measures established for Rural Enterprise Development II were inadequate to measure progress toward the goals of incremental employment, income, and production.  (3) When an adverse operating environment cannot be changed, it is necessary to change the implementation strategy. DIVAGRO would have achieved greater impact had it used a different strategy for investment promotion.  (4) The creation of viable cooperative businesses in El Salvador requires cultural changes and therefore education and not merely training.","Delivery order no. 12|Attachments: XD-ABM-865-A, XD-ABM-865-B, XD-ABM-865-C, XD-ABM-865-D","Special Evaluation","Documents","LAG-4200-I-00-3059-00","","11/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Agribusiness|Business enterprises|Rural development|Nontraditional agricultural exports|Agricultural production|Agricultural product marketing|Private voluntary organizations|Cooperative development organizations|Indigenous private voluntary organizations|Agricultural cooperatives","El Salvador","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABM865.pdf","7,964 KB","006900 - Agricultural Development Consultants, Inc.","","008540 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of a project (6/90-4/95) to develop self-managed rural enterprises and assist institutions serving these enterprises. During the final year, the purpose was expanded to include the promotion of non-traditional agricultural export products (NTAEs).  The project was implemented by Technoserve. Technoserve achieved or exceeded the performance targets established in the Cooperative Agreement.  However, in view of the method used by Technoserve to measure its performance, it is unclear how many new benefits were generated. The evaluators attempted to analyze the impact of Technoserve's efforts by tracking several indicators: sugar and coffee productivity, cooperative profits, cooperative net worth, cooperatives' managerial capacity, and employment for men and women. Results were inconclusive. Technoserve's impact on the production and export of non-traditional crops was small, but the requirement was not introduced until the fifth year of the project and, furthermore, did not specify either objectives or performance indicators. Technoserve helped its clients to achieve a degree of organizational maturity, which is an important element of sustainability.  Primary benefits have resulted from installation of management information, control, and planning systems, including basic accounting and budgetary control procedures. These basic management development efforts have paid off over the long term.  For example, many of CLUSA's successful cooperatives currently producing and exporting non-traditional crops have been assisted by Technoserve. The problem of frequent changes in cooperative leadership was a major obstacle to successful completion of Technoserve's program. Technoserve's investments in time and energy for institutional strengthening of the cooperatives were often lost with the arrival of new cooperative management. Technoserve has had to dedicate too many of its resources to overcome this problem. The following lessons were learned.  (1) A project's goals, strategy, performance measures, and indicators should be consistent.  Technoserve stated that its goals were to increase rural employment, income, and production through working with self-managed enterprises.  Results cannot be measured because performance measures were designed to track process, not progress.  (2) The problem with working toward a standard set of broad goals is that there may be occasions in which these goals and the strategy for achieving them become inconsistent. Technoserve's strategy for institutional development of client cooperatives was to help improve management systems and to control costs.  Given this strategy, employment could be expected to decline, at least in the near term.  (3) When an environment that cannot be changed adversely affects progress, it may become necessary to change the strategy for project implementation. This was particularly applicable to the problem of rotating cooperative leadership.  The evaluation team heard repeatedly that frequent turnover of cooperative decision makers meant that the cooperatives either could not graduate, or otherwise would drop recommended policies once the board of directors changed. Technoserve could have made stable management a pre-condition for providing services.  Possible solutions might have been to insist, as part of the agreement with a cooperative, on their providing stable management for a fixed period of time, or to nominate a permanent steering committee to manage crop production.

"Final evaluation of USAID's assistance to the Salvadoran Foundation for Economic and Social Development (FUSADES) under projects 5190287, -0327, and -0336 (1984-94). USAID's assistance to FUSADES has become controversial in some circles due to its unprecedented massive scale (totaling about $115 million) as well as the highly political, and not merely economic, nature of FUSADES's interventions during a period of violent civil war. Overall, the evidence indicates that FUSADES played an important and possibly crucial role in sustaining and strengthening democratic institutions during the civil war. There is evidence that El Salvador's emergence with a booming economy (5.1% GNP growth in 1994, with a forecast of 5.5% in 1995 with 10% inflation) and a laudable democratic process following the country's transition to peace and democracy was to a large extent due to FUSADES.  It is also likely that El Salvador's economic growth will continue, though at a more modest rate. Politically, FUSADES strengthened El Salvador's two-party system at a time when many questioned whether a peaceful transition of leadership was possible.  It was FUSADES, for example, that developed Alfredo Cristiani's economic platform when he ran for president, and FUSADES whose top economists went over en masse to the government when he was elected.  These political aspects were in fact the raison d'etre for USAID assistance to El Salvador, and the fact that they were almost totally ignored by the project documents shows the difficulty of evaluating FUSADES solely on the basis of the logical framework. With USAID's assistance, FUSADES grew rapidly from its beginning in 1983 as a small economic policy think tank, in the process incorporating USAID's ideas.  Critics have suggested that FUSADES was USAID's Christmas tree, where disparate agendas were hung conveniently like ornaments.  Yet the length of El Salvador's national crisis (1979-93), which is difficult for many to remember since the country's dramatic political and economic turnaround, along with U.S. determination that the country not become ""another Nicaragua,"" indicates that USAID was justified in centralizing the absorption of U.S. foreign aid in FUSADES, particularly since El Salvador did not have a tradition of NGOs and PVOs capable of administering assistance to constituents.  Perhaps peace and stability might have been attained more efficiently and at less cost, but at any rate it has been achieved.  FUSADES, and to some degree all its myriad sub-units (FIDEX, FORTAS, PRIDEX, DEES), made an essential, undeniable contribution to peace and support of El Salvador's war-time economy. Now, however, with peace, a booming economy, a return to democracy, and USAID's subsequent withdrawal of funding, criticism of FUSADES has increased.  While much of this criticism is justified, there were also dramatic accomplishments in a less than ideal environment.  For example, PRIDEX created more than 29,000 jobs; generated approximately $185 million in hard currency from exports; and attracted and helped to implement $51 million in direct investment.  The FIDEX project for making credit available to the industrial export sector shows higher payback than either similar USAID projects or private commercial banks in El Salvador. Further, in order to attract high quality exporters (in a situation in which El Salvador was competing against Costa Rica, Guatemala, etc.), factory start-ups required 5-10 year financing -- something available only through FIDEX, not commercial banks. FORTAS had a very positive impact on the development of NGO/PVO and governmental infrastructure necessary to sustain private sector development; it also played an important role in strengthening export and business associations and rural community development organizations.  The public sector component of USAID's assistance produced the 1986 Export Expansion Act, the 1988 Foreign Investment Act, the 1990 Reactivation Export Act, and transitioned the San Bartolo Free Zone into a thriving export oriented industrial zone.  Also, FUSADES' management largely functioned as USAID originally intended, enduring USAID audits and evaluations and receiving only mild correction, though these evaluations were perhaps too soft. Overall, however, FUSADES exhibited a very powerful achievement that likely had a profound impact on El Salvador's successful transition into peace, the strengthening of democratic institutions, and the building of a strong post-war recovery.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","519-0287-C-00-5023-00","","7/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Economic development|Political development|War recovery|Civil war|Private sector|Indigenous private voluntary organizations|Institution building|Democratization|Economic impact|Political aspects|Post conflict societies","El Salvador","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABM867.pdf","11,279 KB","007414 - Management Business Associates","","008540 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to prevent and control HIV/AIDS and sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) in Jamaica.  Mid-term evaluation covers the period 1988-11/95. With less than 10 months to go, this project has reached and, in some cases, exceeded targets.  Despite problems, this is a good project which deserves continued support. While the behavior change and communication (BCC) component has made important progress using existing methods, new strategies and approaches are needed in order to move beyond the current plateau stage.  Target groups have received sufficient information, which must now be translated into lasting behavioral change; this can be achieved through dialogue with target groups and integrating other social programs.  The multiplicity of BCC sub-agreements -- perhaps due to the multitude of indicators and the need to achieve the predetermined objectives by target dates -- has led to a fragmented approach that can easily be corrected. It should be noted that the National BCC strategy, as well as AIDSCAP sub-agreements, promotes three messages: (1) increase condom use; (2) abstinence, and delay the onset of sexual relationships; and (3) one faithful uninfected partner.  However, the BCC should have selected target groups on the basis of sociocultural and economic boundaries rather than along purely demographic variables.  Also, the project strategy seems to leave out young males, who are the main sexual decision makers. The STD, contact investigator (CI), and sentinel surveillance activities have been well conducted.  While the STD project in the public sector has reached its objectives, further studies and surveys are needed to quantify these achievements. It will also be necessary to consolidate the current level of accomplishments and refine some activities so that the next project cycle can achieve full institutional integration and capacity building of all STD-related activities and surveillance of STD HIV/AIDS.  When the system is fully operational, it could be gradually decentralized (to some extent a pilot approach has begun in the Northwestern Region). Since 1988, HOPE Enterprises, Ltd. has conducted numerous social research projects with various international organizations and has provided invaluable and timely support to USAID-funded STD HIV/AIDS prevention and control activities in the form of surveys, impact studies, evaluations of project activities, etc.  In view of these achievements, support to HOPE should continue, though HOPE should also develop the in-house capacity possessed by the Expanded Program of Immunization (EPI) Unit in conducting similar work.  However, HOPE should always maintain an advisory capacity to the EPI Unit and the National AIDS Control Program. A weak point of the project is the overall level of institutional integration and capacity-building of the various project activities, in large part due to the design of the various sub-agreements.  Some of the management problems could easily be corrected (in ways suggested in the present report). The private and public sectors did equally well managing the various sub-agreements of the project.  This diversification should be continued, provided the level of activity output can be sustained.

"Final evaluation of a project (1987-12/95) to strengthen the capacity of the Honduran Council for Private Enterprise (COHEP) and its members to contribute to economic policy analysis and implementation. COHEP has had a remarkable impact on economic policy in Honduras and functioned effectively as an umbrella private sector association.  It has developed a capacity to conduct quality analyses; influenced the free market-based economic policies now in effect and was virtually responsible for designing the national economic recovery program; and helped put into place economic policy mixes, which resulted in increased investment and competitiveness, though not reduced unemployment. COHEP's management is effective and responsive to private sector needs.  COHEP has generally done a good job in recruiting staff with sufficient academic preparation and experience; its data bank is complete and provides reliable statistics. USAID interventions contributed to the expansion of a viable institution; of particular importance was the establishment of an endowment.  While alternative assistance strategies could have been used, the one selected by the Mission produced solid results -- the ultimate test.  Post-project sustainability is feasible, but limited.  A priority need is to formulate a strategic plan, including a financial strategy, to guide activities over the next 5 years.  Much will also depend on the election of a Chairman of the Board who can galvanize stronger private sector support.  COHEP also needs to maintain the identity and credibility it has earned as a policy analysis organization (hiring of one or two key economic policy experts to complement its staff is recommended), while continuing to promote the interests of the private sector; tension has existed between these two roles which should be complementary.   COHEP should also ban the airing of internal disputes, which has tarnished its image. COHEP's strengths as a representational organization are that it is the only game in town, it has built credibility, and it is taken seriously by the Government.  Its weaknesses are those of Honduras itself:  constant rivalry between Tegucigalpa and San Pedro, as well as ""presidencialismo"".  It is also not fully financially independent, at least to the point where it can operate at capacity. The following lessons were learned.  (1) USAID's low profile coupled with effective TA helped to insure COHEP's credibility as a Honduran organization, not an appendage of USAID.  (2) Boards of directors play a key role in organizations like COHEP.  Boards, especially chairpersons, need to learn not to micromanage, yet maintain a forceful but not controversial presence and provide positive leadership.  A divisive board can cripple an organization.  (3) Good staff (along with effective boards) -- are the essence of an organization.  Institutional development efforts should focus on the human resource component. It is important to try to maintain competitive salary structures. (4) Maximum utility of USAID resources could be achieved through expanded use of endowments, which provide more stability than annual funding.  COHEP's endowment will permit it to function indefinitely.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","12/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Private sector|Business associations|Institution building|Economic policy|Policy analysis|Endowments|Personnel development|Project sustainability","Honduras","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABM949.pdf","1,058 KB","000354 - Carana Corp.|000857 - Honduran Council for Private Enterprises","","008555 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of a project (2/86-9/95) to support the development of microenterprises in the Eastern Caribbean by supporting National Development Foundations (NDFs) and their microenterprise activities, coordinating TA to small and medium-scale enterprises (SMEs), and funding a regional coordinating unit -- originally the Caribbean Association of Industry and Commerce, but as of 2/92, the East Caribbean Organization of Development Foundations (ECODEF). Project assistance to ECODEF and the NDFs has positively affected enterprise development in the Eastern Caribbean, particularly microenterprise development.  The NDFs' major success was in delivering credit, TA, and training to microenterprises.  Entrepreneurs in the service sector benefited the most.  Although the project's impact was positive, it is impossible to quantify its effects on employment, income, productivity, or economic growth at the macroeconomic level due to lack of baseline data and of country-by-country comparative data. The project's demonstration effect is its most notable success indicator.  The NDFs have proven that SME and microenterprise financing is profitable and no less risky than are conventional bank loans to larger businesses.  Commercial banks, noticeably risk-averse prior to the project, are now actively encouraging small businesses to take out loans. The project was one of RDO/C's better-designed projects, partly because of the high degree of involvement and ownership by NDFs, and the project succeeded in upgrading the operational capacity of the NDFs; 4 of the 8 NDFs now have the organizational capabilities needed to facilitate their institutional and financial sustainability. ECODEF performed creditably in delivering microenterprise resources and institutional support to the NDFs, but was less successful in its efforts to strengthen the four weaker NDFs and facilitate SMEs as compared to micro enterprise development.  The agreement with ECODEF included a number of performance requirements for NDF access to project funds. However, even though the NDFs own ECODEF, they failed to restrict its authority over the use of project funds, a situation which led to conflicts between the NDFs and ECODEF's Secretariat. Neither ECODEF nor the NDFs were financially sustainable by the PACD. The emphasis on sustainability came too late in the project cycle and the NDFs' ""grant culture"" had become a major inhibitor to more commercially oriented strategies for survival. The following lessons were learned.  (1) Project ""ownership "" by implementing agencies is one of the most important prerequisites for successful project design and implementation.  (2) The pursuit of organizational and institutional sustainability often changes the shape and focus of development programs to the point where project/program objectives are in direct conflict with the very survival of the agencies selected to implement those programs.  (3) Grant-funded programs inadvertently create an executive management culture of donor dependency which can become so ingrained that it eventually emerges as a major impediment to the commercially oriented initiatives needed to ensure survival after grant funding expires.  (4) Changing the strategic thinking of beneficiary organizations is probably the most critical issue that microenterprise (grant) projects should address to ensure achievement of sustainability objectives.  (5) It is far more important to monitor and assess the extent to which project activities have led to or influenced permanent changes in private sector initiatives of microenterprise activities, since universal adoption of new concepts -- at the country level -- is probably the most important indicator of sustainable project success.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","9/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Regional development|Private enterprises|Small scale enterprises|Medium scale enterprises|Microenterprises|Business support services","Eastern Caribbean","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABM966.pdf","1,503 KB","005886 - Datex, Inc.","","001757 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to increase the participation of Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) in USAID programs by familiarizing them with USAID overseas Missions and project development processes. The project was implemented by the National Association for Equal Opportunity in Higher Education (NAFEO).  Ex-post evaluation covers the period 9/88-5/94. NAFEO accomplished its basic purpose: the constant exposure, promotion, and marketing of HBCUs' capabilities resulted in increased participation of HBCUs in USAID TA contracts and subcontracts, research grants, and faculty linkage agreements and exchange programs.  The project's five major activities (information processes, overseas travel, fellowships, special tasks, and agreement management by NAFEO) were a good choice of interrelated, mutually dependent actions, which proved effective in accomplishing the project purpose.  One of the most effective activities was direct contact between HBCUs and USAID Missions, both overseas and via campus visits by Mission officials.  In sum, USAID's use of an intermediary institution to provide a single point of contact, a conduit for the flow of information, marketing of HBCU capabilities, management and coordination of workshops and conferences, etc., was an effective and efficient way for USAID to address the mandates of the Gray Amendment and Executive Orders. The project was not without shortcomings.  The cooperative agreement with NAFEO did not establish any baseline data, or  quantitative or qualitative measures that would have provided a more precise basis for NAFEO and USAID to assess progress.  In addition, the primary beneficiaries of the project, the HBCUs, in many cases did not (or chose not to) understand that it was their responsibility (not NAFEO's) to actively pursue and follow-up on the opportunities provided through project activities.  Moreover, there are significant differences among the HBCUs as to their desire and commitment to participate in international development programs and their institutional structures and experience in international activities.  Some are committed and experienced in international work, but many others have neither added the international dimension to their curricula nor made efforts to pursue contracts or grants to move into the international assistance arena. Some HBCUs felt the program did not benefit smaller schools and that overseas travel did not include enough schools and included too many high officials of HBCUs and NAFEO. However, now that the services are no longer being provided, many HBCUs miss the advocacy role of NAFEO and the NAFEO network. Also, some HBCUs feel that the focus on HBCUs brought about through the project seems to have waned since the project ended; the availability of a responsive single point of contact is missed. The evaluation recommends that the activities implemented in this cooperative agreement be continued -- expanded to include other minority institutions -- with explicit emphasis on increasing the number of institutions actively involved in USAID programs, providing much more TA to individual institutions, and expanding the geographic areas covered.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","3/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Disadvantaged groups|Racial groups|Minority groups|Universities and colleges|Government policy|Contractors|Grants","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABM971.pdf","3,535 KB","000436 - Development Associates, Inc.","","008230 - USAID.

"Evaluates the impact of activities in the housing/urban development, environment, energy, and privatization sectors on local governments in Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia.  Interim evaluation covers the period through 9/95. Four categories of TA appear to be the most needed by local governments as they emerge from a centralized, Communist-dominated environment: financial management; personnel/human resources management; intergovernmental relations; and service delivery. (1) Financial management. The pressing fiscal problems of most Central and Eastern European municipalities requires that high priority be given to financial management, and particularly to budgeting and resource mobilization.  Systems such as accounting and auditing will take more time to develop, and more sophisticated techniques, such as performance measurement and productivity improvement, will take even longer -- although some steps, such as privatization of selected municipal services, can proceed more rapidly. (2) Personnel development.  While the need to upgrade the technical capabilities of municipal managers and workers is of great importance, none of the assistance activities examined focused directly or principally on personnel development.  Still, some important human resources strengthening activities were conducted, including support for a Polish training organization. (3) Intergovernmental relations.  In Central and Eastern Europe, local government is a relatively new and weak participant in the intergovernmental structure.  The centralizing tendencies of 40 years of communism only further emphasized the previous lack of a home rule tradition in most countries.  For these countries, USAID has (correctly, in the view of this evaluation team) seen strengthening local government as a major means of strengthening democracy.  However, no matter how strong local government can be made, it is likely to remain dependent for much of its resources and authority on central and/or regional governments.  The fact that the central governments in Eastern Europe have very restrained enthusiasm for strengthening municipal governments (and countries have declared their direct opposition to enhanced home rule) also makes USAID's task a difficult one. (4) Service Delivery Improvement.  Many USAID assistance efforts have focused on improving the quality and responsiveness of local services. In the view of the evaluation team, an important aspect of this assistance is whether it seems likely to have spin-off effects on other local government functions or other municipalities. The key recommendation is that USAID give highest priority to fiscal management; personnel management; and intergovernmental relations. Improving service delivery is also important, but it is difficult to ensure transferability across cities and among countries.

"Evaluates a program of the Christian Children's Fund (CCF) to establish a mobile war trauma team (MWTT) to meet the psychosocial needs of war-traumatized children in Angola.  CCF has been implementing the project with funding from Swedish Development Cooperation since 1994; the present evaluation was conducted in 10/95, a month after the inception of USAID support. The MWTT consists of four Angolans, two of whom formerly worked at the Ministry of Rehabilitation and Social Reintegration (MINARS).  In its first year, the MWTT trained 574 adults with responsibility for caring for children, 51% men and 49% women, including community leaders in camps for the dislocated; teachers and social workers; staff of children's homes, child-related NGOs, and street children programs; and trainees working for the government.  The program reached 14,950 children, including 4,372 dislocated children, 2,110 separated children or street children, 7,517 school children, and 951 children of preschool age. The training curriculum is an imaginative synthesis of traditional knowledge and state-of-the-art scientific knowledge about child development, trauma, and healing and training methods and is worthy of application in other African contexts.  The MWTT also conducted 82 follow-up and TA visits and 21 evaluation meetings with trainees.  In a random sample survey, 98% of trainees reported that their project-acquired skills, awareness, and sensitivities had allowed them to identify children with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD); 91% said they were able to improve behavior among children with PTSD; and 96% reported being able to have a better relationship with the children. Additionally, 80% said they were better able to satisfy the psychological and emotional needs of traumatized children and 78% said they believed they could put their ideas into practice. On the basis of their training, trainees organized dances, drawing sessions, storytelling, drama and role playing, sports, and games, and established schools or pre-schools.  The sample of trainees reported the following improvements in the children:  improved child-child and child-adult relationships; decreased sleeping problems; diminished isolation behavior; progress in psychomotor development among younger children; greater participation among children in institutions; diminished violence between children; manifestations of greater certainty and trust in the future; and decreased bed-wetting. The all-pervasive constraints to implementation are the conditions of extreme poverty and the beneficiaries' lack of resources in both their personal and professional lives.  In addition, a serious problem arose regarding the selection of training sites and trainees, with MINARS initially emphasizing children's homes and sites for street children and MWTT eventually adopting a community-based approach where traditional, sustainable methods could be applied. The MWTT has developed a solid community-based, participatory approach based on the cultural and socioeconomic realities of Angola. CCF is a leader in developing such an approach in a country where such initiatives are relatively new. To the extent that it can continue in this direction, awareness of the needs of children, as well as healthy activities for them, will become rooted in local communities.  To implement its program and institutionalize its approach (and have an impact on policy) at the national level, the MWTT has made linkages with a number of relevant organizations, public and private, national and international. Lessons learned are as follows.  (1) A program such as this cannot have an impact apart from efforts to meet children's basic biological and safety needs and to raise social awareness of their needs and rights.  (2) In addressing children's war traumas, it is essential to respect traditional culture and to integrate local knowledge with Western approaches. (3) Key to the success of the MWTT was that it consisted of Angolans who knew the language and culture and who respected and were willing to learn traditional ways from the people whom they trained.  (4) The MWTT should control the selection of training sites as much as possible.  More attention should be given to both site selection and to choosing people who will utilize the training provided.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","HRN-6004-C-00-5004-00","","10/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Child welfare services|Child care|Psychological needs|War victims","Angola","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABN079.pdf","131 KB","003366 - TvT Associates","","008291 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of a grant to the Vietnam Veterans of America Foundation (VVAF) to operate a prosthetics clinic in Cambodia and to train and employ Cambodians in wheelchair making. The evaluation covers the period 9/92/9/95 against a 6/96 PACD. The project contributed to USAID/Cambodia's program strategy of providing responsive and tangible assistance during a period of extreme social and economic crisis.  VVAF has had a notable and positive impact on the disabled in Cambodia and is a respected provider of prosthetics/orthotics (P&O) and wheelchair services.  Its technical work has been of the highest standard. VVAF anticipates that by 10/96 it will have provided more than 4,000 prostheses, 1,000 orthoses, and 2,000 wheelchairs.  In addition, it has established major training programs in the production of the Jaipur foot, physical therapy, orthotics, and wheelchair production; financed one expatriate instructor at the National School for P&O and four Khmer trainees; took the courageous step of changing from Jaipur to polypropylene technology; and initiated improvements in prosthetic foot design. Finally, VVAF constructed a facility at Kien Khleang that will outlive it own presence in Cambodia, and provided services in one of the country's remotest and neediest provinces. On the negative side, VVAF has failed to create an indigenous PVO to take over its work in Cambodia, and its overall management of the grant has been poor, leading to inefficient and ineffective use of USAID resources.  It is particularly difficult to understand how, knowing by May 1995 that USAID grant funding would virtually run out by the end of July, no measures were undertaken to conserve funding and plan for project closeout. Despite these problems, VVAF now has a solid core of management and technical personnel in Cambodia and Washington and, with the implementation of the evaluation's recommendations, is capable of managing efficiently and effectively a future USAID grant.  The uncomfortable working relationship between USAID and VVAF which peaked in early 1995 appears to be on the mend, due largely to the efforts of VVAF's new program director. A project extension is recommended, if there is a significantly higher degree of USAID oversight and if VVAF: drops certain components (e.g., outreach, rehabilitation, and therapy); refocuses on a set of core activities (=provision of 100 prosthetics and 25 orthotics fittings per month); and makes management changes, particularly the closing of the Phnom Penh office and staff cuts (both expatriate and Cambodian). These will obviously cause severe short-term dislocations, but they should also provide the basis for maintaining VVAF operations at a level that can be sustained over the long-term.  If the changes are not made, the project will have to be shut down. The following are lessons learned.  (1) It is unrealistic to think that financial sustainability can be achieved by a safety-net service in a post-crisis situation. Since USAID will soon engage in similar activities in Bosnia and Angola, it should realize that sustainability will not be attained in these countries any more than it has been in Cambodia (or previously in Mozambique) unless host governments take over the funding and delivery of prosthetics services and rehabilitation programs in general.  In an era of shrinking foreign aid budgets, USAID should be asking whether it wants to become involved in emergency relief and rehabilitation activities such as prosthetics, in which no realistic exit strategy is available.  (2) While the New Partnership Initiative (NPI) commits the Agency to expanding the role of PVOs and NGOs in USAID programming, reduced foreign aid budgets, especially for operating expenditures, means increasing PVO/NGO implementation responsibilities in USAID activities.  As the case of VVAF indicates, however, bringing in ""new blood"" to the Agency's programs requires an honest assessment of a PVO's capacity to utilize and manage USAID funding effectively and efficiently.  In a number of cases, this will require remedial training and capacity building for the PVO as well as increased oversight responsibilities for concerned Missions.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","HRN-6004-C-00-5004-00","","10/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Prostheses|Medical education|Handicapped persons|Clinics|War victims|Private voluntary organizations|Project sustainability","Cambodia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABN080.pdf","104 KB","003366 - TvT Associates","","008291 - USAID.

"Ecuador's Coastal Resources Management Program (PMRC) was established in 1986 to develop integrated, sustainable approaches to coastal management, at both the national and community levels.  The PMRC focused on four major coastal management issues -- mangrove destruction, mariculture expansion, disorderly shore use, and environmental sanitation.  Its approach to coastal management emphasized: balance between the needs of conservation and development; use of both regulatory and nonregulatory management tools; participation in governance by all stakeholders; and focus on the interactions and interdependencies among different sectors. This compilation of papers documents 8 years (1986-94) of PMRC experience -- successes, failures, underlying motivations and values, and lessons learned.  Included are (1) papers on mangrove ecosystems, mariculture development, coastal water quality, environmental sanitation, shoreline management, environmental education, and the Ranger Corps (coastal law enforcement coordination units established by the PMRC); (2) a discussion of the program's use of special area management zones or ZEMs to test its approach to coastal management planning; (3) a description of the program's practical techniques for building a community's capacity to participate in ZEM coastal management planning; and (4) summary proceedings of the 1994 International Symposium on Integrated Coastal Management in Ecuador.  Annexes provide additional detail on PRMC's structure, objectives, and legal basis; its strategy to promote shrimp mariculture; a proposed mangrove ecosystem management strategy; and the User Group Agreement on Coastal Resources Management in the Atacames-Sua-Muisne Special Management Area.  Includes references.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","LAC-5518-A-00-5054-00","","9/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Natural resource management|Environmental management|Environmental protection|Coasts|Coastal fisheries|Marine resources|Environmental planning|Environmental policy|Ecosystems|Littoral zones","Ecuador","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNABY789.pdf","16,271 KB","007437 - University of Rhode Island.

"Final evaluation of a debt-for-nature project (1989-1995) aimed at increasing the financial and technical resources available for protecting Madagascar's natural resources. The World Wildlife Fund (WWF) and the Department of Water and Forests (DEF) implemented the project. The project has given the DEF much needed human resources support and provided a mechanism for villagers in buffer zones to become involved more directly and effectively in natural resource conservation and their own development. It also succeeded in improving DEF's image and orientation towards its conservation responsibilities. Although the project is understood by the Malagasy conservation community, there is widespread disagreement over its underlying assumption that the roles of Agents for the Protection of Nature (APNs) and Forest Agents (AFs) can be harmonized and combined within DEF. There are also differing views both within DEF and within the broader conservation community on the roles of APNs, to the detriment of the latter's effectiveness as conservation and development promoters within villages. The project had a small but positive impact on Madagascar's external debt burden and financial situation. It is more difficult to assess the project's impact on forest resource conservation and institutional strengthening of DEF because an adequate impact monitoring system has not been created. Nonetheless, there is some evidence that the project helped reduce the amount of forest clearing for agricultural use and bush fires. It also led to some reforestation and land and soil conservation efforts by villagers. The best results appear to be occurring in areas where APN village-related activities are associated with other donor-supported natural resource management efforts. Project staff are well qualified and highly motivated and the project is for the most part well administered, particularly considering its decentralized and highly dispersed character. The project is well integrated into DEF technically and administratively, but the DEF is not likely to assume funding responsibility for it in the foreseeable future. Further integration of the project into DEF should be deferred until the government's new laws and policies on decentralization and forestry are applied in order to see whether an alternate institutional location of the project and the APNs might be more effective in improving natural resource management. Interim strategies for increasing impact are included in the report. The following lessons were learned. (1) Experienced and talented TA personnel can make a difference in an old, entrenched institution. The WWF/Debt/Nature technical advisor is helping to create a DEF work environment that inspires project and DEF staff, promotes individual creativity, and rewards community-level accomplishments. (2) Institutional support projects need to be designed with the same rigor as other projects. Hypotheses need to be tested, key questions continually asked, and impacts monitored. (3) It is worthwhile to seek out the experiences of other countries who have already embarked on similar projects. Lessons about organizational change, community-based natural resource management, and forestry agent functions from similar projects in Kenya and other development countries could have been very valuable during the design and early implementation phases of this project. (4) Collaboration and harmonization of activities is very difficult when there is no agreement between partners on how to achieve conservation objectives and the roles of field agents in working towards those objectives. (5) An established organizational culture may hinder the implementation of new organizational policies and orientations if the staff of the organization does not participate in the reorientation, or is not adequately informed of the need to change traditional practices. (6) To arrive at common approaches, all partners need to be well informed about what is happening ""on the ground"", which may be quite different from what is presented in formal documents and presentations. This will require significant time talking to villagers, something best accomplished by those who can speak the local language, are familiar with local customs, and have no stake in the activities concerned.

"From 1986 until 1993, USAID/South Africa implemented a program of social, political, and economic development projects aimed at ending apartheid and empowering its victims.  This report describes those efforts and assesses their effectiveness, with an eye toward lessons learned that might be used by other USAID Missions working in similar circumstances; a discussion of the history of U.S. policy towards South African apartheid is included. Key lessons learned are as follows.  (1) Program experience has helped identify some political, economic, and social characteristics that are congenial to a political- or empowerment-driven aid program and some that are more congenial to an economic development-driven aid program.  If placed in a matrix, these results can be used in future development programming.  (2) The types of activities -- political empowerment or economic development -- that a Mission implements tend to determine its operational style and evaluative method. The former require flexibility and finesse and are often short-term and should evaluate process, while the latter are more technical and can be more readily evaluated through an examination of technical outputs.  (3) The labor-intensive, foundation-type community outreach projects used in South Africa require more employees per project dollar than do more traditional projects. Further, turnover of the U.S. staff helped the Mission maintain its flexibility, while the longevity of the foreign service national employees provided continuity and institutional memory. Human relations skills were more valuable in political empowerment activities while technical proficiency was more useful in development activities.  (4) The large and sophisticated network of NGOs and community-based organizations (CBOs) in South Africa was vital to the Mission's effort.  Missions working in areas without such a mature NGO/CBO network might want to consider creating one before providing other types of assistance.  (5) Perhaps the principal lesson is that USAID can work effectively over a sustained period, within a dynamic context of extreme political, social, and economic struggle and change if given adequate autonomy, protection, and flexibility. Although administratively burdensome, direct assistance to pluralistic constituencies strengthens civil society and enhances USAID's standing and influence within a country.  However, given the size of the Mission staff, the model of direct funding of numerous obligations to South African grantees has placed too great a workload on staff; the model has begun to break down.  Either the number of personnel or intermediary agents needs to be increased or the number of grantees needs to be decreased.  Includes case studies and a bibliography.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","674-0318-C-00-4915-00","","4/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Disadvantaged groups|Racial groups|Segregation|Racial discrimination|Political development|Economic development|Social development|USAID|Development program implementation|Democratization|Societies in transition","South Africa","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNACA200.pdf","18.940 KB","003406 - Aurora Associates, Inc.|001341 - Creative Associates International, Inc.

"Final evaluation of a project (1990-9/95) to support collaborative animal health research by Egyptian, Israeli, and U.S. scientists (TAHRP project). Each of the project's three subprojects (SPs) has reached its ambitious goals and leant medical attention to previously ignored species:  the neonatal SP decreased morbidity and mortality of neonatal calves in Egypt and Israel; the brucellosis SP facilitated the initiation of country-wide control programs; and the foot and mouth disease SP produced rapid identification and surveillance techniques which can be incorporated into regional control programs.  This research has contributed significantly to the economic well-being of Israelis and Egyptians. The project not only helped to elevate the level of in-country scientific expertise -- and consequently of service capacity -- for animal research, but has paved the way for collaborative animal health research and disease control between Egypt and Israel, including that between veterinary services and public health officials.  The project was designed solely by the two Country Coordinators and representatives from the United States, but by the project's end laboratory scientists were collaborating on the drafting of final technical reports and planning future joint activities.  Critical to the evolution of these relationships were the U.S. scientific collaborators. Finally, the project created a nucleus of scientists within the region that now attracts others to join in and participate.  Four international workshops were well attended and received, and the researchers have a clear desire to continue fostering relationships developed through this project, particularly in including other regional parties.  In sum, thanks to the project, real opportunities now exist to promote regional cooperation in animal health and related activities and to coordinate regional strategies for the control of animal diseases. Overall, the project was adequately managed, although under some constraints.  These include insufficient transparency in many areas of project administration leading to a lack of information sharing and decision-making at all levels; failure to articulate the priorities of each sub-project in order to avoid overlap and increase efficient decision-making; difficulty of the researchers in contacting one another; and chronic difficulties in the preparation and presentation of quarterly, semiannual, and annual reporting documents. The following lessons were learned.  (1) Equality between country scientists is critical.  Future projects should promote exchanges between scientists and field implementors from all countries involved. (2) The sustainability of project activities would be ensured and enhanced by increased movement toward privatization of veterinary services and livestock production activities in Egypt.  (3) Sustainability depends upon the commitment of each country to providing in-kind contributions either through an institution, the state, or the private sector. (4) Country Coordinators, administrators, or contractors should provide detailed schedules to the Team Leader well in advance of in-country activity.  Modifications could then be made without jeopardizing onsite evaluation time.  (5) On-site monitoring would help ensure that projects meet goals and objectives.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","ANE-0158-P-AG-0030-00","","9/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Animal health|Animal diseases|Research collaboration|Health research|Disease research|Regional development|Disease prevention and control|Development cooperation|Regional relationships","Israel|Egypt|USA","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABN838.pdf","4,974 KB","","","008439 - USAID.

"Evaluates the impacts of a project to promote rural enterprises in Guinea (PRIDE project).  The evaluation covers the period 1991-9/95 and focuses on PRIDE's micro-credit project and entrepreneur development workshop. In the micro-credit project, non-collateralized loans and business management training are provided to small producers who organize themselves into groups of five for the purpose of guaranteeing each other's loans.  There has emerged a clear pattern of difference among those with multiple loans, those who have had one loan or only training, and non-clients of PRIDE.  The recipients of multiple loans have increased the revenues received from their enterprise, as well as their individual and family income.  This is so even though non-clients have as many long-term assets (e.g., houses, land, vehicles) as clients do, suggesting that the multiple loan recipients have begun to receive their higher incomes recently, in the last few years, consistent with receiving the loans from PRIDE. Additionally, multiple loan recipients have begun to enjoy certain fruits of their greater prosperity.  They are now able to purchase better food than they could before, again setting them off from the non-clients. The entrepreneur development workshop, Atelier sur l'Esprit d'Entreprise, is a 2-week, for-fee program which provides 20-30 individuals per session with self-evaluation exercises, business management classes, and simulations and individual meetings with bankers.  The program has been very successful, offering an appropriate set of lessons that were absorbed by the trainees and used directly in their enterprises. Two aspects were interrelated in this success:  the high degree of motivation of those who take the workshop and the appropriate package of lessons and teaching techniques.  The only question is whether the lessons and teaching materials were as adapted to women trainees as to men trainees.  Women found the lessons harder to understand and the case materials less relevant. Overall, however, both men and women were pleased with the program, and reported that it had led to important changes in their work habits and in the success they now experience.","Project title: Growth and equity through microenterprise investment|(GEMINI)","Special Evaluation","Documents","DHR-5448-Q-82-9081-00|DHR-5448-Q-00-9081-00","","9/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Rural development|Business enterprises|Small scale enterprises|Commercial credit|Seminars|Management training","Guinea","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABN863.pdf","227 KB","006727 - Development Alternatives, Inc.

"Final evaluation of a matching grant (9/91-8/96) to TechnoServe, Inc. to strengthen the organization's institutional and operational capabilities. TechnoServe has achieved its goals of providing improved and expanded TA to an increased number of small- and medium-sized rural and community-based enterprises (CBEs) in Africa and Latin America, and has assisted larger numbers of the rural poor to participate in viable and sustainable enterprise. This has been achieved in part by strengthening TechnoServe's internal institutional structure, its network of external relations, and by supporting new country and program expansion, as envisioned in the grant.  TechnoServe's success derives from the technical soundness of its CBE approach, which emphasizes local solutions and community participation while fostering productivity and the creation of wealth, and its capacity to adapt the CBE model to local country conditions.  Despite these successes, there is need for greater emphasis on:  building a ""critical mass"" of institutional capacity in a selected number of country programs, the addition of advanced support services, developing exit strategies and retaining the fee-for-service principle, and paying greater attention to adult training methodologies. TechnoServe is approaching a critical transition period and needs to settle a number of internal and external challenges of an institutional and programmatic nature.  Cutting across both sets of challenges is the need to strengthen TechnoServe's analytical and self-learning capacity both at Norwalk and in the field. Institutional challenges include:  effectively managing TechnoServe's first executive transition; broadening and deepening the base of financial support; and designing a better structure of relationships and communications between the headquarters and field offices, with emphasis on strengthening the support role of headquarters.  Programmatically, TechnoServe needs to ensure that its CBE approach reflects the trends and market conditions of the 1990s.  This will require a greater degree of freedom and openness to experimentation, a more active approach to strengthening autonomy and fostering independence, and a strengthened institutional capacity to learn from experience. While there is considerable debate within TechnoServe about the need for experimentation and change, the climate in which this debate occurs is sometimes dysfunctional. TechnoServe needs to structure a process that will bring alternative views on the table for discussion and to examine new proposals analytically and objectively.  It is especially important for senior country program directors to feel there is a climate responsive to constructive change.  Also, despite the sound reasons for the slow progress made to date in fostering greater independence in its country programs and the costliness of a premature graduation or exit strategy, TechnoServe should continue to develop ways to  promote this independence in order to make the matching grant vision of a strengthened TechnoServe network a reality. TechnoServe is currently in the process of completing and formally adopting a strategic plan that will provide policy direction during the critical executive transition period.  Many of the concerns raised in this evaluation are addressed in that document and the findings and recommendations are largely consistent with the material set forth in this evaluation.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","PDC-0158-A-00-1100-00","","9/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Institution building|Private voluntary organizations|Management reform|Reengineering","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABN908.pdf","3,034 KB","002241 - TechnoServe, Inc.","","007746 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to establish the Business Centre in Tanzania to facilitate the emergence, growth, and sustainability of private businesses.  The evaluation covers the period 4/94-10/95.  The project is being implemented by Development Alternatives, Inc. (DAI). The Business Centre officially opened to the public 7/1/94, after putting in place an adequate administrative and management infrastructure.  The infrastructure, which ensures the provision of timely and responsive TA to the private business sector, includes financial management systems, internal controls, policies and procedures, information systems, high quality and committed professional staff.  The Centre has acquired information technology that can connect its customers to worldwide information and other services. The Centre has developed a 10-module training course and 30 business skills workshops for business managers and entrepreneurs.  To date, however, only 444 of a targeted 4,000 participants (11%) have been trained.  The target is overly ambitious even if the Centre manages to have a rapid take-off in 1996.  Nonetheless, the business skills courses are based on adult education principles not commonly adhered to in Tanzania at this time, and interviews reveal a high level of impact in terms of improved enterprise performance, revenue, and participants' use of training manuals to guide business activities.  An important milestone is the Centre's market-oriented approach to business planning in Tanzania. The project has operated under a number of significant constraints. Due to the project paper requirement that it respond to the needs of the whole Tanzanian business community, the Centre has spread its resources too thinly, and has been unable to reach any one of its targets.  Also, DAI's contract with Business Care Services (BSC), which provides the Centre with local staff, does not outline procedures for obtaining the consent of all parties concerned (DAI, BSC, and USAID) in recruiting and replacing staff; high staff turnover reflects this anomaly.  Further, salary levels approved by USAID for BSC professionals are not high enough to attract the high-quality staff best suited to serve as mentors to Tanzanian businesspeople.  This has limited the Centre's effectiveness in its first year and the morale of BSC in the first half of 1995. Lack of enabling private sector environment has also caused implementation problems.  Due to the lack of qualified consultants, for example, the Centre has had to find its own consultants to provide business advisory services.  Likewise, the extraordinary difficulty of the Tanzanian process of registering and obtaining business licenses has resulted in fewer formal customers for the Centre than had been expected, while the slower than expected pace of financial reforms has led to a lack of finance for bankable projects, which in turn has constrained the Centre's efforts to create new jobs.  Finally, although the Centre is supposed to operate on a cost-recovery basis in order to promote the commercialization of business skills training, donor subsidies (the payment of ""sitting allowances"") have undermined this goal by distorting consulting fees and moving business services away from a sustainable position. Three implementation issues are noted.  (1) The subcontract between DAI and BSC requires BSC to attach two of its principals to the Business Centre full-time.  This has not only robbed BSC of its best talent, but also hurt the Business Centre, which did not get the full attention of the two principals.  It was unrealistic to expect BSC's top management to devote its full attention to the Centre.  (2) Unless its clients get better access to finance, the Centre may have difficulty meeting its target for employment impact.  (3) The Centre has been unable to effectively reach out to associations as planned.  But even if such an effort were undertaken, its effectiveness would be doubtful, since the leadership of these associations is often weak and isolated and does not represent the aspirations of the members.

"Evaluates project to provide economic and political leaders in the Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries with U.S. participant training in support of Support for East European Democracy (SEED) Act legislation.  Interim evaluation covers the period 1991-12/94. The project is largely achieving its stated outputs, and in a timely fashion.  As of 12/94, the project had trained 1,587 participants (39% of them female), of which 1,259 had completed training.  The largest programs are in Poland, Bulgaria, Hungary, the Czech Republic, the Slovak Republic, and Romania.  Training has been mostly technical (72%) rather than academic (28%) and has occurred in all three SEED Act priority areas (economic restructuring, democratic institutions, and quality of life), but mainly in economic restructuring (66% vs. a guideline of 50% for this area). Overall, training programs have been adequately managed, although in-country participant preparation varies substantially among contractors.  Most programs provide more comprehensive orientation after participant arrival in the United States.  Overall, 80% of participants felt prepared for their training.  Participants were least satisfied with orientation services (advance notice of travel, transportation, and stipends).  Some organizations were unable to recruit the anticipated number of participants or required more USAID assistance than anticipated. Exit questionnaires revealed that 84% of participants were satisfied with program quality and 80% with program content.  Goodwill, Harvard, and U.S. Telecommunications Training Institute (USTTI) received the most consistently high ratings, with the Cooperative Housing Foundation, Home Builders Institute, Institute of International Education (IIE), and U.S. Information Agency (USIA) receiving generally above average ratings. Soros and the East Central Europe Scholarship Program (ECESP) received the most consistently low ratings, with State University of New York (SUNY) and William Davidson receiving generally low ratings.  Overall, ratings for relevance were lower than for quality; 86% believed that training would be useful. The programs with the best overall value (quality and cost per participant month) appear to be those of Harvard, Goodwill, Johns Hopkins, and the IIE.  The Soros Foundation's program had the poorest balance of cost and quality.  Returnee data to date are insufficient for assessing training impact. Some lessons learned are as follows.  (1) Changes in project design or priorities might reduce the management burden and enable a greater integrated strategic focus on country development objectives.  (2) The project's diverse components do not lend themselves to common management and evaluation standards.  The program has 22 distinct activities, some of which represent a significant departure from traditional participant training.  In particular, distinct programs such as the USIA's ""topping-off"" program should not be subject to standard management, data collection, or evaluation criteria.  (3) The project's institutional competition (cooperative agreements) component has been a mixed success. The management burden has been significant, and the program quality has ranged form very good to poor.  The program should evolve to build on identified strengths and develop closer linkages to mission strategies. (4) The ECESP program is meeting otherwise unmet training needs, but should be more closely integrated with USAID mission strategic objectives and priorities.  (5) USAID's needs for monitoring and evaluation information and services should be carefully defined and incorporated into the monitoring services contract.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","EUR-0045-C-00-3027-00","","4/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Participants|Economic development|Political development|Participant program administration|Technical training|Leadership training|Democratization","Central and Eastern Europe","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABP135.pdf","8,040 KB","012322 - Aguirre International|009608 - Development Specialists International","","007892 - USAID.

"This study reports the findings of a survey of 100 Senegalese workers who participated in USAID-sponsored health, environment, and agricultural training programs over the period 1961-1995, mostly through long-term programs in the United States. Training impact was tracked at four levels: (1) trainee reaction to the program; (2) trainee acquisition of skills and knowledge; (3) trainee on-the-job performance following training; and (4) changes brought to the organization as a result of the training. Most of those surveyed were from the public sector. Key findings were as follows. (1) Overall, participants expressed an exceptionally high degree of satisfaction with the quality of the training. More than 75% of all respondents, and 92% of long-term participants assessed training at the highest quality level. (2) Participants were able to apply their new skills on the job, and in many instances, outside the workplace. (3) Improved job performance had a positive impact on the efficiency, productivity, or profitability of participants' institutions. A number of innovations were introduced in the workplace by trainees upon their return to Senegal, resulting in stream-lined office communication, use of new venture capital mechanisms and creative financing solutions, use of new diagnosis methods for agricultural research, and improved attendance at family planning clinics, among others. These positive impacts were greater in sectors related to agriculture and environment than health, and greater among long-term than among short-term participants. (4) Human Resources Development Assistance (HRDA) participants rated their training programs lower in quality than those funded by the other projects. Roughly half of the participants sponsored by health projects reported institutional improvements, compared to 62% for HRDA and 88% for agriculture and environment. (5) In terms of gender analysis, 83% of women reported that needs assessments were conducted relating to their training; women were more likely than men to have training objectives than men (89% vs. 77%); and more women (94%) than men (84%) reported that training improved their performance.","Delivery order no. 3","Special Evaluation","Documents","AOT-0463-Q-00-3216-00","","9/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Education for development|Participants|Impact assessment|Human capacity development|Institutional aspects","Senegal","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNACA828.pdf","3,702 KB","006007 - AMEX International, Inc.","","009362 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to increase the utilization of research and analyses for policy and program development and evaluation in the health and human resources sectors in Africa (HHRAA) project.  Mid-term evaluation covers the period 1992-2/95. The HHRAA project is unique in several respects -- it covers a broader range of human resource development areas than most USAID projects, supports a broad range of analytic activities from field research to information synthesis, stresses the use of research for program and policy action, and gives equal weight to research and information dissemination.  In addition, HHRAA supports the participation of Africans and African institutions in all aspects of the project and seeks to ensure that its analytic activities are relevant to the people involved in health and human resource development in Africa. HHRAA also provides a broad umbrella for strategy development by the education and health and population subsectors. In the 2.5 years since its inception, HHRAA has grown from two full-time equivalent staff to a staff of 27 highly qualified professionals based in Washington and in offices in REDSO East and West. A highly flexible mechanism has been put in place for carrying out a diverse set of activities involving a variety of implementors in a number of sub-Saharan African countries.  Results have been impressive. Ten strategic frameworks have been developed and over 100 research and analysis activities (vs. a target of 57) have been initiated.  These activities are either already having impact or show the potential for such.  For example, development of a child survival program design strategy helped change the Africa Bureau's child survival program and influenced program planning at both the regional and country levels; a review of immunization coverage in Africa led to a major joint USAID/UNICEF initiative focused on increasing the Expanded Program of Immunization (EPI) coverage levels; a global strategy for malaria control and treatment has been developed with WHO; an evaluation of the Botswana National Tuberculosis Program resulted in a number of program improvements; and direct assistance has been provided to revising USAID's basic education program in at least 8 countries. One of HHRAA's most important achievements has been to insert its activities into other donor programs and convince donors to undertake certain activities, including the Bamako malaria effort, the EPI program with WHO/AFRO and UNICEF, the Donors to African Education program, and the USAID's BASICS project, which has incorporated nutrition activities into its portfolio as a result of HHRAA's networking activities. Problem areas include the following.  (1) While the project has succeeded in disseminating its results widely, this process has not been integrated into the activity design process and no research on the demand for such information has been performed.  (2) The research and analysis (R&A) process is not guided by any overarching strategy for the health and population sub-sectors, and the existence of what appear to be too many ill-defined activities may fragment HHRAA's efforts and weaken its impact.  (3) External reviews of research plans and protocols have only been made in the health financing subsector.  Also, it has been difficult to determine the costs of research activities. (4) While Africans have participated in the project at every level, their contributions have been directed from Washington and USAID cooperating agencies so that they have had little opportunity to lead the analytic process.  This may prevent them from assuming ownership of results. Similarly, except in the education subsector, Mission personnel have not been integrated into HHRAA activities.  Many still feel more like observers than project participants.  (5) The project has functioned without a full-time project officer or administrator, who is needed to bring coherency and direction to the project.  (6) The decentralized nature of HHRAA operations, the number of implementing groups, dispersed staff locations, heavy work loads, and staff travel schedules have all contributed to a general lack of communication among the HHRAA staff. (7) HHRAA is not widely known and lacks a distinct identity; its niche within USAID and the Africa Bureau is not well-defined; its distinctive characteristics are not identified, developed, and promoted; and its relationships with other similar initiatives in health, population, and education are not clear.  (8) Finally, a clear understanding of and agreement on end-of-project expectations is lacking.","Project title: Health and human resources analysis for Africa|(HHRAA)","Special Evaluation","Documents","AOT-0483-C-00-4200-00","","2/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Development research|Policy analysis|Development strategies|Development planning|Development programs|Strategic planning|Sector planning|Development program planning|Sector policy|Health|Human capacity development|Personnel|Information dissemination|Educational development","Africa south of Sahara","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABP374.pdf","5,817 KB","003366 - TvT Associates","","008308 - USAID.

"Evaluates training programs implemented by USAID/Chad since 1984. The Mission is scheduled to close in September 1995. Since 1984, the Mission has provided short-, long-, U.S.- and third-country, and local training to over 2,700 Chadians in various fields.  These investments have had a significant and measurable impact at the individual, sectoral, and national levels, despite a trying development context.  Moreover, these investments are sustainable, given that in 1990 the Mission began to provide and focus on participant training for the staff of three ""development"" ministries, those of Health (MOH), Agriculture, and Planning, and, by way of complement, to cultivate within each a ""critical mass"" of cadres trained in modern management techniques. On an individual level, 87% of those surveyed reported that training improved their performance, with half receiving promotions as a result. All 27 Chadians interviewed individually stated that training led to a ""change in their life"", and 70% reported using their training very often. At the institutional level, 100% of those surveyed stated that their employers were involved in the selection of training, and most participants returned to the same employer, despite the political upheavals in Chad at the time.  Most participants shared their new skills with colleagues, indicating a significant multiplier effect, and an overwhelming percentage reported that use of their new skills in the work place led to institutional changes.  Training led to the establishment of a MOH unit that publishes annual health statistics. Also, a health training center was founded in Sarh that has trained a large number of rural-based primary health care personnel.  Local consulting firms improved their capacity by collaborating and sub-contracting with the USAID and U.S. contractors who handled training programs.  Training has also helped improve capacity to publish regular and accurate agricultural price reports necessary to the expansion of production and trade.  At the national and sectoral level, Mission training helped induce changes in family planning policies and attitudes. As for the private sector, training under the Human Resource Development Assistance (HRDA) Project did not begin until 1992.  U.S. observation tours exposed key Chadian businesspeople to trade opportunities that resulted in increased revenues and improved commercial ties to U.S. buyers and suppliers.  Training also improved the skills of Chadian businesspeople in new marketing and management tools and helped increase their profits and revenues.  Training also resulted in better distinction between business and personal matters, improved personnel management, and increased creativity, diversity, and product quality. USAID/Chad is the only bilateral donor to use and publicize mandates for recruiting and selecting women for training.  However, even when in-country and participant training are combined, the Mission did not meet its targets for number of women trained; male attitudes toward women assuming ""non-traditional"" professional roles are negative in Chad and silently supported by the lack of clear Government of Chad guidance. However, training of women business owners has led to improved profits and quality of family life. Also, a little over half of the male respondents felt that training had sensitized them to the situation for women in Chad. Finally, the Mission has made some headway towards fostering democracy and governance in Chad: training has exposed the country's top magistrates and jurists to legal aspects relating to the transition to democracy in Benin and Senegal, and hands-on training for Chadian magistrates has provided them with practical information needed to establish a credible judicial system.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","4/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Participants|Institution building|Human capacity development|Education for development","Chad","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABP427.pdf","5,535 KB","006007 - AMEX International, Inc.","","008528 - USAID.

"Evaluates the Mexico Ecodevelopment Program (MEP) to protect selected wildland areas in southern Mexico.  Mid-term evaluation covers the period 1990-4/95. The MEP is implemented by World Wildlife Fund (WWF) in collaboration with seven local Mexican partners (NGOs). Unfortunately, there has been little understanding of or support for the project's Integration of Conservation and Development (ICDP) strategy among concerned Mexican NGOs or government agencies.  In fact, the project's strategy has been largely untested as there are few similar models with which to compare it.  In addition, the rates and causes of deforestation in the project areas are not well understood, and, in particular, the relationship between the introduction of agroecological techniques and the reduction of deforestation is not clearly established.  The MEP's conceptual framework, as outlined in the original proposal, is not being followed rigorously: an almost exclusive focus on campesino agriculture has precluded attention to other activities that have equivalent or greater environmental impacts. Further, insufficient attention has been paid to the participation of targeted communities (especially women and other family members), particularly during initial diagnostic activities.  The Participatory Rural Appraisal technique used in the latter was applied incorrectly and/or was inappropriate to the circumstances, and no alternative technique was attempted.  Other problems include a poorly defined relationship between the MEP's work with local populations in the buffer zone and a broader conservation and land use strategy for the area (including the core zone), and the need to improve extension and promotion methodologies and environmental education. The project has met with some institutional constraints. Disparities between NGO staff and communities decrease project effectiveness, as do intraorganizational problems (e.g., staffing, communication between field and headquarters, few women staff, and weak program administration).  Communication among different WWF offices (Washington, Mexico City, and Oaxaca) and between WWF and the implementing groups could be improved.  Collaboration among Biodiversity Support Program (BSP) consortium members on the MEP, especially between WWF and The Nature Conservancy, is weak. Moreover, collection and analysis of baseline data and information needed for project monitoring is weak overall and inconsistent between projects. The MEP seems to be working through some of these shortcomings; many significant positive changes have taken place in the first 3 years in terms of project management, selection of partners, project-level coordination, and quality of results.  A 5-year time frame, which appeared realistic at the start, now appears inadequate to test hypotheses and achieve program objectives with this degree of social and ecological complexity.","Biodiversity support program (BSP)","Special Evaluation","Documents","DHR-5554-A-00-8044-00|DHR-A-00-88-00044-00","","7/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Environmental management|Natural resource management|Protected wildlife areas|Deforestation|Protected environmental areas|Buffer zones","Mexico","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABP462.pdf","5,982 KB","001303 - World Wildlife Fund-U.S. (WWF)","","008355 - USAID.

"Evaluates the Niger Economic Policy Reform Program (NEPRP), to promote policy, administrative, and institutional reforms that foster increased exports of agro-pastoral products.  Preliminary impact evaluation covers the period 1988-8/95 against a PACD of 6/96. The NEPRP is a successful broad-based experimental reform program. In applying a flexible sector grant approach to a combination of economic and political constraints, this program represented ""cutting edge"" approaches to development assistance in West Africa in the late 1980s.  The focus on obligation of funds using conditionalities at a strategic objective level (reduction of marketing costs such as taxes and illegal payments) with sector performance measured by customer surveys, represents an experiment in reengineering the delivery of USAID development assistance. The reforms supported by the NEPRP fall into five categories:  (1) elimination of export taxes and export quotas on agro-pastoral products; (2) reduction of domestic illegal payments to public officials on the roads by traders and transporters of agro-pastoral exports (rent seeking); (3) regional market development through promotion of trade relationships between Niger and its West African neighbors, Nigeria in particular; (4) improvement or simplification of transport and trading sector regulations and elimination of monopolies; and (5) public dissemination of agro-pastoral market information. Of these five categories, only the first two, which are interdependent, have had people-level impact.  Conditions precedent (CPs) in both these reform areas were met and led to significant short-term impact while contributing to an environment for long-term sustainable growth and regional trade relationships in West Africa. Regional trade promotion included various initial contacts, bridge building, and meaningful exchanges.  However, given the preliminary nature of these contacts and exchanges, it is impossible to attribute any impact directly to these initiatives. There is no evidence of improvement or simplification of transport and trading sector regulations or elimination of monopolies due to program support. Limited impact in this sector can partly be explained by the temporary surplus trucking capacity and a focus on regulations that are not a binding constraint on sector performance or supply of transportation services in the short term. Dissemination of agro-pastoral market information, possibly a critical component of sustainability, has been weak.  Dissemination of information to support elimination of the export tax and illegal payments appears to have been a critical component of success.  However, dissemination of agro-pastoral price and market information in radio programs, Chamber of Commerce bulletins, or printed reports meets the legal requirements of the CPs, but not their spirit.  Price information is disseminated for too short a duration, too long a time after the data are collected, and during a season when the information is not expected to have any measurable impact. Copies of agricultural sector studies were not duplicated to make material broadly available to the private sector in Niger.  Unions directly involved with the reforms supported by NEPRP appeared to be unaware of the existence of the USAID program.

"Final evaluation of a project (4/91-4/95) to help disadvantaged artisans in Hungary to increase their incomes through the development of sustainable craft businesses.  The project was implemented by Aid to Artisans, Inc. The project was remarkably successful in generating new business opportunities for a broad cross-section of artisan enterprises, most of which employed women in rural regions.  Specifically, the project generated over $1 million in direct revenues to small enterprises and microenterprises; provided business training programs for 30 small businesses, 28 microenterprises, and 5 foreign trade companies and independent export agents; and helped participating enterprises to stay in business and stabilize their employment levels.  The project also strengthened a local NGO, the Hungarian Folkart Association, and fostered long-term, committed business relationships between U.S. and Hungarian companies. Several factors impeded implementation. These included:  (1) a highly changeable legal and regulatory environment, which created general confusion among project participants whose businesses were under constant stress and financial uncertainty; (2) language constraints, which reduced program participants' ability to take maximum advantage of opportunities to interact directly with representatives from U.S. business; and (3) differences in cultural attitudes and values, which created misunderstandings and a general lack of experience with market concepts, American business styles, and gender roles.  Additionally, macro-economic conditions had a massive impact on the program: inflation, lack of credit, a legacy of top-heavy management, and low productivity all contributed to painful down-sizing methods throughout businesses in Hungary. The evaluation noted that successful, break-even, and unsuccessful businesses could each be characterized by a different set of traits. Successful businesses were driven by managements which were willing to take great risks, possessed a positive, pro-active approach, and seized every possible opportunity to implement program recommendations related to product design, marketing, and customer relations.  While break-even enterprises should be recognized for their achievements in staying afloat despite overwhelming debt burdens, they were also reluctant to trim costs and reduce their workforce and only partially able to avail themselves of program resources, sometimes stubbornly refusing to make price concessions to would-be buyers. Failed enterprises took a passive attitude towards marketing, tended to be highly negative in their outlook, and did not take steps to participate in the mainstream workplace. The project demonstrated an important lesson:  managing growth and opportunities that a project such as this can generate is difficult. Early successes can breed unrealistic expectations, which very quickly are dispelled by slow market response.  The best antidote to this problem is a feedback loop that fosters open communication between all participants and program management.  Fostering new business opportunities and working with the private sector raises sensitive issues related to fairness, access, and conflict of interest, and much of this formerly communist society is still not clear on what constitutes good business practices.  More time will be needed for the lessons of this project to be absorbed by members of a country living with the legacy of 40 years of communism.

"Final evaluation of Phase II (9/93-3/95) of a program, part of the Nutrition Communication Project (NCP), to promote the consumption of foods rich in vitamin A through a 10-month campaign in Niger.  The evaluation consisted mainly of a comparison between baseline and final surveys conducted in 20 villages in two of the four project districts. As a result of the project, about 40% of women and 60% or more of men surveyed had some exposure to the NCP program through radio skits and spots, village drama, and group educational sessions supported by counseling cards.  The percentage of men exposed does not include those who attended group discussions with counseling cards. There were significant increases in the percentage of women who mentioned foods rich in vitamin A as foods certain at-risk populations should eat.  The percentage of women who mentioned such foods as necessary for children 1-2 years old, increased from 32% to 57%. The percentage who cited yamoutse (a salad of boiled, fresh, or dried green leaves with oil and spices) went from 0% to 27%.  Regarding pregnant women, 77% of women and 59% of men mentioned the importance of eating foods rich in vitamin A compared with 33% and 12% at the baseline. Thus, about twice as many women in the follow-up survey named foods rich in vitamin A as foods children and pregnant mothers should eat.  Changes related to children 6 months of age and to nursing mothers were in the same direction but smaller. Differences were found between the baseline and follow-up surveys regarding the appropriate age for introducing liver and dark leafy greens to young children.  There was an increase in the percentage of women who reported introducing liver and fresh greens earlier.  At baseline, 49% and 52% gave the right age for introducing liver and fresh greens, respectively, compared with 54% and 59% following the intervention. Four critical indicators of reported consumption of vitamin A-rich foods showed significant improvement.  The percentage of women reporting that their husband brought home snacks rich in vitamin A increased from 11% to 47%; the percentage of women who bought such foods with their own money increased from 10% to 37%; the percentage of women who reported eating liver in the last week increased from 43% to 73%; and the percentage of women serving their families and children fresh greens increased from 57% to 94%.  The principal differences were found in the numbers of people who reported consuming liver and yamoutse.  The survey did not find evidence that more men were growing crops rich in vitamin A in their dry season gardens. Villages which had interpersonal counseling and radio did better in terms of both knowledge and practice than villages which had village drama in addition to interpersonal counseling and radio.  While the survey found that interpersonal counseling and group talks tended not to be carried out in the villages with drama teams, the results are still unexpected, since in Phase I drama proved a powerful medium, reaching 68% of men and 32% of women.  Interpersonal communication with counseling cards appears to have been a more powerful medium than village drama.  Drama teams did not succeed in reaching all neighborhoods in their village because the drama villages tended to be larger than those receiving the other media mix. Other findings are that:  listening to the radio was associated with bringing home snacks of vitamin A foods as well as having eaten liver the past week; radio was more effective in larger villages (which tend to have better access to markets and more resources); and people who saw a skit about vitamin A were more likely to have eaten snacks rich in vitamin A and to have eaten liver the past week.  Seeing counseling cards in group discussions about vitamin A was not associated with increased consumption of vitamin A-rich food. Major differences were also found between villages that had participated in Phase I and those new to the project (Phase II).  With regard to both the knowledge and behavioral scale, the difference between persons from Phase I villages and those in Phase II only villages was highly significant, with those exposed for the longer period doing better.

"Interim evaluation of a program/project to improve the quality of and reduce inequities in Uganda's primary education system (SUPER). Evaluation covers the period 8/92-Spring 1995, and concentrates on SUPER's potential problems rather than its general success, which has already been well-documented. Achievement towards the project's three purposes, each of which is matched by a program-level policy objective, are as follows.  (1) Efforts have focused on improving students' mastery of literacy, numeracy, and other basic skills, mostly by trying to improve the quality of teaching and instructional materials.  Progress in improving teachers' terms, conditions, and training was remarkable; however, training modules and sessions may be more effective if used as part of in-service training.  (2) As regards school administration, the initial work done under the Management Training component is excellent and the materials and training will be effective.  With no history of school management training in Uganda, the Teacher Development and Management System (TDMS) staff are not hampered by traditional practices.  The head count and development of establishment ceilings have also improved school management, as has the Ugandan government's efforts to decentralize school administration to the district level.  SUPER has used the project as an opportunity to train district level education officers and inspectors.  (3) Unfortunately, little progress has been made in reducing inequities in the persistence in school of different groups of children.  The corresponding policy objective needs to be revised, including a better definition of what ""disadvantaged groups"" of children are being targeted, clarification of the strategy for achieving the PAAD objective, and the provision of TA by USAID and SUPER to implement the strategy.  Also, to ensure that it does not create inequities in the quality of schools, SUPER should share its products with non-core Parent Teachers' Colleges (PTCs) and with PTCs in districts not served by the project.  This could probably be done at little cost. Overall, the SUPER design is a good blueprint for support for educational reform in Uganda.  However, three aspects of the plan should be reconsidered.  (1) Since SUPER is focused more on improving the quality of teaching than on improving students' mastery of skills, the project should revise its purpose to ""to improve the quality of instruction.""  This revision would also remove SUPER from the debate about whether primary schools should give priority to literacy, math, science, and social studies, or to vocational skills.  (2) Policy objective Two should be revised to focus on improving girls' persistence rather than, more broadly, on eliminating inequities. Strategies for achieving this new aim should be clarified, including the use of community mobilization and incentive grants. (3) The fourth EOPS could be split into two separate items, giving more weight to increasing parental and community participation in schooling.  The corresponding EOPS should be rephrased in terms of policies, structures, and procedures to ensure that improvements are sustained.  Currently, the EOPS describes conditions that could disappear when program inputs end. Four problems were found with implementation.  (1) SUPER modules and training programs may not improve teacher training as much as they might because they are not based on a curriculum with clear priorities, have a weak instructional framework, and are too voluminous.  The materials should make it clear what is most important for teachers to learn and how they are expected to achieve and demonstrate success.  They should also be pilot tested.  (2) To promote sustainability, the TDMS should be moved from the Project Implementation Unit to the Ugandan education ministry.  Institutions hitherto ignored by the reform process, such as the Institute for Teacher Education and Makerere University, should be drawn into the process.  The Educational Planning Unit within the Ministry needs to hone its capacity to estimate the costs of universal free primary education and reform, and to devise a strategy for using information to engender dialogue about cost-effective ways of achieving government objectives.  (3) The strategy for improving equity is disjointed, with community mobilization activities off to a slow start, the Incentive Grants program in need of an overhaul, and with both of these components, which were designed to work in concert with one another, now separated.  The focus on girls' persistence has eroded as a wider range of disadvantaged groups have became eligible for program benefits.  (4) As regards the TDMS, there are concerns about drastically shortening the pilot phase to 3 months and enlarging the areas served from single districts to catchment areas that serve several districts. If major flaws appear in the system, adjustments will be more difficult in the shortened time frame and the expanded geographical scope.","Work order no. 3","Special Evaluation","Documents","HNE-5832-I-00-3069-00","","8/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Educational reform|Nonproject assistance|Policy reform|Educational policy|Primary education|Educational development|Equity","Uganda","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABP618.pdf","6,004 KB","009054 - DevTech Systems, Inc.","","008618 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of USAID's democratic initiative projects in Argentina and Uruguay from 1990-1995. Overall, USAID's support for democratization in both countries has been characterized by an approach that has sought and taken advantage of opportunities to maximize results as well as to be more responsive than instructive. In Argentina, USAID helped modernize the country's largest provincial court system, that of Buenos Aires, and foster within it an openness to change that is spilling out into other provinces.  This progress should be sustained by the new USAID-supported Center of Judicial Studies of the Republic of Argentina (CEJURA), which provides the provincial court system with technical services.  In the area of judicial education, USAID has spurred Argentina's new interest in creating judicial schools in provincial court systems, including that in Santa Fe, and supported the post-graduate legal program of the University of Palermo.  As a result of USAID's efforts, alternative dispute resolution has been institutionalized within the country's judicial system, and Fundacion Libra has become an emissary of the gospel of mediation in Argentina's provinces, international conferences, and in judicial training programs in other Latin American countries.  USAID made a small investment in promoting access to justice by strengthening the role of the public defender.  USAID reduced opportunities for corruption:  in the private sector by supporting Poder Ciudadano, a PVO; and in the public sector by supporting an experiment in accountability in the Sindicatura General de la Nacion (SIGEN), an agency of the office of the President of the Republic.  Finally, in the area of civic education, USAID supported CONCIENCIA, an NGO, in its efforts to generate citizen participation and community integration through municipalities and schools, and to train women political leaders and improve an international network for civic education. In Uruguay, the investment of USAID's limited funds has led to more efficient judicial decisionmaking by establishing a functioning judicial school and a modern administrative apparatus within, and a shift in the operational culture of, the Uruguayan Supreme Court.  In addition, a small investment in the juvenile justice project resulted in a strategic plan, a new approach to management of offenders through a form of social work/probation arrangement, the use of mediation as an option in juvenile justice proceedings, and a project to create five juvenile centers. Lessons learned are as follows.  (1) Success in promoting democratic reform requires political consensus and support of the relevant constituency; efforts in these areas are an important element of democratic initiative programs, as is the need to work -- as USAID did in both countries -- in accordance with the host country's agenda.  (2) The community and court mediation programs and legal education in Argentina, and the juvenile justice program in Uruguay demonstrate that small investments may enhance the justice system in more advanced developing countries, especially when a foundation has been laid through years of collaborative reform.  (3) Democratic initiative programs require project managers and technical advisors who understand a country's political system.  (4) Technical expertise need not be provided by resident TA personnel, but it must be available throughout the project.  (5) USAID must develop ways to assure sustainability of its host country NGO partners in democratic development that maximize their survivability while insulating them from the pressures to conform politically.","Delivery order no. 29","Special Evaluation","Documents","AEP-0085-I-00-3002-00","","5/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Democratization|Democracy|Institution building|Administration of law|Judicial reform","Argentina|Uruguay","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABP705.pdf","1,293 KB","000436 - Development Associates, Inc.","","008058 - USAID.

"Evaluates umbrella project to provide assistance in a broad range of areas related to AIDS prevention and control (AIDSCAP project). Evaluation covers the period 1987-1/95 against a PACD of 9/97. Although AIDSCAP is about a year behind schedule, a group of well-designed and promising subprojects (SPs) is now getting off the ground. Currently, AIDSCAP has projects in 17 priority countries and 27 associate countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America and the Caribbean, some of them begun under predecessor programs AIDSTECH and AIDSCOM.  AIDSCAP is designed around three primary strategies -- Behavior Change Communication (BCC), condom programming, and the reduction of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) -- and three supporting strategies -- behavioral research, policy development, and evaluation.  Programs in priority countries conduct activities under all six rubrics.  In associate countries, a mix of some of these elements is tailored to country needs.  These strategies focus on individuals rather than society at large, although AIDSCAP has recognized the need to shift somewhat in the latter direction. BCC activities, which aim to delay the onset of sexual activity among young people, decrease the number of their sexual partners, and increase appropriate STD treatment-seeking behavior and condom use/demand, appear carefully designed and methodically implemented. However, due to the frequent unavailability of either condoms, STD treatment drugs, or both (neither are provided under the project), some BCC activities have in effect motivated people to seek goods or services not available to them. By the end of 1994, AIDSCAP had assessed the status and trends of STDs and developed prevention and control strategies in 22 countries. AIDSCAP favors the ""syndrome-based"" approach at the ""point of first encounter"".  In some countries, the medical profession resists this approach, preferring laboratory support, which, however, is not always available.  (Several recommendations are made for reducing this resistance over time).  AIDSCAP's efforts to create or strengthen STD diagnosis and treatment centers are commendable. AIDSCAP has completed condom programming in 17 countries and embarked on social marketing schemes for condoms in seven countries.  As of 9/94, AIDSCAP was supporting more than 15,000 outlets for condom distribution. Overall, however, sustainable access to affordable/free condoms remains a serious challenge to AIDSCAP's work.  Some  USAID family planning programs are reluctant to expand condom distribution to serve AIDSCAP clientele, partly out of fear that associating condoms with AIDS and STDs might create resistance to their use for family planning purposes. Four thematic research grants and two commissioned research grants have been awarded.  AIDSCAP also completed two research projects begun under the AIDSTECH program and initiated a series of narrower studies. Future research should focus on projects with narrow objectives, rapid turn-around time, and direct applicability to improving program delivery.  The practice of allowing reviewers of research proposals to conduct AIDSCAP-funded research should be discontinued. Though most projects have increased outreach and coverage, they need to better define their target populations, both in qualitative and quantitative terms, and to refine their evaluation indicators and processes, as well as specify their primary purpose. AIDSCAP has produced a number of studies demonstrating the need for a strong national AIDS policy in several countries.  In other countries, however, more work is needed to convince governments to accord a hierarchical position to AIDS organizations commensurate with the high priority placed on the problem itself. USAID pre-project appraisal documents should assess the likely interactions between forthcoming projects and HIV/AIDS. The widespread provision of TA to associate countries and to USAID Missions carrying out their own AIDS programs is exerting heavy pressure on AIDSCAP's Regional Offices, particularly in Africa and Asia. AIDSCAP should now consolidate its work and refrain from engaging in new country programs or projects.

"Final evaluation of Phase I (5/93-12/94) of the Regional Enterprise Development (RED) Project, to promote sustainable small- and medium-scale enterprises (SMEs) outside of Metropolitan Manila, Philippines. Phase I aimed to strengthen the Philippine Chamber of Commerce and Industry (PCCI) and its affiliated Chambers' capacities to serve regional SMEs. The project has performed remarkably, motivating PCCI and the pilot chambers of commerce and industry to explore avenues for improving their organizations and expanding services to both chamber members and regional SMEs.  Specifically, under Phase I, RED conducted an institutional assessment of PCCI and began to improve its organizational, human resource, compensation, accounting, and operational systems; selected six pilot chambers of commerce and industry located in Bulacan, Naga, Bacolod, Kalibo, Iligan, and Davao; and completed 15 training programs for 582 chamber officers and members, secretariat officers and staff, and entrepreneurs and managers of SMEs. In addition, RED has begun to renovate a building that will house the Davao Business Center (DBC), and completed the RED Impact Analysis and Implementation Plan study, which became the basis for the work plan and the Cooperative Agreement for RED Phase II.  Plans have been completed for the RED Information System and the training and delivery of hardware and software to PCCI and the 6 pilot chambers. However, the study design on the regional implications of ASEAN Free Trade Agreement (AFTA) is not complete and the local tax policy study has been deferred. Lessons learned are as follows.  (1) Institution building support should focus on the implementing organization, PCCI, which can, in turn, deliver services and support to the recipient chambers, and thus most effectively reach regional SMEs. Institution building should be a continuing process so that gaps due to personnel turnover and changes in chamber leadership are sure to be filled.  (2) The success of RED training programs can generally be attributed to the choice of participants, resource persons, and training venues; basing training design on needs assessment; instructional materials; and the granting of training subsidies.  However, training subsidies should gradually decline as the participants become more capable of financing their own participation. (3) The cross visits and the regular interactions between the chambers have provided them with opportunities to share experiences and even do business with each other. (4) Some grantees found the computers very expensive. However, provision of the most technologically current and sophisticated equipment accelerated the turnaround in the delivery of chamber services to SMEs.   (5) Since feasibility studies do not always result in positive conclusions, for large projects it would be less expensive and time-consuming to conduct a pre-feasibility study to determine whether a project merits a formal feasibility study.","Attachment: XD-ABP-782-A|Delivery order no. 14","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","492-0419-I-00-0136-00","","1/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Business enterprises|Small scale enterprises|Medium scale enterprises|Business associations|Business support services|Institutional linkages|Institution building|Regional level","Philippines","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABP782.pdf","3,461 KB","007320 - SGV & Co.","","008592 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of a child survival (CS) project, implemented by Adventist Development and Relief Agency (ADRA), in Minahasa District, North Sulawesi, Indonesia (1991-94). The project had a positive overall impact. Stated summarily, gains in knowledge and practice of CS indicators were significant in regard to maternal and pediatric immunization, moderate in the area of breastfeeding and weaning practices, and marginal in regard to modern contraceptive usage. Although the utilization of qualified professionals and traditional birth attendants (TBAs) for service delivery showed a uniformly consistent pattern over the course of the project, qualitative assessments revealed significant improvements in the appropriateness and timeliness of referral of high-risk obstetric cases by TBAs; this has been corroborated by Ministry of Health (MOH) data reflecting lowered maternal death rates.  This finding may be attributable, in part, to the project's TBA training and refresher programs for at least 74% (800 of 1,085) of all known/registered TBAs within the project field area and for assistance in their regular supervision. Equipped with UNICEF-type delivery kits and weighing scales, these trained TBAs represent a major success for the project.  These TBAs were also able to correctly identify 43% of newborns as having low birth weight. The project can be also indirectly credited with the improvements in the quality (accuracy and completeness) and timeliness of health-related reports generated at the district offices of the MOH as a result of efforts to improve the health information management systems.  Although the district MOH offices are not fully utilizing the existing resources (computer hardware and software) at present for lack of time and trained personnel, plans are being made to overcome these obstacles.  Other project accomplishments include:  (1) improvements in safe water supply in 8 of 11 targeted villages; (2) malaria prophylaxis for 300 pregnant women in the highly endemic Tamako area; and (3) some increases in the percentage of mothers possessing antenatal cards. Regular interaction by project staff with other PVOs before and during the project implementation is a positive step in coordinating health and other related activities in a given area.  USAID/Indonesia also deserves credit for establishing the 6-monthly PVO workshop, a mechanism that facilitates this networking process.  Finally, the close, continuing collaboration and enthusiastic support from the MOH at every level (central, provincial, district, subdistrict, village, and community) is perhaps the single most important factor that has contributed to the project's success and potential for sustainability. By ensuring that project objectives and approaches were congruent with those of the MOH, and by working closely with MOH personnel, the project staff and the implementing PVO have provided an example of an efficient, effective, and sustainable CS program. Among lessons learned are that, to be successful, PVO CS projects must:  maintain proactive relations with all stakeholders; develop sustainable, community-based and -supported activities; ensure congruence between project and government objectives; avoid creating a parallel health care delivery system; enable the PVO to function as a change agent; promote interaction between PVOs; and train trainers and provide ongoing refresher education.

"Final evaluation of the Child Survival VII Cameroon Social Marketing Project, implemented by Population Services International (PSI) (9/91-/94). The project's main activities were social marketing of condoms, oral contraceptives, and oral rehydration salts (ORS).  The project covered the 10 most populated urban centers in Cameroon, targeting 515,000 women of reproductive age and 397,000 children under 5 years of age. The project accomplished its target for distributing condoms (16.8 million were distributed in the 3-year period), and thereby the objective of increasing the contraceptive prevalence rate by 3%. Unfortunately, circumstances beyond its control prevented the project from achieving its targets for distributing oral rehydration salts (ORS) and oral contraceptives, and, consequently, from achieving the objective of increasing the use of oral rehydration therapy.  Efforts in these areas were impeded by lengthy delays in obtaining a country agreement between PSI and the Ministry of Health (MOH) and regulatory approval for the sale of ORS and the oral contraceptive (Norminest), as well as by a court seal, imposed by the former subcontractor, of the warehouse in which the commodities are stored. The following lessons were learned.  (1) Although social marketing involves mainly the private sector, the implementing agency needs to establish a good working relationship with the MOH and to obtain its involvement and formal commitment during the project's design.  Also, the implementing agency needs to establish a presence in the host country's capital, which is conducive to a close working relationship with the MOH. (2) In order to provide protection from potential litigation, the MOH needs to be formally involved in contractual agreements as a partner.  (3) Granting of government regulatory approval for pharmaceutical products or its waiver should be included in the USAID bilateral agreement where such products are funded bilaterally. (4) A regional strategy using sales agents based in each province to assist the local wholesalers in marketing and promotion is successful in increasing sales.  (5) Care should be taken in selecting distributors. A monopoly distributor should be avoided. (6) It may be useful to enlist the help of NGOs that have community health projects in order to reach rural areas that are not well served by the commercial distribution network.  (7) Small-scale baseline research should be carried out before a promotional campaign or activity, in order to provide a basis for planning, monitoring, and evaluation of the activity.

"Final evaluation of the Cooperative Arid Lands Agricultural Research II project (CALAR II -- 3/90-3/95), designed to promote peaceful cooperation between Egypt and Israel through multi-disciplinary agricultural research.  San Diego State University Foundation (SDSUF) served as contractor, with major subgrants to the Ministry of Agriculture and Land Reclamation (Egypt) and to Ben-Gurion University of the Negev (Israel).  CALAR II is part of the Middle East Regional Cooperation (MERC) program. The project enhanced the expansion and implementation of protected agriculture in Egypt and Israel while enabling scientists of the two countries to cooperate in their work.  Technical objectives were met regarding the introduction and genetic modification of new crops, agro-management, environmental modification, and structure selection. Though work on post-harvest technical objectives was minimal, both countries have qualified post-harvest physiologists in close contact with experts from other countries. SDSUF managed the program effectively, taking a direct, hands-on interest in the project, much more than required and expected of a project contractor.  The country coordinators and the steering committee were also effective, though a smaller one is recommended. Project-supported annual workshops enhanced cooperation and information transfer between Israeli, Egyptian, and the participating U.S. scientists who played a major role in helping the program succeed.  The final presentations of scientists will be part of a 3/95 International Society of Horticultural Science meeting in Alexandria, Egypt.  This meeting was organized by one of the Egyptian participants and will provide an international forum for project results. CALAR II was successful in expanding scientific cooperation among between Egypt, Israel, and the United States through country visits and the annual workshops.  On a negative note, research took place in parallel projects, structured according to country priorities, with minimal one-to-one collaboration between scientists.  Neither project design nor project management encouraged or rewarded truly collaborative research; hence, none occurred, even though scientists interviewed indicated a desire for it.  In addition, since CALAR I began in FY 82, only one joint research publication between an Israeli and Egyptian scientist has appeared. The momentum gained in improving cooperation and understanding between Israeli and Egyptian scientists through CALAR II should be sustained through follow-on activities. Otherwise, ongoing contact between Egyptian and Israeli scientists will be minimal.  Research sites in both countries will be maintained following CALAR II, but research in Egypt will continue at a reduced level. The following lessons were learned:  (1) Future projects should be specific about output targets.  (2) Whenever possible, future projects should have reciprocal exchanges of scientists and personnel from both countries.  (3) The support of the USAID Mission and the U.S. Embassy enhances the success of MERC projects, which should, when possible, complement Mission priorities.  Onsite monitoring by MERC personnel should help projects meet goals and objectives.  (4) Contractors should be clearly identified as facilitators for evaluation teams.  (5) Future projects should carefully evaluate the amount of travel outside the target countries and the size and role of advisory groups (such as the technical and steering committees).  (6) Project activity between Egyptian and Israeli scientists must be an association among equals throughout the process of planning, implementation, and dissemination of results.  (7) Project funds should be devoted to the maximum extent possible to collaborative research in Egypt and Israel.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","ANE-0158-G-00-0017-00","","3/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Agricultural research|Arid zone|International cooperation|Research collaboration|Applied research","Israel|Egypt|USA","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABR565.pdf","4,154 KB","004307 - Winrock International.

"This report analyzes the findings of 12 PVO child survival (CS) project evaluations regarding the potential sustainability of project activities and of the gains made in CS indicators.  Specific attention is paid to two sustainability strategies -- a PUSH strategy, aimed at motivating the community to seek or demand health services; and a PULL strategy, aimed at strengthening existing services, particularly by training Ministry of Health (MOH) staff.  The PVOs' projects reviewed included those of:  Adventist Development and Relief Agency (ADRA), Indonesia; Andean Rural Health Care (ARHC), Bolivia; International Eye Foundation (IEF), Malawi; Minnesota International Health Volunteers (MIHV), Kenya; Project Concern International (PCI), Guatemala, Bolivia, Indonesia/Riau; PLAN, Mali; World Relief Corporation (WRC), Bangladesh; and World Vision (WV), Bangladesh, Mali, and Haiti.  All projects had been operational through two cycles of CS funding (at least 6 years). The evaluations suggest that sustainable changes in community health behavior can be achieved with a significant investment of time at the community level.  Leaving trained health workers and mothers in each community can create new community norms to protect children's health, particularly in areas such as nutrition and oral rehydration, where minimal external service delivery is needed.  Promoting related CS messages through the media has also been significantly supported.  In sum, these projects have implemented the PUSH strategy for protective health services in a manner likely to be maintained. The evaluations also suggest that the projects have invested the time, training, and resources necessary to develop health services that will PULL individuals in for preventive care.  The difficulties in maintaining this PULL once the external aid and props retreat are many: limited national budgets for health services in general; limited emphasis within health services on preventive rather than curative care; competing recurrent health crises (e.g., cholera or AIDS); frequent transfer of government health personnel; lack of focus on needs of already marginalized groups (urban poor, widely dispersed rural groups, indigenous peoples, etc.); lack of supervision and management techniques among public sector workers; and limited budgets for refresher training of workers.  These problems can be ameliorated by CS projects only in part -- by training MOH staff in technical and managerial issues, and by leaving a strong vocal community demand for services among the needy populations.  Mentioned very little in the evaluations, and an oft-neglected area of PVO CS projects is national-level advocacy, or at least advocacy training of local people in this area.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","FAO-0500-Q-00-3010-00","","6/1/1995 12:00:00 AM","","Child survival activities|Private voluntary organizations|Project sustainability|Development strategies|Community participation|Behavior change|Health professional education|Government departments|Health delivery|Preventive health care|Human capacity development","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNACG015.pdf","1,134 KB","000691 - Johns Hopkins University.
