"Final evaluation of the CLEAN Urban Program (1/98-3/01), designed to increase Indonesian capacity in the area of urban environmental infrastructure. CLEAN Urban's greatest achievement was to adapt successfully to constantly changing circumstances and priorities. In the process, the project facilitated release of a major loan from the World Bank in support of the Social Safety Net program (SSN), and generated numerous proposals for creating jobs.  At the national level, advisers provided extensive policy guidance on decentralization, winning USAID recognition as a donor leader in the field.  At the local level, CLEAN Urban made a significant impact on attitudes to citizen participation in the planning process and put mechanisms in place to facilitate this.  Making these adjustments required considerable ingenuity and close collaboration between USAID and the contractor, but strained the project and blurred its objectives, creating disjunctions between the center and the field and between field components. Shortening the project from 4 to 3 years also undermined institution-building efforts. The participatory planning component achieved major advances in developing a model for strategic urban planning, known as PDPP.  This has since been approved for use by the Ministry of Home Affairs and is being increasingly applied by local governments. In terms of sustainability, CLEAN Urban had greater impact on local residents than on planning officials. The PDPP model, still in its infancy, is heavily focused on participation in planning and has little to say about implementation and management.  Results are not commensurate with the effort involved, and the contribution of the city fora appears marginal. PDPP plans are strong on physical infrastructure, but weaker on strategic issues and do not adequately reflect community concerns regarding health, education, and security.  Although designed to produce medium-term development plans, PDPP is used mainly as an instrument for preparing annual budgets. CLEAN Urban achieved its biggest impact through policy assistance to central government ministries, especially by placing advisors in key departments involved in decentralization. Advisors contributed critical inputs to the SSN program designed to create jobs, and later in support of fiscal and administrative decentralization.  Their assistance resulted in an impressively long list of laws, regulations, and ministerial decrees. Project efforts to link policy assistance at the center with local government capacity building in the field yielded mixed results. Assistance was provided to municipal corporations, but few went far in implementing guidelines. Assistance to local governments with medium-term development planning produced better results, but involved much more effort. Strengthening local capacity requires intensive, extended effort. Although the Padat Karya component never accomplished its ultimate goal of creating many jobs, it succeeded impressively in the more immediate task of rapidly generating proposals for labor-intensive employment in physical infrastructure works.  It also achieved success in recovering small loans made under SSN programs and in recycling them to new borrowers for income-generating activities.  Padat Karya's monitoring of household incomes provided valuable information to SSN planners.  USAID's motive was to create jobs quickly in response to the economic crisis.  But funds materialized late in the day, few jobs were created when they were needed, and many unemployed either went back to rural areas or joined the informal sector.   This suggests two lessons. Since new programs take time to set up, it may be more effective in times of crisis to support programs already in place.  Rather than relying on short- lived infrastructure projects dependent on government, it may be more effective and quicker to support people's own initiatives in running microenterprises. Coordination proved difficult.  The one exception was a highly productive collaboration between CLEAN Urban and Germany's SfDM project which undertook a ground-breaking needs assessment for strengthening local government capacity for decentralization and produced a framework to address these needs. Recommendations were accepted by government, and donors are using the framework as a basis for planning their own activities. Otherwise, there was little interaction with other donor programs, and there is little prospect for such. Coordination with Government of Indonesia (GOI) was plagued by the constant reorganization of GOI agencies that accompanied the quick succession of three new Presidents.  The same was true in the field, compounded by the merger of local government with local offices of the central government. Constant staff turnover undermined efforts to build local capacity.  Within CLEAN Urban itself, effective coordination between the three components -- whose integration into a single whole was circumscribed by the project's use of a performance contract -- was a constant headache.  Despite this, some degree of informal coordination was achieved at the grassroots level.","Task order no.

"In 1993, USAID launched a multi-project environmental program in Russia as part of an international donor ""first-wave"" effort to bolster political and economic support. This report evaluates the impacts of three of those projects: (1) a project to improve Moscow's drinking water by upgrading selected upstream municipal wastewater treatment facilities and industrial enterprises; (2) a project to create a watershed management plan for communities in the Moscow River Basin, aiming to curb runoff (mainly animal waste) from commercial agricultural operations; and (3) a project to improve environmental conditions in industrial Volgograd by developing a model air quality management program.  All three projects were implemented by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA). The evaluation found strong evidence that the wastewater treatment project had very positive impacts on targeted treatment facilities.  The project also strengthened institutions by using a combination of TA, in-country training, equipment transfer, and U.S. professional study tours.  Watershed development activities were much less successful, with the sole exception of developing an environmental curriculum for schools. Finally, the air quality improvement project did not meet its primary goal of implementing a comprehensive air quality program in Volgograd. The lessons learned are that USAID and its implementers must:  (1) assess carefully the potential for upgrading environmental technology in cash-strapped plants; (2) focus more on planning for replicability from the start; (3) use appropriate (not necessarily state-of-the-art) technology; (4) consider the balance between short-term results and long-term sustainability; and (5) collect baseline and other appropriate data to assess project effectiveness.

"Evaluates the Democracy Network (DemNet) program, designed to strengthen Macedonia's NGO sector, for the period 4/95-2/02. The report centers on DemNet ""process"" activities, aimed at helping make new and existing NGOs capable of producing significant development impacts. Participating new NGOs credit DemNet with making their development possible by teaching them what NGOs can do if properly developed and operated.  Most of those visited, however, admitted that they needed more training.  Previously registered NGOs reported a similar experience.  Most operated as loosely organized groups concerned with particular issues such as drug abuse.  DemNet took them to the next level, helping them to organize and operate more efficiently as NGOs. At the sectoral level, Macedonian NGOs are disconnected from each other, each going its own way and rarely sharing with each other or learning from each other.  DemNet attempted to eliminate this isolation through its training, TA, and outreach activities.  DemNet established a network of local trainers (e.g., LEAP/CAP training; NGO development training/TA) that presumably are available to assist new NGOs.  It also produced and disseminated brochures designed to provide a guidebook. Despite these efforts, many of the NGOs visited lamented the sector's enduring competitiveness. The sector as a whole suffers from the general judgment that NGOs are ineffectual in alleviating or eliminating important social problems. Persuasive evaluative documentation of NGO achievement of significant development results will go a long way towards recasting the sector's image.  It will demonstrate that DemNet enabled potent NGO action that indisputably produced important and measurable impacts. Several factors influenced DemNet's implementation. The Kosovar refugee (1999) crisis fueled inter-ethnic tensions, and was followed closely by armed conflict between Albanian rebels and the Macedonian Army/Government.  The negative image of NGOs has had a detrimental impact on support for NGOs.  The proliferation of NGOs in the last decade, many of which were viewed as purely opportunistic, magnified the problem.  Several stakeholders also noted that the weak NGO image has inflamed the traditional NGO/government distrust.  Other problems include the absence of a tradition of volunteerism in Macedonia, the limitations placed on private sector participation by a frail economy, and the hostile fiscal and legal environment facing most NGOs. Lessons learned are that:  (1) sustainability training is ineffective; (2) application of DemNet training is weak; (3) NGOs need to produce and communicate impacts to improve their image; (4) NGO evaluation is inadequate and their communication skills underdeveloped; (5) NGO performance milestones are effective; (6) the media helps amplify affirmative NGO visibility; (7) site visits verify grantee qualifications; (8) coalitions enhance NGO success potential; and (9) collaboration is possible and works. DemNet, the Local Government Reform Project (LGRP), the Community Self Help Initiative (CSHI), and the PRISMA project are all working in communities, seeking to improve conditions in their particular sectors of activity, such as NGO strengthening, small infrastructure development and quality of life improvement, local government capacity, and economic development.  Together, these projects address a wide range of important community development issues in Macedonia and, together, possess a very promising synergy for systematic change in these communities. DemNet NGOs have been prepared to achieve significant impacts, and the time is propitious for them to reach that goal.  The LEAP and CAP projects, for example, need to demonstrate that their partnering arrangements have actually produced their intended, ultimate results. Convincing proof and communication of these results will in due course establish the Macedonia NGO sector as a vital force for essential social change.","Task order no. 805|Evaluation indefinite quantity contract (Evaluation IQC)","Special Evaluation","Documents","AEP-I-00-00-00023-00","","2/1/2002 12:00:00 AM","","Democratization|Indigenous private voluntary organizations|Institution building|Community development|Human capacity development|Networks|Volunteers|Constraints|Public relations|Economic aspects|Political aspects","Macedonia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABW119.pdf","2,401 KB","000436 - Development Associates, Inc.","","010257 - USAID.

"Reports on results of the Girls' Education Activity (GEA), designed to increase girls' access to primary education, in Guatemala, Morocco, and Peru (1996-2001). Proyecto Global in Guatemala had mixed success in implementing the interventions designed to achieve the intermediate results established by USAID.  The project: mobilized regional and local leadership to promote girls' education; broadened local community participation to promote girls' education: and strengthened teacher performance to improve girls' primary school education.  However, little progress on the national level was made beyond the Basic Education Strengthening (BEST) project in strengthening the performance of public and private sector institutions in promoting girls' education; improving knowledge to implement policies, strategies, and programs for girls' education; and mobilizing national leadership to promote girls' education.  As a result, sustained improvements in enrollment and completion rates for girls in primary school are at best localized in El Quiche.  Guatemala's average enrollment and completion rates have not substantially improved since the beginning of Proyecto Global.  This should not be surprising, however, since the Government of Guatemala asked Proyecto Global to limit its geographic focus, and the project focused efforts in El Quiche. The GEA in Morocco successfully implemented interventions to achieve the intermediate results established by USAID.  It has strengthened the performance of public and private sector institutions in promoting girls' education; improved knowledge to implement policies, strategies, and programs for girls' education; mobilized national, regional, and local leadership to promote girls' education; and broadened local community participation to promote girls' education.  USAID Morocco data tracking indicates substantial increases in girls' enrollment in the particular areas where the Mission is providing resources either through GEA or its Morocco Education for Girls (MEG) project.  This data set is too limited to extrapolate to trends in the general population, although the Ministry of Education claims that considerable progress is being made.  It is too early to conclude whether girls' completion rates for primary school have improved substantially.  If GEA/Morocco is judged on the success of its agendas at the national and local levels, substantial progress has been made in each of the six project tasks (policy legitimization, building constituencies, realigning and mobilizing resources, designing and modifying organizational structures, mobilizing action, and monitoring systemic change). There is no question that project activities have raised awareness about the problems associated with rural girls' education nationally and within the local pilot areas. GEA has directly affected the level and tenor of national discourse on girls' education and has been instrumental in consolidating a varied constituency that is actively engaged in advancing reform at all levels. In Peru, the New Horizons project has successfully implemented interventions to achieve the intermediate results established by USAID. It has strengthened the performance of public and private sector institutions in promoting girls' education; improved knowledge to implement policies, strategies, and programs for girls' education; mobilized national, regional, and local leadership to promote girls' education; broadened local community participation to promote girls' education; and strengthened teacher performance to improve girls' primary school education.  It is too early to say whether these efforts have led to sustained improvements in enrollment and completion rates for girls in primary school.  Preliminary information indicates that Peru has made measurable progress in these national goals since the beginning of the project.  New Horizons/Peru has made substantial progress in each of the six project tasks.  It has raised awareness about the problems associated with rural girls' education and has raised the issue to the national level. The most important factors determining the success of a girls' education project are the people and organizations that take leadership roles.  In addition, three key factors affect GEA's ability to influence systematic change on behalf of girls' education:  (1) tailoring the approach to the political context; (2) linking change at the local, regional, and national Levels; and (3) maximizing in-country control over project activities.

"Evaluates project to develop a sustainable program to provide orthopedic assistance to Mozambicans disabled by civil war and its lingering after effects -- landmines.  Evaluation covers the period 1998-4/02. In 1998, as a result of the establishment of a new unit within the Ministry of Health (MISAU), the Section of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (SMFR), and recommendations made in a USAID-sponsored evaluation, the program's focus shifted from direct involvement in the management and administration of rehabilitation services to providing TA, long-term training opportunities and support to indigenous disability advocacy groups, with Prosthetic and Orthotic Worldwide Education and Relief (POWER) serving as contractor.  The orthoprosthetic rehabilitation centers became the direct responsibility of the provincial and district hospitals in which they were located, and oversight was to be provided by the SMFR. Since that reorganization, the quality and quantity of prosthetic and orthotic services has rapidly declined. Production in the four main orthopedic centers has dropped by more than 51%.  In the year 2000, only 309 prostheses were produced in the country, despite a conservative production capacity of more than 1,000 devices per year.  The quality of fittings and workmanship has taken an equally startling turn for the worse.  Orthopedic services are the responsibility of the MISAU, but they are given lower priority within the ministry compared with other important preventative and curative health issues.  As a result, little interest is paid to these programs and scant resources are allocated for them. The challenges facing the rehabilitation sector in Mozambique are not unique.  Although the MISAU must continue to play a crucial role in this health issue and service, orthoprosthetics will never be cost-effective enough for the government to absorb within its current health budget and manage within its existing structure.  A number of alternative management, administrative, and financial structures have been attempted in other African countries.  Several of the more successful options are based on public-private sector partnerships and oversight boards outside of the day-to-day management structure.  It is incumbent upon the MISAU to conduct a controlled pilot program to examine the potential benefits of these models.","Project title: Displaced Children and Orphans Fund (DCOF) and|Patrick J.

"Evaluates Phase II of a cooperative agreement with Michigan State University (MSU) to improve food security policy and management in developing countries, especially Africa -- the Food Security (FS) II project.  Second interim evaluation covers the period 12/96-12/01. FS II has been successful.  It has met its output and deliverable targets, contributed significantly to the achievement of project goals and objectives, and is recognized and appreciated broadly in the field and within USAID/Washington. One of the most important elements of FS II is the expansion and improvement of the knowledge base on FS policy issues.  Respondents generally had positive views of FS II's work in this regard, especially its descriptive and survey work.  FS II also expanded and improved the knowledge base on cross-country FS issues.  While the overwhelming response to FS II's work in these areas was positive, there was some criticism, principally from the academic community.  These criticisms should be considered in designing any future project. For FS II to succeed, its findings must be communicated to public, private, and donor policy- and decision makers.  The majority of reviews on this topic were positive, virtually all agreeing that the policy synthesis series has been well done and is quite useful.  Besides noting the timeliness and effectiveness of country-level policy briefs and policy synthesis papers, respondents valued the participatory forums and the benefits of the project's price information activities, specific market and price publications, and bulletins.  Respondents also commented on the usefulness of the project's website. FS II needs to be able to monitor and report on the people-level impact of any given FS strategy.  While response to the question on this activity was less universal, a number of examples of this type of work were given.  One example was the impact report on the devaluation of the CFA Franc.  Others commented on the role FS II had in improving survey design and in managing surveys to improve existing or new monitoring programs. Some respondents also viewed the market price information work as an important monitoring activity. In general, both the respondents and the assessment team itself believe that the project has been successful in capacity building.  The project has provided long-term training to scores of participants and short-term training to hundreds more.  In addition, the on-the-job interaction with MSU staff has been invaluable.  Capacity building, while not perfect, has been an important project output. Respondents were generally positive regarding project efforts to establish and maintain African and U.S. institutional memory, but their responses were a bit less detailed than were their responses to other questions.  Many noted the collaboration between African and U.S. researchers as an important element in developing institutional memory. Another point made several times was that senior advisors and managers in the food security activities in Africa, both in the private and public sector, were trained under the FS II project.  Yet another point made several times is that the FS II project, through its publications, data bases, and website, is a storehouse of information on FS issues not only for the project, but within Africa as a whole.  Finally, a few respondents noted that institutional memory on African FS issues has been supported by the longevity of the program. Participants both in the field and in USAID/Washington believed that the technical teams supporting the project are very good.  They are knowledgeable, committed, and respected within both the USAID and the African community. Training at a graduate level, in short-courses and on-the-job was also generally well received.  One of the most important project inputs is that MSU has made a long-term institutional commitment to the activities within FS II.","Project title: Food security II","Special Evaluation","Documents","PCE-A-00-97-00044-00","","3/1/2002 12:00:00 AM","","Food security|Food policy|Universities and colleges|Policy analysis|Human capacity development|Graduate education|Agricultural economics|Agricultural research|Management development|Publications|Websites","Africa south of Sahara","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABW206.pdf","66 KB","000779 - Michigan State University.

"Final Mission report on a Special Objective (SpO) program (9/99-12/01) to mitigate the impact of Hurricane Mitch in Central America. Achievements for intermediate result (IR) 1 -- to establish a framework for sound transnational watershed management -- were as follows:  (1) A state-of-the-art forecast system for the transnational Rio Lempa watershed is fully functional.  (2) A joint management plan that identifies geographic and thematic priorities among a broad spectrum of stakeholders and lays out a tri-national program with institutional arrangements for disaster mitigation, natural resources management, and improved livelihoods along the watershed was implemented.  (3) Subsystems including meteorological data rescue, coordination of meteorological institutions, a geographic information system, and an accumulated rainfall model have been put in place. Under IR 2 -- to develop regional guidelines and standards to reduce road network vulnerability to natural disasters -- manuals for road construction, road maintenance, standards for road signs and for geometric design of roads, and limits to weights and dimensions of vehicles were produced.  The manuals have been distributed to transport ministries in all five Mitch-affected countries (Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica), as well as to national and international institutions. Achievements under the IR to upgrade the capacity of the Costa Rican education system in selected communities affected by Mitch-related Nicaraguan migration were as follows:  (1) The project built 260 new and repaired 120 classrooms, converted 2 classrooms into computer laboratories, and built 55 and repaired 2 sanitary units.  (2) The project purchased 56,000 sets of teaching materials and distributed them to 310 schools for use by 36,000 students, and distributed 15 TVs, 15 VCRs, and 15 overhead projectors.  (3) Inservice training was provided to 1,665 teachers from 326 schools; 207 schools participated in remedial education activities for 7,110 students, of which 30% were Nicaraguan immigrants.  (4) Adult literacy programs were established in 200 schools and enrolled 4,200 adults. Achievements under the IR to strengthen regional policies that reduce energy system vulnerabilities to disasters -- were as follows:  (1) Emergency energy plans were drafted for El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua.  (2) The project helped create Regional Power Operator to facilitate regional interconnection issues and developed transitional regulations and procedures for regional energy interconnection.  (3) The project benefitted 2,045 families with new service either to the grid or renewable energy sources and installed 97 photovoltaic systems (81 in Nicaragua and 16 in Guatemala). The foundation for the Rio Lempa Forecast Center's sustainability under IR 1 lies in the tri-national agreement signed 1/02.  That agreement is a basin-wide strategic plan for tri-national collaboration in watershed management and disaster mitigation. The sustainability of road vulnerability investments is assured by the success of the original five studies and manuals (with work on three additional manuals underway); the ministries of transport and communications in the region are treating this area as a high priority.  The Costa Rican Ministry of Education considers the investments in education under IR 3 to be very successful, much needed, and has put them to immediate use.  Their maintenance and care is assured given the high level of importance vested in both the infrastructure and the supporting training and educational materials developed to assist migrant assimilation. Finally, work in all three areas related to energy investments is sufficiently advanced that sustaining the efforts is very likely. Energy sharing and energy sector restructuring, including emergency planning to reduce vulnerability, will be continued by countries in the region. Also, under USAID/G-CAP, similar interventions will take place in the region following Mitch reconstruction. The benefit of policy reform to promote energy sharing was experienced first hand in El Salvador following that country's twin earthquakes in early 2001.  Stepping back from that progress at this time is unlikely.  Similarly, renewable energy sources put in place are viewed as a model for continued advancement in this area. Lessons learned are detailed at the SpO and IR levels.","Included as annex 1: Final [quarterly] report, March 2002 (no. 10)|Guatemala activity completion report: PD-ABW-331|Project title: Program to upgrade the capacity of the Costa Rican|educational system in selected communities affected by Hurricane|Mitch-related Nicaraguan migration|Project title: Strengthening regional policies that reduce energy|system vulnerabilities to disasters","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","1/1/2002 12:00:00 AM","","Disaster recovery|Cyclones|Natural resource management|Watersheds|International cooperation|Road transportation|Disaster vulnerability analysis|International migrations|Educational delivery|Educational materials|Teacher training|Building construction|Classrooms|Road construction|Manuals and handbooks|Procedural development|Literacy instruction|Adult education|Sector policy|Strategic planning|Energy supply|Coordinating|Project sustainability|Disaster mitigation","Central America|Costa Rica|El Salvador|Nicaragua|Guatemala|Honduras","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABW336.pdf","155 KB","009384 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of the Hurricane Georges Recovery Program (HGRP) in Haiti (1999-2001). Overall, the Pan American Development Foundation (PADF), the prime grantee, and its partners overwhelming met the majority of HGRP objectives and targets.  (Due to the difficulty of evaluating the efforts of the three participating U.S. federal agencies -- the Army Corps of Engineers, the Department of Agriculture, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency -- USAID/Haiti decided that the evaluation team would not include their HGRP activities in this report.)   For details on project achievements, see the abstract of the final impact study (PN-ACP- 634). Lessons learned included the following:  (1) The performance monitoring plan (PMP) provided HGRP implementation partners solid guidelines for establishing objectives and targets quickly.  (2) USAID's cooperative agreement with PADF required the submission of quarterly progress reports.  PADF incorporated this concept into its own agreements with each of the grantees and contractors, thereby reinforcing accountability by each organization.  (3) Working with community-based organizations (CBOs) accelerated the extension of improved soil and water conservation measures to the communities, as the CBO core staff already had a good degree of credibility in the community and were often already trained in most of the conservation measures. (4) Strong and efficient CBOs have popular support and are better able to inform their communities of the benefits of improved seeds and soil and water conservation practices and can promote their adoption.  (5) The ""3-2-1 Formula"" for community labor was a success in developing community spirit, teaching basic construction skills to rural men and women, adding money to CBO coffers, teaching NGO and CBO leaders the principles of management, and encouraging a community spirit and self-reliance among participants.

"Evaluates the Partnership for Economic Growth (PEG) project, designed to promote economic reform in Indonesia. Interim evaluation covers the period 10/98-3/02, against a PACED of 10/02.  An extension of the project to 6/03 is under discussion. PEG provides TA to various Indonesian ministries and agencies, namely, National Development Planning Agency (BAPPENAS), the Office of the Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs (EKUIN), the Ministry of Finance (MOF), the Ministry of Industry and Trade (MOIT), and Bank of Indonesia (BOI).  In addition, PEG implements a partnership grant program that encourages the development of long-term linkages between U.S. institutions and counterpart groups within Indonesia. In spite of the trying conditions in Indonesia over the past few years, the PEG project has admirably achieved its objectives.  The PEG team, which includes TA advisors, Government of Indonesia (GOI) counterparts, and USAID personnel, should be commended for its professionalism and dedication.  Undeniably, PEG's support of five GOI ministries has contributed appreciably to the GOI embarking upon stronger economic policies and its willingness to implement practices associated with increased openness.  Indeed, PEG's collaboration with BAPPENAS on fiscal sustainability, investment, and labor issues has contributed to a more refined macroeconomic framework, a better investment climate, and an acute awareness of the need to balance employment growth with other pressing social demands.  Similarly, PEG's recent assistance to EKUIN and the MOF was instrumental in conveying to the GOI the importance of freezing terrorist assets and adopting tough money-laundering legislation.  By the same token, PEG's cooperation with MOIT promotes Indonesia's competitiveness by building the ministry's capacity to advance market access, foster regional trade arrangements, and reduce internal and external trade barriers.  Finally, PEG's help on small business development for the BOI through assistance in regulatory and financial services as well as earlier project support to improve analytical proficiency in macroeconomic modeling, inflation analysis and forecasting, and exchange rate analysis resulted in more effective institutional capacity. On the down side is the deficient quality of the contractor's required annual reports and annual workplans.  In some cases, this documentation was not prepared.  No workplan has been produced to cover project activities from January 2001 forward, nor has an annual report been completed for the past year.  In other cases, the reports lacked analysis, recommendations, and cohesion against the project objectives and resource allocation.  Moreover, except for the 1999 report, annual reports were predominantly compiled from individual team member reports and did not include a comprehensive review of the PEG project, indicate whether the project was collectively meeting its objectives, or provide historic and prospective financial appraisal of the use of available project resources. The absence of quality annual reports does a disservice to the PEG team, since these reports are the ones that external reviewers and the public at large first consult to determine whether a project has met the wide-ranging and complex objectives mandated under the terms of its contract. Recommendations to remedy the project's deficiencies are made.

"Evaluates the US-Asia Environmental Partnership (US- AEP), designed to address the serious environmental problems in Asia.  Interim evaluation covers the period 1992-2002. In its early years, US-AEP focused on establishing a recognized presence in Asia.  In 1997, promoting a ""clean revolution"" in Asia became the program goal, with a focus on public policy and environmental regulations, urban environmental management, industrial environmental performance, and the transfer of U.S. environmental technology to Asian countries. US-AEP has been cost-effective and a model for USAID advancement of its environmental goal.  To date, US-AEP has:  (1) helped broaden awareness of the need to address Asia's environmental problems; (2) pointed up the need to target assistance on specific environmental problems; (3) established a network of partners in both Asia and the United States capable of working effectively towards solving Asia's environmental problems; (4) established a flexible management structure to ensure effective implementation and coordination of program efforts at the regional and country levels; (5) contributed significantly to U.S. sales of U.S. environmental technologies; and (6) matched over 700 Asian firms with U.S. exporters. US-AEP has formed 195 U.S.-Asia partnerships to date.  Through its partnership with the Council of State Governments (CSG), 36 projects have been undertaken involving 23 states and 110 state agencies. Through its partnership with the National Association of State Development Agencies (NASDA), US- AEP has provided small matching grants to small- and medium-sized U.S. firms to market their environmental goods and services in Asia.  Program grants have generated over $350 million in export revenues.  The Environmental Exchange Program (EEP), funded by US-AEP and administered by the Institute for International Education (IIE), has facilitated meetings, tours, and information exchanges for 4,223 Asian and American decisionmakers. US-AEP regional and field-level accomplishments include: establishment of a Regional Environmental Center for Livestock Waste Management in Taiwan; the Water Efficiency Team (WET) project in Indonesia, which has enabled more than 370,000 community residents to receive piped water; a project to improve air quality in Chang Mai, Thailand; promotion of technology export opportunities for U.S. firms related to the Asian Development Bank-funded $175 million Pasig River Rehabilitation Project; and passage of a clean air act in the Philippines. US-AEP has approached development assistance in two new ways.  One has been to tie development to U.S. exports in order to incorporate environmentally beneficial U.S. technologies into Asia's burgeoning stock.  The second has been to create partnerships to promote sustainable development beyond the reach and longevity of development assistance programs.  The achievements cited above attest to the extent to which the US-AEP partnership approach has been effective in achieving these results.  The approach has been particularly effective in facilitating interaction between public and private entities, in making arrangements for broad-based participation in conferences and workshops, and in expediting the replication across country lines of successful activities, such as the regulatory dialogue and country efforts to phase out leaded gasoline. The decision by Department of Commerce (DOC) to terminate its participation in US-AEP as of 9/02 has disrupted the emergence of the kind of institution that will be critically needed over the next several decades to address the serious environmental problems currently emerging in Asia. It is recommended that the US-AEP program remain within the management structure of the ASIA Near East (ANE) Regional Bureau; more specifically, that the ANE Bureau establish one or more regional US-AEP offices in Asia to directly supervise contract and local staff and to continue to improve coordination of the program with related efforts in the region.","Task order no. 05|Evaluation indefinite quantity contract (Evaluation IQC)","Special Evaluation","Documents","AEP-I-00-00-00023-00","","6/1/2002 12:00:00 AM","","Environmental management|Partnerships|Public sector|Private sector|Environmental technologies|Environmental policy|Policy reform|Regulatory reform|Urban areas|Industrial facilities|Technology transfer|Grants|Exports|Educational exchanges","Asia|Southeast Asia|Taiwan|Indonesia|Thailand|Philippines","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABW493.pdf","1,771 KB","000436 - Development Associates, Inc.","","004200 - USAID.

"PACR of USAID/El Salvador's Hurricane Mitch Activity (6/99-9/01). The project closed well ahead of schedule at the end of FY 2001, having achieved a number of impressive results in four areas, as noted below. First, USAID helped El Salvador's economy to recover in the Mitch areas most affected.  Over 5,500 Mitch-affected farmers received agricultural inputs and TA in soil preparation, along with training in planting, management, harvesting, and marketing strictly via organic methods, planting 2,297 hectares with high-value crops. Second, USAID restored and expanded access to basic community services. A total of 51 small infrastructure projects were carried out, including shelters in schools, dispensaries, bridges, and small rural roads, benefitting 79,250 persons in 182 communities; local communities participated most enthusiastically.  In addition, some 500 homes were built, reaching 3,000 persons in 33 communities and using design standards aimed at mitigating the effects of flooding and other natural disasters.  Also, 79 schools were repaired or rebuilt and another 4 were re-equipped, helping 212 communities and nearly 19,000 students; beneficiary communities donated construction materials, equipment, and labor.  Further, 4,500 replacement desks were delivered to 59 schools and 420 solar panels were installed in 198 community facilities. Sanitary seals and hand pumps were provided for 1,146 wells, providing water services to over 9,500 individuals; 5,342 latrines were built; and 13 potable water systems were put in place serving over 23,000 residents; and community health education was provided.  Local water committees were established and community members trained to provide for sustainability. A total of 136 KM of rural roads were repaired, benefitting more than 176,000 people; also, 205 KM of electrical distribution lines benefitting nearly 6,000 families were put in place. Principal partners included:  for potable water, CARE, with the local NGO CALMA furnishing related education; for rural roads, the General Directorate of Highways of the Ministry of Public Work (MOP); for electrical distribution lines, the Rural Electrification Unit within the Technical Secretariat for External Financing (SETEFE) of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs; and, for all other activities, the Cooperative Housing Foundation (CHF). Third, the Mission, working again with CHF, provided a multi-faceted program in improved environmental management, focusing on the affected Lempa and Grande de San Miguel flood plains.  Conservation activities were carried out in 36 micro-watersheds with the total area reached by such activities amounting to 197 hectares. Activities in solid waste management focused on 10 communities and included community-led marches, campaigns, and clean ups, emphasizing at least in part the dengue epidemic.  A total of 533 hectares were re- forested, including 297 hectares from trees produced in community tree nurseries.  Roughly 3,200 people received training in environmental management. Finally, to help prepare the country for future natural disasters, 3,015 community members (48% of them women) received training in disaster vulnerability, disaster preparedness, and implementation of early warning systems.  Emergency committees charged with producing disaster preparedness plans were established in 118 communities, which also received workshops in the areas of first aid, rescue techniques, shelter management, and methodologies for the evaluation of damage and needs. Further, 36 hectares of environmental risk mitigation work was carried out in the Municipality of Berlin; its community was most proactive in its support of the initiative, providing equipment. Twelve municipal emergency plans were reviewed and improved, and 146 disaster preparedness trainers were trained.  An important focus of disaster mitigation work was the strengthening of emergency management systems at the departmental, municipal, and community levels through the provision of equipment and training.  Finally, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) developed a master flood control plan for the Lempa and Rio Grande de San Miguel watersheds, comprising specific initiatives for 12 municipalities. Other sections of the report discuss Mission efforts to ensure program sustainability, improve host country capability to resist corruption and improve transparency and accountability, along with the coordination of the program at both the donor and U.S. government agency levels.  Lessons learned are detailed in the areas of disaster mitigation, community participation, accountability, implementing partners, contracting, and cost-sharing.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","6/1/2002 12:00:00 AM","","Disaster reconstruction|Cyclones|Economic recovery|Community services|Environmental management|Natural resource conservation|Disaster preparedness|Human capacity development|Community self help|Disaster planning|Project sustainability|Political corruption|Donor coordination|Private voluntary organizations|Indigenous private voluntary organizations","El Salvador","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABW568.pdf","44 KB","008540 - USAID.

"Summative evaluation of a project to increase girls' attainment in basic literacy and education in Malawi (GABLE project, 1991-2001). GABLE, particularly as extended/amended, achieved its objectives of creating a policy environment for sustainable and effective schools and classroom practice while putting into wider practice innovative and effective interventions at the community level.  GABLE contributed very positively to achieving the strategy and objectives of strategic objective (SO) 4 and had a significant impact on its intermediate results.  Specific findings are noted below. Educational quality.  (1) Teachers trained under GABLE practice what they have learned; teaching is characteristically more interactive and more creative than in non- GABLE schools; teachers value their training immensely, have more confidence in their professional activity, and desire to receive more such formation.  (2) The school cluster system and the mentor teacher program, developed in the Quality Education through Supporting Training (QUEST) (sub)project; are among the most successful components of GABLE; support to institutionalize these local support systems is necessary for sustained classroom reform.  (3) Pupil performance at standards 1-4 of the GABLE-targeted schools has been enhanced by 20%, as proposed, in mathematics and Chichewa, less in English reading comprehension.  (4) The rate of pupil dropout has decreased by about the 10% projected in every district and at each standard in GABLE-associated schools; the targeted 10% reduction in the pupil repetition rate was not achieved because of the increased attention given by teachers to pupil adequate performance and readiness for promotion.  (5) The institutional partnerships established within GABLE have been highly productive in researching avenues (e.g., continuous assessment, gender-appropriate curricula) for enhancing the literacy and numeracy teaching strategies at standards 1-4. Community involvement.  (1) GABLE has responded directly and successfully to the strategy of involving communities in school construction, supervision, and management through its training and support program for school committees, parent-teacher associations (PTAs), and community leaders; the contribution of Creative Associates International (CAII) and the Creative Center for Community Mobilization (CRECCOM) to this process was outstanding. (2) Community training has been successful, though the level of community participation in school improvement varies.  More systematic support, facilitation, and monitoring of community practices in school involvement are required for this result to be sustained. Also, there is a risk that if expectations are not met within a reasonable amount of time, local communities will become frustrated and discouraged.  (3) A strategic plan with measurable performance indicators is needed to measure the overall effectiveness of CRECCOM activities; a management information system (MIS) is also needed.  CRECCOM has placed too much emphasis on process and inputs. Gender equity.  (1) GABLE has enhanced the Government of Malawi's commitment to girls' education and fostered educational policy reforms, culminating in the incorporation of gender equity throughout the Policy Investment Framework (PIF).  (2) GABLE has created a conducive and enabling environment for learning among boys and girls via its Social Mobilization Campaign (SMC) and SMC-Education Quality (EQ) activities. (3) Major attitudinal changes towards girls and their education under SMC and SMC-EQ have led to increased access for girls, abridging the gender gap in primary education, reducing dropouts, and improving performance.  (4) A GABLE special unit developed gender-appropriate primary education curriculum for use in standards; these training materials and the training of educators in their use have all improved the learning environment for girls.  (5) Nonetheless, some gender disparities remain; there are still fewer girls in the higher standards of primary education as well as in secondary schools overall, and there continues to be fewer female teachers. Role of government.  (1) The government and its concerned ministries at the central, divisional, district, and zonal levels have successfully appropriated ownership of GABLE.  (2) The ongoing awareness, support, and collaboration of the senior administrators and professional staff of these ministries have greatly facilitated GABLE implementation.  (c) The Ministry of Education, Science, and Technology (MOEST) has successfully developed the PIF, established a Planning Unit, and installed an education monitoring information systems (EMIS) for assessing the strategic policies of GABLE. A total of 22 lessons are detailed regarding the sensitization, orientation, and participation of stakeholders and program/project objectives, activities, and management.","Contract listed on document as OUT-HNE-I-802-00-00075-00-00","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","OUT-HNE-I-802-00-00075-00|HNE-I-00-00-00075-00","","5/1/2002 12:00:00 AM","","Access to education|Equity|Girls|Literacy instruction|Basic education|Strategic objectives|Educational policy|Educational reform|Educational delivery|Educational innovations|Teacher training|Student performance|School dropouts|Community participation|Educational materials|Curriculum design|Management information systems|Development program monitoring|Host country cooperation|Government departments|Gender analysis|Partnerships|Public awareness|Attitude change|Quality of education","Malawi","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABW640.pdf","468 KB","008360 - Mitchell Group, Inc.","","008573 - USAID.

"Evaluates project to increase children's access to high-quality basic education (QUEST project), implemented by Save the Children Federation (SCF)/US in the Districts of Mangochi, Balaka, and Blantyre Rural, Malawi.  No evaluation period is provided. Overall, SC/US has achieved its central aim -- to decentralize action to improve the quality of education at the zone, cluster,  and school level -- and has for the most part achieved its targets for enhancing the access, quality, and efficiency of primary education in the three target districts.  QUEST has also contributed substantially to the Mission's strategic objective (SO) 4 strategy and its two intermediate results, and to the goals of the Ministry of Education, Science, and Technology's (MOEST's) revised sector strategy as presented in the Policy Investment Framework (PIF).  Specific results are noted below. (1) MOEST officials at all levels are keenly aware of QUEST and strongly support it.  At non-central levels, education officials are directly involved in implementation by advising and monitoring activities and by administering the QUEST Fund.  (2) Thirty-three new community schools have been established with enrollments of 11,387 pupils, 69% of the target of 16,500.  Construction is 64% complete.  (3) QUEST-trained teachers practice what they learn in classrooms.  Teaching in QUEST schools is characteristically more interactive and more creative than in non-QUEST schools.  Teachers value QUEST training enormously, have more confidence as a result, and would like to participate in even more training. (4) The teaching of literacy and numeracy, though improved, does not maximize pupils' opportunities to apply new skills and concepts and rarely provides opportunities for creative thinking, self-initiated learning, and problem-solving. Exploring novel and effective ways to enhance the teaching and learning of literacy and numeracy in primary classrooms is critical. (5) It should not be assumed that teachers can develop adequate learning environments simply as a result of training.  Some materials are required over and beyond those that can be produced locally, particularly for literacy enhancement.  (6) Avenues for supplying materials that can be used for teaching need to be explored further. (7) Teachers are knowledgeable about continuous assessment, but their ability to use such information to guide their day-to-day practices and to engage pupil responsibility in learning needs to be strengthened. (8) The School Cluster System (SCS) and Mentor Teacher Program (MTP) are among QUEST's most successful components and should be institutionalized.  (9) Community training has been successful, though community involvement in school improvement varies. More systematic support, facilitation, and monitoring of community practices in school involvement is required for this result to be sustained. (10) The target of 20% gain in pupil performance was met in the first 2 years of the project for the majority of subjects in standards 1-4. This should be taken as, overall, successful achievement of the performance indicator for school quality.  With the exception of standard 4 Chichewa, after 2 years, pupils in QUEST schools outperformed those in non-QUEST schools in mathematics, Chichewa (words in passages), and English (words in passages).  (11) The rate of pupil dropout decreased in all QUEST districts for standards 1-4 over the first 2 years of the project, with the targeted 10% reduction in pupil dropout approximated in standard 1 and 2 for Balaka and Blantyre Rural. Results for the final year of QUEST will not be obtainable until 2003.  (12) The integrated curriculum pilot study showed that this method effected a performance advantage for Chichewa and mathematics, but not English. (13) QUEST's partnership with the Malawi Institute of Education (MIE) and the Improving Education Quality (IEQ) project/Malawi has been extremely productive. Encouragement of these partnerships to enhance literacy and numeracy teaching strategies in junior primary schools is advised.  (13) QUEST accomplishments are not considered sustainable at this time.  It would be premature to discontinue the support to the districts until more sustainable reform is achieved.  Two avenues for effecting sustained change include:  (a) enhancing and institutionalizing the SCS and MTP and linking these system to Malawi's current and future teacher education programs; and (b) further enhancing community participation until a measure of sustained involvement is achieved. A total of 28 lessons learned are detailed in five areas: the sensitization and orientation of stakeholders; the training of teachers, parents, and local leaders; the supervision of teachers; the QUEST Term Plan/Initiative program; and the construction of village-based schools and housing for teachers.","Contract listed on document as OUT-HNE-I-802-00-00075-00-00","Special Evaluation","Documents","OUT-HNE-I-802-00-00075-00|HNE-I-00-00-00075-00","","4/1/2002 12:00:00 AM","","Access to education|Literacy instruction|Basic education|Primary education|Educational reform|Educational administration|Decentralization|Educational delivery|Educational innovations|Teacher training|Building construction|Student performance|School dropouts|Community participation|Educational materials|Curriculum design|Mentoring|Government departments|Partnerships|Project sustainability|Private voluntary organizations|Quality of education","Malawi","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABW641.pdf","301 KB","008360 - Mitchell Group, Inc.","","008573 - USAID.

"Evaluates program implemented by Save the Children (SC) to improve the health and welfare of children (especially girls) living and working on the streets in Indonesia's urban areas.  The program operates in four cities -- Jakarta, Surabaya, Medan, and Bandung -- through subgrants to 39 NGOs.  Interim evaluation covers the period 8/00-5/02. Almost 2 years into a 3-year project, no clear successful strategy has emerged as a means to improve the health and welfare of street children.  The slow start and the lack of attention by SC leadership delayed progress.  Only the personal determination of the project director and her staff, as well as USAID's ultimately forceful intervention, have created the impetus to move this grant forward. It is unclear whether the children being helped are those most in need.  Two different types of children are involved.  For older children, few viable alternatives for living on the street or for improving the conditions and prospects for children working in the street are evident in SC's program thus far.  Living alternatives are largely limited to sleeping at drop-in centers or shipping children off to orphanages maintained by religious groups. Vocational training programs are small, poorly developed, and lack connections with real employment opportunities.  The business sector is almost completely absent from the picture.  This difficulty is especially true with regard to programs for older girls.  Younger children (under 14) pose a different problem. In Indonesia, the trend toward a higher percentage of younger street children and younger girls being pushed by their families to work on the street for economic reasons is not addressed by the intermediate results section of the proposal. Those children make up more than 75% of the children being served by SC's partners.  The majority of those younger children live at home and depend on their parents for food.  Still, they are vulnerable and are being exploited. Solutions that aim to ""fix the child"" through counseling, vocational training, and ""alternative living arrangements"" are not appropriate for this growing group of younger children.  Creative community-based solutions are needed to prevent the younger children from being exploited by their families and communities. The large number of small NGOs requires inordinate amounts of TA for institutional strengthening, while the long-term prospects for their survival as NGOs are weak. There are some positive experiences on which to build, but the next steps, involving analysis of what works and what does not, as well as strong criteria for those choices, will be critical in the next phase.  Community mobilization is repeatedly cited as a central strategy, but it was omitted from the project design.  Although SC encouraged prospective recipients to include community mobilization strategies in their proposals, few did so. Highlights of SC's strengths include the following:  (1) The current staff members clearly are well qualified and well respected, and the staff seems well equipped to move into the next phase of development.

"PACR of a project (12/99-2/01) to increase public awareness of the need for education reform in Guatemala. The project's greatest accomplishment and contribution was the production and dissemination of a CD-ROM with the PowerPoint presentation titled: ""Educacion por Todos: Llegaremos a Donde Queremos Llegar?""  This presentation updates and expands a PowerPoint presentation titled, ""Aprendiendo, Desarrollamos Nuestra Guatemala"" originally produced in diskettes and overheads under the Policy Dialogue component of the Mission's Basic Education Strengthening (BEST) project in 1997. The CD-ROM contains several prefabricated presentations, varying in length and designed for specific audiences such as educators, researchers, NGO leaders, press corps, elected officials in the executive and legislative branches of government, or private sector leaders.  Each presentation is programmed with automation effects and speakers' notes.  Dissemination of the CD was broad and included national, international, public, private, and NGO leaders. Tangible, immediate contributions of the communication tool include several examples of increased awareness, discussion, and support for education reform: effective use by commercial leaders to persuade the National Advertising Council to focus a national 20-year campaign on education as the number one priority in Guatemala; use by the leading civil society organization (CSO) alliance (Gran Campana por la Educacion) to lobby for increased financing for education sector; use of data by education leaders, the Government of Guatemala/Ministry of Education (GOG/MOE), and CSOs resulting in increased press coverage; use by the USAID/Management Systems International (MSI) policy reform support activity in training sessions on policy and stakeholder analysis among selected CSOs. A second project contribution is the audience assessment, key findings were disseminated to partners, including the MOE and the Consultitave Commission for Educational Reform (CCRE) via formal presentations, and the executive summary of the final report was forwarded to all respondents.  These findings are as follows:  (1) Consensus among interviewees that the current state of education is poor and that the sector requires ""investment"" in order to improve.  (2) A general perception that reform of the education system is urgently needed, but there is not consensus on the Parity Commission's Education Reform Design on the ""how-to"".  (3) The public needs information on what education reform actually is and how it relates to citizens' daily lives before attitudes about it will improve (participants emphasized the need for information dissemination, dialogue, and consensus before society at large will endorse reform and participate.  (4) Informational material should be mostly visual, be distributed locally, use testimonials as a medium, and be culturally appropriate.  (5) The CCRE is believed capable of leading a communications strategy directed at decisionmakers and is well-suited because it is at the margins of political interests.  (6) More information is needed as to what intercultural education is and how it works.  (7) Achieving gender equity is believed to be important, though more conservative respondents considered it less important than other aspects of reform. Includes lessons learned regarding project replicability and sustainability and the design and implementation of new activities.

"Final evaluation of the Sudan Transitional Assistance for Rehabilitation (STAR) program (1998-2002), designed to increase participatory development and good governance practices in opposition-held areas in Sudan while reducing the frequently heavy reliance on relief. STAR encompassed four components:  grant making/capacity building, a microfinance program; civil administration training; strategic analysis/capacity building, aimed at the agricultural and natural resource management sectors; and social organizations and rehabilitation (SOAR), designed to improve the role of law, reconstruct school facilities, and improve health administration in southern and eastern Sudan. STAR was generally successful in achieving its objectives, helping to establish a basic framework of local governance and creating awareness on the part of senior public administrators of the need for accountability and transparency in managing and monitoring budgeting and accounting.  But STAR also showed the difficulties inherent in launching a relief to development transition program without first ensuring the existence of a competent and well-trained civil authority to implement it, and an enabling environment. The creation of county development committees (CDCs) was a step forward in increasing civilian participation in community-level administration, rehabilitation, and small-scale economic development programs.  Another step forward was the establishment of the Development Assistance Technical Team by the Sudanese People's Liberation Movement (SPLM) to serve as a catalyst in mobilizing resources from development partners and in working with them to reduce the area's heavy dependence on relief while increasing donor support for productive economic activities. The difficulties encountered by the CDCs in managing microfinance programs indicate that they were more suited to analyzing local constraints to development and finding ways to overcome these constraints on a decentralized basis.  As county-level development-oriented institutions, the CDCs are well positioned to bring TA to bear where it is most needed to resolve local problems and to serve as a managerial and technical backstop.  They are also well positioned and appropriately staffed to identify, initiate, direct, and manage public sector investments in new economic capacity, provided they find ways to underwrite the cost of implementing these activities. While interviews generally confirmed the view that, since 1998, living conditions have improved in most of the stable opposition-administered areas where STAR has operated, there are no quality of life indicators or welfare indexes to support this finding. Abundant rainfall, reduced levels of inter-tribal conflict, and agricultural surpluses were viewed as key factors behind the improvement.  The ongoing war, its impact on agricultural trade, a transport system in disarray, the lack of a common currency, the lack of transparency in applying SPLM tax collection and fiscal measures, and inadequate financial management and budgeting systems were key constraints to achieving greater progress. Limited progress was made in filling key positions in the civil authorities and in developing policy and regulatory frameworks for governing.  Considerably less progress was made in increasing levels of accountability, transparency, and respect for human rights among civil authorities, and in increasing the capacity of institutions to foster democratization and good governance. It is unlikely that the projects initiated under STAR will be able to continue operation once the implementing partners cease active involvement in a project's functioning. STAR did not significantly increase the representation and decisionmaking power of women.  This can be attributed to the absence of a strategic plan to address gender issues, lack of consultation with stakeholders on how to address the gender gap, and lack of in-depth awareness of gender issues at the donor level and among partners. Includes recommendations for STAR II.","Task order 815|Evaluation indefinite quantity contract (Evaluation IQC)","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","AEP-I-00-00-00023-00","","9/1/2002 12:00:00 AM","","Post conflict societies|Societies in transition|Political systems in transition|Governance|Grants|Development finance|Microenterprises|Public administration|Accountability|Decision making|Community participation|Policy analysis|Human capacity development|Local groups|Human rights|Institution building|Quality of life|Agricultural development|Natural resource management|Rule of law|Judicial reform|Educational facilities|Health care administration|Private voluntary organizations|Microfinance","Sudan","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABW919.pdf","3,177 KB","000436 - Development Associates, Inc.","","008607 - USAID.

"This assessment examines the impact and performance of USAID's urban and industrial pollution prevention programs based on case studies of the Philippines (PN-ACP-611), Chile (PN- ACG-619), the Czech Republic (PN-ACG-626), India (PN-ACG-629), and Russia (PN-ACM-154).  The programs stress, variously, industrial, urban, air, and water pollution.  Some focus on preventing pollution at its source, others on end-of-pipe treatments.  Some use financial benefits as the main incentive for industries to adopt clean technologies, while others focus on industries' desire to avoid penalties and financial costs. Interventions were generally in one or more of five areas:  economic policy reform, government regulations and standards, institution building, education and awareness, and technological change.  The impact of these interventions was mixed.  The Philippines, Chile, and India studies all reported positive financial benefits.  This was not the case, however, in the Czech Republic and Russia, where USAID-funded activities focused more on urban than on industrial pollution. Although the environmental impact was positive in all five countries, the availability and reliability of emissions and effluent data needed to reach this conclusion varied among countries.  Data were far more thorough and credible in the Philippines and the Czech Republic than they were in Chile, India, and Russia.  Unfortunately, health surveillance data, needed to measure changes in human morbidity and mortality in response to changes in environmental quality, were not collected in any of the five countries. It is reasonable to assume, however, that the health impact of the projects was positive. Each of the five programs was at least partially effective. This was certainly the case in Chile, the Philippines, and the Czech Republic (at the national level).  By contrast, most components of the programs in Russia, India, and the Czech Republic (at the municipal level) were generally less effective. Program benefits were sustained after USAID funding ended in Chile, the Czech Republic (at the national level), and Russia (under the Moscow Water Quality project).  This was generally not the case in the Philippines, the Czech Republic (at the municipal level), Russia (under the Air Management project), or India (except for the Financial Institutions Reform and Expansion [FIRE] project). Finally, except for FIRE-D (the FIRE project's debt component), benefits were not replicated beyond the original target areas, participants, or industries in any of the countries. Six key lessons were learned:  (1) Companies will not invest in pollution prevention or control technologies or environmental management systems unless they perceive it to be in their business interest.  (2) Environmental regulations and their strict enforcement are important in motivating companies to acquire pollution control technologies.  (3) A pilot effort is an excellent way to demonstrate the benefits of pollution prevention methods, but it should include a plan to ensure that benefits are sustained after donor funding ends.  (4) An industrial pollution prevention program cannot hope to reach all firms directly, but needs an intermediary to spread the message.  Careful targeting with an eye to sharing and spreading successful results can also encourage replication.  (5) Lack of financing is typically not a serious constraint for large firms that want to procure pollution control and prevention technology.  However, it often hinders individual small and medium-size firms.  For municipalities, domestic environmental funds or bonds can be important sources of financing for environmental infrastructure.  (6)  ""Before"" and ""after"" data are needed to monitor program performance and assess program impact.  Program sustainability within a company and replication beyond it depend on the availability of reliable data and information.

"Called upon to provide short-term transition assistance in a sensitive region devastated by civil conflict following East Timor's August 1999 referendum on independence, USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) launched a program rapidly, developing initial grants in November 1999 and establishing a regional office in East Timor in January 2000. This study by USAID's Center for Development Information and Evaluation (CDIE) found that OTI's rapid-response initiatives played a major role in filling the gap between relief and longer term development programs.  The decision to initiate a transition program considered all important guidelines and was undertaken in close consultation with other U.S. entities and donors.  Planning addressed logistics and reviewed potential activities collaboratively with the interim government, other funding organizations, and other USAID offices.  Potential activities were set within a strategic framework. CDIE's review also found that the transition assistance provided by OTI in East Timor had a comparative advantage in getting activities underway until more conventional donor activities could begin.  OTI's quick action helped stem further instability and economic deterioration. The study identified various implementation problems -- lack of spare parts and maintenance for equipment, excessive remuneration, and weak partner organizations, but concluded that the need for fast action justified the risks.  The Support Which Implements Fast Transitions (SWIFT) mechanism, an indefinite quantity contract, proved especially effective for program start-up, rapid procurement, and flexible programming. The study concluded that the East Timor intervention provided a successful model for USAID intervention in situations that do not call for establishing a conventional onsite mission. Continued slippage in OTI's exit date indicated problems in handing off transitional activities:  despite planning for handoff, the lack of more permanent mechanisms for managing initiatives created pressure to retain OTI past its scheduled departure.  Lack of a clear and consistent agency policy on transition program duration further hindered timely phase-out of OTI initiatives.

"In August 1998, USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) began to assist USAID/Indonesia with programs to move Indonesia to a more open, democratic system. Principal activities funded by the approximately $30 million allocated to OTI through FY2000 included supporting Indonesian elections, strengthening the media, building civil society, improving civilian-military relations, and mitigating conflict. A study of transition assistance by USAID's Center for Development Information and Evaluation (CDIE) found OTI's programs played an important role in helping USAID respond quickly and appropriately with short-term assistance to support post-emergency political reform. OTI's capacity to identify opportunities and respond immediately to conflict situations enabled the U.S. Government (USG) to provide immediate support to peace committees and local groups addressing issues in volatile environments. The study also explored the limitations of transition assistance, including the need for effective integration and coordination with sustainable development programs. The CDIE evaluators found that the decision to launch transition assistance was characterized by consultation with the relevant USG agencies and considered the appropriate guidelines, albeit informally. Although OTI's initiative-planning approach maximized flexibility and quick response, it also led to a proliferation of program objectives and dual monitoring systems. Initial tension between OTI and USAID/Indonesia staff eased over time, but OTI's separate planning and monitoring processes worked against full integration. The formation of cross-sectoral teams improved coordination of OTI and USAID/Indonesia activities in conflict-prone regions. Election assistance and media strengthening activities proved particularly effective. Exiting from Indonesia has proven difficult, complicated by the need to respond to new situations, strong support for OTI activities by other U.S. entities, and lack of a clear phase-out policy. Lessons learned from OTI's Indonesia experience include the need to balance short-term flexibility important in responding to crisis situations with long-term, capacity building programming. The study concluded that transition assistance could help reduce tension, but was not a panacea for addressing underlying conflict issues. Linking OTI's short-term assistance with longer term activities could help maximize overall effectiveness, as would an approach to monitoring results within the country context. A clear and consistent duration and phase-out policy would facilitate activity handoff and an orderly transition to regular programs.

"In the aftermath of the devastation and dislocation of the NATO members' air war in Kosovo, USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) played an important role in helping the U.S. Government respond quickly and effectively to the hope engendered by Serbian withdrawal and UN administration.  OTI's pre-air war efforts had been frustrated by Serbian oppression of Kosovo's Albanian majority.  After Serbian forces withdrew in June 1999, OTI launched its programs rapidly, establishing a regional headquarters in the Kosovar capital of Pristina and six field offices throughout the province. A study by USAID's Center for Development Information and Evaluation (CDIE) found that OTI's rapid response initiatives played a valuable role in helping USAID and the U.S. Government get reconstruction and development activities underway in Kosovo. Factors considered during the planning process met OTI's guidelines for engagement.  The program was integrated nearly seamlessly within USAID's strategic plan. Bringing the OTI country program under the authority of the USAID/Kosovo mission director ensured that implementation and support were effectively integrated at the field level. OTI's programming approach allowed for strategy changes as the transition evolved. OTI concentrated its efforts on the creation of grassroots organizations -- Community Improvement Councils (CICs)   to impart basic democratic practices and initiate reconstruction efforts.  Planning for handoff was timely and effective. The activities pursued reflect OTI's comparative advantage in introducing initiatives at the local level. The evaluation concluded that OTI's successful intervention in Kosovo and particularly its effective coordination with the sustainable development program -- could usefully serve as a model in other situations.  This model could be further strengthened, the study recommended, by reporting results within the overall mission reporting framework rather than that of OTI. The study found that OTI's community-development approach effectively introduced grassroots decisionmaking practices -- previously outside of Kosovar or Serbian experience -- while meeting community reconstruction needs.  OTI's self-help programs encouraged communities to seek multiple sources of funding, which resulted in $4 million in additional resources and discouraged single-donor dependency.

"Final evaluation of the Office of Transition Initiatives' (OTI) program (7/99-8/02) to promote peace and reconciliation in Sierra Leone, with emphasis on the Diamond Management Program (DMP) and the Youth Reintegration and Education for Peace Program (YRTEP). The main objectives the DMP were to bring diamonds (and other valuable minerals) under Government of Sierra Leone (GOSL) control in order to enhance revenues from legal trade, and to cut the trade in conflict diamonds used to finance warfare. OTI made progress in achieving both objectives.  Specifically, OTI:  (1) made a unique contribution by working with and positively influencing the GOSL; (2) increased the participation of civil society; (3) actively participated in the ongoing effort to establish the Kimberly Process, designed to certify and verify exported diamonds and limit the importation of smuggled diamonds; (4) helped establish a Certificate of Origin procedure for Sierra Leone; (5) assisted the ongoing attempt to establish a clean channel, minimize corruption, and help the GOSL improve the speed and reliability of the legal process; (6) trained mines monitoring officers; and (7) helped establish the Diamond Area Community Development Fund (DACDF), an innovative, community-based approach to controlling the illicit diamond trade.  The best indicator of DMP success is an increase in the value of legally exported diamonds; the short-term (1999-2001) trend is clearly positive.  The concept, general design, and some of the methodology of the DMP   especially the DACDF model -- may be replicable elsewhere. The YRTEP, an impressive and innovative approach to addressing the critical role of youth in Sierra Leone's conflict, seemed to have had a positive impact on the peace process.  It proved successful in a variety of ways and achieved most of its original objectives (reintegration, the strengthening of peace-building initiatives, and public support for demobilization).  Success was only qualified, however, with trade-offs and concerns that must be addressed if YRTEP is to reach its full potential.  Major findings on YRTEP are noted below. (1) By mixing ex-combatants and war-affected youth in the same program, YRTEP assisted the reconciliation and reintegration process and diminished potential conflicts that arise when services are provided only to ex-combatants.  The curriculum was stimulating (covering self, healing mind, body, and spirit, the environment, health and well-being, and democracy, good governance, and conflict management), but also directive, with few opportunities for participatory interaction, and low literacy gains.  It was also very resource-intensive, making production and distribution difficult.  The major design weakness is inattention to closure; repeatedly, participants reported a sense of frustration over how the training ended, and they feel only partially prepared to implement lessons learned. The quick start-up was impressive, and several observers believed that the rapid response helped secure peace. Repeatedly, it was stated that YRTEP got youth off the street and engaged them in something that was meaningful and beneficial for the community.  The push to implement during the early, uncertain post-war transition resulted in a lack of time to field-test materials or approaches.  Several early ""cracks"" in the program were never overcome.  Security requirements frequently made it difficult or impossible for expatriate staff to visit program sites. Only recently have staff members been allowed to travel freely. The most impressive finding is the degree to which participants and community members report improvements in youth behavior.  Participants vividly and consistently demonstrate great enthusiasm when describing experiences and the changes in their lives.  YRTEP provides a solid foundation for initiating additional community development programs. The message is positive, and participants see it as an impetus to create positive change.  Where there was sufficient participation by women, there was an increase in women's sense of empowerment. Community ownership remains partial, however; most communities still refer to YRTEP as a World Vision activity.  Finally, YRTEP inspired an impressive degree of community activism (though there is little evidence that other agencies are taking advantage of this potential) and established a network of trainers and community-level organizations that offer important resources for future USAID programs. YRTEP can and should be replicated, provided the lessons learned from the evaluation are drawn upon.  Its theme of inclusion -- targeting thousands of ex-combatant as well as marginalized, out-of-school youth -- makes YRTEP a potentially critical contributor to other peace-building efforts.  YRTEP successfully reached tens of thousands of youths, energizing the transition from war to peace by involving out-of-school and ex-combatant youth in productive activities, and reaching them in remarkably short order. Overall, OTI is to be commended for its performance in Sierra Leone. Problems in program design and implementation were minor in comparison with the overall effectiveness of an innovative, risk-taking, and very successful country program that had a major impact.","Title in header: Final evaluation of the OTI program in Sierra Leone|Project title: Basic education and policy support (BEPS)|Related document: PN-ACT-244|Summary: PD-ABY-763","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","HNE-I-00-00-00038-00","","8/1/2002 12:00:00 AM","","Post conflict societies|Peace|Political reconciliation|Black markets|Exports|Political corruption|Beneficiary targeting|Youth|Excombatants|War victims|Economic and social reintegration|Vocational training|Civic education|Literacy instruction|Agricultural training|Community based delivery|Development project design|Development project implementation|Project replication|Civil society|Women in development|Private voluntary organizations|Mining industry|Smuggling|Nonmetalliferous minerals|Diamonds","Sierra Leone","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABX237.pdf","645 KB","007518 - CARE International|001341 - Creative Associates International, Inc.

"Final evaluation of the Office of Transition Initiatives' (OTI) East Timor community stabilization programs, comprising the Transition Engagement for Population Support Program (TEPS II) and the follow-on Building Empowerment, Leadership and Engagement (BELE) program. Implemented over a 15-month period (10/01-12/02), these programs focused on community participation in identifying, implementing, and completing subprojects based on small grants. TEPS II and BELE activities have generally succeeded in breaking some bottlenecks and filling critical gaps in the functioning of selected communities in a transitioning East Timor society.  Grants in agriculture (including some agro-processing activities), schools, markets, and water and sanitation were especially successful in responding to perceived critical needs and in mobilizing people's efforts.  Less obviously responsive and demanding of people's energies were roads, selected income generation activities, and sports facilities (based, however, on only one site visit).  Income generation activities included carpentry shops, rice milling operations, a hand-tractor activity, a brick-making factory, and a coffee production cooperative. Agricultural irrigation activities seemed to strike a responsive chord, in part because the result is so visible. The exit strategy for TEPS II and BELE should consciously tie the economic stability of communities to a process of local government and governance.  Such a linkage represents an appropriate approach to empowering the disenfranchised farmers of rural East Timor.  USAID/East Timor should design a strategy to develop local government capacity that promotes not only electoral democracy and democratic governance, but also transparency and accountability of an eventual rural service delivery program. Lessons learned are as follows:  (1) Small grants programs such as TEPS II and BELE can support a society in transition, filling critical socioeconomic gaps and building local empowerment.  (2) A community transition program that does not consciously build on a partnership with some local supportive organization or institution may be difficult to sustain. Admittedly, TEPS II and BELE found such local partners to be few and far between.  (3) Grant activities that engaged the local village or sub-village chief often had a better chance of success than those that did not, even if full transparency and accountability were not attached to that position.  (4) While community-generated activities represent a highly appropriate approach to a transition program, some community bottlenecks or gaps may be more critical than others.  (5) While breaking dependency may be a long term goal of development programs, there may be ways to consciously attack that problem sooner as part of the transition process.  (6) When procurement considerations begin to drive a grant, they may lead to inferior inputs, thereby jeopardizing grant results, as seemed to be the case with the rice mills.  (7) Income generation grants are not proven as a tool in transition projects, yet results achieved through these grants may be useful, even if they do not contribute directly to income (e.g., some of the agro-processing grants were productive in non-income ways).  (8) While evaluations such as this one can have real value to transition program designers, they often fail to penetrate beneath the surface of a grant activity.  (9) In the absence of a partnership with local government institutions, programs designed to fill gaps in East Timor's economic infrastructure may be unsustainable due to a lack of formal, accountable structure to support and maintain them.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","AOT-I-01-98-00199-00","","1/1/2002 12:00:00 AM","","Societies in transition|Economies in transition|Political systems in transition|Grants|Development projects|Community development|Community participation|Economic dependency|Agricultural development|Water supply structures|Public services|Incentives|Income generation|Irrigation|Democratization|Governance|Development strategies","Timor-Leste","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABX254.pdf","147 KB","006727 - Development Alternatives, Inc.

"Final evaluation of the Conserve Biodiversity for Sustainable Development (COBS) project in Uganda (9/99-9/02). Associates in Rural Development (ARD) was the principal contractor. COBS achieved some remarkable results.  It helped the Uganda Wildlife Authority (UWA) adopt system-wide changes that over time will halt encroachment into protected areas (PAs), improve ecosystem health, and restore wildlife populations.  COBS also engaged district, subcounty, and parish local government structures and involved council members and local populations in defining a state-of-the-art district environment action plans (DEAPs) approach that has been adopted as the national standard and emulated, with varying success, in non-COBS districts.  The approach has also served as a model for planning in other sectors, and facilitated the incorporation of environmental concerns into a number of other annual sectoral plans.  The participatory process involving local populations and subdistrict institutions has paved the way for the plans and type of partnerships envisioned under strategic objective (SO)7. COBS also provided support upon request to the Mission in achieving the COBS SO and integrating it with the economic growth SO.  This provision was called on mostly to assist the nascent Environmental Conservation Trust of Uganda (ECOTRUST), which without COBS support might not have survived in its efforts to achieve long-term sustainability as a national environment, conservation, and sustainable development grant- making body. On the down side, in an attempt to enhance tangible impact, COBS concentrated its efforts geographically and emphasized transitioning from planning to plan implementation for both PAs and the surrounding rural landscapes.  Plan implementation was limited and quite late. Beneficiaries would have profited more from an earlier start or more time for implementation.  COBS was unable to achieve parallel accomplishments in institutionalizing environmental assessment, review, and management.  From the outset, USAID's strategic refocusing of COBS meant that the project's original results module, directed to establishing environmental liaison units within national lead agencies, was dropped.  Efforts at the national level failed to gain traction and were scaled back following a reduction in the project budget.  Training, awareness, and capacity-building at the field level were well received, but accomplishments have not been securely institutionalized.  Although the project had some success in training district officials and local populations, the country is still without systems of certification for practitioners, of audit and compliance, and of incorporation of environmental measures across multiple sectors.  ARD's ""landscape approach"" and the intended synergies sought through geographic concentration were realized only to a limited degree, partly because UWA insisted that ARD's primary PA effort be directed to the outlying Murchison Falls National Park.  Sustainability of outreach programs was not achieved due to lack of an institutional home beyond the project. The project achieved some success in developing innovative participatory approaches in its environmental awareness and management and in its public information and education campaigns, but the effect will be substantial only if the successes are institutionalized and replicated. In terms of impact and sustainability, the UWA has committed to perennially funding a fully staffed planning unit, which is already autonomously applying the general management planning system developed with COBS support.  The system has been adopted for the country's entire PA system.  As tourism and UWA revenues increase over time, the unit can be expected to achieve more independence from donor program support. Also with COBS support, UWA adopted system-wide use of annual operation plans. Through the National Environmental Management Authority (NEMA), COBS engaged local government and its development and civil society partners to achieve comprehensive planning and, to a large extent, to mainstream environmental concerns in the target districts of southwestern Uganda.  The human resources, both political and technical, within districts, subcounties, and parishes have embraced a participatory process that connects environment with the overall move toward decentralization.  The financial resources available to the districts are significant and varied, and the integration of environment into the overall district development plans bodes well for sustained financing for program implementation even in the heavily populated portions of the region. The following lessons were learned:  (1) Program coordination is critical to success.  (2) Focusing on opportunities and not constraints contributed immensely to the project's level of success.  In particular, vision-based planning led to rapid and widespread stakeholder buy-in. (3) Avoiding parallel structures helps transfer ownership and makes a real difference.","Task order 800|Project title: Biodiversity and sustainable forestry indefinite|quantity contract","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","9/1/2002 12:00:00 AM","","Sustainable development|Natural resource conservation|Biological diversity|Protected environmental areas|Institution building|Government departments|Indigenous private voluntary organizations|Project sustainability|Local groups|Districts|Human capacity development|Development program planning|Community participation|Development program implementation|National level|Impact assessment|Economic self sufficiency|Decentralization|Sector authority","Uganda","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABX296.pdf","507 KB","","","008618 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of a matching grant (MG) (1996-2001) to TechnoServe (TNS) to promote sustainable rural growth. MG objectives changed dramatically over the course of the grant. TNS implemented a new strategy in 1999 and used the majority of MG resources to introduce a new organizational model and strategy that resulted in major changes in the MG in terms of client selection, assistance methodology, staffing composition, and partner relationships.  When the original detailed implementation plan (DIP) was prepared, TNS still operated under its old community-based enterprise (CBE) model, and the projected project targets reflected this, as did the MG performance data up to 12/98, which showed significant early progress towards those targets.  In reference, for example, to the first objective, to assist CBEs, by 12/98 TNS and its partners were providing assistance to 346 CBEs (46 more than contemplated) with 176,028 direct beneficiaries.  The second objective was to improve the capacity of local NGOs and other private/public institutions that support rural growth by developing the capacity of 50 clients by the end of the MG.  By 12/98, TNS was already working with 28 institutions, up from 12 at the beginning of the grant, and had reached 85% of the objective set for institution building that year. By the end of the MG (8/31/01), however, the combined number of client businesses and CBEs had declined to 164 (with 113 of these in Ghana) and the number of beneficiaries was only 11,928.  Also, by this date TNS was no longer providing NGO and institutional capacity building services. Several factors help explain the decline in these statistics. Most of the enterprises visited by the evaluation team in Nicaragua and Kenya were developed under the new strategy and were not yet operational or were in their early start-up phase. Many of the enterprises are, or will soon be, substantially larger than the CBEs TNS had traditionally assisted. In Nicaragua (and perhaps elsewhere), enterprises currently assisted by TNS are made up of smaller CBEs, thereby accounting for some in the decline in enterprises being served.  Some of the sharp decline in beneficiaries can be explained by the change in the revised definition of direct beneficiary, which no longer includes farm families or part-time and seasonal workers and their families.  Under the old definition, the number of direct beneficiaries would currently range between 80,000 and 100,000. Regarding the third MG objective, TNS is, and will likely remain, largely dependent on public and private grant funding.  Over the MG period, TNS's dependence on US Government funding has increased from 48% to 70%, although concurrent major investments in private fundraising appear starting to pay off.  Furthermore, only 1% of TNS's budget is derived from fees paid by clients for the TA they receive -- and it seems unlikely that user fees will account for an appreciable part of the budget at least in the medium term. TNS's new strategy is the product of a strategic planning process driven by TNS's frustration with the stagnant growth of the world's poorest countries over the past 30 years. Recognizing limitations of its previous approach, TNS came to embrace a strategy that can be summarized as:  supporting marketing and production channels for high quality, value-added (niche) products that link small and medium farmers to regional, national, and international markets.  This strategy, it was reasoned, would bring substantial new income to poor communities and develop local capacity or, in TNS's terms, eradicate poverty instead of merely alleviating it. The task TNS has set for itself under this new model is not easy. The high value market niches that TNS identifies are also being identified by large-scale producers who are unconcerned with TNS's smallholder agenda.  Further, the market for fair traded and organic products that make up much of TNS's portfolio, while growing quickly, is small compared to mass traded commodities and can easily be oversubscribed. Securing contracts for these products requires a high level of skills, a tough negotiating stance, and good connections.  How successful TNS will be in this effort will become clearer over the next several years. If any organization can carry out this demanding undertaking, it is probably TNS, which has accomplished much over this 5-year period.  It developed a new strategy that could represent an important breakthrough for rural development.  This required retraining its current staff and hiring new staff; decentralizing planning and decisionmaking to the country projects; developing many new enterprises whose potential is just now beginning to be realized; and adopting a set of core indicators that measure the progress of these enterprises in business terms.","Task order #2|Evaluation support services indefinite quantity contract|(Evaluation IQC)","Special Evaluation","Documents","AEP-I-00-00-00024-00","","7/1/2002 12:00:00 AM","","Rural development|Business enterprises|Small scale enterprises|Business support services|Income generation|Community based delivery|Development strategies|Strategic planning|Financial resources|Economic self sufficiency","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABX322.pdf","323 KB","003970 - Management Systems International, Inc.

"Final evaluation of a matching grant (MG) to the Small Enterprise Education and Promotion (SEEP) Network for a 3-year project ((9/98-9/01) to support SEEP core activities in its Institutional Development Services (IDS) program. SEEP has met MG sustainability targets.  In diversifying its grant income, doubling its fee income, and adding contract work as an income source, SEEP has strengthened its financial position and improved cost recovery. The process of lateral learning in the SEEP Network is working well and is facilitated by the MG.  As a network driven by member needs and desires, the approach to planning by the SEEP staff and board was flexible, setting achievement targets only at the higher level of objectives and results.  The detailed implementation plan and its companion business plan contained the framework guided SEEP throughout the grant.  Individual members contribute and make program decisions within this framework.  SEEP's goal of lateral learning would be diminished if a highly structure and rigid planning system were in place. There is a high level of participation in, and contributions to, SEEP activities by members, whose needs are being met by SEEP programs and activities in important ways. The learning agenda is member driven and responsive to member needs.  SEEP activities and structure as supported under the MG are effective in improving the understanding and application of microenterprise development (MED) best practices to member operations.  The design of SEEP products and evaluation survey data show that SEEP activities are building some member capacity to transfer and apply best practices to field partners. Through the research, tools, and guides that are in wide use in MED institutions and programs, SEEP is having a major impact on standards, monitoring, and evaluation in the general fields of microfinance and business development services (BDS).  The working groups (WGs) are effective mechanisms for defining MED priorities as well as for researching and disseminating MED principles, standards, and practices in areas of high priority to practitioners.  Since the WG outputs are the work of member volunteers, they are practical and field oriented, quickly disseminated among SEEP members, and benefit from inputs from multiple MED organizations. EEP's activities in network development services (NDS) over the last 3 years have reached 18 organizations around the world.  SEEP's approaches have worked well as SEEP has linked with several organizations to leverage their resources.  There appears to be a high level of satisfaction with SEEP training, TA, and other support to networks and members.  The experiences and lessons learned by SEEP as a network are useful for MED networks and their members in developing countries.  SEEP is also particularly good in planning/strategy development and technical training to build network capacity because of its long experience with its own members doing the same.  That SEEP can tap its member staffs to deliver NDS assistance makes the experiences more relevant and less costly. In sum, SEEP has fully achieved the objectives set out in the MG for both the IDS and the NDS programs.  The impact of these on the development of MED best practices and their applications around the world is difficult to quantify, but its magnitude is substantial. Bottom-up planning matched with shared vision and objectives are keys to SEEP's success. It is unrealistic to expect SEEP to achieve a high level of financial sustainability.  SEEP is not just a service organization, but a PVO in its own right with a development mission comparable to its members. Like the latter, SEEP will be donor-dependent, but it also has the opportunity for substantial cost-recovery from fees, sales, and other income. Overall, this is a high impact, highly effective grant that reaches field organizations with useful tools and practices at a low cost to USAID, which is getting excellent ""bang for its buck"".","Evaluation support services indefinite quantity contract|(Evaluation IQC)","Special Evaluation","Documents","AEP-I-00-00-00024-00","","4/1/2002 12:00:00 AM","","Private voluntary organizations|Matching funds|Institution building|Development finance|Small scale enterprises|Microenterprises|Business support services|Indigenous private voluntary organizations|Economic self sufficiency|Cost recovery|Best practices|Microfinance","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABX323.pdf","247 KB","003970 - Management Systems International, Inc.

"Final evaluation of Woman/Child Impact-2 (WCI-2, 10/96-9/01), a matching grant to Save the Children (SC) to promote the economic and social empowerment of children, women, and other disadvantaged groups by expanding their participation in decisionmaking at all levels of society.  The project planned a wide spectrum of capacity-building activities in SC headquarters (HQ) and in four hub country settings (Bangladesh, El Salvador, Ethiopia, and Mozambique). The detailed implementation plan (DIP) submitted to USAID in 1997 was poorly designed and impossible to implement.  The Office of Private Voluntary Cooperation (PVC) failed to conduct a formal review of the DIP, which, after 3 years of confusion and uncertainty, was realigned to be consistent with USAID's result framework format.  Despite early problems, SC field offices achieved demonstrable results in implementing gender equity programs, establishing viable and sustainable partnerships and, to a lesser extent, creating operating monitoring and evaluation (M&E) systems for their programs.  SC headquarters has also adopted and advocated policies supportive of gender equity and partnerships.  The implementation of an M&E system at SC HQ has proceeded much more slowly than anticipated and is far from accomplished. Overall, the WCI grant has added value to SC operations both in the field and at HQ offices in Westport and Washington, DC:  (1) SC has integrated gender equity policies throughout the organization and worked hard to promote these policies with its international and national partners and through numerous international fora on women and children's issues.  (2) SC has strengthened the planning and monitoring of its field programs; programming procedures have been enhanced in HQ operations; and program learning groups are carrying out important training and TA roles.  (3) SC field offices have increased their program outreach capabilities through strategic partnerships and have adopted more rigorous M&E approaches to assessing these efforts. In sum, despite some shortcomings, USAID funds strengthened SC as an organization and its capacity to carry out its mission consistent with the goals of the matching grant program.  USAID has received a fair return on its investment.","Evaluation support services indefinite quantity contract|(Evaluation IQC)","Special Evaluation","Documents","AEP-I-00-00-00024-00","","2/1/2002 12:00:00 AM","","Women in development|Child welfare services|Disadvantaged groups|Private voluntary organizations|Institution building|Human capacity development|Matching funds|Political participation|Decision making|Gender analysis|Equity|Development program monitoring|Policy reform|Partnerships","Ethiopia|El Salvador|Bangladesh","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABX324.pdf","1,353 KB","003970 - Management Systems International, Inc.

"Final evaluation of the Rural Organizations and Environmental Conservation Activity (ROCA/TNS   5/9-12/02) in El Salvador, designed to increase the availability of environmentally sound technologies and marketing services to primary-level organizations (1LO) and low-income small producers, through sustainable secondary-level organizations (2LO). ROCA/TNS has made important contributions to improving targeted small farmers' income and standard of living by increasing access of their products to local markets, as well as by developing 2LOs' and 1LOs' entrepreneurial capacity.  Farm management centers' (FMCs) services have attained partial sustainability and were valued by the majority of direct clientele interviewed.  Partners' participation in FMCs staff selection process was essential.  Some assumptions proved unrealistic, however, e.g., that 1LO and members will prefer to market their production through their own 2LO FMCs based on a strong sense of belonging, compromise, and loyalty.  Also, the original number of target beneficiaries was excessive, mainly during the first year. The activity has made important contributions to environmental conservation.  A total of 1,507 hectares are now covered by organic cropping, 362 hectares with integrated pest management, and 552 hectares with soil conservation practices. Training was a key activity, but massive diffusion of training products and achievements was not very successful.  Also, early efforts to improve credit availability did not make progress, in part due to farmers' reluctance to use their land title as guarantee as required by financial institutions. One of the FMCs' most recognized services among the small farmers visited was product transportation from the farm to the market.  The majority of ROCA/TNS technicians have been continuously involved in transport of products using FMC vehicles.  Although this situation created small farmer dependency on activity vehicles and personnel and affected the activity's technical performance and operational costs, it facilitated farmers' access to markets. Institutional problems limited CENTA's capacity to offer TA to small farmers in a sustainable basis.  As result, ROCA/TNS personnel increased their work load pursuing the use of alternative technology information sources to obtain appropriate recommendations for small producers, especially for high value horticulture crops. ROCA/TNS responded in 86 municipalities to the two earthquakes that affected El Salvador in 2001. Lessons learned are as follows:  (1) Projects to increase small farmers based on a market demand approach should not limit existing income generating activities carried out by project implementation units.  The challenge is to take advantage of existing market opportunities in order to increase net family income increase and raise the standard of living.  (2) Changing the mindset of an organization from a traditional to a more business oriented approach and to mobilize small farmers' scarce resources from traditional crops and slash and burn agriculture to horticulture and other high value crops using environmental sound practices is usually a very slow process.  Building up a critical mass of beneficiaries and significantly increasing their number will take a long time and dedication.  (3) Special attention must be devoted to analyzing the conceptual framework that will support future USAID projects of this kind.  Project design must deal not just with technical and commercial aspects, but also with the sociocultural background and institutional setting.  (4) Flexibility and proactive behavior by project staff seem to be key to success in market demand oriented projects. (5) To increase FMC impact on small farmer welfare, it is necessary to share such experience with outside organizations and a broad range of audiences.  (6) A mid-term evaluation should be considered in future projects, in order to introduce necessary changes at the right time.  (7) Pilot testing new agricultural development approaches permits the assimilation of important lessons for future activities, reduces risk and uncertainty, and increases the chances of success while improving the use of scarce resources.  (8) In a project mainly geared to increasing small farmer income, research must be more hands-on and less academic, with findings presented in a readable form for a wider audience.  (9) Promotion and diffusion of project activities, achievements, financial support are essential.","","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","12/1/2002 12:00:00 AM","","Rural development|Agricultural enterprises|Agricultural product marketing|Environmental technologies|Sustainable agriculture|Technology transfer|Farm income|Small farms|Human capacity development|Management training|Access to services|Road transportation|Road vehicles|Attitude change|Agricultural research|Information dissemination|Development project design|Disaster relief","El Salvador","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABX326.pdf","322 KB","006900 - Agricultural Development Consultants, Inc.","","008540 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of a cooperative agreement with the International Eye Foundation (IEF) under the Community Partnership Project (CHAPS -- 1997-2002), designed to utilize PVOs as partners with the Ministry of Health and Population (MOHP) to extend key health services and enhance institutional capacity in Malawi.  The IEF worked with the MOHP in Chikwawa District in the Lower Shire Valley, where IEF has a history of technical and development assistance. The CHAPS project in Chikwawa District was successful in strengthening the accounting system, fleet management, communications between the district hospital and outlying health centers, and community-level capacity.  Major accomplishments in these areas included the following:  (1) The accounting system was computerized and is functioning. Posting of accounts were 2 to 3 months behind schedule, but all tasks were done electronically and reports were generated from the system.  (2) Budgeting was done on the computer, which facilitated planning when problems occurred such as unannounced cuts in monthly budget allocations from the central office.  Now that the manual system has been replaced, it can be expected that the accounting will be done electronically in the future.  (3) The fleet management system has been credited with increasing the number of functional vehicles from one to eight. (4) The person initially trained as the fleet manager was still in place and producing daily and monthly usage and maintenance reports. (5) The radio system for communication among the health centers and the district hospital was evident at every health center that the evaluation team visited. It  worked and was used extensively. CHAPS contributed to sustaining the child survival project that preceded it. Financial and technical assistance from CHAPS concentrated on capacity building and district- level TA, and provided support for continuing community-level services.  This is a model worth emulating. Volunteers who distributed contraceptives were the best trained and most active of all the volunteer groups. It is impressive to note that all of the volunteers were active; they were the most knowledgeable, served multiple villages, and had neat and up-to-date records. It should also be noted that the volunteers were women. Because of IEF's work, Chikwawa District has a large cadre of active and committed community leaders.  The major constraints were beyond the control of IEF and the district's health care system.  The constant staff rotation made it difficult to have continuity of leadership.  In too many instances, IEF had to start over again in building leadership capacity. The concept of a decentralized health care system embodied by the CHAPS projects needs to include the district's participation in areas such as personnel management.","RFA no. 690-97-002","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","690-A-00-98-00125-00","","1/1/2002 12:00:00 AM","","Community health care|Public health care|Government departments|Private voluntary organizations|Partnerships|Districts|Human capacity development|Institution building|Communications development|Radio communications|Accounting|Health vehicles|Maintenance|Management development|Budgeting|Automation|Contraceptive distribution|Health workers|Volunteers|Women","Malawi","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABX327.pdf","1,378 KB","000627 - International Eye Foundation (IEF)","","008573 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of a grant to Health Alliance International (HAI) for a child survival (CS) project comprising maternal health, malaria control and prevention, and STI/HIV/AIDS education and prevention in Manica and Sofala Provinces, Mozambique (1998- 2002). HAI's partner in Mozambique is the Ministry of Health.  HAI works directly with the Provincial Health Directorate (DPS) for each province. This partnership represents the essential strength of the HAI program, as the approach builds both ownership and sustainability of activities. The program goal is to bring about sustainable reduction in infant, antenatal, and maternal mortality and morbidity in the two provinces. HAI has achieved remarkable success in reaching the targets set in the Detailed Implementation Plan (DIP) for the CS project.  However, there are still severe health problems in the central region to be tackled, further exacerbated by HIV/AIDS epidemic that has changed the epidemiological landscape.  One of the principal achievements of the CS grant has been the strengthening of the health structures from provincial to health post levels through the extensive capacity building program in an extremely difficult operating environment. Over the period of the grant, HAI has responded to the rapid changes in the HIV/AIDS field by supporting important provincial initiatives that were in accordance with the overall objectives of the organization, namely in the areas of mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) and voluntary counseling and testing centers (VCT).   HAI should continue working through the National Health Services (NHS) and work to the organization's strengths in terms of health worker training, operational research, and innovation in cutting edge areas of policy (MTCT and antiretroviral treatment). All aspects highlighted by HAI for the next phase of the CS grant are considered to be priority areas for intervention by the provincial authorities and are more focused than the previous CS program.  HAI needs to consolidate its internal structure in order to clarify roles of personnel and their responsibilities towards partners and donors.  The current reporting culture in HAI is not conducive to reflective learning, and new mechanisms need to be devised to encourage organized reflection that can stimulate staff members to develop critical analysis of their programs in a supportive environment. Lessons learned are as follows.  (1) HAI will work to its strength as an organization and have a more focused operational approach.  HAI should disseminate its operational approach by writing an issue paper highlighting the successes and constraints of working through the local health institutions   (2) HAI will avoid moving into areas where it lacks the resources or vocation to adequately address the problems.  (3) HAI has learned to embrace new challenges of overwhelming importance and urgency, even those not foreseen at the beginning of an operating period, for example, HIV/AIDS work.  (4) HAI needs to consider national-level representation to strengthen its advocacy and operational base. (5) HAI has used a considerable amount of resources on health worker training using an in-service training model. It is time to consider a more innovative approach to the capacity building needs of the NHS.","Project title: PVO child survival grants program (CSGP)","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","FAO-A-00-98-00054-00","","11/1/2002 12:00:00 AM","","Child survival activities|Maternal health care|Disease prevention and control|Provinces|HIV/AIDS|Malaria|Health education|Private voluntary organizations|Host country cooperation|Institution building|Human capacity development|Health professional education|Development program management|Prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV (PMTCT)|Voluntary counseling and testing (VCT) for HIV/AIDS","Mozambique","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABX362.pdf","297 KB","011251 - Health Alliance International","","003432 - Mozambique.

"Final evaluation of the Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) program in Serbia-Montenegro (1997-2002), covering activities in regard to local media, NGO groups, community development projects (CDPs), conflict mitigation, and elections. Also covered are ""handover strategies"", project relations with the USAID Mission and other donors and partners, and OTI management. Major lessons learned are as follows: (1) In communities that express deep distrust of government born out of years of neglect, CDPs that contain tangible benefits for the citizenry are likely to have the greatest impact.  This was precisely the case in South Serbia. Albanian citizens felt that traditionally the Serbian government did not care about them and did nothing to help them. They welcomed the OTI community improvement program (CIP) project because, for the first time, they were listened to and, most importantly, they could experience a tangible benefit (e.g., paved roads, renovated schools) resulting from government action. (2) Successful collaboration by former disputants on an actual CIP will not only help rebuild the community, but will also have the equally important benefit of promoting conflict mitigation.  With OTI encouragement and support, in South Serbia former Albanian and Serbian antagonists for the first time worked together to bring donor funding into their communities to effect infrastructure improvements.  This multi-ethnic collaboration reportedly eased tensions by demonstrating that cooperation was possible and yielded material community payback. (3) For OTI to be successful in a threatening and unstable political environment, it needs local project implementers (e.g., project development officers [PDOs] in Serbia/Montenegro) who are thoroughly in touch with the local political scene, are calm in view of the risks involved, are able to work under uncertainty, and are discreet. They are the front line implementers, the 'OTI gatekeepers' that select the local partners (e.g., NGOs), support them with money and TA, and monitor their performance.  Their behavior determines what the program actually does and how well it performs. (4) If OTI is going to rely on NGOs as a key part of its implementation strategy, it needs to recruit NGOs that are fully qualified and fittingly experienced. OTI relied heavily on NGOs during its Serbia/Montenegro tenure. The NGOs were very effective in the 1997-2001 periods in doing tasks for which they were qualified and experienced. The Pace of Reform (POR) campaign (2001-2002) funded some NGOs that were unqualified and inexperienced in conducting the type of media campaign required.  Time had to be spent in training them and then in relying on more on-the-job training. This was inefficient and unproductive in this type of media campaign, with its tight deadlines and monthly, rotating theme strategy. (5) The OTI Success Model can and should have application in other man- made disaster situations, particularly where uncooperative or hostile governments are involved. While application of the model would necessarily have to be adapted to a particular situation, it provides useful guidelines and a checklist.","Evaluation indefinite quantity contract (Evaluation IQC)","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","AEP-I-00-00-00023-00","","12/1/2002 12:00:00 AM","","Post conflict societies|Societies in transition|Mass media|Indigenous private voluntary organizations|Community development|Conflict resolution|Elections|Project sustainability","Serbia|Montenegro","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABX440.pdf","337 KB","000436 - Development Associates, Inc.","","010972 - USAID.

"Evaluates the impact of a project to provide cash grants to help resettle victims of the 1999-2000 floods in Mozambique (resettlement grant activity). The activity helped families return to their homes and farms and rebuild their lives, while at the same time, jump-starting economic activity, re-establishing effective demand and supply of goods and services. Cash grants were distributed from December 2000 to April 2001 to more than 106,000 rural families. Each head of household received 1.5 million meticais, about US$92. The distribution of US$9.7 million was accomplished at 167 distribution sites that encompassed over 730 villages in 30 districts within the five affected provinces. Grants were delivered to the woman of the household. Families were able to chose for themselves which goods or services, or even savings were their highest priorities. Grant recipients for the most part met criteria based on, among others, location and damage to homes and crops. Beneficiary identification involved a village by village registration process, collecting names, inventorying losses, and verifying information with village elders. Grant recipients were poor, largely subsistence farmers, living in rural villages near their own fields. Many recipients live in areas often affected by extreme natural conditions. They suffered in the floods then, and are now suffering with drought. Grants were primarily spent on household goods (e.g., dishes, pots, pans, blankets), clothes, and livestock. The money was spent mainly near local distribution points, and thus remained in the region, stimulating sales and job creation by retail traders. Food prices increased substantially during and after the floods, but food inflation effects of the program were minor, given the tendency by households towards purchases other than food. The main cause of the marginal local inflation was the scarcity of products, highlighting the importance of accompanying such cash programs with complementary programs on the supply end. The program contributed to the revitalization of distribution networks in affected areas. The extra income that trickled up to local retailers in the form of increased business allowed them to restock their stores and repair damages caused by the floods. The fundamental principle of a cash grant program -- that without any conditions attached, households would make prudent use of the money - was confirmed. The view that women manage the money and choose the family priorities was also borne out. The program helped stabilize affected households by providing them with income lost during the floods, and allowed homes to be re-established, essential needs to be met, and productive, income-generating activities to be re-started. Those most severely affected by the floods were assisted, and in the absence of the grant program, would have been worse off. At the same time, however, the program reinforced a sense of expectation by villagers that others may be depended upon for their survival.

"This report documents lessons learned from Phase II (9/99-5/01) of the Environmental Health Project's (EHP) community-based environmental sanitation and hygiene (CESH --aka GESCOME) activity in Benin, designed to prevent transmission of diarrheal disease to children under age 5. The CESH approach is an effective instrument for stimulating community changes in health understanding, and probably health practices, as well as building and maintaining physical infrastructure for diarrheal disease prevention in rural towns.  CESH combines participatory problem identification and analysis, solution finding, and health communication with a good governance component, and stresses coalition building between local government, civil society, and communities. CESH has:  (1) used local communities' own traditions to generate and communicate vital health information rapidly; (2) included groups reflecting multiple sectors of the local society in all aspects of the participatory CESH process; (3) built broad support and trust among local administrators, technical service agents, civil society leaders, and communities to mobilize resources to construct and maintain latrines and water resource points; (4) given local communities a strong sense of ownership by giving them full responsibility to choose and manage their micro-projects; (5) provided appropriate low-cost technologies easily managed by people with relatively little formal education; and (6) reduced the need to use expensive external TA to supervise and manage local environmental health interventions. GESCOME showed that, with minimum external supervision, local communities can successfully establish and manage effective, decentralized, autonomous decisionmaking structures.  To attain these results, communities must employ and master low- cost simple technologies that provide a desirable public service sustained and financed by public support.  Elements in the decisionmaking structures included:  effective linking of community groups and informal neighborhood groups with local elected officials, municipal/commune-level government and departmental administration; delegation of decisionmaking to local communities to manage microprojects as they see fit; and establishment and enforcement of rules ensuring transparency and accountability. Key elements that facilitate the CESH approach include:  strong support at the departmental and municipal levels; a tradition of community-level participatory decisionmaking; presence of an enthusiastic development champion; perceived or easily perceptible advantages of adopting practices to decrease children's risk of diarrheal disease; local beliefs about diarrheal disease causation that do not have important symbolic or social meaning in local cultures; and reliable local resources to finance construction and maintenance of infrastructure (latrines, water resource points, etc.). Participatory projects should take into account seasonality factors that could affect participation and resource mobilization.  The projects should be of sufficient duration (4-5 years) to ensure that sustainable institutions and knowledge generation and communication methods are developed.  Key elements affecting the amount of time needed are detailed, as are suggestions for scaling up the CESH process to an entire country.","EHP project 26568/CESH.BENIN.PUB01|Related document: PN-ADB-072|Project title: Environmental health project II (EHP II)","Special Evaluation","Documents","HRN-I-00-99-00011-00","","12/1/2002 12:00:00 AM","","Child survival activities|Disease prevention and control|Diarrhea|Environmental health|Environmental management|Sanitation|Hygiene|Community based delivery|Development strategies|Water supply structures|Health education|Information dissemination|Governance|Problem identification|Problem solving|Decision making|Development cooperation|Development project design","Benin","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABX500.pdf","1,353 KB","000333 - Camp Dresser and McKee, Inc.

"Final evaluation of the Integrated Protected Area Management and Spatial Planning project in  Kalimantan and Papua, Indonesia (10/99-10/02), a natural resource management (NRM) project implemented by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF). In general, around 80% of the planned outputs have been achieved consistently.  Significant progress has been made in identifying high-priority biodiversity resources, increasing awareness of some of the key endangered species present, and facilitating the inclusion of the protection of these resources within draft district spatial plans. Good relationships have been established with decisionmakers at the district level, and their capacity in land use planning policymaking has been increased through provision of data, maps, advice, and technical training.  Appropriate alternative income generation activities, which would relieve pressure on biodiversity resources from local communities, have been identified and preliminary training has taken place. However, the ultimate objective of increasing the area of protected resources and the associated best practices in protected area management has yet to be fully achieved due to a number of constraints, including some that were unforeseeable. The draft spatial plans in both districts have been compiled, but neither has yet been presented to the parliament due to circumstances beyond the program's control.  Given the substantial achievements so far, and WWF's unique advantage in terms of the relationships built with local stakeholders and its image as a credible, useful, neutral agency by both local government and community members, a no- cost extension is recommended so that the program can achieve this objective. Lessons learned are as follows:  (1) The speed and effects of decentralization were underestimated, but have had major influences on the project's structure, activities, and achievements.  Papua's Special Autonomy status poses different issues in dealing with local government, communities, and Lenibaga Adat that are different than does Nunukan. (2) Socioeconomic and cultural conditions.  (a) Differing sociocultural, economic, political and biophysical conditions require different activities and thus entail varying rates and levels of progress.  (b) The economic needs of the local communities need to be taken into account in conservation planning.  (c) It is important to understand the structure, decisionmaking structure, and system of representation of traditional communities in order to ensure that socialization of the project's mission is communicated clearly to all and that the aspirations of all members of the communities are represented. (3) Program management.  (a) Non-reception of some data and reports from external consultants has caused delays in activities dependent on these reports.  (b) At both sites, an anthropology specialist is needed, especially in Papua, to help understand the structure and culture of Lembaga Adat.  Both places also need a community facilitator/trainer to help the local community empower itself through community participation. (c) Proposals for protected area status require participatory planning and continuous socialization of local communities.  The concept and model of community-based protected area management must come from the communities themselves.  Developing such an approach is a long process, requiring flexibility in terms of both timeframe and activities.   (d) An integrated approach -- combining strong scientific, spatial and economic data, expertise in spatial planning, understanding of local communities, and lobbying skills -- is needed to effectively promote biodiversity conservation at a bioregional scale.  (e) Biodiversity data has been underutilized at both sites in promoting biodiversity conservation rather than merely maintaining vegetation/forest cover. WWF could tap its existing databases as well as those of their local, national, and international networks to provide information in a form that local communities can understand.  (f) Monitoring and evaluation systems (and related performance measures and indicators) are needed to provide more substantial evidence of progress towards objectives rather than just completion of planned activities.  Finally, monitoring and evaluation should be seen as a process for reflection and learning within and between projects with the overall aim to improve methodology and increase progress through learning from experience.","Project title: Natural resource management (NRM)","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","","","11/1/2002 12:00:00 AM","","Natural resource management|Protected environmental areas|Natural resource conservation|Biological diversity|Endangered species|Development planning|Districts|Community participation|Community based delivery|Development cooperation|Land use|Income generation|Constraints|Political aspects|Decentralization|Cultural environment|Experts|Stakeholder participation","Indonesia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABX530.pdf","2,155 KB","001303 - World Wildlife Fund-U.S. (WWF)","","008558 - USAID.

"Reviews progress as of 9/01 on performance indicators in five countries participating in the Girls' and Women's Education (GWE) activity --  Guatemala, Guinea, Mali, Morocco, and Peru.  The programs worked at the national level and in selected rural areas, except in Mali, where work focused on developing life skills curriculum for girls in local schools. Achievements at the strategic objective level included:  (1) greater annual increases in female gross enrollment ratios than in previous years in the countries (Guatemala, Guinea, and Morocco) for which comparative data were available, as well as a reduced gap in national enrollment ratios favoring boys by 3%, 8%, and 8%, respectively, in those countries; (2) increases in national rural female completion rates of 8.1%, 5.6%, and 7.9% in Guinea, Guatemala, and Peru, respectively, and higher rural completion rates for girls than boys in Morocco; (3) increases in national urban female completion rates of 1.3%, 4.5%, 8.2%, and 14.1% in Morocco, Guatemala, Guinea, and Peru, respectively; and (4) increases in local female completion rates of 26.7% and 25.9% in the two countries, Guinea and Peru, that had intensive efforts supported by local networks or alliances in target areas.  Nonetheless, low rural female completion rates were found in all countries.  Even with the increases, less than half of the rural girls who enroll in school attain fifth grade of primary school in 5 years.  In Guatemala and Guinea, only about one-fourth of enrolled rural girls attain fifth grade. Also, low primary completion rates were also found among rural boys:  one-third or less of the male rural primary school population attain fifth grade in 5 years in Guatemala, Guinea, Morocco, and Peru. Findings in terms of intermediate results are as follows.  (1) In each country, one or more partnerships -- generally comprising 20-40 core organizations -- were formed between NGO, private sector, and public sector entities to promote girls education.  (2) Social awareness efforts were the largest percentage of the work by civil society organizations in Guatemala (38%), Peru (63%), and Guinea (59%). In Morocco, actions focused on a scholarship program (66%), followed by social awareness actions (23%).  (3) NGOs carried out the majority of actions related to girls' persistence in school.  NGOs in Guatemala, Peru, Morocco, and Guinea carried out 46%, 56%, 58%, and 88% of the identified actions promoting girls' education. However, they generally did not contribute a large percentage of local resources generated.  In Guatemala, Peru, and Morocco, where participation by the private sector was actively pursued, that sector provided 80%, 55%, and 61% of the resources generated.  (4) As members of national partnerships, government agencies in all countries supported actions carried out by civil society entities.  However, except for Guatemala, national budgets did not have special funding for girls' education, and only in Guinea was there a relative increase in the budget for primary education. (5) Non-USAID funding to support girls' education was generated without reliance on other donors. Small teams of local professionals acted as catalysts for constituency building in the emphasis countries.  However, members in each country felt the project was understaffed to meet the demands of national and local involvement.  Another demand on staff was the need to provide administrative support to the national partnerships during their formation. Nonetheless, by project end organizations were in place to carry on the work. Lessons learned are as follows:  (1) In countries with low female completion rates, long-term investment will be needed to achieve high completion rates, especially in rural areas.  It is difficult to achieve dramatic change in female completion on a national level without direct efforts to improve school efficiency.  (2) International conferences can be important in providing leaders from different sectors an opportunity to learn from relevant experience in other countries and to identify areas of mutual interest.  In this connection, the 1998 Conference ""Educating Girls: A Development Imperative"" was given high marks by participants from all countries.  (3) Civil society participation in girls' education is not likely to grow exponentially. Rather it will be the responsibility of a ""core"" group of organizations that generally have the promotion of education in their mission statement. Implications of these findings and lessons are detailed.","Project title: Girls' and women's education (GWE)","Special Evaluation","Documents","LAG-C-00-99-00042-00","","5/1/2002 12:00:00 AM","","Access to education|Girls|Boys|Comparative studies|Enrollment|School graduates|Primary schools|Performance indicators|National level|Urban areas|Rural areas|Scholarships|Indigenous private voluntary organizations|Community based delivery|Local groups|Civil society|Change agents|National budgets|Public awareness","Guatemala|Guinea|Mali|Morocco|Peru","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABX953.pdf","571 KB","000709 - Juarez and Associates, Inc.","","010959 - USAID.

"Evaluates program to conserve biological diversity worldwide through improved management of significant habitats -- the Global Conservation Program (GCP). Interim evaluation covers the period 1/99-12/02.  The program is implemented by six PVO/NGO partners. The GCP has begun to make contributions to biodiversity conservation, and USAID and its partners have developed a strong base on which to build.  The Leader with Associate Award (LWA) has generally proven an efficient and cost-effective mechanism. Partners have (or already had) incorporated most of the 14 program principles into their ongoing work, though they need increased understanding of the concept of ""results"". Program strengths include:  the approach to biodiversity conservation (e.g., threats-based approach, in-situ conservation, partner-driven, and global perspective); the diverse array of partners and of efforts funded; the opportunity for learning and sharing experiences; the sense of a global network; links to the broader conservation community; and an effective NGO procurement mechanism.   Areas of program weaknesses include:  communication and budget; proactive internal sharing and collaboration; analysis of lessons learned; staffing (e.g., limited field visits by USAID/GCP staff); program management (e.g., regarding review of work plans); USAID reporting requirements, which the majority of the partners feel are excessive; capacity building in the field; and financial sustainability. Partners believe they have identified threats at the appropriate scale for GCP- funded sites moderately well.  Key threats identified have included land subdivision, lack of awareness, illegal logging, unsustainable levels of hunting and fishing, weak management capacity to address difficult transboundary issues, and issues of scale. Lessons about the threat- based approach noted by partners include the following:  (1) If used rigorously, a threats-based approach helps keep field staff, communities, and other stakeholders (government, other NGOs, etc.) focused on the resource management aspects of the work.  At the same time, several partners suggested that USAID has focused too intensively on the ""threats-based approach"" to the neglect of other important aspects (e.g., conservation targets, threats, and ultimate and proximate causes).  (2) Assessment of causal linkages is useful for identifying where and how interventions can affect the threat status and where monitoring can be done.  Assessment of causal changes also helps to explain why GCP is doing what it is doing.  (3) A threats-based approach in marine/coastal areas must be undertaken holistically and may require addressing terrestrial-based threats. (4) Determining the size of large-scale activities is a significant issue.  For example, the scale of interaction and impact in the Bering Sea is highly related to threats arising from markets and policies in the European Union (EU). At the July roundtable, partners identified ""best practices"" or lessons learned under the GCP in regarding the use of innovative landscape tools, ways to improve learning and measure progress, integrate economics into conservation, scope and scale issues, and place-based (site) planning. In general, relationships between the GCP and both USAID and its missions are good.  However, partners and GCP staff recommended increased interactions between USAID/GCP staff and Missions; improved coordination of partner programs with USAID programs that complement sustainable development efforts of Missions; and increased interaction with and input by USAID Mission staffs.","Project title: Biodiversity and sustainable forestry (BIOFOR)","Special Evaluation","Documents","LAG-I-00-99-00013-00","","12/1/2002 12:00:00 AM","","Natural resource conservation|Biological diversity|Private voluntary organizations|Indigenous private voluntary organizations|Development strategies|Environmental degradation|Reporting|Development program management|Communication","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABX997.pdf","1,633 KB","001600 - Associates in Rural Development, Inc.

"USAID's support for democracy in Guatemala began in the mid-1980s when the country was still engaged in civil war.  Democracy/governance (D/G) assistance has been provided in six areas:  elections administration, rule of law, legislative strengthening, human rights, civil society, and local governance.  This assessment covers programs carried out from 1993 to 2002 in the last 5 of these areas, detailing their impacts as well as the internal and external factors affecting that impact.  An introductory section analyzes the stages and trends of Guatemala's political development over the same period. A number of lessons learned are detailed:  (1) Sustained international pressure, combined with reliable technical and financial support for Guatemalan reformers over significant periods of time, has been a necessary condition for the progress made in Guatemalan democratization to date.  (2) The consensus framework of goals for democratic development provided by the Peace Accords was very useful to Guatemalan reformers and their supporters. (3) Assistance to address post-conflict conditions had to accompany more traditional D/G programming for the latter to have a chance of succeeding.  (4) Impact was greatest when USAID gave priority attention to political factors affecting progress in specific D/G sectors.  (5) USAID had to work especially hard to identify and nurture capable and dedicated Guatemalan reformers with whom to cooperate.  The more USAID was able to partner with trusted local reformers who could take the lead in selecting and implementing program initiatives, the more impact was achieved and sustained.  (6) Very careful attention to program strategy choices by USAID and its local partners is important.  (7) The availability of significant funding over several years enabled USAID/G-CAP to achieve impacts in some D/G areas.  Without it, the likelihood of achieving impacts in other D/G sectors is reduced.  (8) Coordination of assistance with diplomatic initiatives has magnified the impact of both.    (9) Having the flexibility to modify program strategy choices in keeping with experience and changing political conditions can help improve impacts achieved.  Flexible program design and contracting arrangements implemented by the Mission have been instrumental in allowing USAID/G-CAP to take advantage of reform opportunities as they arose, and to cancel programs when they failed to make progress.  (10) Frequent, participatory program monitoring and evaluation is advisable, as are efforts to identify and stay abreast of basic political factors affecting democratization via democratic indicators monitoring system(DIMS)-type surveys and expert analyses by political scientists. Includes recommendations for future D/G assessments.","General democracy and governance analytical support and|implementation services indefinite quantity contract (IQC)|Task order no. 1","Special Evaluation","Documents","AEP-I-00-99-00041-00","","9/1/2002 12:00:00 AM","","Democratization|Governance|Development programs|Impact assessment|Time series analysis|Rule of law|Institution building|Legislature|Human rights|Civil society|Municipal level|Consensus building|Government reform|Post conflict societies|Political leadership|Partnerships|Development strategies|Financial resources|Coordinating|Development program management|Host country cooperation|Development program monitoring|Information management|Diplomacy","Guatemala","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNACS872.pdf","1,425 KB","001600 - Associates in Rural Development, Inc.

"Evaluates cooperative agreement with Alfalit International, a faith-based NGO, to implement adult literacy activities in Bolivia. Mid-term evaluation covers the period 3/02-8/03. Literacy students in Bolivia are learning to read, write, and do basic arithmetic in about 9-10 months, studying 6 hours per week. Certain factors -- particularly the fact that many students speak an indigenous language rather than Spanish -- delay the learning process somewhat.  Alfalit has successfully instilled in students the concept that literacy is not an end, but a means to increase skills, expand opportunities, and improve quality of life.  Most students want to continue studying well past the basic literacy level.  They are also very interested in receiving complementary technical/vocational training. As a result of participating in Alfalit courses, students' attitudes are changing to reflect increased self-esteem and confidence, recognition of the importance and value of education, a desire to grow and get ahead in the future, and improved gender relations.  Students' behaviors have also begun to change in the past year.  Many said they are now able  to speak without fear in public, help their children with homework, encourage friends and family to study, and actively participate in their communities.  It is noteworthy that the school attendance of literacy students' children is also improving. The start-up phase of any new project is always a navigation of expected and unexpected challenges, particularly for entities facing USAID policies and regulations for the first time.  Alfalit has successfully managed most of these hurdles and is achieving or surpassing most project objectives. Implementing a USAID project has required Alfalit Bolivia's transformation from a small, faith-based organization to a more modern NGO partner.  This evolution has entailed organizational development and capacity building with the support of Alfalit International.  The explosion of demand for Alfalit courses in the past year proves that success breeds success.  Based on interview results, there is currently an unmet demand for at least 200 additional literacy centers around Bolivia. Principal recommendations are as follows:  (1) Rather than try to fulfill all unmet demand, Alfalit should stop expansion efforts in the immediate term to consolidate the quality of service delivery in existing literacy centers.  (2) Alfalit should build on its comparative advantage and continue to focus primarily on its central mission of nonformal adult literacy/basic education   (3) While basic education was not budgeted for under the first phase of the USAID agreement, it should be included in the follow-on so that students can complete at least 8th grade. (4) Alfalit should build on its current efforts to form partnerships and strategic alliances with NGOs, municipalities, and other groups seeking complementary services (e.g., technical training, early childhood care, health care) to the greatest extent possible.  (5) Alfalit has a long history as an interdenominational faith-based organization in Bolivia.  Efforts should be made to continue working with traditional partners so that Alfalit is not totally dependent on USAID funding, thereby improving its prospects for future sustainability.  (6) The capacity of Alfalit Bolivia should be strengthened through better planning, office systems, and administrative/financial policies and procedures. (7) Emphasis should be given to training all organizational actors, starting with facilitators (teachers).  There is also need for additional promoters to ensure effective supervision.  (8) If funds are available, additional teaching resources (e.g., small blackboards, basic didactic posters) should be provided to centers, as well as additional reading materials for home libraries to promote a culture of reading and to sustain literacy.  (9) Although Alfalit should not develop an expertise in vocational education, it is important to provide some work-related information and technical training to students.  This can be done by drawing on the expertise of individuals and groups in local communities. Additional funding, preferably approved on a multi-year basis to permit better planning, would be a sound USAID investment.","[Task order no. 1]|Project title: Basic education and policy support (BEPS)","Special Evaluation","Documents","HNE-I-00-00-00038-00","","1/1/2002 12:00:00 AM","","Adult education|Literacy instruction|Arithmetic instruction|Nonformal education|Indigenous private voluntary organizations|Religious groups|Behavior change|Attitude change|Vocational training|Institution building|Human capacity development|Economic self sufficiency","Bolivia","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABZ668.pdf","556 KB","001341 - Creative Associates International, Inc.

"Final evaluation of USAID/Madagascar's Cyclone Recovery Program (CRP) (4/00-10/02) Overall, the Mission and the contracting entities -- Chemonics (as a supplemental funding to the Landscape Development Interventions [LDI] contract), Rehabilitation du Capital Routier (ReCAP), and Fianarantsoa Cote-Est Rehabilitation (FCE-R) have done an extraordinary job helping Fianarantsoa and Tamatave Provinces recover from the storms of 2000. LDI funding has been used effectively to repair farm-to-market roads, repair and rehabilitate irrigation systems, provide training and assistance with grain stores, fish ponds, and facilitate local community planning to better prepare for future cyclones.  The ReCAP contract used funds to improve farm-to-market roads, help establish and train local community associations to manage and maintain those roads, and repair Manakara's port facilities. The FCE-R contract has focused on rehabilitation and maintenance of the 163-KM Fianarantsoa to Manakara rail line. USAID/Madagascar and contract staff worked collectively to effect results that are greater than the sum of the three parts. In Fianarantsoa the rail line cuts through the forest corridor where USAID has funded activities for more than a decade; LDI is a continuation of some of those efforts.  With the railroad as the core, the rehabilitation activities of the other two contracts complement one another and focus economic activities on settled farming and away from slash and burn tavy practices that threaten the forest's rich biodiversity.  Further north in the Moramanga Region of Tamatave Province, CRP funding, utilized through LDI activities and ReCAP, focused on road construction, with emphasis on restarting production in zones of high agricultural productivity.  Once again, these activities complement and bolster one another. Because the geology of this area is even more fragile than in the other CRP areas, and where another nearby forest corridor is also being threatened by land clearing, there is a definite effort to refocus local farmers agricultural and accompanying economic activities in the irrigated perimeters around the lake.  LDI's activities are helping to do that, and ReCAP roads should facilitate access to wider Malagasy markets. The period covered by the CRP funding is short: 2 years or a little more, in the case of all three contracts.  Madagascar is a difficult place in which to work and the rural infrastructure is in a sad state of neglect and will likely stay that way for some time to come. With intense rainy seasons and regularly recurring cyclones, progress is difficult.  Further curtailing the CRP was the recent (6-month long) political crisis that slowed most activities to a standstill, making CRP achievements even more remarkable. Lessons learned are as follows:  (1) The development of cyclone preparedness plans have provided a unique and participatory process that encourages ownership and forward planning in local communities. This process certainly warrants greater dissemination.  (2) The use of subcontractors needs to be carefully examined on a contract-by-contract basis.  There may be better use of the primary contractors staff in some situations, and thus a better (more effective) use of finances.  (3) The excellent use of local labor in ""labor-intensive-public-works"" in communities that really have shown considerable initiative and concern for the FCE railway is certain to be utilized in future projects.  This, coupled with the use of appropriate technology, can keep down costs and, more importantly, show local communities that they do have some ownership of the project.  (4) The technical packages for agricultural development -- e.g., use of vetiver grass for stabilization -- are replicable in other geographic areas. (5) Experiences from the LDI contract have shown that the flexibility in budget line items enabled contract staff to address unforeseen issues, an extremely important aspect, especially in an emergency and rehabilitation situations. (6) The need to provide quarterly and financial reports on the two tranches of allocated funds seemed to be excessive and a poor use of resources.  (7) There is a need for more explicit contracts with main subcontractors, with particular care given to the warranty period and its supervision.  In the ReCAP contract this is the year-long period following completion of the roads and the subcontractors responsibility to repair damage due to normal wear and tear of the road.  (8) There could be better technical supervision of the local engineering contractor (Lalana).  Selection of a technical specialists with pertinent experience should be more carefully undertaken.  Management of the ReCAP contract could have been enhanced with road design and construction engineering experience figuring more prominently in the level of effort contracted.  (9) The level of effort for the ReCAP Project was insufficient for proper supervision and was poorly utilized in the use of short-term TA inputs.","Task order no. 819|RFQ no. 687-02-P-015|Evaluation indefinite quantity contract (Evaluation IQC)","Final Evaluation Report","Documents","AEP-I-00-00-00023-00","","10/1/2002 12:00:00 AM","","Disaster recovery|Cyclones|Disaster preparedness|Economic infrastructure|Irrigated farming|Ports|Railroads|Transportation system maintenance|Road construction|Road maintenance|Farm to market roads|Local groups|Human capacity development|Natural resource conservation|Forests|Agricultural productivity|Agricultural technology|Community self help|Contract management|Reporting|Supervision","Madagascar","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACA015.pdf","858 KB","000436 - Development Associates, Inc.","","008572 - USAID.

"Final evaluation of the USAID program in response to the 8/7/98 terrorist bombing outside the U.S. Embassy in Kenya (8/02-8/02). The USAID/Kenya bombing response program has been composed of a comprehensive array of projects, including the immediate and follow-up medical care of the many Kenyans injured, trauma counseling for survivors, payments of school fees for the children of victims, aid to those disabled by the explosion, reconstruction and replacement of the more seriously damaged buildings, assistance to businesses hurt by the bomb blast and specific measures, such as blood safety programs, emergency medical training and disaster planning, to better prepare Kenya for future disasters. Over 4 years, USAID has provided Kenya $42.3 million for these activities. USAID, especially its resident bilateral Mission, worked with a variety of U.S. and Kenyan contractors, NGOs, and other partners to implement the many, diverse components of the program. This USAID assistance probably affected some 50,000 Kenyan victims, survivors and their families in helping to rebuild their lives and to overcome the serious economic impact of this disaster. USAID overall did an excellent job in managing this program. After a slow and difficult start, mostly due to funding problems in Washington and less than satisfactory performance by a few organizations in Nairobi, USAID/Kenya worked through a complex set of project, legal, managerial, compassionate and other concerns to design and implement activities that responded well to meet the legitimate needs of the Kenyan people affected by this disaster. The staff from USAID's various offices in Kenya pulled together well as a team to implement an effective program to share with Kenyans the burdens of the effects of this terrorist attack. The overwhelming majority of Kenyans interviewed individually and in focus groups were genuinely appreciative of this U.S. government (USG) assistance. Despite some of the serious problems encountered, the evaluators applaud the efforts and successes of USAID in implementing this program and believe that Kenyans are emerging reasonably well from their suffering and are now better able today to handle future disasters based on lessons learned in this tragedy. Major recommendations and lessons learned are as follows: (1) Because this 1998 terrorist bombing and the traumatic events of September 11, 2001 have sadly introduced a new era, USAID needs to review urgently its management procedures about how best to respond to this type of disaster when it strikes again and to manage the ensuing recovery efforts. The experience in Kenya would be a very good case study to stimulate this discussion and to help update USAID and some other USG procedures. (2) At the top of the list, there must be a change in the systemic problems that impede the provision of adequate funding expeditiously to Missions. An expansion of OFDA's mandate or some other ""bridge"" funding mechanism between the immediate disaster relief and the later recovery efforts needs to be arranged faster. (3) USAID/Kenya would have benefitted from more flexible delegations of authorities and temporary staff from Washington, particularly early on, to design projects faster and avoid delays and extensions. (4) Because of the uniqueness of the bombing response program, the Mission should seriously consider establishing a qualified Bombing Response Unit (BRU) to carry out similar activities in the future without unduly hampering other Mission responsibilities. (5) In implementing programs of this type, USAID Missions should still look to partner with U.S. and local contractors and other organizations as much as possible, while careful to ensure the management capabilities of these entities and their sub-partners to carry out the specific tasks required. (6) It is important to involve and work with local government organizations to the extent of their capacities and interest in particular activities, although this seems to have been difficult in this Kenya case. (7) NGOs often rise to the occasion, having the right set of skills, motivation and funding, and are usually a valuable resource in such disasters and recovery efforts. (8) When implementing partners collaborate and share information, they are much stronger and effective both individually and as a whole. (9) USAID learned well a lesson from the Oklahoma City bombing that early and continuing mental health counseling is important in such traumatic situations. (10) In the spirit of ""public diplomacy"", USAID and the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi should continue to provide appropriate information and publicity about the many positive results of this program in order to stifle lingering local criticism based on a lack of knowledge about what has actually been accomplished by the USG. (11) Because there is some residual funding available from this program and there are still worthy needs, USAID/Kenya should extend selected activities for one more year, like the payment of school fees, follow-up medical care and medications, and improved facilities at the Nairobi morgue, to complete priority elements in this bombing response program. (12) Other activities, like the blood safety project and counseling, should be continued under the Mission's bilateral health program especially as related to HIV/AIDS prevention, and the disaster preparedness assistance should be continued under the aegis of OFDA, especially working with the Kenyan National Disaster Operations Center and providing more training in emergency health care.","Task order no. 816|Evaluation indefinite quantity contract (Evaluation IQC)","Special Evaluation","Documents","AEP-I-00-00-00023-00","","8/1/2002 12:00:00 AM","","Disaster response|Disaster recovery|Terrorism|Explosives|Emergency medical care|Psychological needs|Counseling services|Educational costs|Children|Disabilities|Building construction|Business support services|Blood|Safety|Disaster planning|Health professional education|Partnerships|Indigenous private voluntary organizations","Kenya","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACA016.pdf","1,799 KB","000436 - Development Associates, Inc.","","008565 - USAID.
