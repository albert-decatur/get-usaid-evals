"To encourage host country participation and ownership, some donors believe that General Budget Support (GBS), a type of non-project assistance, offers promise.  While most non-project assistance approaches depend on some degree of earmarking or policy conditionality, GBS relies on broad agreements and an acknowledgment that appropriate development policies are in place. Funds usually flow directly to the finance ministry. If a recipient government demonstrates its commitment to broad development goals and donors agree, GBS donors participate in a planning dialogue with central government officials and pool their aid resources to support the government's development efforts. In applying this approach, the host country finance ministry allocates donor financing and uses its own procurement and accounting systems, which some donors argue is a manifestation of country ""ownership"" that can lead to sustainable development. In Mozambique, a large group of donors has decided to move away from projects in favor of GBS, providing a good case study to examine the conditions under which this approach might be recommended.  Donors in Mozambique have a long history of coordination, beginning with their humanitarian efforts during and after the civil war. Currently, donors coordinate through a number of mechanisms, including a group comprised of all of the GBS donors plus the United States as an observer and donor sub-committees. A GBS program in Mozambique has particular appeal to some donors and has garnered their support because of the country's well-designed development and poverty reduction plan. In Mozambique there are many different donors with a variety of views about GBS. The proportion donor assistance provided using GBS ranges from 10% to 50%. Donors also  provide sector support as well as through traditional projects, TA, and support to the nonprofit and private sectors. While GBS may contribute to sustainable development, there are a number of risks inherent in its use. If government institutions and management capabilities are weak, development suffers. Mozambique has established good planning mechanisms, but still has extremely weak accounting and financial control systems.  Public expenditures management is weak, and there is considerable fiduciary risk. These weaknesses contribute to a significant risk of inappropriate spending or outright theft. The shift to GBS is relatively recent and there are some donors who prefer to wait until more experience is gained in its use. Though it is too soon to know whether improved government performance does result from GBS, this assessment examines the factors necessary for GBS to work successfully in Mozambique. Using the lessons learned from Mozambique, it is possible to identify key factors that should be examined in other countries where donors are considering GBS.  These lessons and recommendations are summarized in PN-ACU-999.

"Over the course of four decades, USAID's AFGRAD (African Graduate Fellowship [1963-1990]) and ATLAS  (Advanced Training for Leadership and Skills [1991- 2003]) programs trained, at a cost of $182 million, over 3,200 African professionals for PhD and MA degrees at U.S. universities in fields critical to their country's growth. This report uses quantitative and qualitative information to assess the development impact of the two programs. USAID's investment in long-term training  produced significant and sustained changes that furthered African development in measurable ways. Long-term degree training at U.S. institutions was critical in creating the necessary foundations for significant impact to occur.  Participants reported that changes in institutional performance were attributable to U.S. training and gave concrete examples as justification.   Running against prevailing views, participants cited critical thinking and research skills rather than improved technical and scientific knowledge more frequently as critical to achieving impact.   Changes in attitudes towards work consistently appeared as major benefits.  No difference in impact was observed between PhD and master's graduates.   Improved management was a frequently cited training benefit, even though it received minimal attention during training.  Participants from the education sector reported consistently higher impact and less difficulty applying their acquired knowledge and skills in their institutions than those from other sectors.  Participants in financial fields, or those with MBAs, recorded  lower impact than those in agriculture, health, and education.  Although women reported more difficulty applying their knowledge and skills at the workplace than men, they reported impressive anecdotal examples of impact.  No correlation could be found regarding impact and the frequency with which participants returned to their original workplace. Participants returned to their home countries after their U.S. training when conditions permitted. There is no significant evidence that long-term U.S. training under these sponsored programs contributed to brain drain of African human resources.  The ATLAS/AFGRAD participants surveyed were well-advanced in their careers,  making significant contributions to development. Several important lessons were learned or affirmed.  (1) Target institutions for capacity-building in key sectors.  A major reason for program success was a commitment to institutional change over individual improvement.  (2)  To ensure sustainable impact, USAID must invest in long-term graduate training in the United States.  Short-term training is important in transferring technical knowledge and skills, but only through long-term training can developing country professionals absorb the research skills, modified work attitudes, and improved critical thinking needed to make a measurable difference in their home countries. (3) That participants cited the  major importance of non-technical aspects of long-term training, e.g., work attitudes, critical thinking, and self-confidence, calls for more attention to these ""soft"" aspects of U.S. academic training than previously thought.  That these benefits accrued to the extent they did with little programming attention or USAID investment underscores how vital they are.  With a concerted effort from sponsors, future impact could be exponentially greater. (4) Although the assessment could not be conclusive on the role played by having a cadre of U.S.-trained staff at an institution, anecdotal evidence and some quantitative data support the notion that critical mass made a difference.  Due to costs, managers have to select participants strategically from institutions -- and should recognize that the number of participants from an institution sent to the United States is less critical to impact than their area of expertise, potential for inducing future change, leadership, and commitment.  (5) Master's and PhD participants reported nearly the same levels of institutional impact.  This raised important questions about the value obtained for USAID's investment in the two degree programs (see report for details).  (5) Assess the relative merits of in-country versus long-term U.S. training fairly.  Although the present assessment did not compare the value of different training options used by USAID, the reasons for the demise of long-term academic training cannot be ignored. The high cost of U.S. training is often mentioned first. Yet the present assessment provides ample evidence that the cost of U.S. training measured by the impact (or value) obtained could be extraordinarily low. The tendency has been for USAID to consider the cost of training against the numbers of recipients, essentially viewing training as a benefit to be distributed to the largest number of local nationals.  Instead of comparing the cost of a single academic program in the United States with the cost of training 50 junior accountants in a program in their own country to computerize financial management, program planners should estimate the value of the anticipated impact to be generated by the trained participants, once they apply their new knowledge, skills and attitudes (KSAs).   Were program planners to focus on impact rather than cost, the return on having thousands of women in villages trained year after year about HIV/AIDS or about their marriage rights because one participant acquired and applied KSAs far exceeds the return from the junior accountant program.  USAID program managers need new tools to be able to fairly and objectively evaluate whether to spend funds on in-country, U.S. short-term, or U.S. long-term academic training. (7) Maintain contact with returned participants.  Women and participants from some sectors encountered greater difficulties in introducing changes in their workplaces than did participants in other sectors.  Follow-up support should be factored into future long-term training programs.  Sustained, in-country activities for returned participants are needed.  (8) Select sectors carefully for impact-oriented long-term training.  Since critical mass can provide internal synergies and support for accelerating changes in targeted sector-based institutions, planners should consider limiting sectors for long-term training.  Another technique to increase impact and decrease the non-return possibility is to send a small number of participants from the same target institution to the same university in the United States for graduate work.  Concentrating on sectors and institutions, as ATLAS/AFGRAD effectively did throughout the years, can help focus and sustain changes.","Volumes I, II and III|An evidence-based impact assessment of the value obtained from|major investments in graduate education for 3,219 African|professionals by USAID & its partners in the ATLAS and AFGRAD|programs|Final report|Task order 13|Global evaluation and monitoring indefinite quantity contract (GEM|IQC)","Special Evaluation","Documents","FAO-I-00-99-00010-00","","9/1/2004 12:00:00 AM","","Education for development|Participants|Impact assessment|Economic sectors|Attitude change|Occupational skill levels|Educational costs|Institutional aspects|Women|Change agents|Graduate education|Participant follow ups|Selective student admissions|Masters degrees|Doctoral degrees","Africa","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNADB130.pdf","1,775 KB","012322 - Aguirre International","","011326 - USAID.

"This report examines USAID's evaluation function, based on a rapid review of previous, selected ""evaluations of evaluation"" and 30 interviews.  Recommendations are noted below. (1) Demonstration by Senior Management of its commitment to ensuring that USAID programs are accomplishing their objectives by requiring submission of quality evaluations so that the Agency can truly become a ""learning organization.""  (2) Training for officers at all levels in order to return USAID to a ""culture of evaluation."" Al1 employees should receive training on evaluation techniques and an incentive system should be developed to reward ""risk takers"" and innovation.  (3) All final evaluations should be external.  Professional integrity will be ensured through development of a peer review system to referee controversia1 conclusions and a tracking system to verify that evaluation recommendation have been implemented.  (4) All contracts and grants must include a provision requiring submission of evaluations and assessments to USAID's Development Experience Clearinghouse (DEC) by contractor/grantees/Missions/Bureaus.  No payment should be made until such requirement is fulfilled.  Employees should be charged with following current Agency guidelines, i.e., submitting all evaluations to the DEC, including those deemed ""sensitive"".  (5) ""Policy abstracts"" should be written for all evaluations, the purpose of which would be to draw policy implications of ""lessons learned"" from evaluations for USAID, as well as the rest of the foreign policy community.  (6) The Agency's Knowledge for Development (KfD) activity must be more closely integrated with the evaluation function so that USAID does not create a structure within which there is little written  historic knowledge.  KfD may have to be placed on a slower track until the ""Knowledge"" in KfD can be assured.  (7) Greater participation in the international donor evaluation arena to exchange important development information and to regain USAID's status as the ""premier development agency."" (8) Modify PPC/DEI's role in evaluation to include: (a) oversight of all Bureau/Mission evaluation activities, including maintaining an up-to-date inventory of all Bureau/Mission evaluations; (b) ensuring that all Agency evaluations and assessments are included in the DEC, including those performed with/by contractors and grantees; (c) performing more joint evaluations with other donors (OECD, DAC), attendance at important international evaluation meetings, even if through videoconferencing, as well as involvement of other USG agencies in evaluation should they be present at field Missions; (d) development and standardization of evaluation training materials and methods so that the Agency performs uniformly high quality evaluations and Bureaus do not waste scarce resources reinventing training courses and ""tool kits"" due to the lack of a central repository function: (e) consultation with all Missions (through Bureaus) to establish criteria for evaluations, i.e., when, what types, how, should be clear and such information disseminated widely; (f) identification of the nexus between the Agency's knowledge and policy formulation; (g) collaboration with all Bureaus in developing objective scopes of work (SOWs) for evaluations, participating in evaluations where warranted; (h) provision of in-house or contracted TA to Bureaus/Missions' in performance of selected evaluations on the evaluation agenda or for field evaluations, including, but not limited to: comparison of technical results or policy lessons/implications across regions, impact evaluations of no more than nine months where the potential exists for applicability beyond one region, and retrospective examination or in-depth program reviews to inform the Agency's strategic p1anning; (i) contracting for experts or performance of in-house evaluations/short analyses dealing with innovative, timely, or politically important issues; (j) coordination of an inter-bureau evaluation working group to compile and implement an annual Agency evaluation agenda, establishing peer referee groups for Mission and DEI evaluations; other tasks as required; and (k) maintenance of EvalWeb, including state-of-the- art information on evaluation techniques, updated TIPS, and links to outside evaluation sites and other professional evaluators. (9) Undertake a thorough inventory of all Bureaus' Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) functions, personnel, listservs, contractor evaluations and websites, to eliminate a wastage of scarce resources.  (10)  Staff PPC/DEI sufficiently to accomplish all of the above.","","Special Evaluation","Documents","","","9/1/2004 12:00:00 AM","","USAID|Development project evaluation|Development program evaluation|Evaluation methodology|Resource allocation|Personnel|Experts|Planning|Human capacity development|Regulations|Abstracts|Donor coordination|Information systems|Supervision|Reference materials","","http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNADB222.pdf","1,778 KB","008735 - USAID.

"This report is the result of a five-week assessment of USAID/Egypt's Small and Emerging Business Project (SEB).  The assessment comprised of two different components: an evaluation of the SEB Project itself including implementing partners, approaches, objectives and outcomes; and an assessment of the microfinance industry in Egypt. Recommendations to USAID/Egypt on future support to the microfinance sector are based on the findings of these two assessment components. The SEB project evaluation consisted of a detailed review of six implementing partners including ABA, AsBA, BdC, DBACD, EQI and CGC.  In addition, the evaluation included a review of the microfinance project objectives, approaches and outcomes of USAID/Egypt.  USAID/Egypt's support to the microfinance sector started in 1989 and it has allocated a total of $141 million1 since the beginning.  It has worked with a total of nine partner business associations and two banks.  Together, these institutions reach over 270,000 active clients as of June 30, 2004. USAID/Egypt's approach has been to create retail NGO-Business Association partners and replicate the same institutional model across the country.  The main lending methodologies used are individual lending and group lending.  Since 1993 technical assistance has been provided by NCBA/EQI.  The TA support included a package of services consisting of an MIS system, an accounting manual, the two loan products, training for loan officers as well as periodic support to staff on implementing any of these systems.  USAID/Egypt has become known as the best practices donor and some of its partners are indeed among the best in Egypt. USAID's activities over the past 15 years have enabled development of a number of market leaders who have achieved significant scale of outreach as compared to their peers in Egypt.  One of USAID's most notable achievements is the introduction of two banks to microfinance, one of which is utilizing its own funds.  USAID partner MFIs has been able to attain high portfolio quality through solid lending methodologies and mechanisms.  On the other hand, USAID's approach has also created institutions that are heavily reliant on it for vision and growth.  The technical assistance and training activities supported by USAID have not lead to independent and innovative MFIs.  Rather, USAID's partners have limited products and lack the capacity to innovate and respond to market needs.  Many of USAID's partner MFIs have limited institutional visions, lack sound governance, and are highly inefficient. Some of the strategies used in the past by USAID, which were appropriate to introduce microfinance to the market, are no longer appropriate as the industry is now at a different stage of development. While there are some strong MFPs in the market, there are considerable areas for improvement within these MFPs such as governance, capacity of management, back office systems and market orientation.  USAID should broaden its support to address the above weaknesses at the retail level as well as ensure development of suitable support structures that can help all MFPs increase market penetration.
